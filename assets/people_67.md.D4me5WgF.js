The neighborhood proper is located between the East River to the north; College Point and Whitestone Expressway to the west; Flushing and 25th Avenue to the south; and Bayside and Francis Lewis Boulevard to the east. Whitestone contains the subsection of Malba, which is bounded to the north by the East River, to the east by the Whitestone Expressway, to the south by 14th Avenue, and to the west by 138th Street. Malba was cited in a New York Times article as one of the few \\"elite enclaves\\" of Queens. Whitestone is located in Queens Community District 7 and its ZIP Code is 11357. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 109th Precinct. Politically, Whitestone is represented by the New York City Council's 19th District.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History =Whitestone= Dutch settlers derived the name of the town from limestone that used to lie on the shore of the river according to a popular tradition. This tradition is supported by 17th century wills and deeds, which may be found in The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, that refer to \\"the white stone\\" as a local landmark and survey reference point. Whitestone got its name because the settlers discovered that Whitestone was built on white limestone. The area was, in large part, the estate of Francis Lewis, a delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The estate was the site of an English raid during the Revolutionary War. Lewis was not present but his wife was taken prisoner and his house was burned to the ground. For a period of time Whitestone was called Clintonville after Dewitt Clinton, the former governor of New York; this etymology is present in the name of Clintonville Street, located in the neighborhood. In the late 19th century, many wealthy New Yorkers began building mansions in the area, on what had once been farmland or woodland. Rapid development of the area ensued in the 1920s, however, as trolley and Long Island Rail Road train service on the Whitestone Branch was expanded into the neighborhood. Although this rail service ended during the Great Depression, part of the right-of-way was later used by Robert Moses to help construct the Belt Parkway, which includes the Whitestone Expressway which runs along the southeast edge of the former Flushing Airport and through Whitestone. Flushing Airport has been abandoned since 1985. Further development came with the building of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge in 1939. The bridge measures 2,300 feet and was the fourth longest bridge in the world at the time of its construction. =Malba subsection= Malba Drive Powell's Cove The name of the subsection of Malba in northern Whitestone is derived from the first letters of the surnames of its five founders of the Malba Land Company: Maycock, Alling, Lewis, Bishop, and Avis. Malba is considered part of Whitestone, one of the more affluent communities in Queens. Demographically, the population is mostly white and of European descent (Greek, Italian, Irish and Jewish), with a small minority of Asian Americans. Most of the residential properties in Malba are large homes. The first known resident of the area known as present-day Malba was David Roe, who arrived from England in the 1640s. According to Clarence Almon Torrey's book, David Roe Of Flushing And Some Of His Descendants, Roe became a resident of Flushing circa 1666. In 1683, Roe was taxed upon owning and thereafter increased his holdings substantially, ultimately acquiring the upland around what was to become Malba. Roe's farm was on the east side of the bay, which was then known as \\"Roe's Cove\\". He was among the most well-to-do citizens of Flushing, owning lands, farm stock, carpenter's tools and two slaves. In 1786, John Powell purchased Roe's parcel for 1,685 pounds, 6 shillings, and 8 pence. It has been reported that Roe lost his lands for his allegiance to the crown during the American War of Independence. Powell thereafter built a home and the cove was renamed \\"Powell's Cove\\", the name it bears today. During the 19th century, some of Powell's land passed into the hands of Harry Genet, a member of the Tammany Hall, New York City's infamous political machine. Powell's house was destroyed by fire in the 1890s. During the second half of the 19th century, the Roe/Powell land passed to a succession of owners. A map dating from 1873 lists the Smiths, Biningers and Nostrands as landowners in the area. The Nostrand and Smith farms represented a large portion of what is Malba today. The area around Hill Court and 14th Avenue was known as \\"Whitestone Heights\\". In 1883 railroad service to Manhattan was extended on the \\"Whitestone and Westchester Railroad\\", later the Long Island Rail Road. The terminus of the Whitestone line was at \\"Whitestone Landing\\" (154th Street), a popular summer resort area during the late-19th century and early-20th century. William Ziegler, a self-made industrialist and president of the Royal Baking Powder Company bought all these parcels in or about 1883 and his holdings became known as the \\"Ziegler Tract\\". Ziegler died on May 24, 1905, leaving his wife, Electa Matilda Ziegler (a philanthropist for the blind, among other things) and son, William, Jr., then 14 years of age. William S. Champ (Ziegler's former secretary) and W.C. Demarest (Mrs. Ziegler's nephew) (both to become among the first families residing in Malba) formed a Realty Trust to purchase the Ziegler tract from his estate for development purposes. Champ was vice president of the Realty Trust, and also one of the executors of Ziegler's estate. The Ziegler Tract had been appraised for $100,000 shortly after Ziegler's death. In the spring of 1906, the Realty Trust secured over 100 investors from New Haven, Guilford, Bridgeport, and other Connecticut towns, to the planned purchase of the Ziegler Tract. Based on a review of early maps of the area, the developers, at one point, planned a very densely populated community; with homes on lots no bigger than wide. Obviously, this plan was modified and much larger properties were developed. The trust represented to the investors that the property could be purchased from the Ziegler estate for $640,000. In fact, the which ultimately became Malba, had been earlier purchased from the Ziegler estate for $350,000. Thereafter such Connecticut residents as Samuel R. Avis, Noble P. Bishop, George W. Lewis, David R. Alling and George Maycock were elected trustees (altogether these were the five names that combined to form the MALBA name) of the Malba Land Company. The true, lesser, amount paid to Ziegler's estate was not uncovered until 1912. (For a complete discussion of the Realty Trust's acquisition of the land and its subsequent defense of a lawsuit from the Malba Land Company, see Crowe v. Malba Land Co., 135 N.Y.S. 454, 76 Misc. 676 (Sup. Ct. Queens Co. 1912)). Development slowly began in 1908. A railroad station on the Whitestone line was added where 11th Avenue sits today. The Champs and Demarests were among Malba's first families to own homes in Malba. There were thirteen houses by the time of World War I and more than a hundred were built in the 1920s. The railroad station closed in 1932. The triangle by Malba Drive and 11th Avenue was dedicated as \\"Jane Champ Park\\" on November 16, 1969 and was renovated by the Malba Field and Marine Club in 2005.

It is the highest in France and the fourth highest in Europe. The extensive views of Mont Blanc and adjacent mountains of the Mont Blanc massif provided by the tramway make it popular with tourists. Also, mountaineers and hikers use the tramway because its stops provide the jumping off points for many trails, as well as giving access to the Refuge Nid d'Aigle close to the terminus of railway. The normal alpine mountaineering route to climb Mont Blanc starts at the tramway's terminus, Nid d'Aigle, and proceeds either to an overnight stop at the Tête Rousse Hut, or at the higher .SummitPost Tête Rousse Hut. Retrieved 17 August 2009. Location The line runs from a connection with the SNCF at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains Le Fayet station to the Nid d'Aigle station at the Bionnassay glacier at an altitude of . The initial intention was for the line to reach the Aiguille du Goûter. Technology The line is long and has a rail gauge of . It is a rack and adhesion railway, using the Strub design to overcome a height difference of . The line has an average gradient of 15% and a maximum gradient of 24%. Some 85% of the line is equipped with rack rail, with adhesion being used at the foot of the line and at intermediate crossing stations. The line is electrified using an overhead line at 11 kV and 50 Hz AC. Operations The line is operated by the which also manages the Montenvers Railway and many ski lifts in the Mont Blanc region. The first section of the line, to the Col de Voza, was opened in 1907. The line reached its current terminus in August 1914 when work was suspended, because of World War I, and never resumed. The line was worked by steam locomotives until it was electrified in 1956. The line is worked by three motor coaches which are named Anne, Marie and Jeanne. These were the names of the three daughters of the line's owner at the time of electrification. The journey time is 1 hour from Fayet to Bellvue with four or five trips operating per day. The Mont Blanc Tramway is featured in the film Malabar Princess. In late July 2010 the last section of the Tramway and the nearby Nid d'Aigle mountain refuge was closed for safety reasons for the rest of the operational season. This was due to concerns of a repeat of a potentially catastrophic flood from release of a vast quantity of water that had built up within an intraglacial pocket within the Tête Rousse glacier lying directly above it.

Born in 1890 in Liverpool, Sullivan is believed to have organized a group named the Order of Twelve from 1911-1914 and again from 1920. In about 1924 it became known as the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship (Crotona was the site of Pythagoras’s school in southern Italy). As a journalist, playwright and actor George Alexander Sullivan used the name Alex Mathews; in the context of his mystical activities he used the name Frater Aureolis. From 1925-1928 he put out a periodical, The Rosicrucian Gazette. The ROCF operated first from Liverpool area of England and then from the mid-1930s onwards from the Christchurch area. The group’s headquarters was a wooden building called the Ashrama Hall, completed in 1936 on the grounds of Catherine Chalk’s house on Somerford Road near Christchurch, England. Peter Caddy became one of Sullivan’s disciples in 1936, introduced by his then brother-in-law Cyril “Jim” Barnes. In the light of future developments at the Findhorn Foundation, it's interesting to note that Sullivan's disciples began to buy bungalows close by his Ashrama Hall. With Mabel Besant-Scott, George Alexander Sullivan organized a rosicrucian theatre company. In 1938, also on Catherine Chalk's land, they built Christchurch Garden Theatre, which called itself “The First Rosicrucian Theater in England.” It presented Sullivan's mystically-themed plays during June–September 1938. Gerald Gardner (1884-1964), the reviver of British witchcraft (“Wicca”), claimed to have been initiated into traditional witchcraft through contacts he made at the rosicrucian theatre, though there is some debate about this. Gerald Gardner’s biography by Jack Bracelin (although said by Frederic Lamond to have been written by Idries Shah) mentions the group. Although the group named itself after the Rosicrucian tradition, and although its rituals had a Masonic flavour to them, the teachings of George Alexander Sullivan -- at least as given by Peter Caddy -- resemble most of all the teachings of the New Thought movement. George Alexander Sullivan died in 1942.

Philosophy Plato mentions in his Laws that 5040 is a convenient number to use for dividing many things (including both the citizens and the land of a city-state or polis) into lesser parts, making it an ideal number for the number of citizens (heads of families) making up a polis. He remarks that this number can be divided by all the (natural) numbers from 1 to 12 with the single exception of 11 (however, it is not the smallest number to have this property; 2520 is). He rectifies this \\"defect\\" by suggesting that two families could be subtracted from the citizen body to produce the number 5038, which is divisible by 11. Plato also took notice of the fact that 5040 can be divided by 12 twice over. Indeed, Plato's repeated insistence on the use of 5040 for various state purposes is so evident that Benjamin Jowett, in the introduction to his translation of Laws, wrote, \\"Plato, writing under Pythagorean influences, seems really to have supposed that the well-being of the city depended almost as much on the number 5040 as on justice and moderation.\\"Laws, by Plato, translated By Benjamin Jowett, at Project Gutenberg; retrieved 7 July 2009. Jean-Pierre Kahane has suggested that Plato's use of the number 5040 marks the first appearance of the concept of a highly composite number, a number with more divisors than any smaller number.. Number theoretical If \\\\sigma(n) is the divisor function and \\\\gamma is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, then 5040 is the largest of the known numbers for which this inequality holds: :\\\\sigma(n) \\\\geq e^\\\\gamma n\\\\log \\\\log n . This is somewhat unusual, since in the limit we have: :\\\\limsup_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{n\\\\ \\\\log \\\\log n}=e^\\\\gamma. Guy Robin showed in 1984 that the inequality fails for all larger numbers if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true. Interesting notes * 5040 has exactly 60 divisors, counting itself and 1. * 5040 is the largest factorial (7! = 5040) that is also a highly composite number.

The line-up included chief songwriter David Line (vocals, guitar), Caroline Banks (drums and backing vocals) and Kevin Penney (guitars) who joined the band following the departure of founder-member Charles MacLeod. Bassist and founder member Kevin Hendrick left the group to join Pre/Male Bonding following the recording of their fourth album Paper Crown King in 2006, and was not permanently replaced. Cahir O'Doherty, from Fighting with Wire and Jetplane Landing, played bass on numerous tours. Band History =Early Years= Seafood were formed on 31 August 1996 by David and Charles, who advertised for a female bassist and male drummer in classified magazine Loot. The line-up turned out differently - a female drummer and male bassist - but, happily, this worked out and Seafood played their first gig at Camden’s Dublin Castle in March, 1997. Seafood were signed to Fierce Panda Records after their fourth gig in London's Highbury Garage. The band claim that they could have been signed at their third gig, had the representative of Fierce Panda not been too drunk from a Kerrang magazine party to turn up in time to see their set. Seafood came to the attention of the music press with the release of \\"Scorch Comfort\\" on Fierce Panda, a noisy but melodic track that was oddly compared to both Sonic Youth and Bis. This was followed by the release of \\"Psychic Rainy Nights\\" on Kooky records, and \\"Porchlight\\" on Fierce Panda. All of these singles were eventually compiled with their b-sides on the Messenger in the Camp mini- album. At this time, Seafood embarked on two national tours, one supporting Kenickie, and the other as part of the \\"Panda in a Vanda\\" record label tour with Billy Mahonie and Tiny Too. They also played support slots for Laptop, Grandaddy and Dawn of the Replicants, amongst others. Seafood played as a three-piece at the Reading festival after Charles lacerated his hands in an accident, ending with a 10-minute noise version of Walking in the Air as made popular by choir-boy Aled Jones. 1998 ended with the release of Messenger in the Camp, and a gig at London's LSE. In 1999, Seafood headed off on tour again, with Idlewild and Llama Farmers, and returned to play a full set at the Reading festival. They also made their American debut at the CMJ band marathon. =Surviving The Quiet and When Do We Start Fighting= This was also the year they recorded their debut album, Surviving the Quiet. Produced by Ian McCutcheon the album was released by Fierce Panda Records worldwide. The LP included flutes, cello, acoustic and electric guitar and a 10-minute noise breakdown on the last track. Four singles were released from Surviving the Quiet: \\"Easy Path\\" and \\"This Is Not An Exit\\" (both released before the album) and \\"Belt\\" and \\"Led by Bison\\" (both released after the album). After the release of the LP, Seafood toured extensively during 2000, firstly with Wilt and Turn, then with Gerling. They also did a short tour of the US, playing with Jimmy Eat World and Hot Rod Circuit. In 2001, Seafood continued touring as well as beginning the recording of their follow-up to Surviving the Quiet. The second LP, When Do We Start Fighting... was recorded and produced in New York by Girls Against Boys member Eli Janney. It featured guest appearances by Mary Lorson of Madder Rose and Scott McCloud of Girls Against Boys. The album release in July 2001 (on Infectious Records) was preceded by the release of Cloaking as a single. The release of further singles \\"Splinter\\" and \\"Western Battle\\" followed in December 2001 and March 2002. 2001 saw Seafood headline a tour with Easyworld, support Sportfreunde Stiller in Germany and My Vitriol and Ash on their UK tours. In 2002 the band toured with Dashboard Confessional in the US, played a long UK tour with Jetplane Landing, supported Jimmy Eat World on their UK tour and played their own headline UK tour with Crackout as support. After this tour, Seafood spent time working on building a studio, Neat Science Laboratories, in preparation for recording their next album, eventually released in the summer of 2004. During this time, Seafood played only a handful of gigs due to problems with singer David Line's health following the collapse of one of his lungs. =As The Cry Flows, Paper Crown King and split= As the Cry Flows was recorded with Surviving The Quiet producer Ian McCutcheon at the end of 2003 and released by Cooking Vinyl records in May 2004. An attempt at touring the record around the time of its release was cut short when David Line's lung problem flared up again. However, they were able to finally tour the UK in late 2004, and Europe in early 2005. After the conclusion of their European tour, the band retreated to write songs for their next release. On 17 September 2005, the band played their first live show for almost six months, at the 2nd annual Smalltown America Records Charity All-Dayer at London's 93 Feet East venue, where they played a set that consisted almost entirely of new material. The band embarked on their first national tour of the UK for several years in July 2006 and released the single \\"Signal Sparks\\" on the 31st of that month. The band's fourth album, Paper Crown King, followed in September of the same year. In early May 2007 Seafood announced, via their website, that they would be releasing covers of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" and Townes Van Zandt's \\"I'll be Here in the Morning\\" as a double A-side download-only single on 11 June to accompany their May/June UK tour. In mid-2009 it was announced via the band's website that the band no longer exists, but each member of the band continues to work in various side projects.

Nelson Gonçalves had a very productive collaboration with lyricist Adelino Moreira and recorded numerous successful albums. One of the great crooners of the day, he gained an international following and appeared at venues such as Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Nelson sold more than 62 million albums around the globe and is the second best-selling Brazilian artist of all time, behind Roberto Carlos (77 million). His personal life was sometimes filled with turmoil and at one time, a cocaine addiction almost destroyed his career. Having an outstanding singing voice, he was known to have a stutter in his regular speech. Nelson Gonçalves died of a heart attack at the age of 79.

It is a scaled-down version of Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 or 2000 which is free for non-commercial use as well as certain limited commercial use. It was introduced at Microsoft TechEd in May 1999, and was included as part of Microsoft Office 2000 Developer Edition. Its successor, SQL Server Express was released in November 2005. Vendor support of MSDE ended on April 8, 2008. MSDE Upgrade.  Overview  MSDE was initially designed by (then) Microsoft Program Manager Jeff Alger and later implemented by Peter Byrne (core), Ronald Martinsen (core/setup), and Mike Maringas (setup). Alger and Martinsen are the co-inventors who hold the patent. The initial release of MSDE is called the \\"Microsoft Desktop Engine\\", which is based on SQL Server 7.0 and was positioned as an alternative to using Microsoft Access's Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a focus on its ability to operate as a client–server application instead of requiring direct access to the file system which the Jet database resided on. Microsoft Access, the company's most popular database tool at the time, was expanded for its Office 2000 release to incorporate using Microsoft Desktop Engine as its back-end data store. This design was promoted by Microsoft as a solution for small workgroups that may eventually grow to require the full SQL Server product. This initial release of MSDE also included the Data Transformation Services Wizard, which provided the ability to use OLE DB and ODBC data sources to transfer data between SQL Server 7.0 and MSDE. Supported operating systems at the time of its release included Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, and was available for both x86 and Alpha architectures. Compared with the full server editions of SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, MSDE has some restrictions: a limit of 2 GB databases, and has a workload governor which reduces its speed when eight or more concurrent workloads are running.The SQL Server 2000 Workload Governor Microsoft has also stated that MSDE is not supported in Windows NT 6.0 operating systems such as Windows Vista.

This is the standard configuration expected by the Internet standards supporting many DNS- reliant protocols. David Barr published an opinion in RFC 1912 (Informational) recommending it as best practice for DNS administrators, but there are no formal requirements for it codified within the DNS standard itself. A FCrDNS verification can create a weak form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While weak, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually by-pass this verification when they use zombie computers for email spoofing. That is, the reverse DNS might verify, but it will usually be part of another domain than the claimed domain name. Using an ISP's mail server as a relay may solve the reverse DNS problem, because the requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or sending domain of messages it relays. Other methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email are the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the MX record. ISPs that will not or cannot configure reverse DNS will generate problems for hosts on their networks, by virtue of being unable to support applications or protocols that require reverse DNS agree with the corresponding A (or AAAA) record. ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS ultimately will be limiting the ability of their client base to use Internet services they provide effectively and securely. Applications * Most e-mail mail transfer agents (server software) use a FCrDNS verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \\"Received:\\" trace header field. * Some e-mail mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail is usually not rejected by default. * The Sender Policy Framework email anti-forgery system uses a FCrDNS check in its \\"ptr:\\" mechanism. However, the use of this \\"ptr:\\" mechanism is discouraged since the first standardization of SPF in 2006 (in RFC 4408). * Some e-mail spam filters use FCrDNS checks as an authentication method for domain names or for whitelisting purposes, according to RFC 8601, for example. * SpamCop uses the FCrDNS check, which sometimes causes problems for SpamCop users who are also customers of Internet service providers who do not provide properly matching DNS and rDNS records for mail servers. * Some FTP, Telnet and TCP Wrapper servers perform FCrDNS checks. * Some IRC Servers perform FCrDNS checks to prevent abuse.

She was the daughter of the famous Theosophist, Secularist, and Co-Freemason Annie Besant and her husband Rev. Frank Besant. She had an older brother named Arthur Besant. When her father and mother separated, she was to be under the custody of her mother, but in 1878 her father went to the High Court and won the case for custody. It was not until she was 21 that she returned to her mother. In 1892 Mabel married a journalist named Ernest Scott at Marylebone, London. They emigrated to Australia where she had a daughter, Muriel, and became a Roman Catholic. She returned to England with Muriel in 1909 but Scott did not sue for divorce until 1915. For some time she assisted her mother in both British Co-Masonry and the Theosophical Society Adyar. After her mother's death, Mabel Besant-Scott briefly became the head of the British Federation of Co-Freemasonry and held the highest thirty third degree in Scottish Rite Freemasonry. In 1933 she visited India where her mother died, and met the Avatar Meher Baba, where they discussed her mother resurrecting as a man in India. She wrote several articles for The Aydar Bulletin, a periodical of the Theosophical Society based in Adyar, India. A year later she abruptly resigned from Co-Freemasonry, joining the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship shortly afterwards and taking with her some of her followers from Co-Masonry. She was one of the most active members of this Rosicrucian theatre near Christchurch, which was led by George Alexander Sullivan.

In this animation, the flow on the two sides of the cylinder are shown in different colors, to show that the vortices from the two sides alternate. Courtesy, Cesareo de La Rosa Siqueira. Heard Island (bottom left) in the southern Indian Ocean resulted in this Kármán vortex street in the clouds In fluid dynamics, vortex shedding is an oscillating flow that takes place when a fluid such as air or water flows past a bluff (as opposed to streamlined) body at certain velocities, depending on the size and shape of the body. In this flow, vortices are created at the back of the body and detach periodically from either side of the body forming a Von Kármán vortex street. The fluid flow past the object creates alternating low- pressure vortices on the downstream side of the object. The object will tend to move toward the low-pressure zone. If the bluff structure is not mounted rigidly and the frequency of vortex shedding matches the resonance frequency of the structure, then the structure can begin to resonate, vibrating with harmonic oscillations driven by the energy of the flow. This vibration is the cause for overhead power line wires humming in the wind,The Mechanical Universe: Mechanics and Heat, Advanced Edition, p. 326 and for the fluttering of automobile whip radio antennas at some speeds. Tall chimneys constructed of thin-walled steel tubes can be sufficiently flexible that, in air flow with a speed in the critical range, vortex shedding can drive the chimney into violent oscillations that can damage or destroy the chimney. Vortex shedding was one of the causes proposed for the failure of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge (Galloping Gertie) in 1940, but was rejected because the frequency of the vortex shedding did not match that of the bridge. The bridge actually failed by aeroelastic flutter.K. Billah and R. Scanlan (1991), Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks, American Journal of Physics, 59(2), 118--124 (PDF) A thrill ride, \\"VertiGo\\" at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio suffered vortex shedding during the winter of 2001, causing one of the three towers to collapse. The ride was closed for the winter at the time. In northeastern Iran, the Hashemi-Nejad natural gas refinery's flare stacks suffered vortex shedding seven times from 1975 to 2003. Some simulation and analyses were done, which revealed that the main cause was the interaction of the pilot flame and flare stack. The problem was solved by removing the pilot.  Governing equation  The frequency at which vortex shedding takes place for an infinite cylinder is related to the Strouhal number by the following equation: :\\\\mathrm{St} = \\\\frac{f D}{V} Where \\\\mathrm{St} is the dimensionless Strouhal number, f is the vortex shedding frequency, D is the diameter of the cylinder, and V is the flow velocity. The Strouhal number depends on the Reynolds number \\\\mathrm{Re},http://hmf.enseeiht.fr/travaux/CD0102/travaux/optmfn/gpfmho/01-02/grp6/pages/strouhal.htm but a value of 0.22 is commonly used. Over four orders of magnitude in Reynolds number, from 100 to 100000, the Strouhal number varies only between 0.18 and 0.22.  Mitigation of vortex shedding effects  A helical strake on a chimney stack Fairings can be fitted to a structure to streamline the flow past the structure, such as on an aircraft wing. Tall metal smokestacks or other tubular structures such as antenna masts or tethered cables can be fitted with an external corkscrew fin (a strake) to deliberately introduce turbulence, so the load is less variable and resonant load frequencies have negligible amplitudes. The effectiveness of helical strakes for reducing vortex induced vibration was discovered in 1957 by Christopher Scruton and D. E. J. Walshe at the National Physics Laboratory in Great Britain.Scruton, C.; Walshe, D.E.J. (October 1957) \\"A means for avoiding wind-excited oscillations of structures with circular or nearly circular cross section\\" National Physics Laboratory (Great Britain), Aerodynamics Report 335. (unpublished) They are therefore often described as Scruton strakes. For maximum effectiveness in suppression of vortices caused by air flow, each fin or strake should have a height of about 10 percent of the cylinder diameter. The length of each fin should be approximately 5 times the cylinder diameter. A tuned mass damper can be used to mitigate vortex shedding in stacks and chimneys. A Stockbridge damper is used to mitigate aeolian vibrations caused by vortex shedding on overhead power lines.

Biography Born in Ohio, McDougal was appointed as a midshipman on April 1, 1828. During the next three decades, he served in the Mediterranean, West Indian, and Home Squadrons as well as on the Great Lakes in Michigan. While serving in the USS Mississippi from 1846 to 1848, during the Mexican–American War, McDougal participated in Commodore Matthew C. Perry's Mosquito Fleet Campaign and the blockade and siege of Veracruz. He later commanded the sloop-of-war from 1854 to 1856, the steam tug in 1856, and the screw sloop from 1861 to 1864, in which he cruised in the Pacific protecting American merchant ships from pirates and Confederate raiders. The Wyoming first patrolled off Lower California, then headed south to operate in South American waters, before heading to the Far East. Because of an earlier attack on the American merchant steamer Pembroke, Wyoming boldly entered the Straits of Shimonoseki, and on July 16, 1863, in the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits engaged shore batteries and three ships of Prince Mori, clan chieftain of the Chōshū. During an hour's brisk action, McDougal sank two ships and heavily damaged another, then pounded enemy shore guns. After searching for Confederate raiders elsewhere in the Far East, Commander McDougal finally sailed Wyoming to an overdue overhaul in the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1864; having completed a circumnavigation of the globe. Despite needing extensive repairs McDougall and Wyoming were ordered back to sea to search for the CSS Florida before being forced to return for repairs. On December 23, 1869, McDougal assumed command of the South Pacific Squadron. Commander McDougal was promoted to captain, on the active list, on March 2, 1864. He was placed on the retired list on September 27, 1871, and appointed rear admiral on August 24, 1873. He died at San Francisco, California, and is buried at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, California. Namesakes Two ships have been named for him.

A logbook (a ship's logs or simply log) is a record of important events in the management, operation, and navigation of a ship. It is essential to traditional navigation, and must be filled in at least daily. The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water. Today's ship's log has grown to contain many other types of information, and is a record of operational data relating to a ship or submarine, such as weather conditions, times of routine events and significant incidents, crew complement or what ports were docked at and when. The term logbook has spread to a wide variety of other usages. Today, a virtual or electronic logbook is typically used for record-keeping for complex machines such as nuclear plants or particle accelerators. In military terms, a logbook is a series of official and legally binding documents. Each document (usually arranged by date) is marked with the time of an event or action of significance. Shipping Most national shipping authorities and admiralties specify that logbooks are kept to provide a record of events, and to help crews navigate should radio, radar or the GPS fail. Examination of the detail in a ship's log is often an important part of the investigative process for official maritime inquiries, in much the same way as a \\"black box\\" is used on airplanes. Logbook entries are sometimes of great importance in legal cases involving maritime commercial disputes. Commercial ships and naval vessels often keep a \\"rough log\\", – or \\"scrap log\\" – a preliminary draft of the ship's course, speed, location, and other data, which is then transcribed as the \\"smooth log\\", – or \\"official log\\" – the final version of the ship's record. Changes may be made to the rough log but the smooth log is considered permanent and no erasures are permitted. Alterations or corrections in an official logbook must be initialled by the authorised keeper of the logbook and the original data entries which have been cancelled or corrected must remain legible. Other logbooks The V5C motor vehicle registration document in the United Kingdom is often referred to as the \\"logbook\\". In the fishing industry, a logbook is used to record catch data as part of the fisheries regulations. It is then submitted to the fishing authorities of the vessel's flag state. For amateur radio, the logbook is where the hams register their contacts and other radio operations. There are several programs to help radio operators in the management of their logbook. Aircraft pilots must maintain a pilot logbook to record their time spent flying and in a simulator. In New Zealand, a logbook is used to register driver and operator work time for commercial heavy vehicles. Two different logbooks for scuba divers. In scuba diving, the logbook documents the experience of a diver by logging a diver's dives. In skydiving, a logbook serves as a parachutist's personal history in the sport and also serves as an identifying document. It also provides drop zones proof to back one's skydiving licenses, ratings and currency. A logbook recording a project which is compiled while it is being done may be called a project diary.  Use in fiction  * The Hornblower series mentions logs to explain plot development, or to make the story more realistic. * In Star Trek, the captain's log, a form of ship's log, is used to fill in the audience as to the events in progress, and acts as a diegetic form of soliloquy. This is part of a larger log system that includes personal logs (a sort of journal) and other officers' official logs, for stories that could not believably be reflected in the official Captain's log.

The character was initially depicted as an enemy of Daredevil, but has also come into conflict with Spider-Man and Deadpool. The character was portrayed in the film Elektra by Natassia Malthe. Alice Eve portrayed a grounded version of the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Iron Fist in the second season. Publication history Typhoid Mary first appeared in Daredevil #254 (May 1988), and was created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr. Her name comes from early 20th-century Irish-American cook and typhoid fever carrier \\"Typhoid Mary\\" Mallon. The character first appeared as Mutant Zero in Avengers: The Initiative #4 (September 2007) as a member of Henry Peter Gyrich's black ops team but she was eventually revealed to be this character. Prior to this, writer Dan Slott stated that the \\"mysterious character\\" was secretly a well-known character in disguise. Fictional character biography Typhoid Mary is an enemy and former lover of Daredevil with low level psionic powers, including telekinesis. She has been a professional criminal employed by organized crime syndicates as an assassin in the past. She is also gravely mentally ill. Her condition was accidentally caused when Matt Murdock had tracked a villain down to the brothel where Mary worked. Matt attacked the man, but surprisingly, the women working at the brothel surrounded and attacked Matt. Panicking, Matt lashed out, knocking Mary out of the window. It was at this moment that she somehow became \\"Typhoid Mary\\" and vowed no man would ever hurt her again.Deadpool/Daredevil Annual 1997 In later appearances, however, she would imply that she was a victim of child abuse. Typhoid Feb. 1996 Suffering from dissociative identity disorder, Mary Walker has three other abnormal personalities in addition to her seemingly healthy one. Her \\"Mary\\" personality is a timid, quiet, pacifist; her \\"Typhoid\\" personality is adventurous, lustful, and violent; and her \\"Bloody Mary\\" persona is brutal, sadistic, and misandrous. Mary once claimed that there was a fourth personality who is 'lost' but has not since been mentioned. Aside from highly developed martial arts skills, she also possesses telekinetic powers and, more dangerously, pyrokinesis, the ability to set people or objects in her immediate vicinity aflame. In her first appearance, she met Murdock, and was hired as an assassin by the Kingpin.Daredevil #254 She then first battled Daredevil, while beginning a romance with Murdock.Daredevil #255 She temporarily reverted to her \\"Mary\\" personality,Daredevil #256 but then reverted to her \\"Typhoid\\" personality, and began a romance with the Kingpin.Daredevil #257 She hired Bullet, Bushwacker, Ammo, and the Wild Boys to attack Daredevil,Daredevil #259 and then personally led these criminals against the blind vigilante.Daredevil #260 A favorite pawn of the Kingpin, Typhoid frequently battled and had a love-hate relationship with Daredevil before disappearing. Through hypnosis, the abnormal and psychotic personalities were suppressed from Walker's consciousness, and she began to lead a normal life, becoming an actress on a soap opera. She was sent by Doctor Doom to learn the secrets of Kymellian technology from Power Pack during the Acts of Vengeance.Power Pack #53 She was subsequently in the Kingpin's employ once again, and met Bullseye.Captain America #373 She helped thwart an attempt on the Kingpin's life by Crossbones.Captain America #376 At one point, as she struggled to keep her multiple personalities under control, she befriended Mary Jane Watson and battled Spider-Man when Bloody Mary resurfaced and she began killing men who committed domestic abuse. With the web-slinger's help, Mary regained control and voluntarily turned herself in to the police for treatment.The Spectacular Spider-Man #214 At one point, Mary was confined to a mental institution where each personality hired a mercenary. Mary hired Deadpool to kill her, Typhoid hired Deadpool to break her out, and Bloody Mary hired The Vamp/Animus to break her out to resume a killing spree. Deadpool defeated the Vamp/Animus but refused to kill Mary, allowing the Typhoid personality to become dominant.Deadpool Vol. 1 #6-7 Typhoid and Deadpool had a few adventures together, including traveling to New York City to confront Daredevil for accidentally kicking her out of the brothel some years ago (as she regained the memories of this incident when Deadpool pushed her out of a window), before Deadpool attempted to reform Typhoid. This did not go well and the two eventually separated after she raped Deadpool while disguised as Siryn.Deadpool #13 Following a series of events involving the Kingpin (fall from power, subsequent near-death coma, recovery, rising back to power, and taking out enemies to retake the criminal empire),Daredevil vol. 2 #46 the Kingpin distracts Daredevil by paying a visit to Walker at her show and, with a blunt slap, released the abnormal personalities. Murdock's bodyguards Luke Cage and Jessica Jones managed to take her down after she confronted Daredevil's secret identity and set the man on fire. Mary was imprisoned on a maximum security prison for super-powered criminals.New Avengers vol. 1 #01 Electro later led an attack on the Raft, breaking out the prisoners. While the Avengers arrived and managed to stop some of the prisoners, Mary managed to escape and was briefly mentioned as once more working for the Kingpin.Civil War: War Crimes Mutant Zero. Art by Stefano Caselli. At some point after the superhuman Civil War's events, she is found and recruited into Henry Peter Gyrich's Initiative program as \\"Mutant Zero\\", although her true identity was kept secret from her teammates. It's unknown whether she suffered some sort of psychotic episode which left her too unstable to be left to her own devices or whether she sought out treatment and joined of her own free will. Gyrich reveals that Mutant Zero is a mutant that not only remained empowered following M-Day, but one that is not included in the official record of the remaining mutants. Technically not existing in any official capacity, her true identity is made classified and she is given the Mutant Zero codename. According to Dr. Leonard Samson, Mutant Zero is still mentally unstable and that referencing any of her other identities could lead to a period of instability.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Typhoid Mary is a mutant and possesses a number of limited psionic powers. She can use telekinesis to levitate small objects over short distances (such as weapons of under 10 pounds; knives, razors, etc., which her \\"Bloody Mary\\" persona often gathered and assembled into improvised battle-armor). She is a powerful pyrokinetic, meaning she can cause spontaneous combustion within line of sight to set objects in her immediate vicinity aflame. She can implant mental suggestions in the minds of others. She can use her psionic hypnosis ability to induce sleep in weak-minded individuals and most animals; certain individuals are mentally resistant to her hypnotic powers. However, she has three separate personalities as a result of her mental illness. The timid, pacifist \\"Mary\\" personality has no psionic abilities. The \\"Typhoid\\" personality has the full range of these psionic powers which are strongest in the \\"Bloody Mary\\" personality. Her original \\"Mary Walker\\" personality is supposed to be a balanced amalgam of all of these, but is seldom dominant. Because of the different heart rates and voice patterns of her different personas, not to mention the different ways of dress, even Daredevil's super-senses were long unable to tell the different personas all belonged to the same woman, and she took advantage of this situation to hide from Daredevil/Matt Murdock even within earshot. As Mutant Zero, Mary appears to possess the same psionic powers utilized by both Typhoid and Bloody Mary. It is unknown whether the powers Mutant Zero possesses are equal to or stronger than those of Bloody Mary. Recent battles suggest they are more powerful, but take their toll on Mary when used as a result of this strength. Mutant Zero is also equipped with a suit of full body armor that appears to enhance her physical strength and an arsenal of weapons, including guns and various blades. Typhoid Mary is in excellent physical condition. She has sufficient reflexes to block and redirect a bullet back at its shooter. She has peak human agility, and is highly athletic. She is also trained in the martial arts, particularly Judo and Kendo. She has exceptional skill in wielding and throwing bladed weapons, and is usually armed with a variety of machetes and smaller knives.

Albert Suerbeer (ca. 1200 - 1273) was the first Archbishop of Riga in Livonia. Suerbeer was an aggressive supporter of papal power and tried to take over the whole eastern Baltic area for the Holy See. His efforts failed, however, and he was forced to submit to the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights. Suerbeer was born in Cologne. He studied in Paris, received a degree of magister, and became the canon in Bremen. After the death of Albert of Riga in 1229, he was appointed Bishop of Riga by Archbishop of Bremen Gerhard of Oldenburg. The canons of Riga did not recognize his appointment and elected their own candidate Nicholas, who was confirmed by Pope Gregory IX in 1231. In 1240, Suerbeer became Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, where he was known as Alberic the German. After taking part in the First Council of Lyon in 1245, he left Ireland, as Pope Innocent IV needed him in Germany in his struggle against Emperor Frederick II. Upon returning to German, however, the Pope appointed him Archbishop of Prussia, Livonia, and Estonia, and later also a legate to Gotland, Holstein, Rügen, and Russia. In 1246 he was given also the vacant Diocese of Lübeck in Germany. The Teutonic Knights were wary of Suerbeer and warned him to stay away from Prussia. After Bishop Nicholas of Riga died in 1253, Suerbeer finally received the Bishopric of Riga he had claimed over 10 years. According to a compromise arranged by William of Modena, Albert promised to stop his activities against the Teutonic Order. Suffragan bishoprics subordinate to Riga included Dorpat, Ösel-Wiek, Courland, Sambia, Pomesania, Warmia (Ermland), and Culmerland. His activities regarding the proselytisation of the pagans and the foundation of a church union with the Russian principalities brought him into conflict with the Teutonic Order. While Suerbeer's proselytisation and power policy eventually yielded little success, the competing Teutonic Order attained papal support more easily than the archbishop, thanks to its supraregional presence and comparative wealth. In 1267, however, Suerbeer allied himself with Gunzelin, a son of Count Gunzelin III of Schwerin, who had come to Livonia as a crusader. He appointed Gunzelin an advocate (governor) of his diocese which resulted in deep conflict with the Livonian Order. While Gunzelin was recruiting troops in Germany, the Order arrested Suerbeer and kept him imprisoned with only bread and water. Suerbeer was forced to recognize the authority of the Order. Suerbeer died in Riga in 1273.

It was adapted into a 1993 film of the same name by Andrew Birkin, starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Andrew Robertson. The Cement Garden has had a positive reception since its original publication.  Plot summary  In The Cement Garden, the father of four children dies. Soon after, the children's mother dies as well. In order to avoid being taken into foster care, the children hide their mother's death from the outside world by encasing her corpse in cement in the cellar. The children then attempt to live on their own. The narrator is Jack (14 at the start of the book, becoming 15 later), and his siblings are Julie (17), Sue (13), and Tom (6). Jack describes how, when they were younger, he and Julie would play doctor with their younger sister, although he is aware that their version of the game occasionally broke boundaries. Jack then mentions how he longs to do the same to his older sister but it is not allowed. Sexual tension between Jack and his older sister, Julie, becomes increasingly obvious as they take over the roles of \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" in the house, which is gradually deteriorating into squalor. When Julie begins to date a young man called Derek, aged 23, and invites him to their house, Jack feels jealous and shows hostility towards him. Derek gets a hint that something is hidden in their cellar, and becomes more and more interested while the children attempt to hide it from him. When a smell begins to emanate from the cellar, the children tell him their dead dog, Cosmo, is encased in the cement. Derek then helps to re-seal the cement which their mother is hidden in. Eventually, Tom tells Jack that Derek has told him he believes their mother is in the cellar. Jack enters naked, apparently absent-mindedly, naked into Julie's bedroom. Only Tom is present. Jack climbs into Tom's cot and begins to talk to him about their parents. Julie enters and, seemingly unsurprised by her younger brother's nakedness, jokes that \\"it is big\\". Jack and Julie sit on the bed while Tom sleeps, and Julie takes off her clothes. While talking, Jack and his older sister become more and more intimate with each other. Right at this point, Derek enters. He remarks that he has seen it all and calls them \\"sick\\". When he leaves, Jack and Julie begin to have sex. A thudding noise is heard below, and their sister Sue comes and informs them that Derek is smashing up the concrete coffin. The three begin to talk, remembering their mother. After a while, police lights illuminate the room through the bedroom window.  Reception  The Cement Garden received positive reviews from critics. A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews argued that although one important event in the novel seemed staged for effect, the grim book \\"is somehow suffused with light and warmth. Having worked such wonders with such intrinsically stunted material, McEwan calls attention to his undeniable talent. If he and his characters can stretch to measure up to that prose, we may be watching a major novelist in the making.\\" Robert Towers of The New York Review of Books deemed The Cement Garden “morbid, full of repellent imagery – and irresistibly readable.” Paul Abelman of The Spectator called it “just about perfect”, and Blake Morrison declared in The Times Literary Supplement that the novel “should consolidate Ian McEwan’s reputation as one of the best young writers in Britain today”. In The New York Times, however, Anne Tyler praised McEwan as a skillful writer but stated that \\"these children are not--we trust--real people at all. They are so consistently unpleasant, unlikable and bitter that we can't believe in them (even hardened criminals, after all, have some good points) and we certainly can't identify with them. Jack's eyes, through which we're viewing this story, have an uncanny ability to settle upon the one distasteful detail in every scene, and to dwell on it, and to allow only that detail to pierce the cotton wool that insulates him. [...] It seems weak- stomached to criticize a novel on these grounds, but if what we read makes us avert our gaze entirely, isn't the purpose defeated?\\" In a review of the film adaptation, John Krewson of The A.V. Club referred to McEwan's original book as a \\"beautiful but disturbing novel\\". Kitty Aldridge of The Independent argued in a 2012 article, \\"McEwan's calm, exquisite sentences lead you into the secret and strange world of the post-war middle-class family, with its unique clash of make-do-and-mend and sexual revolution. Devastating information is relayed in short, cool-headed paragraphs, increasing the charged atmosphere of disorder and horror. [...] The novel is a masterclass in clarity and precision.\\" In a lukewarm review for a stage adaptation of the novel, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph said that the book remains \\"powerful and disconcerting\\" despite a narrative that is clearly heavily influenced by Lord of the Flies. Stephen King placed it 66th on a list of books that had influenced him. In a 2018 article, Elaina Patton of The New Yorker praised the author's extensive discussion of the minutiae of the environment, writing, \\"McEwan’s evocative detail and perfect British prose lend a genteel decorum to the death and decay that surround the family. [...] McEwan’s lovers are loathsome, a far cry from the romanticized versions in the 1993 film adaptation. But they’re all the more captivating for it.” The Cement Garden is David Aaronovitch's favorite McEwan novel. Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times called the book \\"shocking\\" and placed it fifth along with The Comfort of Strangers (1981) in her list of recommended books by the author. It was also ranked one of the author's five essential books by Book Marks in 2019.  In popular culture  A quote from the book can be heard in the opening of Madonna's song \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\\". The Cement Garden was adapted into a film of the same name by Andrew Birkin in 1993, starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Andrew Robertson. In March 2008, it was adapted for the first time for the stage by FallOut Theatre in Cambridge. A developed version of this adaption opened in London at The Vaults, Waterloo, starring George MacKay and Ruby Bentall in January 2014.  Anthology  The Cement Garden was included in the book Horror: Another 100 Best Books (2005) by Stephen Jones.

Brief history =Ancient history= The name Therfield is a variation of Tharfield and anciently Þurreweld. It is a theophoric placename referring to Thunor, and either means 'Thunor's Field' or 'Thunor's High place\\", from the same Germanic root that gives 'veldt'. It was inhabited long before the Anglo Saxons came, as the Icknield Way runs through the village, and Neolithic barrows have been found on Therfield Heath. =Today= Today Therfield is known as a very small village that is locally famous for its church, chapel and pub. The Nature Reserve of Therfield Heath lies a mile to the north of the village. From here on a clear day it is possible to see the Cathedral of Ely, over twenty miles to the north. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. =Church of St. Mary the Virgin= In Therfield the Church of St Mary the Virgin has stood the test of time. The most recent building was completed in 1878 and it replaced the church that had existed since the 13th Century which fell into such disrepair that it was in danger of collapsing. When it was replaced, the windows, pulpit and font were removed from the old church and built into the new structure. The tower contains six bells dating from 1597, 1608, 1626, 1656, 1689 with the most recent from 1707. For years these bells were not used and worship services were marked by the ringing of a bell dated 1862 that hung from a tree in a nearby field. The church register dates from the year 1538. Francis Turner (bishop) was buried here in the chancel in 1700. The church's original Stuart royal arms survives, and is unusual in that the inscription on the Garter is partly misspelt. =Therfield Chapel= Therfield Chapel was established as a congregation of Protestant dissenters (the \\"Independents\\") in 1836. The current Chapel was built subsequently, in 1854, and the Church eventually became known as Therfield Congregational Church, being affiliated to the Congregational Union who acted as trustees for the Church property. When in 1966 the Congregational Union was replaced by a body which espoused more liberal views, the Chapel seceded and became affiliated first to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC), and then to the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches (EFCC). In 1965, Allon Taffs was ordained as Pastor, after serving the church as Secretary/informal leader for some 10 years before. He remained until May 1993. After a period of interregnum, during which time the church was cared for and led by the elders and deacons, the Rev Mark Kingston was appointed as Pastor in August 1997. He served the church until he resigned in July 2002. Andrew Carter was appointed as Pastor in February 2006 until January 2016. In May 2016, Joshua Jones was appointed and currently serves as Pastor.

MAST Academy is a magnet school under the governance of Miami-Dade County Public Schools. The school's principal is Dr. Derick R. MacKoy, Sr., appointed in 2018. US News & World Report ranked MAST as the 42nd best high school in the nation as of 2015. The academic focus of MAST Academy is primarily marine studies. Students choose one of three major areas of study in which a traditional U.S. high school curriculum is infused with maritime-related subjects. These areas are Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences (OAS), Maritime Studies and Culture (MSC), and Marine Related Industries (MRI). Special course offerings include Marine Science, Oceanography, Solar Energy, Environmental Science, Swimming, and Water Safety. MAST Academy is located on Virginia Key, a barrier island between Miami and Key Biscayne, across the street from the Miami Seaquarium and within walking distance of the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.  History  In 1990, MAST Academy was established in Key Biscayne. In 2012, the school announced that it would expand by 1,100 seats, with preference given to eligible Key Biscayne residents. It was controversial and highly debated whether residents of the Village of Key Biscayne should be opened up to all Key Biscayne high school students. A former student was reported as claiming, \\"I can't believe they are going to turn over the school to the affluent residents of Key Biscayne in return for $9 million,\\" adding, \\"it will really destroy what MAST is all about.\\" In April 2015, a school shooting threat was posed toward MAST Academy, as a note was found reading, \\"On April 17, 2015 I will walk into this school and shoot everyone I see.\\" Some students decided to attend school on the day of the supposed shooting. In an interview with NBC 6 South Florida, one student was claimed his reasoning for attending to be, \\"I just really like learning, so I like going to class, and I'm not afraid.\\" Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho later tweeted, \\"I am always impressed by the composure of our student body. 'I am not scared. I am here to learn.'\\" MAST Academy now is a secondary school from 6-12 grade. Tours are available on Tuesdays during the academic year and are provided by their leadership students.

In 2010, MAST Medical @ Homestead was established. In 2011, José Martí Middle School introduced its magnet program with a high school expansion in 2011, before completely re-branding itself as José Martí MAST 6-12 Academy in 2013. In 2013, another MAST high school opened at a Florida International University campus. = Awards and recognition = During the 1994–96 and 2006-07 school years, MAST Academy was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.\\"For their accomplishments, all three schools this month earned the status of Blue Ribbon School, the highest honor the U.S. Education Department can bestow upon a school.\\" MAST Academy was one of six national finalists in the 2010 White House \\"Commencement Challenge\\". People from across the nation voted to determine which school would host President Barack Obama as a commencement speaker. MAST has established a tradition of academic excellence, and has been ranked among Newsweeks Top 100 High Schools several times. It has been listed as one of \\"Miami-Dade's Best Schools\\", and, as of 2014, is ranked 10th in Florida. = Planet Ocean = MAST Academy is currently housed in the former Planet Ocean museum. Planet Ocean was an 80,000 sq.ft., interactive oceanographic museum featuring state of the art, hands on exhibits about the ocean (such as a giant piece of touchable iceberg), displays of deep sea submersibles, multi-media presentations, and other educational experiences. The museum opened in the mid-seventies and was located across the street from the Miami Seaquarium on Virginia Key. Planet Ocean had trouble attracting enough visitors to be self-sustaining; it closed in 1991.  Demographics  The school has an enrollment of 1420 high school students. The breakdown of the student's ethnicity is 60% Hispanic, 23% White, 10% Black, 5% Asian, and 2% unknown.  Extracurricular activities  The school's primary sports are water polo and swimming. The school also offers a boys' basketball team, boys' and girls' cross country teams, boys' and girls' soccer teams, boys' and girls' golf teams, boys' and girls' tennis teams, and a girls' volleyball team as of 2019. MAST is active in the National Ocean Sciences Bowl Competition, where it placed first in the region and fifth place in the nation in 2006. The Black History Brain Bowl team won the 2006 Regional Championships. MAST is home to the first Coast Guard JROTC unit in the country. The school's mascot is a mako shark named Isurus, after retiring a pelican named Pete. The robotics and engineering team, the MAST Academy Mecha Makos, founded in 2006, has competed in numerous competitions including Youth Fair, MATE, FIRST, and FIU's Wall of Wind competition. The Mecha Makos qualified for the VEX World Championship in the 2011, 2012, and 2013 school years.

Young girl from Bou Saâda dropping flowers onto a portrait of Guillaumet Louis-Ernest Barrias (13 April 1841 – 4 February 1905) was a French sculptor of the Beaux-Arts school. In 1865 Barrias won the Prix de Rome for study at the French Academy in Rome. Barrias was involved in the decoration of the Paris Opéra and the Hôtel de la Païva in the Champs-Élysées. His work was mostly in marble, in a Romantic realist style indebted to Jean- Baptiste Carpeaux. Biography He was born in Paris into a family of artists. His father was a porcelain-painter, and his older brother Félix- Joseph Barrias a well-known painter. Louis-Ernest also started out as a painter, studying under Léon Cogniet, but later took up sculpture with Pierre- Jules Cavelier as teacher. In 1858 he was admitted to the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his teacher was François Jouffroy. In 1865 Barrias won the Prix de Rome for study at the French Academy in Rome. Barrias was involved in the decoration of the Paris Opéra and the Hôtel de la Païva in the Champs-Élysées. His work was mostly in marble, in a Romantic realist style indebted to Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. In 1878 he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour, an officer in 1881, and a commander in 1900. Barrias replaced Dumont at the Institut de France in 1884 then succeeded Cavelier as professor at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1900-03 he served on the Council for the National Museums. Among his students were Josep Clarà, Charles Despiau, Henri Bouchard, Fernand Hamar, and Victor Ségoffin. Barrias was very influenced by the Art Nouveau style, which was prominent in art during the fin-de-siècle in France. The voluptuous women figures used in many of his sculptures are a product of this time and style. Nature and the erotic was, also, used often in this type style of art, which is seen in many of Barrias's works including, Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science. This piece was made in 1899, when this style was popular. Another sculpture by Barrias is Portrait of the Young Mozart. He also often used literary references in his sculptures (Fusco, Peter, and H. W, Janson, eds. The Romantics to Rodin. New York: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1980. Print). Barrias died in Paris on 4 February 1905.

Balduína \\"Bidú\\" de Oliveira Sayão (pronounced bee-DOO sigh-OW; May 11, 1902 – March 12, 1999) was a Brazilian opera soprano. One of Brazil's most famous musicians, Sayão was a leading artist of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1937 to 1952. Life and career Bidu Sayão was born to a cultured family of Portuguese, French and Swiss heritage, in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro. Her father died when she was five years old and her mother struggled to support her daughter's costly pursuit of a singing career. At just eighteen, the gifted Bidu Sayão made her major opera debut in Rio de Janeiro. Her acclaimed performance led to an opportunity to study with the famous Elena Teodorini, first in Brazil, then in Romania; and then to study with the renowned Polish tenor and tutor, Jean de Reszke, in Nice. During the mid-1920s and early 1930s, she performed in Rome, Buenos Aires, Paris, as well as in her native Brazil. While at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, she met impresario Walter Mocchi (1870–1955). After his wife, soprano Emma Carelli, died in 1928, the two became romantically involved and were married. However, it did not last and in 1935 Sayão married Italian baritone Giuseppe Danise (1883–1963). In 1930, she debuted at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, and in the next year she sang a successful Juliette, in Gounod's Roméo et Juliette, at the Paris Opera. In the same year, she gained a great success with her debut at the Opéra Comique as Lakmé. She soon became one of the leading lyric coloratura sopranos in Europe, especially in Italy and France. Her repertoire included Lucia di Lammermoor, Amina in La sonnambula, Elvira in I puritani, Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos and Cecilia in Il Guarany, among other roles. =Metropolitan Opera= Bidu Sayão made her U.S. debut in a recital at Town Hall in New York City on December 30, 1935. Her U.S. operatic debut followed on January 21, 1936, when she and Danise sang in the penultimate production of the Washington National Opera, a semi-professional company not associated with its modern namesake; the performance, of Léo Delibes's Lakmé, was marred by a fractious dispute in which the orchestra musicians declined to play without payment in cash, and ultimately the performance was accompanied by a portable organ, with some singers appearing in costume and some in street clothes owing to a similar demand by the stage hands and costume man.McPherson, Jim. \\"Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America’s 'National' Opera\\", The Opera Quarterly, volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004 Altogether more dignified was her performance a few months later with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall singing La Damoiselle élue by Debussy. Her performance was under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, who would become her greatest supporter and lifelong friend. She sang her first performance at the Metropolitan Opera as Manon on February 13, 1937, replacing the Spanish soprano Lucrezia Bori. The critics, including Olin Downes of The New York Times, raved about her performance and within a few weeks she was given the lead in La traviata, followed soon thereafter by Mimì in La bohème. She also contributed to the Mozart revival at the Metropolitan Opera, becoming the pre-eminent Zerlina (Don Giovanni) and Susanna (The Marriage of Figaro) of her generation. She performed to much acclaim for the University of Michigan May Festival in 1948 with Conductor Thor Johnson. She sang \\"Un Bel Di\\" from Madame Butterfly as an encore. Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos had an artistic partnership with the diva that lasted many years. He made a number of recordings of his compositions, including a famous recording of the Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5. Bidu Sayão and her husband Giuseppe Danise purchased an oceanfront property in Lincolnville, Maine. After fifteen years with the Metropolitan Opera, she gave her last performance in 1952, choosing to retire from opera while still at the top of her form. For the next two years she was a guest performer throughout the U.S., but in 1957 she decided to retire completely from public performance; two years later she made her final recording as the soprano soloist on Villa-Lobos' world premiere stereo recording of his cantata Forest of the Amazon with the composer conducting the Symphony of the Air. Following her husband's death in 1963, Bidu Sayão lived quietly at her home in Maine. She returned to visit Brazil a last time in 1995 for a tribute to her during the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and died a few years later, aged 96, at the Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Maine. Her ashes were scattered across the bay in front of her home. Legacy Following her last visit to her homeland, the government prepared plans to honor her memory. In 2000 the Bidu Sayão International Vocal Competition was established to promote Brazilian operatic talent through a world-class competition. Sayão's portrait, painted by Curtis Ether, hangs in the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City.

Based in Toronto, Ontario and founded in 1978 by Matt Walsh, Jerry Ciccoritti, and Sky Gilbert, Buddies in Bad Times is dedicated to \\"the promotion of queer theatrical expression\\". Although the company eventually achieved notoriety and success in the 1980s as a queer theatre company, it was not founded with that intent. Buddies' original focus was on staged adaptations of poetry. However, during the 1980s, under the sole leadership of Sky Gilbert, Buddies developed a distinctly queer aesthetic and practice. The company articulated a vision for its work that was unapologetically political, fiercely pro-sexual, and fundamentally anti-establishment. In 1983, Sue Golding joined the company as its founding Board President—a post which she held until 1995, playing an instrumental role in shaping the direction of the organization. Some of the company's earliest commercial and critical successes included productions of Gilbert's Lana Turner has Collapsed! (1980), The Dressing Gown (1984), Drag Queens on Trial (1985), and The Postman Rings Once (1987), Don Druik's Where is Kabuki? (1989), as well as the Sex Tours of the Church-Wellesley community hosted by Gilbert's drag persona Jane. History Buddies in Bad Times (BIBT) was established and incorporated in Toronto in 1979. Gilbert was the company's first artistic director. Sue Golding played a pivotal role as President from 1983 to 1995. Buddies' inaugural production was a Gilbert play, Angels in Underwear. An anthology of Beat poetry, Angels starred Walsh as Jack Kerouac and Ciccoritti as Allen Ginsberg, and was performed at The Dream Factory on Queen Street in Toronto in September 1978. Gilbert, Walsh and Ciccoritti, along with playwright Fabian Boutilier, subsequently founded the Rhubarb Festival of Canadian Plays, first produced by the theatre company at The Dream Factory in January 1979 and featuring short plays written by local, unknown playwrights directed by all four of Rhubarb's founders. The name Buddies in Bad Times was taken from the poem of the same title by the French poet Jacques Prévert. It was originally the expression of the close friendship that prevailed between Walsh and Gilbert during their years at York University and The Three Schools of Art. Shortly after Walsh and Ciccoritti stopped working with the company in its infancy, Gilbert moved its artistic direction toward the then emerging gay subculture of Toronto. Buddies has become one of North America's premiere exemplars of the synthesis between so-called gay culture and modern theatre and has spawned the successful careers of dozens of Canadian actors, playwrights and directors. 1979: The beginning In 1979, The Rhubarb! Festival was mounted for the first time. Buddies was one of the six influential companies who banded together to form The Theatre Centre in Toronto—a movement of theatre that was hailed as the \\"next wave\\". Of all the companies involved in the venture, Buddies found an artistic and social connection to the work Nightwood theatre was doing and an alliance was formed that showed itself in six collaborative Rhubarb! Festivals. By 1983 Buddies in Bad Times Theatre was receiving funding from four levels of government. 1985–1993 In 1985 BIBT gave birth to the 4-Play Festival which premiered at Theatre Passe Muraille. This festival was dedicated exclusively to the promotion of lesbian and gay writers and creators. Seed Shows came into being in 1986. Opportunity without intervention was a growing ethos in how Sky Gilbert was building BIBT. Seed Shows such as DNA Theatre's This Is What Happens in Orangeville won a jury prize at The Festival Des Ameriques in Montreal. Platform 9 Theatre's Steel Kiss was also produced: born out of Rhubarb! and developed through Seed. It is now known as one of the most important plays of the 1980s. BIBT's first mainstage production, Sky Gilbert's The Postman Rings Once opened at TWP (12 Alexander Street) in 1987. Tim Jones became general manager in 1988. By 1990 BIBT had been directly or indirectly nominated or presented with numerous and various cultural awards. 1990 marked the year that Sky Gilbert's Drag Queens in Outer Space hit the stages of Seattle and San Francisco. BIBT was a company on the move that utilized venues within Toronto to create exciting hit shows. In 1991, BIBT set up its first permanent performance space at 142 George Street. Sky Gilbert's Suzie Goo: Private Secretary went on to win a Dora Mavor Moore Award for Best Production. Daniel MacIvor's 2-2-Tango was nominated for a Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award and Don Druick's Where Is Kabuki? was nominated for a Governor General's Award. BIBT was also integral in its support of smaller independent companies, such as Robin Fulford's Platform 9, Ed Roy's Topological Theatre and the newly formed Augusta Company by Daniel Brooks, Don McKellar and Tracy Wright. By 1993, BIBT had successfully negotiated a 40-year lease with the city and entered into a symbiotic partnership with The Alexander Street Theatre Project, a company formed primarily to raise funds and manage expenses for the renovation of the theatre. Sue Golding was President throughout this period.Open Letter from Sue Golding 1994–1998 In 1994 BIBT opened its first season at Alexander Street with Sky Gilbert's ambitious More Divine. The community support for the company was at an all-time high; Strange Sisters reached a new kind of notoriety, and an explosion of activity under one roof like the city of Toronto had never seen. 1994–1998 saw many exciting and challenging things happen for BIBT. Queerculture, 4-Play and Seed Shows were all laid to rest. Associate artists took on a larger role of shaping the subsidized work in the building and as a result there was tremendous success with Daniel MacIvor's Here Lies Henry and The Soldier Dreams. Sky Gilbert's Ten Ruminations on An Elegy Attributed to William Shakespeare toured to glowing reviews in Great Britain with stops in London, Brighton, and Cardiff. Two anthologies of Sky Gilbert's plays were also published. In 1996, Tim Jones resigned as general manager. 1997 marked the highly successful Martha Steward Projects and The Attic, the Pearls and Three Fine Girls and the resignation of founding artistic director Sky Gilbert. Sarah Stanley was appointed as Sky Gilbert's successor in April, and Gwen Bartleman was appointed general manager in July. During the 1997–1998 season, BIBT's profile rose with the premiere of Brad Fraser's Martin Yesterday and Diane Flacks' Random Acts, plus the 20th anniversary of Rhubarb! curated by festival director Franco Boni. RHUBARB-O- RAMA!, an anthology of works generated from twenty years of the Rhubarb! Festival, was published. 1997–1998 heralded a renewed commitment to play development, marked by the birth of the Ante Chamber Series and the development of six scripts under the eye of company dramaturg Edward Roy. In 1997, the theatre also hosted the inaugural We're Funny That Way! festival of LGBT comedians. BIBT's programming grew more ambitious in 1998–1999; the company produced the world premiere of R.M. Vaughan's camera, woman, the Toronto premiere of Live With It by Winnipeg playwright Elise Moore and the repertory run of Robin Fulford's Steel Kiss and Gulag. 1999–2000 In 1999, following a national search, David Oiye was hired as BIBT's third artistic director. Expanding its commitment to gay, lesbian and bisexual youth, BIBT launched its first annual Summer Youth Arts Programme in 1999, providing a summer-long outlet for twelve queer youth, and two year-round internship positions. On the producing front, BIBT's 1999 tribute to Canadian rock legend Carole Pope, Shaking the Foundations, received Dora Mavor Moore Award nominations for Outstanding Production, Direction, Musical Direction, and won in the category of Outstanding Female Performance (Paula Wolfson). BIBT also increased its commitment to new play development in 1999 by introducing Winter Fling in partnership with The Shaw Festival, to develop and present workshops of new Canadian scripts. 2000–2003 Over the 2000–2001 season, BIBT explored the notion of a national queer repertoire by programming Vancouver- based artist Dorothy Dittrich's award-winning musical When We Were Singing, Winnipeg playwright Ken Brand's comedy Burying Michael, and PileDriver! from Edmonton-based companies Guys in Disguise and Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie. For the 2001–2002 season Buddies produced the largest production in its history with Kelly Thornton's ambitious Peep Show (Designed by Steve Lucas and Sherri Hay, with lighting by Michael Kruse), and also received eight Dora Mavor Moore Award nominations for da da kamera]'s production of In on It by Daniel MacIvor, and Damien Atkins' much lauded Real Live Girl, which won in the categories of Outstanding Male Performance and Outstanding New Musical. During the 2002–2003 Gwen Bartleman resigned as general manager. Jim LeFrancois stepped in to oversee operations as Buddies' producer in the spring of 2003. Shows presented that season included James Harkness' rural drama Homage and Stem (created by Greg MacArthur, Ruth Madoc-Jones, Erika Hennebury, Clinton Walker), developed through Buddies' developmental programmes. The 2002–2003 season also launched a naughty late night series in Tallulah's Cabaret dubbed the Friday Superstar Series, featuring the outrageous, ultra- queer talents of such folks as Sasha Van Bon Bon, Kitty Neptune, R. Kelly Clipperton, Pretty Porky and Pissed Off, Will Munro, Kids on TV, and Buddies' resident trannypunk Josh Schwebel. A highlight of the 25th Rhubarb! Festival was the inclusion of two works from a contingent of Czech artists. 2003–2006 In 2003–2004 Buddies celebrated its 25-year contribution to Toronto's cultural landscape by programming its largest season ever. The year was decidedly retrospective in flavour, and welcomed back key artists who helped shape the company over the years. Sky Gilbert returned to direct the silver anniversary season opener, his much-lauded Play Murder (which starred Jason Cadieux, Marc Gushuliak, Ellen Ray Hennessy, Ann Holloway, Jane Johanson and Edward Roy) and artistic director David Oiye directed a re-mount of one of Gilbert's biggest hits, Suzie Goo: Private Secretary. Moynan King returned as associate artist, and was instrumental in launching Hysteria: A Festival of Women. Moynan also joined forces with Franco Boni on The Retro Rhubarb! Festival, which featured new work and pieces from past incarnations of the festival. Hits of The Retro Rhubarb! Festival included Hope Thompson's Green and The Magic Key and Peter Lynch's Colourful Conversation. Damien Atkins' Real Live Girl returned, as did a remount of Brad Fraser's Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love from Crow's Theatre. For 2004–2005, offered a season of theatrical works by Greg MacArthur (Snowman), Daniel MacIvor (da da kamera's Cul-de-sac), Mirha-Soleil Ross (Yapping out Loud), Marie Clements (Native Earth's The Unnatural and Accidental Women), Adam Bock (Theatrefront's Swimming in the Shallows), Darren O'Donnell (Mammalian Diving Reflex's Suicide-site Guide to the City), Ann Holloway (Kingstonia), Sky Gilbert (Cabaret Company's Rope Enough), and an adaptation by Judith Thompson (Volcano's take on Ibsen's Hedda Gabler). King also enjoyed tremendous success with the second incarnation of Hysteria: A Festival of Women, which saw artists flock to Buddies from as far afield as Sweden (The Lion Kings). Damien Atkin's Real Live Girl toured to London (The Grand Theatre) and Winnipeg (Manitoba Theatre Centre), and in June Cheap Queers returned home to Buddies. The company's 2005–2006 season included shows such as R.M. Vaughan's The Monster Trilogy, Marie Brassard's Jimmy, the Scandelles' remount run of Under the Mink, Salvatore Antonio's heartfelt family drama In Gabriel's Kitchen and Daniel MacIvor's A Beautiful View. The company also workshopped a new play by award-winning artist d'bi young, and supported presentations of Ed Roy's The Golden Thug (Topological Theatre) and Sky Gilbert's Bad Acting Teachers and the workshop of Diane Flacks' new one-woman show Bear With Me (Nightwood Theatre). The company's Queer Youth Arts Programme brought youth into Buddies throughout the season, to learn about theatre, see shows and meet artists and to create their own performance for Pride Week. 2006–2007 The company's 2006–2007 season, dubbed ArtSexy2, was an experiment in structure, development and presentation. Instead of full-scale productions, the company instead presented a series of works-in-development, which allowed the audience a unique opportunity to see artists developing non-linear work in workshop settings. Most of the presentations were only two or three performances long and the season was divided into three \\"waves\\" of development, each around a core theme: Wave One - The Creator/Performer; Wave Two - Audience Relocation (anchored around the presentation of Mammalian Diving Reflex's Diplomatic Immunities); and Wave Three - Art & Sex (which included a presentation by porn activist/performance artist Annie Sprinkle; and Gilbert's play Will The Real JT Leroy Please Stand Up). The season also included Keith Cole's sprinkler tap-dance from Mine in Wave One; Emergency Exit's moody forest of headphones as part of their installation, the evening news; and the Scandelles' Neon Nightz, an exploration of the relationship between strip clubs and the Church in Montreal in the 1990s. Also developing work in ArtSexy2 were Edwige Jean- Pierre, Andrew Kushnir, Nathalie Claude, Small Wooden Shoe, Ed Roy, Kids on TV, Mikiki, 2BoysTV and One Reed Theatre. This schedule was anchored by Necessary Angel's Dora award-winning production of Insomnia and the farewell season of one of Toronto's most challenging companies, da da kamera, which staged three solo shows, directed by Daniel Brooks and performed for the last time by core artist Daniel MacIvor. Here Lies Henry, Monster and House proved to be some of the most successful runs in Buddies' history. 2007–2008 The 2007–2008 season, Guilty Pleasures, offered an array of performance styles. ArtHouse Cabaret, a modern queer vaudeville conceived and directed by Jim LeFrancois and David Oiye, opened the 2007–2008 season. The set design for this multidisciplinary production completely transformed the theatre, and featured Keith Cole as the omniscient MC, burlesque from The Scandelles, Shane MacKinnon (the Beefcake Boys) and Stephen Lawson and Aaron Pollard (2Boys.tv of Montreal). ArtHouse Cabaret won Outstanding New Musical at the 2008 Dora Mavor Moore Awards. The 07-08 line-up also included a large-scale burlesque from The Scandelles (Who's Your DaDa?), a new musical from Sky Gilbert (Happy), an ultra-sexy modern dance programme (Art Fag), and the return of Hardworkin' Homosexuals' Cheap Queers. 2008–2009 Celebrating its third decade, Buddies' rebellious youthful tendencies began to collide with considerations for the future. 2008–2009 saw the programming of an exceptionally rich season. Two young artists developed through Buddies' Queer Youth Arts Programme took centre-stage. Agokwe, written and performed by Waawaate Fobister, enjoyed critical acclaim and won a leading six Dora awards. Agokwe nabbed awards for outstanding production of a play, best new play, and outstanding performance by a male in a principal role, while Ed Roy was honoured for his direction. Mark Shyzer, also from the Queer Youth Arts Programme, wrote and performed Fishbowl: A Concise, Expansive Theory Of Everything. This limited run performed to sold-out audiences. Buddies continued long-time partnerships with Canada's cutting-edge cultural artists and independent theatre companies. Crow's Theatre, Mammalian Diving Reflex, The Scandelles, Necessary Angel, Native Earth Performing Arts, 2boys.tv, Small Wooden Shoe and Sky Gilbert were also included as part of the 2008–2009 season. 2008–2009 saw its share of successes, but like so many art organizations during this season, Buddies in Bad Times Theatre felt increased pressure related to the economic downturn. Gay4Pay, written by Edward Roy, fell victim and had its scheduled mid-season run cancelled. In the midst of 'bad times', Buddies' extended family of artists came forward to help weather the financial storm. Daniel MacIvor performed his one-man show Cul-de-Sac, raising a significant amount of much needed revenue. Sharron Matthews and an entourage of Canada's finest musical theatre talent presented Sing Out, Louise! The Scandelles bared all in Funhouse. Comedians Gavin Crawford and Elvira Kurt also mounted a joint comedy show, Together Again for the First Time. During the 2008–2009 season, major changes to staffing occurred. Jim LeFrancois resigned as artistic producer and David Oiye announced that 2008–09 would be his last season as artistic director.\\"Buddies' artistic director David Oiye resigns\\" . Xtra!, May 8, 2009. 2009–present Following an extensive national search for a new artistic head, the company underwent two major shifts in leadership in 2009. Award-winning director Brendan Healy became the artistic director in October 2009, and acting general manager Shawn Daudlin officially became the general manager of the company in December 2009. The programming for the 2009–10 season, the final season programmed by Oiye, featured work led by female creators. This decision was in response to a national study on gender parity in Canadian theatre which revealed that female representation in our theatres is shockingly low. Participating artists included The Scandelles (Neon Nightz), Nina Arsenault (The Silicone Diaries), The Independent Aunties (Breakfast) and Nathalie Claude (The Salon Automaton). Healy's first season in 2010/11 featured many artists long associated with the company, such as Sonja Mills, Evalyn Parry, Sky Gilbert and 2boys.tv, while also announcing some new directions for the company. For the first production of the season, Healy helmed the English-Canadian premiere of Sarah Kane's play Blasted. Rhubarb! returned with a new festival director, Laura Nanni, and featured, for the first time, off-site performance in public spaces. Buddies also embarked on two major national tours of productions from its recent repertoire, Agokwe and The Silicone Diaries. The company took home five Dora Mavor Moore Awards (for outstanding production, lighting design, set design, sound design and direction) for its production of Blasted. This year also saw a 25 per cent growth in attendance for the company's main stage shows and festivals which included sold-out runs of Blasted, The Silicone Diaries and Spin. The 2011/12 season opened with a production of Jean Genet's classic text The Maids, and included work from Native Earth Performing Arts, Modern Times Stage Company, and legendary lesbian performance group Split Britches. The season also hosted a revival of Larry Kramer's seminal AIDS play The Normal Heart (produced by Studio 180 Theatre), and the Toronto premiere of Margaret Atwood's The Penelopiad (Nightwood Theatre) which went on to win several Dora Mavor Moore Awards. Buddies in Bad Times' 2012/13 season looked to empower the individual as an agent of social change. It began with Tawiah M'carthy's Obaaberima, which was originally developed as a part of the Young Creators Unit (YCU) in 2009. In the Spring Canadian theatre icon Daniel MacIvor returned to Buddies with his darkly poetic play Arigato, Tokyo. The season also included Sky Gilbert's A Few Brittle Leaves, a partnership with performance company Ecce Homo to present Of a Monstrous Child: a gaga musical and Studio 180's The Normal Heart. Laura Nanni returned as the Rhubarb Festival Director and oversaw the return of the wildly successful One-To-One Performance Series and Mobile Works projects. The 34th Rhubarb Festival broke all previous attendance records and engaged almost 200 artists. The season saw 22 Dora Mavor Moore Award nominations overall, including three awards for Obaaberima, music, set design and Outstanding Production. In 2012, Buddies was voted Toronto's Best Small Theatre Company by Now Magazine. The 2012/13 season also saw the completion of two large-scale initiatives: a three-year Audience Development Project and a strategic planning process that helped revise and Buddies' mandate, and articulated a long-term vision for the company. Buddies' 2013/14 season marked the company's 35th Anniversary. Its programming included the world premiere of PIG, directed by Artistic Director Brendan Healy, the return of the Strange Sisters Festival, and the premiere of The Gay Heritage Project. The 35th Rhubarb Festival, helmed by Festival Director Laura Nanni, marked the company's historic milestone with a 35 Performances for 35 Year Cabaret. The Festival looked to explore ideas of heritage and archiving while looking forward to possible Queer futures. The 2013/14 season was filled out with multiple guest companies including Theatre Rusticle, Pleiades Theatre, Cahoots Theatre Company, Cabaret Company and inDANCE. Buddies enters its next 35 years as the premier cultural centre for Toronto's LGBT community, as the top destination for all audiences seeking cutting-edge theatre in Toronto, as a leading centre for the creation and presentation of alternative theatre in Canada, and as a preferred employer in the arts in Toronto. Buddies is truly a one-of-a-kind place in the world that is dedicated to the nurturing, protection, and celebration of queer culture.

For seven years, she refused to give up reporting on the war despite numerous acts of intimidation and violence. Politkovskaya was arrested by Russian military forces in Chechnya and subjected to a mock execution. She was poisoned while flying from Moscow via Rostov-on-Don to help resolve the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis, and had to turn back, requiring careful medical treatment in Moscow to restore her health. Her post-1999 articles about conditions in Chechnya were turned into books several times;these were mostly published outside of Russia, see Literature. Russian readers' main access to her investigations and publications was through Novaya Gazeta, a Russian newspaper known for its often-critical investigative coverage of Russian political and social affairs. From 2000 onwards, she received numerous international awards for her work. In 2004, she published Putin's Russia, a personal account of Russia for a Western readership. On 7 October 2006, she was murdered in the elevator of her block of flats, an assassination that attracted international attention.The State of the World's Human Rights (Internet Archive), Amnesty International 2009, Report on Jan–Dec 2008, p. 272: \\"In June [2008], the Office of the Prosecutor General announced that it had finished its investigation into the killing of human rights journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot dead in Moscow in October 2006. Three men accused of involvement in her murder went on trial in November; all denied the charges. A fourth detainee, a former member of the Federal Security Services who had initially been detained in connection with the murder, remained in detention on suspicion of another crime. The person suspected of shooting Anna Politkovskaya had not been detained by the end of the year and was believed to be in hiding abroad.\\" In June 2014, five men were sentenced to prison for the murder, but it is still unclear who ordered or paid for the contract killing. Early life and education Politkovskaya was born Anna Mazepa in New York City in 1958, the daughter of Stepan F. Mazepa from Kostobobriv, Ukraine. Some sources say that her birth name was actually Hanna Mazeppa.Halyna Mazepa: My fondest Ukrainian memories are of Katerynoslav, day.kiev.ua Other sources state that she was born in Chernihiv region of Ukraine.Biography , annapolitkovskayafund.com Her parents, Soviet diplomats at the United Nations, were Ukrainian.Anna Politkovskaya, notablebiographies.com Politkovskaya spent most of her childhood in Moscow; she graduated from Moscow State University's school of journalism in 1980.POLITKOVSKAYA, Anna Stepanovna , russiaprofile.org While there, she defended a thesis about the poetry of Marina TsvetaevaHer school friends would note that the only and main specific about Politkovskaya is that she was very much into Tsvetaeva, who also have specific place in her poetry about hell, which probably influenced the titles of Politkovskaya books - , Simon Karlinsky, Marina Tsvetaeva: The Woman, Her World, and Her Poetry, CUP Archive, 1985 and married fellow student Alexander Politkovsky. They had two children, Vera and Ilya. At first Alexander was better known, joining TV journalist Vladislav Listyev as one of the hosts on the late-night TV programme Vzglyad. Apart from her childhood years, Politkovskaya spent no more than a few weeks outside Russia at any one time, even when her life came under threat. She was a U.S. citizen and had a U.S. passport, although she never relinquished her Russian citizenship. Journalistic work Politkovskaya worked for Izvestia from 1982 to 1993 as a reporter and editor of the emergencies and accidents section. From 1994 to 1999, she worked as the assistant chief editor of Obshchaya Gazeta, headed by Yegor Yakovlev, where she wrote frequently about social problems, particularly the plight of refugees. From June 1999 to 2006, she wrote columns for the biweekly Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper with strong investigative reporting that was critical of the new post-Soviet regime from the outset. She published several award-winning books about Chechnya, life in Russia, and Russia under Vladimir Putin, including Putin's Russia. =Reports from Chechnya= Politkovskaya won a number of awards for her work.Naming ceremony for the \\"Anna Politkovskaya\\" Press Conference Room (Internet Archive), an announcement of European Parliament. She used each of these occasions to urge greater concern and responsibility by Western governments that, after the 11 September attacks on the United States, welcomed Putin's contribution to their \\"War on Terror\\". She talked to officials, the military and the police and also frequently visited hospitals and refugee camps in Chechnya and in neighbouring Ingushetia to interview those injured and uprooted by the renewed fighting. In numerous articles critical of the war in Chechnya and the pro-Russian regime there, Politkovskaya described alleged abuses committed by Russian military forces, Chechen rebels, and the Russian-backed administration led by Akhmad Kadyrov and his son Ramzan Kadyrov. She also chronicled human rights abuses and policy failures elsewhere in the North Caucasus. In one characteristic instance in 1999, she not only wrote about the plight of an ethnically-mixed old peoples' home under bombardment in Grozny, but helped to secure the safe evacuation of its elderly inhabitants with the aid of her newspaper and public support. Her articles, many of which form the basis of A Dirty War (2001) and A Small Corner of Hell (2003), depict a conflict that brutalised both Chechen fighters and conscript soldiers in the federal army, and created hell for the civilians caught between them. As Politkovskaya reported, the order supposedly restored under the Kadyrovs became a regime of endemic torture, abduction, and murder, by either the new Chechen authorities or the various federal forces based in Chechnya. One of her last investigations was into the alleged mass poisoning of Chechen schoolchildren by a strong and unknown chemical substance which incapacitated them for many months.Poison in the air, The Guardian, by Anna Politkovskaya =Criticism of Vladimir Putin and FSB= After Politkovskaya became widely known in the West, she was commissioned to write Putin's Russia (later subtitled Life in a Failing Democracy), a broader account of her views and experiences after former KGB lieutenant colonel Vladimir Putin became Boris Yeltsin's Prime Minister, and then succeeded him as President of Russia. This included Putin's pursuit of the Second Chechen War. In the book, she accused the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) of stifling all civil liberties in order to establish a Soviet-style dictatorship, but admitted: > [It] is we who are responsible for Putin's policies ... [s]ociety has shown > limitless apathy ... [a]s the Chekists have become entrenched in power, we > have let them see our fear, and thereby have only intensified their urge to > treat us like cattle. The KGB respects only the strong. The weak it devours. > We of all people ought to know that. She also wrote: > We are hurtling back into a Soviet abyss, into an information vacuum that > spells death from our own ignorance. All we have left is the internet, where > information is still freely available. For the rest, if you want to go on > working as a journalist, it's total servility to Putin. Otherwise, it can be > death, the bullet, poison, or trial—whatever our special services, Putin's > guard dogs, see fit.\\"Poisoned by Putin\\", The Guardian, 9 September 2004 \\"People often tell me that I am a pessimist, that I don't believe in the strength of the Russian people, that I am obsessive in my opposition to Putin and see nothing beyond that\\", she opens an essay titled \\"Am I Afraid?\\", finishing it—and the book—with the words \\"If anybody thinks they can take comfort from the 'optimistic' forecast, let them do so. It is certainly the easier way, but it is the death sentence for our grandchildren.\\"Obituaries: Anna Politkovskaya, The Times, 9 October 2006\\"Russia's Secret Heroes\\", an excerpt from A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya.\\"Disquiet On The Chechen Front\\" (Internet Archive), TIMEeurope Heroes 2003Video – on the documenting the Chechen war as Russian journalist, PBS' Democracy on Deadline =A Russian Diary= In May 2007, Random House posthumously published Politkovskaya's A Russian Diary, containing extracts from her notebook and other writings. Subtitled A Journalist's Final Account of Life, Corruption, and Death in Putin's Russia, the book gives her account of the period from December 2003 to August 2005, including what she described as \\"the death of Russian parliamentary democracy\\", the Beslan school hostage crisis, and the \\"winter and summer of discontent\\" from January to August 2005.pp 187–98, A Russian Diary, 2007. Because she was murdered \\"while translation was being completed, final editing had to go ahead without her help\\", wrote translator Arch Tait in a note to the book.p xi, A Russian Diary, 2007. \\"Who killed Anna and who lay beyond her killer remains unknown\\", wrote Jon Snow, the main news anchor for the United Kingdom's Channel 4 in his foreword to the book's UK edition. \\"Her murder robbed too many of us of absolutely vital sources of information and contact\\", he concluded, \\"Yet it may, ultimately, be seen to have at least helped prepare the way for the unmasking of the dark forces at the heart of Russia's current being. I must confess that I finished reading A Russian Diary feeling that it should be taken up and dropped from the air in vast quantities throughout the length and breadth of Mother Russia, for all her people to read.\\"p x, A Russian Diary, 2007. Attempted hostage negotiations Politkovskaya was closely involved in attempts to negotiate the release of hostages in the Moscow theatre hostage crisis of 2002. When the Beslan school hostage crisis erupted in the North Caucasus in early September 2004, Politkovskaya attempted to fly there to act as a mediator, but was taken off the plane, acutely ill due to an attempted poisoning, in Rostov-on-Don (see Poisoning).Anna Politkovskaya, I tried and failed, The Guardian, 30 October 2002 Access to Russian authorities In Moscow, Politkovskaya was not invited to press conferences or gatherings that Kremlin officials might attend, in case the organisers were suspected of harbouring sympathies toward her. Despite this, many top officials allegedly talked to her when she was writing articles or conducting investigations. According to one of her articles, they did talk to her, \\"but only when they weren't likely to be observed: outside in crowds, or in houses that they approached by different routes, like spies\\". She also claimed that the Kremlin tried to block her access to information and discredit her: > I will not go into the other joys of the path I have chosen, the poisoning, > the arrests, the threats in letters and over the Internet, the telephoned > death threats, the weekly summons to the prosecutor general's office to sign > statements about practically every article I write (the first question > being, \\"How and where did you obtain this information?\\"). Of course I don't > like the constant derisive articles about me that appear in other newspapers > and on Internet sites presenting me as the madwoman of Moscow. I find it > disgusting to live this way. I would like a bit more understanding. Death threats After Politkovskaya's murder, Vyacheslav Izmailov, her colleague at Novaya Gazeta—a military man who had helped negotiate the release of dozens of hostages in Chechnya before 1999—said that he knew of at least nine previous occasions when Politkovskaya had faced death, commenting \\"Frontline soldiers do not usually go into battle so often and survive\\".Novaya gazeta, October 2006 Politkovskaya herself did not deny being afraid, but felt responsible and concerned for her informants. While attending a December 2005 conference on the freedom of the press in Vienna organised by Reporters Without Borders, she said \\"People sometimes pay with their lives for saying aloud what they think. In fact, one can even get killed for giving me information. I am not the only one in danger. I have examples that prove it.\\" She often received death threats as a result of her work, including being threatened with rape and experiencing a mock execution after being arrested by the military in Chechnya.\\"Her Own Death, Foretold\\", 15 October 2006. =Detention in Chechnya= Early in 2001, Politkovskaya was detained by military officials in the southern mountain village of Khattuni.\\"How the heroes of Russia turned into the tormentors of Chechnya\\", 27 February 2001. She was investigating complaints from 90 Chechen families about \\"punitive raids\\" by federal forces. She interviewed a Chechen grandmother from the village of Tovzeni, Rosita, who endured 12 days of beatings, electric shocks, and confinement in a pit. The men who arrested Rosita presented themselves as FSB employees. The torturers requested a ransom from Rosita's relatives, who negotiated a smaller amount that they were able to pay. Another interviewee described killings and rapes of Chechen men in a \\"concentration camp with a commercial streak\\" near the village of Khattuni.

Upon leaving the camp, Politkovskaya was detained, interrogated, beaten, and humiliated by Russian troops: \\"the young officers tortured me, skillfully hitting my sore spots. They looked through my children's pictures, making a point of saying what they would like to do to the kids. This went on for about three hours.\\" She was subjected to a mock execution using a BM-21 Grad multiple-launch rocket system, then poisoned with a cup of tea that made her vomit. Her tape records were confiscated. She described her mock execution: > A lieutenant colonel with a swarthy face and dull dark bulging eyes said in > a businesslike tone: \\"Let's go. I'm going to shoot you.\\" He led me out of > the tent into complete darkness. The nights here are impenetrable.

After the mock execution, the Russian lieutenant colonel said to her: \\"Here's the banya. Take off your clothes.\\" Seeing that his words had no effect, he got very angry: \\"A real lieutenant colonel is courting you, and you say no, you militant bitch.\\" In 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found the Russian Federation responsible for the forced disappearance of a suspected Ingush militant, Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev. Colonel-General Alexander Baranov, the commander of the Russian Caucasus deployment mentioned by Politkovskaya's camp guide as the one who ordered captured militants to be kept in the pits, was filmed as he ordered Yandiyev to be executed.\\"Bazorkina vs. Russia\\", a judgement by European Court of Human Rights, 27 July 2006. =Poisoning= While flying south in September 2004 to help negotiate with those who had taken over a thousand hostages in a school in Beslan (North Ossetia), Politkovskaya fell violently ill and lost consciousness after drinking tea given to her by an Aeroflot flight attendant. She had reportedly been poisoned, with some accusing the former Soviet secret police poison facility. =Threats from OMON officer= In 2001, Politkovskaya fled to Vienna, following e-mail threats that a police officer whom she had accused of atrocities against civilians in Chechnya was looking to take revenge. Corporal Sergei Lapin was arrested and charged in 2002, but the case against him was closed the following year. In 2005, Lapin was convicted and jailed for the torture and subsequent disappearance of a Chechen civilian detainee, the case exposed by Politkovskaya in her article \\"Disappearing People\\".\\"Siberian police 'obstructing Politkovskaya murder inquiry'\\", 6 November 2006. A former fellow officer of Lapin's was among the suspects in Politkovskaya's murder, on the theory that the motive might have been revenge for her part in Lapin's conviction. =Conflict with Ramzan Kadyrov= In 2004, Politkovskaya had a conversation with Ramzan Kadyrov, then Prime Minister of Chechnya. One of his assistants said to her, \\"Someone ought to have shot you back in Moscow, right on the street, like they do in your Moscow\\". Ramzan repeated after him: \\"You're an enemy. To be shot....\\"«Тебя надо было расстрелять еще в Москве, на улице, как там у вас в Москве расстреливают... Тебя надо было расстрелять...». Рамзан вторит: «Ты — враг... Расстрелять...

In her final interview, she described Kadyrov—now president of Chechnya—as the \\"Chechen Stalin of our days\\". (Citing The Moscow Times, 09.x.06) Murder, investigation and trial Near her house, Moscow, 2006 Grave of Anna Politkovskaya at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov or his men were possibly behind the assassination of Politkovskaya. Politkovskaya was found dead in the lift, in her block of flats in central Moscow on 7 October 2006. She had been shot twice in the chest, once in the shoulder, and once in the head at point-blank range. The assassination had happened on Vladimir Putin's birthday, and two days after Ramzan Kadyrov's 30th birthday celebrations, raising suspicions that one or both were served up by the contract hit.Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky, The Corporation. Russia and the KGB in the Age of President Putin, , Encounter Books; 25 February 2009, description , pages 479–452.Boris Volodarsky, \\"The KGB's Poison Factory\\", Frontline Books, 2009, page 251. There was widespread international reaction to the assassination. The funeral was held on 10 October 2006 at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in the outskirts of Moscow. Before Politkovskaya was buried, more than one thousand mourners filed past her coffin to pay their last respects. Dozens of Politkovskaya's colleagues, public figures, and admirers of her work gathered at the cemetery. No high-ranking Russian officials could be seen at the ceremony. Politkovskaya was buried near her father, who had died shortly before her. In May 2007, a large posthumous collection of Anna's articles, entitled With Good Reason, was published by Novaya Gazeta and launched at the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow.Politkovskaya, Anna. Nothing But the Truth. 2010. The event came soon after the birth of Anna's namesake grandchild: Vera's daughter was named Anna in honour of her grandmother. A few months later, 10 men were detained on suspicion of various degrees of involvement in Politkovskaya's murder.\\"The first arrests have been made\\", 30 August 2007, Novaya Gazeta in Russian. Four of them were brought before the Moscow District Military Court in October 2008. =First trial, 2008–2009= Three men were charged with directly aiding Politkovskaya's killer, who was allegedly the brother of two of the suspects. There was insufficient evidence to charge the fourth man—an FSB colonel—with the murder, though he was suspected of a leading role in its organisation; he stood trial at the same time for another offence. The case was held before a jury (a rare occurrence in Russia)\\"From fifty to twenty\\" (Selecting a jury for the Politkovskaya trial), 18 November 2008, Novaya Gazeta; accessed 2015-02-28. and, after the jurors insisted, was open to the press and public.24 November 2008, Novaya Gazeta Reports on the first week of the trial (Internet Archive).4 December 2008, Novaya Gazeta (Internet Archive) Reports on the second week of the trial. On 25 November 2008, it was reported that Politkovskaya's murder might have been ordered by a politician inside Russia. Murad Musayev, a lawyer for the men on trial, told journalists that the case notes—as one of the interpretations of the crime—mentioned that a politician, based in Russia (but not named in those notes), was behind her death.Убийство Политковской заказал некий политик в России, и об этом упоминается в деле, заявил адвокат обвиняемых, Newsru.com tr. The murder of Politkovskaya was ordered by a certain politician in Russia, and this is mentioned in the case, the lawyer of the accused said. 25 November 2008 NEWSru On 5 December 2008, Sergei Sokolov, a senior editor of Novaya Gazeta, testified in court that he had received information (from sources he would not name) that defendant Dzhabrail Makhmudov was an agent of the FSB. He said Makhmudov's uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, who was serving a 12-year jail sentence for the attempted murder of a Ukrainian businessman, also worked for the FSB. Russia's Investigative Committee—with help from the Belgian police—arrested Rustam Makhmudov, the man suspected of killing Anna Politkovskaya, after he was detained in the Chechen Republic and transported to Moscow for questioning. =Following the acquittal= After all three men were acquitted of Politkovskaya's murder in February 2009, her children Vera and Ilya, their lawyers Karinna Moskalenko and Anna Stavitskaya, and senior Novaya Gazeta editor Sergei Sokolov gave their reaction to the trial at a press conference in Moscow.\\"The whole system stands condemned\\", 20 February 2009, Novaya Gazeta, in English . Transcript of press conference following verdict. In his comments on the end of the trial, Andrew McIntosh, Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's Sub-Committee on the Media and Rapporteur on media freedom, expressed frustration at what he perceived to be a lack of progress in investigating the murder, or the inability of the Russian authorities to find her killers: > Two years ago, in its Resolution 1535 (2007), the Assembly called on the > Russian Parliament closely to monitor the progress in the criminal > investigations regarding the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and hold the > authorities accountable for any failures to investigate or prosecute. The > closure of the trial yesterday can only be regarded as a blatant failure.

There are no excuses for these flawed investigations into > murders of politically critical journalists writing against corruption and > crime within government, such as the murders of Georgy Gongadze in Ukraine > in 2000 and Paul Klebnikov in Moscow in 2004. Before the trial ended, Stanislav Markelov, a lawyer who had investigated many of the abuses documented by Politkovskaya, was assassinated in Moscow on 19 January 2009. Journalist Anastasia Baburova, who was with Markelov at the time, died later of injuries sustained while trying to intervene.Anna Politkovskaya's lawyer Stanislav Markelov shot dead in Moscow. The Times More closely related to Politkovskaya's work as a journalist was 15 July 2009 murder of Natalia Estemirova. A board member of the Memorial human rights society and one of Politkovskaya's key informants, guides, and colleagues in Chechnya, Estemirova was abducted in Grozny and found dead, several hours later, in the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia.\\"Russian activist Natalya Estemirova found dead\\", The Daily Telegraph, 15 July 2009 =Retrial, 2012 and 2014= On 5 August 2009, the prosecution service's objection to the acquittals in the Politkovskaya trial was upheld by the Supreme Court, and a new trial was ordered. In August 2011, Russian prosecutors claimed they were close to solving the murder after detaining Dmitry Pavliuchenkov, a former policeman, who they alleged was the principal organiser. The following month Kommersant Daily reported that, according to Pavlyuchenkov, Lom-Ali Gaitukayev was the one negotiating with the person who ordered the killing, and although Pavlyuchenkov did not know the name, he suspected he could be the fugitive businessman and Putin critic Boris Berezovsky. In December 2012, Dmitry Pavliutchenkov was found guilty and sentenced to 11 years in a high security penal colony. In May 2014, five men were convicted of murdering Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial. The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building. In June 2014 the men were sentenced to prison, two of them, Lom-Ali Gaitukayev and his nephew Rustam Makhmudov, receiving life sentences. It is still unclear who ordered or paid for the contract killing. =Murder remains unsolved, 2016= In September 2016, Vladimir Markin, official spokesman for the Investigative Committee, included the killing of Anna Politkovskaya among the Most Dramatic Crimes in 21st century RussiaVladimir Markin, Samye gromkie prestuppleniya 21 veka v Rossii, 2016. and claimed that it had been solved. Her colleagues at Novaya gazeta protested that until the instigator or sponsor of the crime was identified, arrested and prosecuted the case was not closed. On 7 October 2016, Novaya gazeta released a video clip of its editors, correspondents, photographers and technical and administrative staff holding text-boards giving details of the case and stating, repeatedly, \\"The sponsor of Anna's murder has not been found\\". On the same day deputy chief editor Sergei Sokolov published a damning summary of the official investigation, describing its false turns and shortcomings, and emphasised that it had now effectively been wound up. After the three Makhmudov brothers, Khadjikurbanov and Lom-Ali Gaitukayev were convicted in 2014, wrote Sokolov, the once large team of investigators was reduced to one person and within a year he retired, to be replaced by a lower-ranking investigator.

Latin manus \\"hand\\" and capere \\"to take hold of\\") was a solemn verbal contract by which the ownership of certain types of goods, called res mancipi, was transferred. Mancipatio was also the legal procedure for drawing up wills, emancipating children from their parents, and adoption.Forsythe, Gary, \\"Ubi tu gaius, ego gaia. New Light on an Old Roman Legal Saw,\\" in Historia, 45.2 (1996), p. 241. Res mancipi were goods important in an early agrarian society, like land, rights over land, horses, cattle and slaves. The right of ownership (dominium) for such goods was reserved to Roman citizens (Quirites) and therefore called a \\"quiritian\\" or a \\"quiritary\\" right. The procedure of acquisition of property by scales and bronze (per aes et libram) is described as follows by Gaius: \\"Mancipatio is effected in the presence of not less than five witnesses, who must be Roman citizens and of the age of puberty, and also in the presence of another person of the same condition, who holds a pair of brazen scales and hence is called Libripens. The purchaser, taking hold of the thing, says: HUNC EGO HOMINEM EX IURE QUIRITIUM MEUM ESSE AIO ISQUE MIHI EMPTUS ESTO HOC AERE AENEAQUE LIBRA (I affirm that this slave is mine according to quiritary right, and he is purchased by me with this piece of bronze and scales). He then strikes the scales with the piece of bronze, and gives it to the seller as a symbol of the price\\" (Gaius, Institutes, I.119). Mancipatio existed even before the Twelve Tables.

The puckering of the white striped part of the fabric can be seen in close-up. Seersucker or railroad stripe is a thin, puckered, all-cotton fabric, commonly striped or chequered, used to make clothing for spring and summer wear. The word came into English from Hindi, and originates from Sanskrit क्षीरशर्करा (kshirsharkara) and also Persian words and , literally meaning \\"milk and sugar\\", from the resemblance of its smooth and rough stripes to the smooth texture of milk and the bumpy texture of sugar. Seersucker is woven in such a way that some threads bunch together, giving the fabric a wrinkled appearance in places. Often realized by warp threads for the puckered bands during weaving being fed at a greater rate than the warp threads of the smooth stripes (these need not be, but often are, of different colors). This feature causes the fabric to be mostly held away from the skin when worn, facilitating heat dissipation and air circulation. It also means that pressing is not necessary. Common items made from seersucker include suits, shorts, shirts, curtains, dresses, and robes. The most common colors for it are white and blue; however, it is produced in a wide variety of colors, usually alternating colored stripes and puckered white stripes slightly wider than pinstripes. History During the British colonial period, seersucker was a popular material in Britain's warm-weather colonies like British India. When seersucker was first introduced in the United States, it was used for a broad array of clothing items. For suits, the material was considered a mainstay of the summer wardrobe of gentlemen, especially in the South, who favored the light fabric in the high heat and humidity of the southern climates, especially prior to the arrival of air conditioning. During the American Civil War, this cheap but durable material was used to make haversacks and even the famous baggy pants of Confederate Zouaves such as the Louisiana Tigers. From the mid Victorian era until the early 20th century, seersucker was also known as bed ticking due to its widespread use in mattresses, pillow cases and nightshirts during the hot summers in the Southern US and Britain's overseas colonies. Steam locomotive driver wearing a popular shade of light blue and white striped seersucker overalls and engineer cap The fabric was originally worn by the poor in the U.S. until preppy undergraduate students began wearing it in the 1920s in an air of reverse snobbery. Seersucker's comfort and easy laundering made it the choice of Captain Anne A. Lentz, one of the first female officers selected to run the Marine Corps Women's Reserve during the Second World War, for the summer service uniforms of the first female United States Marines. From the 1940s onwards, nurses and US hospital volunteers also wore uniforms made from a type of red and white seersucker known as candy stripe. =Hickory stripe= In the days of the Old West, a type of heavyweight indigo or navy blue seersucker known as \\"hickory stripe\\" was used to make the overalls, work jackets and peaked caps of train engineers and railroad workers such as George \\"Stormy\\" Kromer or Casey Jones. It was later worn by butchers and employees of the gasoline companies, most notably Standard Oil. This cotton fabric was durable like denim, cheap to produce, kept the wearer cool in the hot cab of the steam locomotive, and obscured oilstains. Even today, the uniforms of American Union Pacific train drivers include \\"railroad stripe\\" caps based on those from the steam age, and some rolling stock used for freight, shunting and maintenance work is painted with blue and white \\"zebra stripes\\" to improve visibility. In fashion About 1909, New Orleans clothier Joseph Haspel, Sr. started making men's suits out of seersucker fabric, which soon became regionally popular as more comfortable and practical than other types of suits and fit the hot and humid southern climate. During the 1950s, cheap railroad stripe overalls were worn by many young boys until they were old enough to wear jeans. This coincided with the popularity of train sets, and films such as The Great Locomotive Chase. At the same time, seersucker formal wear continued to be worn by many professional adults in the Southern and Southwestern US. College professors were known to favor full suits with red bowties, although 1950s Ivy League and 21st century preppy students usually restricted themselves to a single seersucker garment, such as a blazer paired with khaki chino trousers. Menswear brands famous for manufacturing seersucker at this time included Brooks Brothers, Macy's, Sears, and Joseph Haspel of New Orleans. In the 1970s, seersucker pants were popular among young urban African Americans seeking to connect to their rural heritage. The fabric made a comeback among teenage girls in the 1990s, and again in the 2010s. Musician David Byrne, 1986 Beginning in 1996, the US Senate held a Seersucker Thursday in June, where the participants dress in traditionally Southern clothing, but the tradition was discontinued in June 2012. As of June 2014, it has been revived by members of the US Senate. The Republican Party has advised students at its Comms college not to wear seersucker when appearing before the cameras because of its old fashioned connotations, plus the disruptive effect of the stripes. =2010 to present= Australian Olympic athletes in 2016 From 2012 onwards, seersucker blazers and pants made a comeback among American men due to a resurgence of interest in preppy clothing and the 1920s fashion showcased in the 2013 film version of The Great Gatsby. Although pale blue and dark blue stripes remained the most popular choice, alternative colors included green, red, black, grey, beige, yellow, orange, purple, pink, and brown. The traditional two button blazer was updated with a slimmer cut and Edwardian inspired lapel piping, and double breasted jackets became available during the mid 2010s. Since 2010, \\"Seersucker Social\\" events have been held in major cities across the United States, where participants wear vintage clothes and ride vintage bicycles. Such events are the summer equivalent of a Tweed Run, which is traditionally held in the fall. In the 2016 Olympics hosted by Brazil, the Australian Olympic team received green and white seersucker blazers and Toms Shoes rather than the traditional dark green with gold trim. At the same time, seersucker pants, skirts, espadrilles, blouses, and even bikinis were worn as casual attire by many fashion conscious young women in America. Weaving process Seersucker is made by slack-tension weave. The threads are wound onto the two warp beams in groups of 10 to 16 for a narrow stripe. The stripes are always in the warp direction and on grain. Today, seersucker is produced by a limited number of manufacturers. It is a low-profit, high-cost item because of its slow weaving speed.

In the Harold structure, characters and themes are introduced and then recur in a series of connected scenes.  History  The Committee, a San Francisco improv group, performed the first Harold in Concord, California, in 1967. They were invited to a high school and decided to do their improvisations on the war in Vietnam. On the way home in a Volkswagen bus, they were discussing the performance, when one of them asked what they should call it. Allaudin (Bill) Mathieu, (W.A. Mathieu) called out \\"Harold\\", which was a joking reference to a line from A Hard Day's Night where a reporter asks George Harrison what he calls his haircut and he answers \\"Arthur\\". The form was further developed by improv teachers Del Close and Charna Halpern, as well as the Upright Citizens Brigade. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, improv company Improvisation, Inc. was the only company in America continuing to perform the group's \\"original\\" Harold: a 45-minute free-form piece that would seamlessly move from one \\"Harold technique\\" to another. In 1974, in Los Angeles, former Committee member Gary Austin co-founded The Groundlings, using improv-as-a-tool.Fotis, M. Long Form Improvisation and American Comedy: The Harold In 1976, two former Improvisation, Inc. performers, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam, performing in San Francisco's Old Spaghetti Factory through 1983. Spaghetti Jam performed Harolds while also turning Spolin games and Harold techniques into stand-alone performance pieces (i.e., shortform improv). The 1994 book Truth in Comedy describes a \\"training wheels Harold\\" as three acts (or \\"beats\\"), each with three scenes and a group segment. With each beat, the three scenes return. By the end of the piece, the three scenes have converged. Modified Harolds Some modern improv forms are Harolds with an added requirement.

Life According to his Vita, Sulpitius was born at Vatan (Diocese of Bourges), of noble parents, before the end of the sixth century. From his youth he devoted himself to good works and to the study of Scripture, and donated his large patrimony to the church and the poor.Butler, Alban. \\"St. Sulpicious II\\", The lives of the primitive fathers, martyrs, and other principal saints, J. Moir, 1798 Austregisilus, Bishop of Bourges, ordained him cleric of his church, then deacon, and finally made him director of his episcopal school. Clotaire II (King of the Franks from 613 to 629), who had heard of his merits, summoned him and made him almoner and chaplain of his armies. Upon the death of Bishop Austregisilus (c. 624) Sulpicious was recalled to Bourges to succeed him. Thenceforth he labored with much zeal and success to re-establish ecclesiastical discipline, for the relief of the poor.Dégert, Antoine. \\"Sulpitius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14.

Krusch, Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores Rerum Merovingicarum vol. IV pp. 364-380; an earlier version was included by Krusch on vol. VI (1902). An English translation by Sarah Brush is on-line. Sulpicius' miracles show him receiving \\"Theudogisilus\\", a noble from the palatium of the king with entertainments and a \\"great heaped fire\\" (in a fireplace in the centre of the great hall, the smoke issuing through a vent in the roof). Sulpitius allegedly extinguished this fire, when it threatened to get out of control, with an outstretched hand. The vita asserts with approval that \\"he, the holy man gave leave for no-one, neither heretic, gentile or Jew, to live in the city of Bourges without the grace of baptism\\" - with many consequent conversions from the Jews of Bourges. The Vita tells that Dagobert I sent his representative the merciless general Lollo (Lollonius) to reside at Bourges and to bring the city more closely under the king's command.\\"that the people of Bourges should at once be placed under law and under him and should live and serve the king’s command.\\" (Sarah Brush, tr.). Sulpitius intervened with King Dagobert on behalf of his flock, of whom a too heavy tax was exacted. When the people came complaining of their treatment to Sulpicius, he decreed a three-day fast for clergy and laity, but also sent one of his clergy, Ebargisilus by name, to the king. Towards the end of his life Sulpitius took a coadjutor, Vulfolnde,\\"he asked the king for a partner to support this burden.\\" (Vita, Sarah Brush, tr.). and retired to a monastery which he had founded near Bourges. There he died on 17 January 646, which day several manuscripts of the Hieronymian Martyrology indicate as his feast. The reports of miracles at his tomb in the basilica he had ordered built began soon after his death and the place became a place of pilgrimage. > That place, the basilica, where the memorable man of God is buried, is > called Navis, because the port of ships is seen to be there. It is a most > lovely place between two rivers with pastures and woods and vineyards in > great number, with fields and rivers flowing between huge plains so that > there, the inhabitants may be seen to possess the image of paradise.

Due to the first past the post electoral system, national fourth parties are rarely successful in achieving representation in the House of Commons. A notable exception is the case of regional parties, such as the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru, who have gained a number of seats. The impact of minor parties should not be underestimated. The success of the Green Party in the 1980s led to environmentalism becoming a key issue for the three main parties, while the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) is now one of the largest British parties in the Europe Parliament and has greatly advanced the issue of euroscepticism. Parties listed below are organised firstly by the nations and regions in which they are standing, then the number of MPs elected in the 2001 general election, then by number of candidates standing in the 2005 election, and finally alphabetically. As a result, parties attracting more support will tend to appear higher in each list than fringe parties.  Parties standing in England and Wales  There are well over 500 seats in England and Wales, with the Labour Party and Conservative Party standing in every one, and the Liberal Democrats standing aside only against Health Concern.

Nonetheless, this period is often characterized as the Danish Golden Age. His father was a customs officer in the service of the absolute monarchy and also a bon vivant. Aarestrup had a younger brother, but when he was seven years old, their parents were separated, and tragically both died shortly after, leaving the two Aarestrup boys orphaned, but in the care of a local elderly spinster, Marie Møller, and the boys' grandfather, a dealer in tea and porcelain. As a poet, Aarestrup would later return to feelings of loss and loneliness, perhaps caused by these traumatic childhood experiences. In 1819 Aarestrup became a student, and continued to study medicine at the University of Copenhagen, graduating as a physician in 1827. That same year he married his 15 year old cousin Caroline Aagard and together they settled in Nysted on the Danish island Lolland, where he would have his practice. It was later found out that he had actually fathered an illegitimate daughter with his landlords wife during his studies in Copenhagen, which naturally put strains on his relations with Caroline, but even so, he made provisions for this daughter also, besides from fathering no less than 12 children with his wife. The Aarestrup couple would live in Nysted from 1827 until 1838, when Aarestrup got hold of a more profitable district, better suited for his expenses to the growing family, though still not sufficient. In 1849 he finally succeeded in obtaining the much larger post of District Physician in Funen, overseeing the other doctors. Again he and his family moved, for the last time, to Odense, where he spent the remainder of his life. Works Working as a doctor, he wrote poetry in his spare time. Only one book was published while he was alive, in 1838: \\"Digte\\" (\\"Poems\\"). It was generally ignored by critics as well as the public at the time of its release. Another was published after his death in 1863: \\"Efterladte Digte\\" (\\"Posthumous poems\\"). Among Danish lyricists, Aarestrup is considered one of the most genuine amorists. Especially in his ritornelles and short and emphasized verses he reaches mastery. As a verse technician he is influenced by the German poet Friedrich Rückert but finds his own form. Compared to most contemporary Danish love poets he is much more sensual, material and audacious though still respecting decorum. His tune is teasing, ironic, witty and elegant but sometimes with a hidden fear of death and vanity. Among his most famous poems must be mentioned Paa Sneen (“On the Snow”), Angst (“Fear”), Til Nanna (“For Nanna”), Tidlig Skilsmisse (“Early Divorce”) and Var det Synd? (“Was It a Sin?”). Less known today are his few political poems that reveal his liberal sympathies. Legacy Although not recognized in his own time, he is now widely considered one of the most influential Danish poets and is still read in Denmark today. Normally his poetry is regarded as an important precursor of the great poet Sophus Claussen.

Singapore is on the north of the channel, and the Riau Islands are on the south. The Indonesia-Singapore border lies along the length of the strait. It includes Keppel Harbour and many small islands. The strait provides the deepwater passage to the Port of Singapore, which makes it very busy. Approximately 2,000 merchant ships traverse the waters on a daily basis. The depth of the Singapore Strait limits the maximum draft of vessels going through the Straits of Malacca, and the Malaccamax ship class. Historical Records Aerial panorama of the Singapore Strait and the Pasir Panjang Port Terminal, 2016 Aerial perspective of Kusu Island, one of the southern islands found in the Singapore Straits, 2016 The 9th century AD Muslim author Ya'qubi referred a Bahr Salahit or Sea of Salahit (from the Malay selat meaning strait), one of the Seven Seas to be traversed to reach China. Some have interpreted Sea of Salahit as referring to Singapore, although others generally considered it the Malacca Strait, a point of contact between the Arabs and the Zābaj (likely Sumatra). Among early Europeans travellers to South East Asia, the Strait of Singapore may refer to the whole or the southern portion of the Strait of Malacca as well as other stretches of water. Historians also used the term in plural, \\"Singapore Straits\\", to refer to three or four different straits found in recorded in old texts and maps - the Old Strait of Singapore between Sentosa and Telok Blangah, the New Strait of Singapore southwest of Sentosa, the \\"Governor's Strait\\" or \\"Strait of John de Silva\\" which corresponds to Phillip Channel, and the Tebrau Strait. Today the Singapore Strait refers to the main channel of waterway south of Singapore where the international border between Singapore and Indonesia is located.

Career =Early years= Born in Stafford, Curry grew up in the mining village of Allerton Bywater near Castleford in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father, Arthur, a physical training instructor and prison officer, died when Curry was five. His mother, Lily, was a maternity nurse. His television career began when he was seven, after he auditioned for Jess Yates, the executive producer of Yorkshire Television's Junior Showtime. He was a regular performer on the show from 1969 to 1974. He attended the Jean Pearce School of Dancing in Leeds throughout the early 1970s. Curry has appeared in many pantomimes throughout the UK. His first was a television pantomime in 1972, Babes in the Wood, starring Little and Large and Susan Maughan, where Curry and Bonnie Langford were the two babes. Alan Parker cast Curry as Oscar, the producer, in the film Bugsy Malone (1976). In the late 1970s, Curry co-presented a Saturday morning TV show called Calendar Kids, with Kathryn Apanowicz, which was only shown in the Yorkshire Television region. He was also a main character in a six episode comedy/drama series about brass bands, Sounding Brass, for ATV. Curry joined the Harrogate Theatre Company and appeared in several plays over three years in the early 1980s. In 1981, he co-hosted the series Get Set For Summer on BBC1 with main host Peter Powell and Lucie Skeaping. The series returned the following year as Get Set but eventually became The Saturday Picture Show with Curry as main host, running until 1986. Curry's co-hosts over the years included Deborah Appleby, Maggie Philbin and Cheryl Baker. In 1984, Curry was the question master on the final series of Screen Test, the BBC's cinematic quiz show for children.Screen Test on IMDb =Blue Peter: 1986–1989= On 23 June 1986, Curry joined the children's television programme Blue Peter. During his time on the show, he did such things as being strapped to the sails of Outwood Windmill in Surrey and accidentally knocking the head off a man made of Lego. Curry spent three weeks in Malawi witnessing distressing scenes of people from surrounding villages suffering with blindness and chronic eye problems. He had an eye operation when he was two years old and has to wear spectacles due to only seeing clearly through one eye, so was very enthusiastic about raising money for the charity, SightSavers, which was the Blue Peter appeal for 1986. He travelled all over the Soviet Union for the 1987 summer expedition and was known for his history features on the show, his cooking disasters and his performing. Due to Curry's successful children's history programme Treasure Houses, created by Dorothy Smith and the head of children's programmes, Edward Barnes, he was invited to replace Simon Groom without auditioning for the show. Curry's co-hosts during his time with the programme were Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan, Caron Keating, Yvette Fielding and John Leslie. Curry was very emotional in 2004 after the death of fellow presenter and close friend, Caron Keating. The team of Curry, Keating and Fielding during the 1980s was very popular at the time and they worked together on the programme's Christmas song and dance specials. Curry's trip with Yvette Fielding to the Pleasure Beach in Blackpool on Blue Peter was very well regarded by viewers. After leaving Blue Peter in June 1989, Curry was offered another BBC 1 Saturday morning show but turned it down, feeling that he had done everything he wanted to do in children's television. =1990–present= Curry played the role of a TV host in a 1990 episode of the ITV drama London's Burning. He appeared in an episode of the BBC comedy series, Bread, and when Roy Castle became ill during the mid-1990s, Curry was asked to co present Record Breakers for the BBC. Curry played one of the two leading roles in the London West End production of The Woman in Black, in 1994 and starred in the centenary production of Charley's Aunt.

It is the illegal deposit of any waste onto land, including waste dumped or tipped on a site with no license to accept waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency developed a “profile” of the typical illegal dumper. Characteristics of offenders include local residents, construction and landscaping contractors, waste removers, scrap yard operators, and automobile and tire repair shops. Terminology Illegal dumping is typically distinguished from littering by the type and amount of material and/or the manner in which it is discarded. An example of littering could be throwing a cigarette on the ground. However, emptying a rubbish bin with no permission in a public or private area can be classified as illegal dumping. The term fly tipping is derived from the verb tip, meaning \\"to throw out of a vehicle\\", and on the fly, meaning \\"on the wing\\" – to throw away carelessly or casually.  Types of materials dumped  Illegally dumped tires on the side of the road. Illegal dumping involves the unauthorized disposal of numerous types of waste. Typical materials dumped include building materials from construction sites, such as drywall, roofing shingles, lumber, brick, concrete, and siding. Other frequently dumped materials include automobile parts, household appliances, household waste, furniture, yard scraps, and medical waste.  Causes of illegal dumping  The reasons people illegally dump vary; however, research indicates that lack of legal waste disposal options is a primary factor. A shortage of legal disposal options drives demand for waste removal service, increasing prices. Studies also have found unit pricing, which involves charging a set price per bag of garbage thrown out, may contribute to illegal dumping. Although the intent of unit pricing is to encourage people to use other forms of waste disposal such as recycling and composting, people may turn to disposing of waste in unauthorized areas to save money. Additionally, weak enforcement of laws prohibiting illegal dumping and a lack of public awareness regarding the environmental, health, and economic dangers of illegal dumping contribute.  Effects of illegal dumping  Effects of illegal dumping include health, environmental, and economic consequences. While legal waste disposal locations, such as landfills, are designed to contain waste and its byproducts from infiltrating the surrounding environment, illegal dumping areas do not typically incorporate the same safeguards. Due to this, illegal dumping may sometimes lead to pollution of the surrounding environment. Toxins or hazardous materials infiltrating soil and drinking water threaten the health of local residents. Additionally, illegal dump sites that catch fire pollute the air with toxic particles. Environmental pollution due to illegal dumping causes short-term and long-term health issues. Short-term issues include asthma; congenital illnesses; stress and anxiety; headaches, dizziness and nausea; and eye and respiratory infections. Long-term concerns include cancer and kidney; liver; respiratory; cardiovascular; brain; nervous; and lymphohematopoietic diseases. Beyond negative health outcomes due to pollution and toxic waste, illegal dumps pose a physical threat. Unstable piles of material and exposed nails threaten harm to humans, specifically children who may be attracted to illegal dumps as play areas. Illegal dumps also attract vermin and insects. Tires, a material frequently illegally disposed of as most municipalities ban their disposal in landfills, provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitos due to stagnant water collected within. Mosquitoes transfer life-threatening diseases, such as encephalitis and West Nile virus, to humans. Materials disposed of in illegal dumps, specifically tires and electronic waste, are combustible. Outbreaks of fire at illegal dump sites can lead to forest fires, causing erosion and destroying habitat. Illegal dumping also negatively affects surrounding property values. Unattractive and odorous accumulations of waste discourage commercial and residential developers from improving communities. Additionally, existing residents may have difficulty “taking pride” in their neighborhoods. In addition to decreasing property values and, therefore, tax revenue for governments, illegal dumping costs governments millions of dollars in clean up costs. In the United Kingdom, the Environmental Protection Agency spends £100–150 million annually to investigate and clean up illegal dump sites. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates several million in costs each year nationwide.  How to combat illegal dumping  Efforts to combat illegal dumping vary in each situation as solutions are crafted with specific community dynamics in mind. However, common approaches include a combination of limiting access to illegal dumping sites, surveillance, enforcement, and increasing access to legal waste disposal opportunities. Listed below are common techniques employed by governing bodies: = Limit access = The majority of illegal dumpers engage in illicit waste disposal at night, as darkness helps them avoid detection. Installing lighting around known or potential illegal dumping sites deters the practice. In Canada Bay, New South Wales, the city installed solar powered lights in dumping “hot spots”. Following installation of the lights, the city received fewer complaints regarding illegal dumping in those areas. Other methods of limiting access include re-landscaping and beautifying illegal dump sites. Adding aesthetic amenities such as grass, flowers, and benches demonstrates that the site is well maintained, discouraging dumpers. Additionally, increasing community use of the area will adjust locals’ perception of the site from dumping ground to valued open space. Adding barriers such as fencing, rocks, locked gates, and concrete blocks prevents offenders from accessing dump sites with their vehicles, completely deterring illegal dumping or reducing the volume of disposed materials. For example, Maitland, New South Wales erected fences around rural dumping sites prevented vehicles from gaining access. Continued monitoring 12 months later showed that 80% of dump sites protected by the fences experienced negligible illegal waste disposal activity. = Increase surveillance and enforcement = Sign in Ireland intended to deter illegal dumping, threatening a €3,000 fine. Increasing offenders’ risk of getting caught is also a way to combat illegal dumping. The most common way to accomplish this is through surveillance measures, such as video cameras. Camera footage can help law enforcement officials identify dumpers while also collecting data on peak dumping periods. Installation of fake cameras has also been shown to be a deterrent. Police patrols, helicopter and plane surveillance, and community surveillance are also options for increasing risk. Police presence generally deters illegal activity, while community surveillance depends upon residents reporting known illegal dumpers to law enforcement for a monetary reward. The cities of Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Oakland all implement similar reporting schemes.Glenroy, Victoria, Australia Surveillance camera. Cities can implement periodic compliance campaigns, which involve randomly conducted “crackdowns” by law enforcement. Increased police patrols, anti-dumping signage posted in known illegal disposal sites, random inspections of property, and publicity regarding convicted illegal dumpers and the use surveillance can deter illegal dumping. = Provide alternatives = Removing illegal dumpers’ reasons for improperly disposing of waste is also an option for governing bodies. Offenders often dump to save money. Cities can offer free or subsidized waste services to residents to encourage legal disposal. If free and subsidized programs are not feasible due to funding limitations, cities must ensure affordability of waste disposal services. Offering alternate disposal options like recycling and compost centers is also recommended. Giving fines or assigning liability for clean-up costs to those caught illegally disposing of waste can also act as a deterrent. Combating illegal dumping also involves promoting legal waste disposal avenues. Offering Kerbside collection and improving waste storage in high density residential areas provides residents with convenient trash disposal options. Communication of available services is important to the success of such programs. Offering similar accommodations for commercial and industrial waste generated by office buildings, restaurants, schools, and factories will also decrease instances of illegal dumping. Cities can also combat illegal dumping by offering disposal options for materials and substances banned from landfills, such as tires, toxic and hazardous waste, and medical waste. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends chipping or shredding tires so that they can be recycled in other uses such as highways, playgrounds, and running tracks.\\"Waste tire management\\" mass.gov. Retrieved 24 June 2018. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends disposing of household hazardous and toxic waste in the nearest community drop off location. For example, Boston, Massachusetts holds drop off days four times per year. Similar rules apply to disposal of medical waste. In Boston, officials recommend storing syringes in Sharps Containers and disposing in a designated community site. The city also recommends utilizing mail back services to dispose of used syringes.\\"Proper Use and Disposal of Waste and Syringes\\" mass.gov. Retrieved 24 June 2018. = Education = City governments can implement education campaigns to further mitigate illegal dumping. For example, cities can inform residents and businesses of legal waste disposal avenues through mailed flyers, newspaper and radio announcements, and posters. Posting signs near known illegal dumping sites can also help deter offenders. = Cleaning up existing dumps = According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, waste attracts more waste. Therefore, cleaning up existing illegal dumps is a helpful deterrent for additional illegal dumping. The United States Environmental Protection Agency instituted a program to cap open dumps in tribal communities. 1,100 of these dumps exist in the United States and pose health and environmental risks to the surrounding communities. The open dumps are closed off with a clay liner and soil depth accounting for infiltration and erosion. \\"Native dryland grass\\" is planted on top of the newly covered dump to prevent erosion and water monitoring wells are installed nearby.  Illegal dumping in Campania, Italy  The Triangle of death (Italy) in Campania, Italy is Europe's “largest illegal waste dump”. The area, which encompasses Italian municipalities Acerra, Marigliano, and Nola, experiences illegal waste disposal practices by the Camorra such as unauthorized burying of toxic waste under places frequented by humans. Frequent fires at dumping sites and illegal waste fires set by residents have resulted in contamination of the air and drinking water. Additionally, the land has deteriorated due to the illegal waste. The environmental pollution caused by the illegal dumping has resulted in elevated instances of cancer and cancer mortality in the region. In 2014 and 2015, the Italian government funded health screenings to track the rise in illnesses in Campania. Studies conducted using the data collected from these screenings found elevated instances of leukemia, lymphoma, and colorectal and liver cancer mortality in one of Campania's districts. The study attributed this increase in cancer and cancer mortality with toxic exposures from the illegal waste.  Electronic waste in China  Illegal dumping of electronic waste, or e-waste, presents environmental and health concerns in China. The informal e-waste sector recycles the majority of e-waste in China, which is supplied through consumption, importation, and production. Foreign governments often send e-waste to China as the informal sector offers cheaper recycling services. China is not only the “largest e-waste dumping site”, it also generates large amounts of e-waste. In 2006, China produced 1.3 kg of e-waste per capita. The informal e-waste sector lacks formal government oversight and pays its workers low wages while using recycling practices that expose both workers and the environment to toxic materials. Toxic substances are found in leachates, particulate matter, ashes, fumes, wastewater, and effluents generated during dumping, dismantling, and burning throughout the recycling process. Particles emitted are carried through the air and deposited nearby recycling centers and in surrounding areas. Leachates and wastewater infiltrate the soil, drinking water, livestock, and fish, exposing humans to toxic substances. In recent years, China has begun to address the informal e-waste sector. At the governmental level, improvements have been made to waste management practices through adoption of Western management schemes such as those found in Japan, the United States, and the European Union. Additionally, the Chinese government has invested in improved e-waste collection and processing. Locally, various Chinese cities have constructed “recycling industrial parks” where e-waste can be processed efficiently and without harm to the environment. Regulations on e-waste have been implemented in the Chinese regions of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsuprovince, Zhejiang province and Guangdong province. Corporations such as Nokia and Lenovo instituted free return services for Chinese customers who wish to dispose of old electronic products from the two companies. United Kingdom Rubbish disposal in the UK is heavily regulated, with most households having on average one 240 litre bin for recyclable waste and one similar bin of non recyclable waste every week; some areas have additional similar or smaller bins for garden, food, or specific recycling waste. Any large rubbish e.g. old furniture and mattresses - may need to be taken to the local waste depot by the home owner at their own expense, although many councils will collect certain items for free, or for a small fee. This leads to some people simply leaving their waste in open public spaces or untended public gardens. This is called fly tipping. In addition, commercial or industrial users may fly-tip to avoid waste handling charges, as will unofficial and unlicensed waste disposal firms. Taxes on landfill in the UK have led to illegal waste dumping. Materials illegally disposed of can range from green waste and domestic items to abandoned cars and construction waste, much of which may be hazardous or toxic. As the cost of disposing of household rubbish and waste increases, so does the number of individuals and businesses that fly-tip, and the UK government has made it easier for members of the public to report fly-tipping. The fine or punishment is normally defined by the local council that operates in the local area in which the rubbish was dumped. According to the BBC, fly- tipping costs councils in England and Wales more than £50m annually (2016). Open dumping Open dump by a rural lane in Tatsfield, Surrey, England Open dumps are locations where illegally dumped, abandoned piles of waste and debris are left in noticeable quantities. Fines are a common punishment for a person caught dumping at an open dump. Open dumps are commonly found in forests, backyards and abandoned buildings. Open dumps are sometimes removed shortly after they are created, but most will persist for an indefinite period of time when the site is situated in the wilderness or in public space without adequate public services.

It is located near a branch of the Trinity River. In Fort Worth, Tanglewood is known as a very safe neighborhood and is great for families. The neighborhood has bicycle paths, many parks, and is covered by many tall trees. History The Tanglewood neighborhood consists of land in the low areas along the branch of the Trinity River and is approximately five miles southwest from the Fort Worth Central Business District. The Tanglewood area lies within two surveys. The western part of the addition being part of the 1854 Felix G. Beasley Survey, and the eastern part, along the branch of the river, the 1876 James Howard Survey. The original approach to the Tanglewood area consisted of a two-rut dirt road which is now Bellaire Drive South. Up to the time of development, children enjoyed swimming in the river in a deep hole which was located where the bridge is now on Bellaire Drive South near Trinity Commons Shopping Center. The portions of Tanglewood which are now Bellaire Park Court, Marquette Court and Autumn Court were originally a dairy farm. Land use restrictions filed on the Tanglewood addition stipulate that all houses must be brick or stone, and have at least a two-car garage attached to the house. Even though this was ranch property, it also stated that no cows, horses or other livestock would be allowed on the property after developmentcitation needed. Neighborhood Description The heritage of the ranchland shows in the typical architecture of Tanglewood, the predominant being ranch style. Most of the homes are single story with a few two stories here and there. However, the architecture of the homes has changed significantly in recent years, with many new homes being built much larger than the original ones. The streets wind around generally following the contours of the river and the trees tower over all. This is good bottom land and very fertile. In heavy rains the area flooded before measures were taken to control the Clear Fork and branches of the Trinity River which run through the area. The bicycle-walking trail which meanders through Tanglewood is well used and enjoyed because of the shade and park setting. It typifies the relaxed atmosphere of this executive neighborhood. The bicycle trail was built originally by the City of Fort Worth in the early 1970s and expanded shortly thereafter with the leadership of Mrs. Margaret Rimmer - a prominent Fort Worth city council woman and resident of Tanglewood. The Tanglewood neighborhood children primarily attend Tanglewood Elementary which has long been the highest ranking elementary school in Fort Worth ISD. Tanglewood Elementary is located right across the park from the neighborhood and allows many families in Tanglewood to walk and bike with their children to school.

Private yacht Infanta was designed by Ted Geary and built by the Craig Shipbuilding Company in Long Beach, California for John Barrymore as a present to his wife, actress Dolores Costello. The keel was laid on 15 September 1929, launched on 16 January 1930 and named in honour of the couple's expected first child, Dee Dee Barrymore. The motor yacht was originally measured as 118 feet in length and with a tonnage of 253 GRT. Power was from two 275bhp Atlas-Imperial diesels driving twin propellers The Barrymores used the yacht sparingly, due to his preference for the simpler pleasures of his sailboat and his increasing alcoholism. By 18 July 1935 Infanta composed most of Barrymore's net worth, being assessed at $56,350 of his net $56,575. In 1937 the yacht, then valued at $75,000 was auctioned to satisfy a mortgage. The yacht was subsequently renamed Polaris by owners Edward and Kathryn Lowe of San Francisco and home-ported at Juneau, Alaska. Naval service Polaris was purchased by the United States Navy on 23 December 1940, converted for naval service by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Co. Inc., Winslow, Washington. The yacht was renamed Amber on 10 January 1941 and simultaneously designated Coastal Patrol Yacht PYc-6, then placed in commission at Seattle on 3 March 1941 with Lt. W. B. Combs in command. Amber was assigned to the Inshore Patrol of the 13th Naval District and, from May until early August, operated around Seattle, Tacoma, and Port Townsend, Washington. The patrol craft left Seattle on 6 August on a cruise to Alaska, and visited Ketchikan, Juneau, and Sitka, before returning to Seattle early in September. In November, Amber was assigned to patrol duty at Astoria, Oregon, and patrolled the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Neah Bay, Washington, under the control of the Northwest Sea Frontier Patrol Group. She was decommissioned on 18 October 1944 and her name was struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1944. Amber was sold back to her former owners on 13 June 1945. Return to civilian life Thea Foss on Lake Union, August 2019. Later in 1945 the yacht was sold to the Macco Construction Company of Clearwater, California and used as a freighter and for geological surveys, still as Amber. In 1950 she was purchased by the Foss Launch and Tug Company of Tacoma, Washington and restored there at their own shipyard as the company yacht, named for its founder Thea Foss. As of 2015, and now registered to Saltchuk Resources Inc, the parent company of Foss Maritime of Seattle, Thea Foss remains in service and has been used continually for the enjoyment of customers and other guests, including in 1975 King Olaf of Norway.

Xavier's was the first college to be granted autonomy by the University of Mumbai in 2010. In 2006, St. Xavier's was awarded the highest 'A+' grade by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The college is named after Francis Xavier, the 16th-century Spanish Jesuit saint. Its campus in South Mumbai is built in the Indo-Gothic style of architecture, and recognized as a heritage structure. Founded by German Jesuits in 1869, Xavier's developed rapidly from 1884 to 1914. The imprisonment of German Jesuit priests during the First World War (1914–1918) led to a dislocation of the administration, which was mitigated by the appointment of other European Jesuits. While it began as an arts college, by the 1920s science departments were established. The college was greatly expanded in the 1930s. The college is now run by Indian Jesuits, with a distinct focus on affirmative action for minority students. It offers undergraduate and post-graduate courses in Arts, Science, Business, Commerce or Public Policy. It has spawned several research institutions within its campus including the Blatter Herbarium, and is known for its inter-collegiate youth festival 'Malhar'. History Tombstone Tablet of Founders St. Xavier's College was founded on 2 January 1869 in Bombay by German Jesuits with only two students in attendance. The two students came from a group of six, who appeared for the University matriculation examination in 1868 from St. Mary's Institution. Swiss Jesuit (or Willy), the first principal of the college from 1869 to 1873, and three other Jesuits began lecturing and teaching at the college on 7 January 1869. The college was granted formal recognition by Bombay University on 30 January 1869. One student joined later in 1870. The first three students graduated in 1871. From 1884 to 1910, under the patronage of Principal Frederick Dreckmann, the college began to develop rapidly. The Blatter Herbarium was established in 1906 by the Swiss Jesuit priest Ethelbert Blatter and his associates. The hostel was completed in 1909, while the East- West science wing, costing Rs. 200,000, was completed in 1912. The Government provided grants of Rs. 70,000 and Rs. 37,000 for the two additional buildings of the college. The college first admitted women in 1912. Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Bombay (1923–1926), inaugurated the extension of the East-West science wing in 1926 Being a German institute in British India, the college suffered wide repercussions during the First World War (1914–1918). Following the outbreak of the war, the German Jesuit priests, mainly the older ones, were interned and detained in 1914 at the college villa in Khandala, where many died. However, the younger German Jesuits were repatriated in 1916. The departure of German Jesuits led to a dislocation in the administration of the college, but was mitigated by a few Swiss, Luxemburger, and English Jesuits. The number of lay professors increased following the withdrawal of the German Jesuits. In 1920, enrollment of students from outside Bombay, especially Calcutta, Yangon, Mangalore, and Sindh, started increasing. Subsequently, a third floor was added to the hostel to provide accommodation facilities for them. The college started offering six more languages: Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Arabic, Hebrew, and Portuguese. The Spanish Jesuits arrived in 1922. By the 1920s, the college had expanded its offerings to more than just liberal arts. Science departments such as Chemistry and Biology came to be established. The Spanish Jesuit Henry Heras founded the \\"Indian Historical Research Institute\\" in 1925. The extension of the East-West science wing was completed in 1925 and opened by Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Bombay (1923–1926), on 26 January 1926, at an outlay of Rs. 200,000. The following decade, the priest Gonzalo Palacios propelled massive architectural expansions, with the addition of a third floor to the East-West science wing and in April 1935 the demolition of the Chemistry shed. The General Library was shifted to the new central building providing space for over 100,000 books and 6,000 volumes of periodicals. The college took charge of the Abdulla Fazalbhoy Technical Institute for Radio and Cinema (now St. Xavier's Technical Institute) near Mahim Causeway. More rooms were added to the hostel together with a tower. The construction of the college chapel, which had begun in 1937, was completed under the reign of Principal Aloysius Coyne (1940–1949). The college hall was inaugurated in January 1937 by Lord Brabourne, Governor of Bombay (1933–1937). In August 1939, the non-degree course for the Teacher's Diploma was started, while Microbiology was revolutionized. After India's independence in 1947, Hindi began to be taught in the college from June 1949 and several new departments were instituted, such as the Department of Sociology and Anthropology (1951) and the Department of Psychology (1957). Barack Obama greeting students (2010) In the later 20th century, St. Xavier's has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of several research centers and programs. Indian Jesuits of the Bombay Province have run the college in close collaboration with the Society of Jesus in Germany and Spain. On 18 July 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited the college. She conducted an interactive session with its students regarding academics and education. In November 2010 US President Barack Obama visited the college and held a town hall meeting. Religious affiliation and ethos Francis Xavier, after whom the college is named A 1994 stamp dedicated to the 125th anniversary of St. Xavier's College The college is Roman Catholic and the Society of Jesus exercises responsibility over it through a Governing Body whose chairman is the Provincial of the Bombay Province of the Society. St. Xavier's College is named after Francis Xavier, a Spanish Jesuit saint of the 16th century who travelled to India and who is considered as the proponent of the Goa Inquisition. The college seeks to give an all-round formation, inculcating both human and spiritual values. It gives special consideration to Roman Catholics (under the minority rights enshrined in the Constitution of India) for whose education the college was founded. Currently 50% of the seats are reserved for Catholics. =Invocation= =Crest and motto= The crest was designed by Fr. T. Molina in 1929, a student of heraldry and a member of the college staff. It shows an eagle teaching its young to fly. Above it, on the left side is the emblem of the Society of Jesus, which consists of the first three Greek initials for \\"Jesus\\" set in a sun; on the right is a chequered moon, taken from the arms of the house of Xavier. The Latin motto Provocans Ad Volandum, \\"Challenging to Fly\\", is central to the ethos of the college and comes from the Bible, which mentions how the eagle encourages its young to fly (Dt 32.11). As a whole, the crest symbolizes a college that bears the name of Xavier and is run by the Jesuits, with the ideal of educating young men and women to aim high in life. Accreditation and assessment Since 30 January 1869, St. Xavier's College has been affiliated with the University of Mumbai. It is accredited by the University with the task of preparing students for degrees in Arts, Science, and Commerce. It was made a constituent college of the university in 1953 following the Bombay University Act 1953 and received recognition by the University Grants Commission (UGC) since 1956. In 2007, the college was awarded the highest rating A+ (5-Star) in the re-accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), an autonomous body linked to the University Grants Commission of India. The national India Today magazine report on colleges has consistently rated Xavier in the top 10 in India in recent years. In the June 2000 and June 2006 issues, Xavier has been rated the best arts college and the second best science and commerce college in the country. The UGC awarded St. Xavier's the \\"College with a Potential for Excellence\\" award in 2006. On 31 May 2010, St. Xavier's was granted autonomy by the University Grants Commission, thereby becoming only the second college in Mumbai to be granted such a status. Administration The Second Quadrangle Arches The Governing Body consists of the chairman, vice chairman, ex-officio trustees, members, the local managing committee, and an advisory council. The principal functions through the Academic Council of the three vice principals and other important officials, aided by the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) which is responsible for planning and evaluation of the college. Various committees of staff and students take responsibility for the different activities of the college. The Local Managing Committee (LMC) comprises nine members, including the principal as the secretary and rector as the chairperson, and meets twice every year. It prepares the budget and financial statements, recommends creation of new posts, recommends measures for academic and administrative improvement, and undertakes many other vital decision-making activities. The prospective plan for institutional development is done after consecutive meetings with the Academic Council, IQAC, and the heads of the departments. The college takes measures to upgrade the skills of non-teaching staff by conducting workshops and training programmes during vacations, and by conducting sessions on personality enhancement and financial management. An Advisory Council of eminent alumni has also been constituted. The college has 90 permanent teachers (of whom 53 are women) and an additional 3 full-time teachers, 11 part-time, and 2 teachers working as full-time on temporary assignment, raising the number of full-time teachers to 95. The teacher-student ratio is 1:33. Three teachers have been accorded special awards and recognition for their distinguished service. Courses As of 2007, the college remains mainly an undergraduate college, with 2648 undergraduate students and 99 postgraduate students. The syllabi for undergraduate and postgraduate courses are prepared by the University of Mumbai, and include mid-term tests and final examinations. The success rate of students is 90 to 100 percent across all departments, and 95 to 100 percent in university examinations. Special considerations are given to Catholics, economically and socially disadvantaged applicants, and students from Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Programs operated by the college include The Learning for Life Programme, Honours Programme, Social Involvement Programme, and Personality and Human Values. =Junior college courses= Junior college courses in science and arts last two years.

It is approved by the All India Council for Technical Education. XIMR was established in 1963 by Professor Pascoal Gisbert as St. Xavier's Social Institute of Industry, when India was striving to achieve self-sufficiency. In 1971 the Institute's focus shifted to supervisory and managerial skills and its name was changed to Xavier Institute of Management. In 2006 it became the Xavier Institute of Management and Research. XIMR trains managers with skills in doing business internationally and globally and facilitates entry into African markets. In January 2011, the Centre for Africa Studies was launched in association with Makerere University Business School in Uganda, East Africa. Campus and facilities The college is built in the Indo-Gothic style of architecture St. Xavier's stands on a campus in the Fort locality of South Mumbai. It is located near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) railway station, which serves as the headquarters of the Central Railways, and Churchgate station, which serves as the headquarters of the Western Railways. The college is built in the Indo-Gothic style of architecture, and has been recognized as a heritage structure by the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee. The main college library is central and common to all the academic activities of the college. It has a collection of 133,489 books, of which more than 50% are reference books, with some dating back to the 16th century. It also receives 76 journals, of which 14 are foreign journals. The library has a carved cabinet, card index of books, and a computerized database of books. Students have access to a lending library, reference library, paperback library, non- print media library, and a vast collection of journals, current and back volumes. Books are lent out at the lending library, which also houses the online public access catalog (OPAC) for information search. The reference library includes reserve counters, overnight loans, photo-copying services, reference services, inter-library loans, journals, reference books, and a special multi-media facility for accessing compact disks (CDs) on computers. Students also have access to a paperback library and a non-print media library where audio cassettes, television, and video cassette recorder (VCR) facilities are available for group and individual use. \\"The Woods\\" leisure space The campus also has a leisure space known as \\"The Woods\\" which includes a couple of large trees. The college runs a small hostel on campus for male students of the senior college. The hostel has a capacity of 60 students, two to three occupants to a room. The college also has a chapel cum prayer hall with green, stained-glass exteriors, arching vaults, and intricate marble work, behind the façade facing the college quadrangle. It has two fully equipped audio-visual centres, the Smith Centre for Audio-Visual Instruction (SCAVI), with a seating capacity of 100, and the Multi-Media Room (MMR) which seats 110. Classrooms have partially Information technology (IT) enabled accessories, fiberglass boards, and pull-down screens. A full-fledged language laboratory has also been set up to cater to students from non-English medium schools and to promote multi-language skills. There is also an auditorium, a spacious canteen, and full-size basketball and volleyball courts. The Fell Gymkhana, built in 1954, provides bodybuilding, badminton, table-tennis, carrom, chess, and other recreational facilities for staff and students. The St. Xavier's Villa in Khandala is a property of the college nestled in the hills of the Western Ghats mountain range, about two hours from Mumbai. It provides facilities for retreats, seminars, and educational conferences. The college also has a cricket pitch leased by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on the Azad Maidan sports ground, near the college. College chapel The college counselling centre, founded in 1954, provides personal counselling, personality-evaluation tests, testing programmes for vocational purposes, information on careers, professions, and specialized studies in India and abroad, information on scholarships and financial assistance schemes, and admission guidance to students; it also organizes orientation programmes. The college placement centre exposes students to reputed employers, trains them in writing resumes, and acquaints them with the selection process of corporations. There are separate common rooms for male and female students and for teaching and non-teaching staff. The Xavier's Women's Development Cell was formed in 2006 to coordinate programmes for awareness and action on women's issues, since girls constitute more than 60% of the student body. It also serves as a grievance redressal cell for complaints of sexual harassment. First aid centres are also available in the college general office and the counselling centre. The college undertakes a number of welfare measures for students and staff including provision of insurance coverage. The college has also set up a Grievance Redressal Cell with a representative from a Non-governmental Organization (NGO). =Films shot on the campus= *Kucch To Hai (2003) *Main Hoon Na (2004), in college library *Jaane Tu...

The Extra Curricular Credits Committee (ECC) monitors the performance of students and awards cedits to all students and sends contingents to other colleges. Malhar is the most famous festival of this college mostly held in 3 days in mid August. It starts with the Malhar Conclave which include programmes like Panel Discussion, Talk by a Keynote Speaker. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, HH Dalai Lama, Rakesh Sharma, Julio Reberio, Shashi Tharoor, Raghuram Rajan, Suresh Prabhu, Piyush Goyal, Sreenevasan Jain, Karuna Nandy were some of the speakers/panelists who addressed the audience on Malhar Conclaves. Other festivals include Ithaka, Zephyrus, JanFest, Antas also showcase the talent of Xavierites A platform known as Mosaic, which is an inter-disciplinary, interdepartmental activity of exhibitions and poster presentations, has also been set up. Students also organize hobby clubs like the \\"Philately Club\\" and the \\"Star Gazers Club\\" to pursue their individual interests. =Student associations= The Alumni Association, established in 1902, is actively involved in fundraising, providing scholarships, career counseling, and felicitation of the retiring staff. The Indian Music Group (IMG) was founded in 1973 to promote Indian Classical Music in the city, especially among its young people. It organises concerts, lecture-demonstrations and music appreciation courses. Its annual Indian classical music festival, Janfest, is well known. =Festivals= Malhar, one of the most popular college festivals in the city, is hosted by the students of St. Xavier's College. It is an inter-collegiate youth festival held since 1979. It is usually in August during the rains and involves teams from about 60 other colleges in Mumbai and elsewhere, with around 30 cultural contests in the Literary, Performing Arts, and Fine Arts categories, along with a number of Workshops on different themes. It draws about 20,000 student participants and audience to the college Campus. Janfest is a well-known Indian classical music festival in India, held in January and hosted by the Indian Music Group (IMG). Inaugurated in 1974, it promotes classical music among the youth and offers a platform for young people to showcase their talent. It has played host to maestros of Indian classical music like Hariprasad Chaurasia, Zakir Hussain, and Ravi Shankar. The Zephyrus conference is organised by the Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) department and features renowned speakers from the business world. Additionally, the college hosts Ithaka, the annual English literature and theatre festival organised by the English Literature department since 1990. It is a platform for students to demonstrate their theatrical talents. Theatre personalities such as Qasar Padamsee started their careers in Ithaka. The college also holds Aamod, a festival organised by Marathi Vangmay Mandal which is the first and the oldest Marathi Association registered with Mumbai University. In 2011–12, the Mass Media department organised Zeitgeist – The Media ConferenceZeitgeist . Zgconference.com. Retrieved on 17 August 2013. for the first time. It has welcomed panellists like Shekhar Kapoor and Madhu Trehan. It also organised a screening of the film The Untitled Kartik Krishnan Project. Then in 2012 Xavier hosted its first science fest \\"Paradigm\\", an all- Inclusive, pan-departmental, inter-collegiate science festival. Paradigm '12 hosted Vice Admiral Shekhar Sinha along with Sunjoy Monga, Ajoy Ghatak, and Raghavendra Gadagkar who delivered talks on a wide variety of topics. Magazines and publications The college launched its commemorative Coffee Table Book St. Xavier's College – Celebrating Diversity since 1869, as a part of its 140 years celebration. It covers all aspects of the college's mighty tradition, to the present. Each March and September Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture, within the college campus, publishes the research journal Indica. It began publication in 1964 and emphasizes the research work of staff and students at Heras Institute. Then there are the St. Xavier's College magazine and the online newsletter The Xavierite, covering stories, events, and reports related to the college and its alumni. Student magazines include Ithaka (Literature), Aithihasik (History), Vox Populi (Political Science), Eidos (Sociology), Imprint (Zoology), \\"Lignum vitae (Life Science) The Catchphrase (Mass Media),The Michronicle (Microbiology), Pakharan (Marathi Vangmay Mandal), B.I.T.M.A.P (Information Technology) and Arthniti (Economics). A monthly newspaper The Xavier's Press was inaugurated in December 2008 by the Student Council and is run entirely by undergraduates. It covers events and issues of interest to the general student body.

That latter contains the Opisthokonta, which includes the Fungi, Animals and the Choanomonada, or Choanoflagellates. The taxonomic affinities of the members of this clade were originally described and proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2002. The International Society of Protistologists, the recognised body for taxonomy of protozoa, recommended in 2012 that the term Unikont be changed to Amorphea because the name \\"Unikont\\" is based on a hypothesized synapomorphy that the ISP authors and other scientists later rejected. It includes amoebozoa, opisthokonts, and possibly Apusozoa. Taxonomic revisions within this group Cavalier-Smith has proposed two new phyla: Sulcozoa, which consists of the subphyla Apusozoa (Apusomonadida and Breviatea), and Varisulca, which includes the subphyla Diphyllatea, Discocelida, Mantamonadidae, Planomonadida and Rigifilida. The validity of this proposed taxonomy has yet to be ruled upon by the Society of Protistologists. Further work by Cavalier-Smith has shown that Sulcozoa is paraphyletic. Apusozoa also appears to be paraphyletic. Varisulca has been redefined to include planomonads, Mantamonas and Collodictyon. A new taxon has been created - Glissodiscea - for the planomonads and Mantamonas. Again, the validity of this revised taxonomy awaits confirmation. Amoebozoa seems to be monophyletic with two major branches: Conosa and Lobosa. Conosa is divided into the aerobic infraphylum Semiconosia (Mycetozoa and Variosea) and secondarily anaerobic Archamoebae. Lobosa consists entirely of non-flagellated lobose amoebae and has been divided into two classes: Discosea, which have flattened cells, and Tubulinea, which has predominantly tube-shaped pseudopodia. Clade The group includes eukaryotic cells that, for the most part, have a single emergent flagellum, or are amoebae with no flagella. The unikonts include opisthokonts (animals, fungi, and related forms) and Amoebozoa. By contrast, other well-known eukaryotic groups, which more often have two emergent flagella (although there are many exceptions), are often referred to as bikonts. Bikonts include Archaeplastida (plants and relatives) and SAR supergroup, the Cryptista, Haptista, Telonemia and picozoa. Characteristics The unikonts have a triple-gene fusion that is lacking in the bikonts. The three genes that are fused together in the unikonts, but not bacteria or bikonts, encode enzymes for synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides: carbamoyl phosphate synthase, dihydroorotase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase. This must have involved a double fusion, a rare pair of events, supporting the shared ancestry of Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. Cavalier-Smith originally proposed that unikonts ancestrally had a single flagellum and single basal body. This is unlikely, however, as flagellated opisthokonts, as well as some flagellated Amoebozoa, including Breviata, actually have two basal bodies, as in typical 'bikonts' (even though only one is flagellated in most unikonts). This paired arrangement can also be seen in the organization of centrioles in typical animal cells. In spite of the name of the group, the common ancestor of all 'unikonts' was probably a cell with two basal bodies.

These two characteristics of an interlanguage result in the system's unique linguistic organization. An interlanguage is idiosyncratically based on the learners' experiences with the L2. It can \\"fossilize\\", or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. The interlanguage rules are claimed to be shaped by several factors, including L1-transfer, previous learning strategies, strategies of L2 acquisition (i.e., simplification), L2 communication strategies (i.e., circumlocution), and overgeneralization of L2 language patterns. Interlanguage is based on the theory that there is a dormant psychological framework in the human brain that is activated when one attempts to learn a second language. Interlanguage theory is often credited to Larry Selinker, who coined the terms \\"interlanguage\\" and \\"fossilization.\\" Uriel Weinreich is credited with providing the foundational information that was the basis of Selinker's research. Selinker (1972) noted that in a given situation, the utterances produced by a learner are different from those native speakers would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning. This comparison suggests the existence of a separate linguistic system. This system can be observed when studying the utterances of the learner who attempts to produce meaning in their L2 speech; it is not seen when that same learner performs form-focused tasks, such as oral drills in a classroom. Interlanguage can be variable across different contexts; for example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one domain than in another. To study the psychological processes involved one can compare the interlanguage utterances of the learner with two things: #Utterances in the native language (L1) to convey the same message produced by the learner. #Utterances in the target language (L2) to convey the same message, produced by a native speaker of that language. It is possible to apply an interlanguage perspective to a learner's underlying knowledge of the target language sound system (interlanguage phonology), grammar (morphology and syntax), vocabulary (lexicon), and language-use norms found among learners (interlanguage pragmatics). By describing the ways in which learner language conforms to universal linguistic norms, interlanguage research has contributed greatly to our understanding of linguistic universals in second-language acquisition.  Background  Before the interlanguage hypothesis rose to prominence, the principal theory of second-language (L2) development was contrastive analysis. This theory assumed that learners' errors were caused by the difference between their L1 and L2. This approach was deficit-focused, in the sense that speech errors were thought to arise randomly and should be corrected. A further assumption followed that a sufficiently thorough analysis of the differences between learners' first and second languages could predict all of the difficulties they would face. This assumption was not based in rigorous analysis of learner language but rather was often anecdotal, and researchers' claims were prone to confirmation bias. Robert Lado (1957) held that the claims of contrastive analysis should be viewed as hypothetical unless and until they were based on systematic analyses of learner speech data. Around this time, second-language acquisition research shifted from hypotheses of language learning and the development of language-teaching materials to the systematic analysis of learner speech and writing with the practice of error analysis. Although this was initially done to validate the claims of contrastive analysis, researchers found that many learner behaviours could not be easily explained by transfer from learners' L1 to their L2. The idea that language learners' linguistic systems were different from both their L1 and L2 was developed independently at around the same time by several different researchers. William Nemser called it an approximative system and Pit Corder called it transitional competence.  Variability  Interlanguage is claimed to be a language in its own right. Learner language varies much more than native-speaker language. Selinker noted that in a given situation the utterances produced by the learner are different from those native speakers would produce had they attempted to convey the same meaning. This comparison reveals a separate linguistic system. Interlanguage can be observed to be variable across different contexts. For example, it may be more accurate, complex and fluent in one discourse domain than in another. Variability is observed when comparing the utterances of the learner in conversation to form- focused tasks, such as memory-based oral drills in a classroom. Spontaneous conversation is more likely to involve the use of interlanguage. A learner may produce a target-like variant (e.g. 'I don't') in one context and a non-target like variant (e.g. 'me no') in another. Scholars from different traditions have taken opposing views on the importance of this phenomenon. Those who bring a Chomskyan perspective to second-language acquisition typically regard variability as nothing more than performance errors, and not worthy of systematic inquiry. On the other hand, those who approach it from a sociolinguistic or psycholinguistic orientation view variability as an inherent feature of the learner's interlanguage. In these approaches, a learner's preference for one linguistic variant over another can depend on social (contextual) variables such as the status or role of the person the learner is speaking to. Preference can also be based on linguistic variables such as the phonological environment or neighboring features marked for formality or informality. Variability in learner language distinguishes between \\"free variation\\", which has not been shown to be systematically related to accompanying linguistic or social features, and \\"systematic variation\\", which has. = Free variation = Free variation in the use of a language feature is usually taken as a sign that it has not been fully acquired. The learner is still trying to figure out what rules govern the use of alternate forms. This type of variability seems to be most common among beginning learners, and may be entirely absent among the more advanced. = Systematic variation = Systematic variation is brought about by changes in the linguistic, psychological, and social context. Linguistic factors are usually extremely local. For example, in earlier stages of acquisition, a learner will often display systematic constraints on their ability to use the correct tense. They may say \\"Last year we travel to the ocean\\" rather than \\"Last year we travelled to the ocean.\\" They also tend to make more mistakes when the word following a tensed word begins with a consonant (e.g., burned bacon). But they will show higher accuracy when the word following the tensed word begins with a nonconsonant (e.g., burned eggs). = Other factors = Social factors may include a change in register or the familiarity of interlocutors. In accordance with communication accommodation theory, learners may adapt their speech to either converge with, or diverge from, their interlocutor's usage. For example, they may deliberately choose to address a non-target form like \\"me no\\" to an English teacher in order to assert identity with a non-mainstream ethnic group. The most important psychological factor is usually regarded as attention to form, which is related to planning time. The more time that learners have to plan, the more target-like their production may be. Thus, literate learners may produce much more target-like forms in a writing task for which they have 30 minutes to plan, than in conversation where they must produce language with almost no planning at all. The impact of alphabetic literacy level on an L2 learner's ability to pay attention to form is as yet unclear. Affective factors also play an important role in systematic variation. For example, learners in a stressful situation (such as a formal exam) may produce fewer target-like forms than they would in a comfortable setting. This clearly interacts with social factors, and attitudes toward the interlocutor and topic also play important roles.  Stages of development  Individuals learning a second language may not always hear spoken L2 words as separate units. Some words might blend together and become a single unit in the learner's L2 system. The blended words are called \\"prefabricated patterns\\" or \\"chunks\\". These chunks are often not immediately obvious to the learner or anyone that listens to them speak, but may be noticed as the learner's L2 system becomes more developed and they use the chunk in a context where it does not apply. For example, if an English learner hears sentences beginning with \\"do you\\", they may associate it with being an indicator of a question but not as two separate words. To them, the word is \\"doyou\\". They may happen to say \\"What do you doing?\\" instead of \\"What are you doing?\\" Eventually the learner will learn to break the chunk up in to its component words and use them correctly. When learners experience significant restructuring in their L2 systems, they sometimes show a U-shaped learning pattern. For instance, a group of English language learners moved, over time, from accurate usage of the \\"-ing\\" present progressive morpheme, to incorrectly omitting it, and finally, back to correct usage. Occasionally the period of incorrect usage is seen as a learning regression. However, it is likely that when the learners first acquired the new \\"-ing\\" morpheme or \\"chunk\\", they were not aware of all of the rules that apply to its use. As their knowledge of tense in English expanded, this disrupted their correct usage of the morpheme. They eventually returned to correct usage when they gained greater understanding of the tense rules in English. These data provide evidence that the learners were initially producing output based on rote memory of individual words containing the present progressive \\"-ing\\" morpheme. However, in the second stage their systems contained the rule that they should use the bare infinitive form to express present action, without a separate rule for the use of \\"-ing\\". Finally, they learned the rule for appropriate use of \\"-ing\\". The \\"chunking\\" method enables a learner to practice speaking their L2 before they correctly break the chunk up in to its component parts. According to interlanguage theory, this seeming progression and regression of language learning is an important and positive manifestation of the learner's developing understanding of the grammar of the target language.  Fossilization  An interlanguage can fossilize, or cease developing, in any of its developmental stages. Fossilization is the process of 'freezing' of the transition between the L1 and L2, and is regarded as the final stage of interlanguage development. It can occur even in motivated learners who are continuously exposed to their L2 or have adequate learning support. Reasons for this phenomenon may be due to complacency or inability to overcome the obstacles to acquiring native proficiency in the L2. Fossilization occurs often in adult language learners. It can also occur when a learner succeeds in conveying messages with their current L2 knowledge. The need to correct the form/structure is therefore not present. The learner fossilizes the form instead of correcting it.  Linguistic universals  Research on universal grammar (UG) has had a significant effect on second-language acquisition (SLA) theory. In particular, scholarship in the interlanguage tradition has sought to show that learner languages conform to UG at all stages of development. Interlanguage UG differs from native UG in that interlanguage UGs vary greatly in mental representations from one L2 user to another. This variability arises from differing relative influences on the interlanguage UG, such as existing L1 knowledge and UG constraints. An example of a UG constraint is an \\"island constraint,\\" where the wh-phrase in a question has a finite number of possible positions. Island constraints are based on the concept that there are certain syntactical domains within a sentence that act as phrase boundaries. It is theorized that the same constraints that act on a native UG are also often present in an interlanguage UG.  Versus creoles and pidgins  The concept of interlanguage is closely related to other types of language, especially creoles and pidgins. Each of these languages has its own grammar and phonology. The difference is mostly one of variability, as a learner's interlanguage is spoken only by the learner and changes frequently as they become more proficient in the language. In contrast, creoles and pidgins are generally the product of groups of people in contact with another language, and therefore may be more stable.

Ayer & Son was a Philadelphia advertising agency founded in 1869. It called itself the oldest advertising agency in the United States. Named by Francis Ayer after his father N. W. Ayer, it ventured into advertising in 1884. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as De Beers, AT&T; and the U.S. Army. The company started to decline in the 1960s and, after a series of mergers,other options considered included a partnership with Dentsu. closed in 2002 with its assets sold to the Publicis Groupe. Early history N. W. Ayer & Son was founded in Philadelphia in 1869 by 21-year-old Francis Ayer, who named the agency after his father, N. W. Ayer. N. W. Ayer & Son started its business by representing religious weekly newspapers. By 1877, N. W. Ayer & Son had become successful enough to obtain what remained of another agency, the Volney Palmer Agency. In 1884, Ayer expanded into the advertising business. Ayer styled itself the oldest advertising firm in the U.S. In 1892, artists and writers began working in groups known as creative teams. Eventually Ayer became responsible for some of the most recognized slogans in advertising history. Gerold M. Lauck was president of Ayer in the 1930s. Notable slogans *When it rains it pours, advertising salt for Morton Salt, coined in 1912. *I'd walk a mile for a Camel, advertising Camel cigarettes for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, coined in 1921. Sometimes formed into a jingle, I'd walk a mile for a mild, mild Camel.http://www.unlikelystories.org/pdfs/commercial_fiction_pp_84-168.pdf *A diamond is forever, advertising diamonds for De Beers, coined in 1947 by Mary Frances Gerety. *Reach out and touch someone, advertising long-distance telephone service for AT&T; Corp., coined in 1979 by Anthony (Tony) P. Galli and Stanley Lomas. Music composed by David Lucas. *We may be the only phone company in town, but we try not to act like it, advertising phone services for AT&T;, coined by Tony Galli. *Today's army wants to join you, advertising military service for the U.S. Army. *Be all you can be, advertising military service for the U.S. Army, coined in 1981 by E. N. J. Carter. De Beers N. W. Ayer & Son created one of the most recognized slogans of the 20th century, A diamond is forever. Harry Oppenheimer of De Beers and Ayer president Gerold M. Lauck discussed a marketing campaign in 1938 that would change the falling price of diamonds at the time. The idea of engagement rings decorated with diamonds wasn't very popular in Europe, but interest in diamonds was high in the U.S. Because of this, Oppenheimer decided to promote the idea in the U.S. and told Lauck that, if Ayer's plan was successful, De Beers would have Ayer become the exclusive agency for its American interests. Ayer was motivated to propose that its campaign should move the American spending demographic towards larger and more expensive diamonds. To successfully achieve its goal, Ayer suggested a reinforcement of the relationship of diamonds with love and romance. This proved successful, as both men and women were caught in the relationship of diamonds being a gift of love. The slogan created for De Beers remained memorable for many years. AT&T; In 1906, Ayer was commissioned by the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to create an advertising campaign for AT&T; Corp. Ayer's successful campaign began with the AT&T; ad Twenty million voices, appearing in June, with four more appearing in the following months. Due to the campaign's success, AT&T; made Ayer its main advertising agency. This relationship continued until the 1970s and became one of the oldest advertising relationships in America. Ayer created the slogan Reach out and touch someone, one of AT&T;'s most successful ads, coined in 1979 by Tony Galli and Stanley Lomas; music was composed by David Lucas. Galli's original phrasing was: To communicate is the beginning of understanding. Reach out and touch someone. Decline In the late 1960s, Ayer faced challenges from industry changes as smaller agencies began creating ads appealing to targeted groups of consumers. This method focused agency attention on single demographics and could be performed faster by smaller agencies rather than traditional larger agencies. Ayer's standing dropped to tenth place among major agencies in one report. In 1982, it called itself the 14th largest advertising agency in the U.S. In 1986, Ayer received positive feedback for its U.S. Army recruiting slogan, Be all that you can be. This campaign benefited the army's recruitment goals greatly, and also faced negative responses toward the Vietnam War and low enlistment. In a well- published scandal, charges were filed against the Ayer employee responsible for the Army collaboration, and Ayer was consequently suspended from making bids with any branches of government.

Retrieved May 27, 2013 The Army account loss struck Ayer hard. Ayer strengthened its business by obtaining an account with the Burger King Corporation but lost the account after 18 months. Ayer also desperately tried to keep the AT&T; Corp. account, but AT&T; parted ways around the same time despite its long history with Ayer. Merger Due to the Army scandal, Ayer began to struggle, and its importance gradually faded. In 1996 Ayer became part of MacManus Group after merging with D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. Three years later, Ayer CEO Mary Lou Quinlan stepped down to form a new unit within MacManus and was replaced by Mary Beth Casey. Under MacManus, Ayer was merged with Leo Group and Dentsu to form Bcom3. In 2002, Bcom3 retired the Ayer name and merged it into the thriving Kaplan Thaler Group, where Ayer's stalwart client, Continental Airlines, took flight again. Bcom3 Chairman and CEO Roger Haupt said, \\"Retiring the venerable N. W. Ayer name wasn't easy .... It is more about the Kaplan name .... We're in a situation where we have an excellent agency in Kaplan Thaler and at the end of the day that's the right thing to do.\\" \\"Ayer\\" remained one of the most recognized names in advertising; other agencies approximately as old as Ayer are overshadowed by Ayer's legacy. Ayer's assets were bought by the Publicis Groupe in Paris, which closed down the Ayer offices in 2002. In 2005, the N. W. Ayer Philadelphia building was purchased and has been made into The Ayer, a luxury condominium.

X-Jet viewed from the side The Williams X-Jet, created by Williams International, was a small, single-person, light-weight, Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft powered by a modified Williams F107 turbofan aircraft engine designated WR-19-7 after some minor modifications. The vehicle was nicknamed \\"The Flying Pulpit\\" for its shape. It was designed to carry one operator and to be controlled by leaning in the direction of desired travel and by modulating engine output power. It could move in any direction, accelerate rapidly, hover and rotate on its axis, stay aloft for up to 45 minutes and travel at speeds up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). It was evaluated by the United States Army in the 1980s, but was deemed inferior to the capabilities of helicopters and small, unmanned aircraft, and so the development of the X-Jet was discontinued. Other VTOL systems developed by Williams International included a jet-powered flying belt, developed in 1969, which was powered by a Williams WR19 turbofan, and X-Jet's predecessor, the WASP I (Williams Aerial Systems Platform), which was developed in the 1970s and was powered by the more powerful WR19-9 BRP5, rated at 670 lbf (2.98 kN) thrust and a specific fuel consumption of 0.47 lb/lbf·h (13.31 g/kN·s). was issued for the Williams X-Jet. Technical information and drawings are available at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The WASP II uses a slightly modified and derated version of the WR-19-A7D, yielding 600 lbf thrust from its micro turbofan engine and is designated WR19-7, rated at 570 lbf thrust, after minor modifications and said derating. Modifications to the WR-19-A7D included accessories — replacement of pyro starter with electric/air start — and exhaust system modifications. No internal modifications to the counter-rotating micro turbofans were performed. The first manned, untethered flight was conducted in April 1980.

It was formed, by Yagnapurushdas (Shastriji Maharaj), on the principle that Swaminarayan was to remain present on earth through a lineage of gurus dating all the way back to Gunatitanand Swami – one of Swaminarayan's most prominent disciples. Based on the Akshar Purushottam doctrine (also known as Akshar-Purushottam Darshan), followers of BAPS believe Swaminarayan manifests through a lineage of Aksharbrahman Gurus, beginning with Gunatitanand Swami, followed by Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, and presently Mahant Swami Maharaj. As of 2019, BAPS has 44 shikharbaddha mandirs and more than 1,200 mandirs worldwide that facilitate practice of this doctrine by allowing followers to offer devotion to the murtis of Swaminarayan, Gunatitanand Swami, and their successors. BAPS mandirs also feature activities to foster culture and youth development. Many devotees view the mandir as a place for transmission of Hindu values and their incorporation into daily routines, family life, and careers. BAPS also engages in a host of humanitarian and charitable endeavors through BAPS Charities, a separate non-profit aid organization which has spearheaded a number of projects around the world addressing healthcare, education, environmental causes, and community-building campaigns. Mandirs The mandir, known as a Hindu place of worship, serves as a hub for the spiritual, cultural, and humanitarian activities of BAPS. As of 2019, the organization has 44 shikharbaddha mandirs and more than 1,200 other mandirs spanning five continents. In the tradition of the Bhakti Movement, Swaminarayan and his spiritual successors began erecting mandirs to provide a means to uphold proper devotion to God on the path towards moksha, or ultimate liberation. BAPS mandirs thus facilitate devotional commitment to the Akshar- Purushottam Darshan, in which followers strive to reach the spiritually perfect state of Aksharbrahman, or the ideal devotee, thereby gaining the ability to properly worship Purushottam, the Supreme Godhead. =Mandir rituals= The offering of bhakti, or devotion to God, remains at the center of mandir activities. In all BAPS Swaminarayan mandirs, murtis, or sacred images of Swaminarayan, Gunatitanand Swami, BAPS gurus and other deities, are enshrined in the inner sanctum. After completion of prana pratishta or life- force installation ceremonies, the deities are believed to reside in the murtis, and are thus subjects of direct worship through sacred daily rituals. In many mandirs, murtis are adorned with clothes and ornaments and devotees come to perform darshan, the act of worshiping the deity by viewing the sacred image. Aarti, which is a ritual of waving lit lamps in circular motions to illuminate the different parts of the murti while singing a song of praise, is performed five times daily in shikharbaddha mandirs and twice daily in smaller mandirs. Additionally, food is offered to the murtis amidst the singing of devotional songs three times a day as part of the ritual of thaal, and the sanctified food is then distributed to devotees. Daily readings of and discourses on various Hindu scriptures also take place in the mandir. Many mandirs are also home to BAPS swamis, or monks. On weekends, assemblies are held in which swamis and devotees deliver discourses on a variety of spiritual topics. During these assemblies, bhakti is offered in the form of call-and- response hymns (kirtans) with traditional musical accompaniment. Religious assemblies also take place for children and teenagers of various age ranges. Throughout the year, mandirs celebrate traditional Hindu festivals. Assemblies with special discourses, kirtans, and other performances are arranged to commemorate Rama Navami, Janmashtami, Diwali, and other major Hindu holidays. Members of the sect are known as Satsangis. Male Satsangis are generally initiated by obtaining a kanthi at the hands of a swamis or senior male devotee while females receive the vartman from the senior women followers. =Mandir activities= Mahant Swami Maharaj performing the arti In addition to being focal points of religious activity, BAPS mandirs are also centers of culture. Many forms of traditional Indian art have their roots in Hindu scriptures and have been preserved and flourished in the setting of mandirs. Many BAPS mandirs outside of India hold Gujarati classes to facilitate scriptural study, instruction in traditional dance forms in preparation for performances in festival assemblies, and music classes where students are taught how to play traditional instruments such as tabla. Devotees view the mandir as a place for transmission of knowledge of Hindu values and their incorporation into daily routines, family life, and careers. Apart from classes teaching about religion and culture, mandirs are also the site of activities focused on youth development. Many centers organize college preparatory classes, leadership training seminars and workplace skills development workshops. Centers often host women's conferences aimed at empowering women. They also host sports tournaments and initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles among children and youth. Many centers also host parenting seminars, marriage counseling, and events for family bonding. BAPS mandirs and cultural centers serve as hubs of several humanitarian activities powered by local volunteers. Mandirs in the US and UK host an annual walkathon to raise funds for local charities such as hospitals or schools. Centers also host annual health fairs where needy members of the community can undergo health screenings and consultations. During weekend assemblies, physicians are periodically invited to speak on various aspects of preventative medicine and to raise awareness on common conditions. In times of disaster, centers closest to the affected area become hubs for relief activity ranging from providing meals to reconstructing communities. =Notable mandirs= The founder of BAPS, Shastriji Maharaj, built the first mandir in Bochasan, Gujarat, which led the organization to be known as \\"Bochasanwasi\\" (of Bochasan). The organization's second mandir was built in Sarangpur, which also hosts a seminary for BAPS swamis. The mandir in Gondal was constructed around the Akshar Deri, the cremation memorial of Gunatitanand Swami, who is revered as a manifestation of Aksharbrahman. Shastriji Maharaj constructed his last mandir on the banks of the River Ghela in Gadhada, where Swaminarayan resided for the majority of his adult life. Yogiji Maharaj constructed the mandir in the Shahibaug section of Ahmedabad, which remains the site of the international headquarters of the organization. Under the leadership of Pramukh Swami Maharaj, over 25 additional shikharbaddha mandirs have been built across Gujarat and other regions of India and abroad. As a consequence of the Indian emigration patterns, mandirs have been constructed in Africa, Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The BAPS mandir in Neasden, London was the first traditional Hindu mandir built in Europe. The organization has six shikharbaddha mandir's in North America in the metro areas of Houston, Chicago, Atlanta, Toronto, Los Angeles, and in the New Jersey suburb of Robbinsville Township, near Trenton, New Jersey. BAPS has constructed two large temple complexes dedicated to Swaminarayan called Swaminarayan Akshardham, in New Delhi and Gandhinagar, Gujarat, which in addition to a large stone-carved mandir has exhibitions that explain Hindu traditions and Swaminarayan history and values. BAPS is constructing a Hindu stone temple in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of United Arab Emirates, on 55,000 square metres of land. Projected to be completed by 2021, and open to people of all religious backgrounds, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the foundation stone-laying ceremony in the UAE, which is home to over three million people of Indian origin. History =Doctrinal origins (1799–1905)= Formation The history of BAPS as an organization begins with Shastriji Maharaj's desire to propagate the mode of worship from Swaminarayan's teachings. During Swaminarayan's own time, his group's spread had been curbed by opposition from Vaishnava sampradayas and others hostile to Swaminarayan's bhakti teachings. Due to the hostility of those who found Swaminarayan's growing popularity and teachings unacceptable, swamis and devotees during Swaminarayan's time tempered some of the public presentation of his doctrine, despite their own convictions, to mitigate violence towards their newly formed devotional community. The original doctrine taught by Swaminarayan continued to be conveyed in less public fora, but with the passage of time, Shastriji Maharaj sought to publicly reveal this doctrine, which asserted that Swaminarayan and his choicest devotee, Gunatitanand Swami, were ontologically, Purushottam and Akshar, respectively. However, when Shastriji Maharaj began openly discoursing about this doctrine, hereafter the Akshar-Purushottam doctrine, he was met with opposition from some quarters within the Vadtal diocese. As the opposition against him grew violent, Shastriji Maharaj was left with no choice but to leave Vadtal to escape violent physical assaults. Thus, Williams notes, the very basis for separation from the Vadtal diocese and raison d’être for the formation of BAPS was this doctrinal issue. Revelation of doctrine Murtis of Akshar Purushottam, Bochasan Swaminarayan is viewed as God (Purushottam) by BAPS followers. Thus, his writings and discourses form the foundation for BAPS' theological tenets. Regarding Swaminarayan's philosophy, Akshar plays a fundamental role in the overall scheme of ultimate liberation. To that end, Swaminarayan indicated that those who wish to offer pure devotion to God (Purushottam) and are desirous of Moksha should imbibe the qualities of the Gunatit Guru [Satsangijivanam Volume IV/72:1,2]. As Akshar, embodied as the Gunatit Guru, epitomizes ideal devotion transcending maya. Swaminarayan's philosophical stand that liberation is unattainable unless one \\"identifies oneself with Akshar (a synonym of Brahman) and offers the highest devotion to Purushottam\\" is also found in various Hindu scriptures [Mundaka Upanishad 3/2:9, Shrimad Bhagavatam I/1:1, Bhagvad Gita XVIII/54]. It follows that the doctrine that Shastriji Maharaj propagated, as Kim observes, \\"did not result in the rejection of any scriptures; instead, it was the beginning of a distinctive theology which added a single but powerful qualification, [that Akshar plays] in the form of the living guru\\". BAPS devotees also believe that Swaminarayan propagated the same doctrine through the mandirs he built. From 1822 to 1828, Swaminarayan constructed a total of six shikharbaddha mandirs in Gujarat; in each he installed the murtis of a principal deity coupled with their ideal devotee in the central shrine: Nar-Narayan-Dev in Ahmedabad (1822) and Bhuj (1823), Lakshmi-Narayan-Dev in Vadtal (1824), Madan-Mohan-Dev in Dholera (1826), Radha-Raman-Dev in Junagadh (1828), and Gopi-Nathji in Gadhada (1828). As Kim notes, \\"For BAPS devotees, the dual murtis in the original Swaminarayan temples imply that Swaminarayan did install a murti of himself alongside the murti of his ideal bhakta or Guru\\". Thus, Shastriji Maharaj, was simply extending that idea by enshrining the murti of Swaminarayan along with Gunatitanand Swami, his ideal devotee, in the central sanctum. However, many within the Vadtal and Ahmedabad dioceses did not subscribe to this view, and this became one of the main points of disagreement that led to the schism. Shastriji Maharaj explained that as per Swaminarayan's teachings, God desired to remain on earth through a succession of enlightened gurus. In many of his discourses in the Vachanamrut (Gadhada I-71, Gadhada III-26 and Vadtal 5) Swaminarayan explains that there forever exists a Gunatit Guru (perfect devotee) through whom Swaminarayan manifests on earth for the ultimate redemption of jivas. Shastriji Maharaj noted that Swaminarayan had \\"expressly designated\\" the Gunatit Guru to spiritually guide the satsang (spiritual fellowship) while instructing his nephews to help manage the administration of the fellowship within their respective dioceses. Numerous historical accounts and texts written during Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami's time period identify Gunatitanand Swami as the embodiment of Akshar. Followers of BAPS believe that the Ekantik dharma that Swaminarayan desired to establish is embodied and propagated by the Ekantik Satpurush – the Gunatit Guru. The first such guru in the lineage was Gunatitanand Swami. Shastriji Maharaj had understood from his own guru, Bhagatji Maharaj, that Gunatitanand Swami was the first Gunatit Guru in the lineage. Historically, each Gunatit Guru in the lineage has continued to reveal his successor; Gunatitanand Swami revealed Pragji Bhakta (Bhagatji Maharaj), who in turn revealed Shastriji Maharaj, who pointed to Yogiji Maharaj, who revealed Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the Guru, thus continuing the lineage of Akshar. Most recently, Pramukh Swami Maharaj revealed Mahant Swami Maharaj as the next and current Guru in the lineage. Propagation of doctrine by Bhagatji Maharaj 307x307px Bhagatji Maharaj, born Pragji Bhakta, was originally a householder disciple of Gopalanand Swami. He was instructed to seek the company of Gunatitanand Swami if he desired to attain the gunatit state. As he associated with Gunatitanand Swami, he began spending more time in Junagadh and obeyed every command from his new guru. He wanted to renounce the world and become an ascetic but he was told not to. Bhagatji Maharaj over time came to believe that the doctrine of Akshar-Purushottam was the true doctrine propagated by Swaminarayan. In 1883, Shastriji Maharaj met Bhagatji Maharaj in Surat. Recognizing Bhagatji Maharaj's spiritual caliber, Shastriji Maharaj began spending increasing amounts of time listening to Bhagatji Maharaj's discourses, and soon, he accepted Bhagatji Maharaj as his guru. Over time, Shastriji Maharaj also became a strong proponent of the Akshar-Purushottam Upasana. After Bhagatji Maharaj died on 7 November 1897, Shastriji Maharaj became the primary proponent of the doctrine of Akshar-Purushottam. He believed that the construction of mandirs guided by this doctrine was urgently needed to facilitate followers' practice of this understanding of Swaminarayan devotion and identified Gunatitanand Swami and Bhagatji Maharaj as the first and second embodiments of Akshar. =Schism and early foundational years (1905–1950)= In this regard, Shastriji Maharaj persuaded Acharya Kunjvihariprasadji to consecrate the murtis of Akshar (Gunatitanand Swami) and Purushottam (Swaminarayan) in the Vadhwan mandir. Shastriji Maharaj's identification of Gunatitanand Swami as the personal form of Akshar was already a paradigm shift for some that led to \\"opposition and hostility\\" from many within the Vadtal diocese. Moreover, the installation of Gunatitanand Swami's murti next to Swaminarayan in the Vadhwan Mandir, led to further hostility and opposition from many swamis of the Vadtal temple who were determined to prevent the murti of Gunatitanand Swami from being placed [along with Swaminarayan in the central shrine]. Jaga Bhakta, a respected devotee of Gunatitanand Swami said: \\"It is the wish of Maharaj that the upasana (worship) of Akshar-Purushottam should be established. Therefore, you must take up this work. It shall be your shortcoming if you don't take a pledge to accomplish this task, and it shall be my shortcoming if I default in fulfilling it.\\" Following this, several attempts to murder him were made, but Shastriji Maharaj maintained his reluctance to leave Vadtal. Since Bhagatji Maharaj promised him, \\"Even if they cut you into pieces, I will stitch you together, but you must never leave the doors of Vadtal\\", Shastriji Maharaj refused to leave. Seeing the unrelenting threat to Shastriji Maharaj's life, Krishnaji Ada, a respected devotee of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, advised him to leave for his own safety, as per the teachings of Swaminarayan in the Shikshapatri Verse 153–154. Acknowledging the commands of Swaminarayan in the Shikshapatri, and interpreting Krishnaji Ada's words to be of Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj decided to leave the Vadtal temple to preach in the surrounding regions until the temple became safe again. On 12 November 1905, Shastriji Maharaj left the Vadtal temple with five swamis and the support of about 150 devotees. However, he did not want to believe that he was separating from Vadtal as he initially instructed his followers to continue their financial contributions to and participation in the temples of the Vadtal diocese. (See Shastriji Maharaj: Formation of BAPS)  Mandirs to facilitate doctrinal practice  266x266px On 5 June 1907, Shastriji Maharaj consecrated the murtis of Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami in the central shrine of the shikharbaddha mandir he was constructing in the village of Bochasan in the Kheda District of Gujarat. This event was later seen to mark the formal establishment of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, which was later abbreviated as BAPS. The Gujarati word Bochasanwasi implies hailing from Bochasan, since the organization's first mandir was built in this village. Shastriji Maharaj continued to consolidate and spread the Akshar-Purushottam teachings of the nascent BAPS by spending the majority of 1908–15 discoursing throughout Gujarat, while continuing construction work of mandirs in Bochasan and Sarangpur. As recognition of Shastriji Maharaj's teachings continued to spread throughout Gujarat, he acquired a loyal and growing group of devotees, admirers, and supporters, many of whom were formerly associated with the Vadtal or Ahmedabad diocese of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Over the next four decades, Shastriji Maharaj completed four more shikharbaddha mandirs in Gujarat (Sarangpur – 1916, Gondal – 1934, Atladra – 1945, and Gadhada – 1951). Kim notes that these temples, in essence, represented the fundamental doctrine that Shastriji Maharaj wished to propagate based on Swaminarayan's teachings: \\"the ultimate reality [Purushottam] and the means, in the form of the Guru, which [enables a] devotee to offer eternal devotion to the ultimate reality\\". Thus, this historical period marked a \\"focused emphasis\\" on building shikharbaddha mandirs as a means of conveying Swaminarayan doctrine. Shashtriji Maharaj was accepted as the third successor, or Akshar by BAPS devotees.  Successors  On 12 August 1910 Shastriji Maharaj met his eventual successor, Yogiji Maharaj, at the house of Jadavji in Bochasan. Yogiji Maharaj was a resident swami at Junagadh Mandir (Saurashtra), where Gunatitanand Swami had served as mahant. Yogiji Maharaj regarded Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar and also served the murti of Harikrishna Maharaj which had previously been worshiped by Gunatitanand Swami. As he already believed in the doctrine being preached by Shastriji Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj left Junagadh on 9 July 1911 with six swamis to join Shastriji Maharaj's mission. On 7 November 1939, 17-year-old Shantilal Patel (who would become Pramukh Swami Maharaj) left his home and was initiated by Shastriji Maharaj into the parshad order, as Shanti Bhagat, on 22 November 1939, and into the swami order, as Narayanswarupdas Swami, on 10 January 1940. Initially, he studied Sanskrit and Hindu scriptures and served as Shastriji Maharaj's personal secretary. In 1946, he was appointed administrative head (Kothari) of the Sarangpur mandir. In the early part of 1950, Shastriji Maharaj wrote several letters to 28-year-old Shastri Narayanswarupdas expressing a wish to appoint him as the administrative president of the organization. Initially, Shastri Narayanswarupdas was reluctant to accept the position, citing his young age and lack of experience and suggesting that an elderly, experienced swami should take the responsibility. However, Shastriji Maharaj insisted over several months, until, seeing the wish and insistence of his guru, Shastri Narayanswarupdas accepted the responsibility. On 21 May 1950 at Ambli-Vali Pol in Amdavad, Shastriji Maharaj appointed Shastri Narayanswarupdas as the administrative president (Pramukh) of BAPS. He instructed Shastri Narayanswarupdas, who now began to be referred to as Pramukh Swami, to ennoble Satsang under the guidance of Yogiji Maharaj. In the last few years of his life, Shastriji Maharaj took steps to preserve the growth and future of BAPS by registering BAPS as a charitable trust in 1947 under India's new legal code. =Development and organizational formation (1950–1971)= After the death of Shastriji Maharaj on 10 May 1951, Yogiji Maharaj became the spiritual leader, or guru, of the organization while Pramukh Swami continued to oversee administrative matters as president of the organization. Yogiji Maharaj carried Shastriji Maharaj's mission of fostering the Akshar-Purushottam doctrine by building temples, touring villages, preaching overseas and initiating weekly local religious assemblies for children, youths and elders. In his 20 years as guru, from 1951 to 1971, he visited over 4,000 cities, towns and villages, consecrated over 60 mandirs and wrote over 545,000 letters to devotees.  Youth Movement  This period of BAPS history saw an important expansion in youth activities. Yogiji Maharaj believed that in a time of profound and rapid social ferment, there was an imminent need to save the young from 'degeneration of moral, cultural and religious values'. To fill a void in spiritual activities for youths, Yogiji Maharaj started a regular Sunday gathering (Yuvak Mandal) of young men in Bombay in 1952. Brear notes, \\"His flair, dynamism and concern led within ten years to the establishment of many yuvak mandals of dedicated young men in Gujarat and East Africa\\". In addition to providing religious and spiritual guidance, Yogiji Maharaj encouraged youths to work hard and excel in their studies. Towards realizing such ideals, he would often remind them to stay away from worldly temptations. A number of youths decided to take monastic vows. On 11 May 1961 during the Gadhada Kalash Mahotsav, he initiated 51 college-educated youths into the monastic order as swamis. Mahant Swami Maharaj initiated as Keshavjivandas Swami was one of the initiates.  East Africa  Satsang in Africa had started during Shastriji Maharaj's lifetime, as many devotees had migrated to Africa for economic reasons. One of Shastriji Maharaj's senior swamis, Nirgundas Swami, engaged in lengthy correspondence with these devotees, answering their questions and inspiring them to start satsang assemblies in Africa. Eventually, in 1928, Harman Patel took the murtis of Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj to East Africa and started a small center. Soon, the East Africa Satsang Mandal was established under the leadership of Harman Patel and Magan Patel. In 1955, Yogiji Maharaj embarked on his first foreign tour to East Africa. The prime reason for the visit was to consecrate Africa's first Akshar-Purushottam temple in Mombasa. The temple was inaugurated on 25 April 1955. He also travelled to Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Tororo, Jinja, Kampala, Mwanza and Dar es salaam. His travels inspired the local devotees to begin temple construction projects. Due to the visit, in a span of five years, the devotees in Uganda completed the construction of temples in Tororo, Jinja and Kampala and asked Yogiji Maharaj to revisit Uganda to install the murtis of Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj. The rapid temple constructions in Africa were helped by the presence of early immigrants, mainly Leva Patels, who came to work as masons, and were particularly skilled in temple building. As a result, Yogiji Maharaj made a second visit to East Africa in 1960 and consecrated hari mandirs in Kampala, Jinja and Tororo in Uganda. Despite his failing health, Yogiji Maharaj at the age of 78 undertook a third overseas tour of London and East Africa in 1970. Prior to his visit, the devotees had purchased the premises of the Indian Christian Union at Ngara, Kenya in 1966 and remodeled it to resemble a three-spired temple. Yogiji Maharaj inaugurated the temple in Ngara, a suburb of Nairobi in 1970.  England  In 1950, disciples Mahendra Patel and Purushottam Patel held small personal services at their homes in England. Mahendra Patel, a barrister by vocation, writes, \\"I landed in London in 1950 for further studies. Purushottambhai Patel...was residing in the county of Kent. His address was given to me by Yogiji Maharaj\\". Beginning 1953, D. D. Meghani held assemblies in his office that brought together several followers in an organized setting. In 1958, leading devotees including Navin Swaminarayan, Praful Patel and Chatranjan Patel from India and East Africa began arriving to the UK. They started weekly assemblies at Seymour Place every Saturday evening at a devotee's house. In 1959, a formal constitution was drafted and the group registered as the \\"Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, London Fellowship Centre\\". D.D. Megani served as Chairman, Mahendra Patel as Vice-Chairman and Praful Patel the secretary. On Sunday, 14 June 1970, the first BAPS temple in England was opened at Islington by Yogiji Maharaj. In this same year he established the Shree Swaminarayan Mission as a formal organization.  United States  Yogiji Maharaj was unable to travel to the United States during his consecutive foreign tours. Nonetheless, he asked Dr. K.C. Patel, to begin satsang assemblies in the United States. He gave Dr. Patel the names of twenty-eight satsangi students to help conduct [satsang] assemblies. In 1970, Yogiji Maharaj accepted the request of these students and sent four swami to visit the U.S. The tour motivated followers to start satsang sabhas in their own homes every Sunday around the country. Soon, K.C. Patel established a non- profit organization known as BSS under US law. Thus, a fledgling satsang mandal formed in the United States before the death of Yogiji Maharaj in 1971. =Growth and further global expansion (1971–2016)= 256x256px After Yogiji Maharaj's death, Pramukh Swami Maharaj became both the spiritual and administrative head of BAPS in 1971. He was the fifth spiritual guru of the BAPS organization. Under his leadership, BAPS has grown into a global Hindu organization and has witnessed expansion in several areas. His work has been built on the foundations laid by his gurus – Shastriji Maharaj and Yogiji Maharaj.  Personal outreach (1971–1981)  Immediately upon taking helm, Pramukh Swami Maharaj ventured on a hectic spiritual tour in the first decade of his role as the new Spiritual Guru. Despite health conditions—cataract operation in 1980—he continued to make extensive tours to more than 4000 villages and towns, visiting over 67,000 homes and performing image installation ceremonies in 77 temples in this first decade. He also embarked on a series of overseas tours beginning in 1974 as the guru. Subsequent tours were made in 1977, 1979, and 1980. Overall, he embarked on a total of 28 international spiritual tours between 1974 and 2014. His travels were motivated by his desire to reach out to devotees for their spiritual uplift and to spread the teachings of Swaminarayan.  Festivals and organization (1981–1992)  Swamis of BAPS with Pramukh Swami Maharaj in Sarangpur, Gujarat, India (2016) The personal outreach (vicharan) of the earlier era (1971–81) by Pramukh Swami Maharaj through traveling to villages and towns, writing letters to devotees, and giving discourses contributed to sustaining a global BAPS community. The Gujarati migration patterns in the early 1970s, globalization factors and economic dynamics between India and the West saw the organization transform into a transnational devotional movement. Organizational needs spanned from transmitting cultural identity through spiritual discourses to the newer much alienated generation in the new lands, temple upkeep and traveling to regional and local centers to disseminate spiritual knowledge. As a result, this era saw a significant rise in the number of swamis initiated to maintain the organizational needs of the community – both in India and abroad. Furthermore, having access to a greater volunteer force and community enabled the organization to celebrate festivals on a massive scale which marked the arrival of a number of milestone anniversaries in the history of the organization, including the bicentenary of Swaminarayan, bicentenary of Gunatitanand Swami, and the centenary of Yogiji Maharaj. Some effects of the celebration included a maturation of organizational capacity, increased commitment and skill of volunteers, and tangentially, an increased interest in the monastic path. The Swaminarayan bicentenary celebration, a once in a life-time event for Swaminarayan followers, was held in Ahmedabad in April 1981. On 7 March 1981, 207 youths were initiated into the monastic order. In 1985 the bicentenary birth of Gunatitanand Swami was celebrated. During this festival, 200 youths were initiated into the monastic order. The organization held Cultural Festivals of India in London in 1985 and New Jersey in 1991. The month-long Cultural Festival of India was held at Alexandra Palace in London in 1985. The same festival was shipped to US as a month-long Cultural Festival of India at Middlesex County College in Edison, New Jersey. Migrational patterns in the 70s led to a disproportionate number of Hindus in the diaspora. Culturally, a need arose to celebrate special festivals (Cultural Festival of India) to reach out to youths in the diaspora to foster understanding and appreciation of their mother culture in a context accessible to them. To engage the youths, festival grounds housed temporary exhibitions ranging from interactive media, dioramas, panoramic scenes and even 3D-exhibits. By the end of the era, owing to the success of these festivals and the cultural impact it had on the youths, the organization saw a need to create a permanent exhibition in the Swaminarayan Akshardham (Gandhinagar) temple in 1991. In 1992, a month-long festival was held to both celebrate Yogiji Maharaj's centenary and to inaugurate a permanent exhibition and temple called Swaminarayan Akshardham (Gandhinagar). The festival also saw 125 youths initiated into the monastic order bringing the total number of swamis initiated to more than 700 in fulfillment to a prophecy made by Yogiji Maharaj.  Mandirs and global growth (1992–2016)  In the third leg of the era, the organization saw an unprecedented level of mandir construction activities taking place in order to accommodate the rapid rise of adherents across the global Indian diaspora. Initially, beginning with the inauguration of Swaminarayan Akshardham (Gandhinagar) in 1992. A number of shikharbaddha mandirs (large traditional stone mandirs) were inaugurated in major cities; Neasden (1995), Nairobi (1999), New Delhi (2004), Swaminarayan Akshardham (New Delhi) (2005), Houston (2004), Chicago (2004), Toronto (2007), Atlanta (2007), Los Angeles (2012), and Robbinsville (2014). =Mahant Swami Maharaj as Guru (2016 – present)= 303x303px On 20 July 2012, in the presence of senior swamis in Ahmedabad, Pramukh Swami Maharaj revealed Keshavjivandas Swami (Mahant Swami) as his spiritual successor. Following the death of Pramukh Swami Maharaj on 13 August 2016, Mahant Swami Maharaj became the 6th guru and president of BAPS. In 1961, he was ordained as a swami by Yogiji Maharaj and named Keshavjivandas Swami. Due to his appointment as the head (mahant) of the mandir in Mumbai, he became known as Mahant Swami. He continues the legacy of the Aksharbrahma Gurus by visiting BAPS mandirs worldwide, guiding spiritual aspirants, initiating devotees, ordaining swamis, creating and sustaining mandirs, and encouraging the development of scriptures. In his discourses, he mainly speaks on how one can attain God and peace through ridding one’s ego (nirmani), seeing divinity in all (divyabhav), not seeing, talking, or adapting any negative nature or behavior of others (no abhav-avgun), and keeping unity (samp). In 2017, he performed the ground-breaking ceremony for shikharbaddha mandirs in Johannesburg, South Africa, and Sydney, Australia, and in April 2019, he performed the ground-breaking ceremony for a traditional stone temple in Abu Dhabi. Philosophy Swaminarayan Bhashyam The philosophy of BAPS is centered on the doctrine of Akshar-Purshottam Darshan, in which followers worship Swaminarayan as God, or Purshottam, and his choicest devotee Gunatitanand Swami, as Akshar. The concept of Akshar has been interpreted differently by various branches of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, and one major reason for the separation of BAPS from the Vadtal diocese has been attributed to doctrinal differences in the interpretation of the concept of Akshar. Both the Vadtal and Ahmedabad dioceses of the Swaminaryan Sampradaya believe Akshar to be the divine abode of the supreme entity Purushottam. The BAPS denomination concurs that Akshar is the divine abode of Purushottam, but they further understand Akshar as \\"an eternally existing spiritual reality having two forms, the impersonal and the personal\\"Gadhada I-21 The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. , pg. 31. Followers of BAPS identify various scriptures and documented statements of Swaminarayan as supporting this understanding of Akshar within the Akshar-Purushottam Darshan. BAPS teaches that the entity of Akshar remains on earth through a lineage of \\"perfect devotees\\", the gurus or spiritual teachers of the organization, who provide \\"authentication of office through Gunatitanand Swami and back to Swaminarayan himself.\\" Followers hold Mahant Swami Maharaj as the personified form of Akshar and the spiritual leader of BAPS. The Swaminarayan-Bhashyam is a published commentary written by Bhadreshdas Swami in 2007 that explicates the roots of Akshar-Purushottam Darshan in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahma Sutras.. This is further corroborated in a classical Sanskrit treatise, also authored by Bhadreshdas Swami, called Swaminarayan-Siddhanta-Sudha. =Swaminarayan ontology= The Swaminarayan ontology comprises five eternal entities: jiva (jīva), ishwar (iśvara), maya (māyā), Aksharbrahman (Akṣarabrahman, also Akshara, Akṣara, or Brahman), Parabrahman (Parabrahman, or Purushottam, Puruṣottama). The entities are separate and distinct from one another and structured within a hierarchy.Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 154. Encompassing the entities of both Swaminarayan and his ideal devotee, this hierarchy emphasizes the relationship between Akshar and Purshottam. Parabrahman - At the top is Parabrahman. Parabrahman is the highest reality, God. He is understood as pragat (manifest on Earth), sakara (having a form), sarvopari (supreme), and karta (all do-er). He is also one and unparalleled, the reservoir for all forms of bliss and eternally divine. Parabrahman is also referred to as Purshottam and Paramatma, both of which reflect his supreme existential state. Furthermore, Parabrahman is the only unconditioned entity upon which the other four entities are contingent. Aksharbrahman - Subservient to Parabrahman is Aksharbrahman, also known as Akshara or Brahman, which exists simultaneously in four states. The first state is in the form of the impersonal chidakash, the divine, all- pervading substratum of the cosmos.Vachnamrut, Gadhada I-46, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. p. 87. Another form of Akshar is the divine abode of Parabrahman, known as Akshardham. Muktas, or liberated jivas (souls), also dwell here in unfathomable bliss and luster which is beyond the scope of human imagination. The other two states of Akshar are personal, which manifest as the ideal servant of Purshottam, both within his divine abode of Akshardham and simultaneously on earth as the God-realized saint. Maya - Below Aksharbrahman is maya. Maya utilizes three main qualities to create the physical world: sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (darkness). Maya entangles ishwar and jiva and causes them to form an attachment to both their physical bodies and the material world. This attachment denies them liberation, and only through contact with the personal form of Brahman can they overcome the illusion created by maya and attain liberation.Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 158 Ishwar - Ishwars are conscious spiritual beings that are responsible for the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the cosmos, at the behest of Parabrahman.The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. p. 729. They are metaphysically higher than that of jivas yet are inferior to Parabrahman and Aksharbrahman. They are the deities that are above jiva, but are also bound by maya, and must transcend maya to attain final liberation.Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 157 Jiva - Every living being can be categorized as a jiva. Jiva is derived from the Sanskrit verb-root 'jiv' which means to breathe or to live. In its pristine form, the jiva is pure and free from flaws, however the influence of maya propels the jiva through the cycles of births and deaths.Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 155-156 =Akshar-Purshottam Darshan= History In 1907, Shastriji Maharaj consecrated the images of Akshar and Purshottam in a temple's central shrine in the village of Bochasan as sacred, marking the formation of the BAPS fellowship as a formally distinct organization. However, the fundamental beliefs of the sampradaya date back to the time of Swaminarayan.Amrutvijaydas, Sadhu (2006). Shastriji Maharaj Life and Work. Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith.. One revelation of Gunatitanand Swami as Akshar occurred in 1810 at the grand yagna of Dabhan, during which Swaminarayan initiated Gunatitanand Swami as a swami. On this occasion, Swaminarayan publicly confirmed that Gunatitanand Swami was the incarnation of Akshar, declaring, \\"Today, I am extremely happy to initiate Mulji Sharma. He is my divine abode – Akshardham, which is infinite and endless.\\" The first Acharya of the Vadtal diocese, Raghuvirji Maharaj, recorded this declaration in his composition, the Harililakalpataru (7.17.49–50).Acharya, Raghuvirji Maharaj; Sadhu Shwetvaikunthdas (Translator) (1966). Shri Harililakalpataru (1st ed.). Mumbai: Sheth Maneklal Chunilal Nanavati Publishers. Under Shastriji Maharaj, considered the manifest form of Akshar at the time, the fellowship continued the traditions of the Akshar-Purshottam Darshan. He focused on the revelations of Gunatitanand Swami as Swaminaryan's divine abode and choicest devotee.Dave, Kishorebhai (2012). Akshar Purushottam Upasana As Revealed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 138. .  Essence  The Akshar-Purushottam Darshan refers to two separate entities within the Swaminarayan ontology. These two entities are worshipped in conjunction by followers of BAPS in accordance with the instructions laid down in the Vachanamrut. According to BAPS, Swaminarayan refers to Akshar in the Vachanamrut, with numerous appellations such as Sant, Satpurush, Bhakta and Swami, as having an august status that makes it an entity worth worshipping alongside God. For example, in Vachanamrut Gadhada I-37, Swaminarayan states: \\"In fact, the darshan of such a true Bhakta of God is equivalent to the darshan of God Himself\\"Vachanamrut, Gadhada I-37, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. , p. 65 Moreover, in Vachanamrut Vadtal 5, Swaminarayan states: Just as one performs the mãnsi puja of God, if one also performs the mãnsi puja of the ideal Bhakta along with God, by offering him the prasãd of God; and just as one prepares a thãl for God, similarly, if one also prepares a thãl for God's ideal Bhakta and serves it to him; and just as one donates five rupees to God, similarly, if one also donates money to the great Sant – then by performing with extreme affection such similar service of God and the Sant who possesses the highest qualities...he will become a devotee of the highest calibre in this very life.Vartal 5. The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition. p. 536–537. Thus, in all BAPS mandirs the image of Akshar is placed in the central shrine and worshipped alongside the image of Purushottam. Furthermore, BAPS believes that by understanding the greatness of God's choicest devotee, coupled with devotion and service to him and God, followers are able to grow spiritually. This practice is mentioned by Swaminarayan in Vachanamrut Vadtal 5: \\"by performing with extreme affection such similar service of God and the Sant who possesses the highest qualities, even if he is a devotee of the lowest type and was destined to become a devotee of the highest type after two lives, or after four lives, or after ten lives, or after 100 lives, he will become a devotee of the highest caliber in this very life. Such are the fruits of the similar service of God and God's Bhakta.\\"Vachanamrut, Vartal 5, The Vachanamrut: Spiritual Discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan. Ahmedabad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. 2003. 2nd edition, p.534  Metaphysical ends  As per the Akshar-Purushottam Darshan, each jiva attains liberation and true realization through the manifest form of Akshar.G. Sundaram. The Concept of Social Service in the Philosophy of Sri Swaminarayan. p. 45 Jivas who perform devotion to this personal form of Brahman can, despite remaining ontologically different, attain a similar spiritual standing as Brahman and then go to Akshardham.Mukundcharandas, Sadhu (2004). Vachnamrut Handbook (Insights into Bhagwan Swaminarayan's Teachings). Amdavad: Swaminarayan Aksharpith. p. 160 It is only through the performance of devotion to Brahman that Parabrahman can be both realized and attained.G. Sundaram. The Concept of Social Service in the Philosophy of Sri Swaminarayan. p. 43  Akshar as a living entity  According to the Akshar-Purushottam Darshan, the personal form of Akshar is forever present on the earth through a lineage of spiritual leaders, or gurus. It is through these gurus that Swaminarayan is also held to forever remain present on the earth. These gurus are also essential in illuminating the path that needs to be taken by the jivas that earnestly desire to be liberated from the cycle of rebirth. This lineage begins with Gunatitanand Swami (1785–1867), a swami who lived conterminously with Swaminarayan. Members of BAPS point to numerous historical anecdotes and scriptural references, particularly from the central Swaminarayan text known as the Vachanamrut, as veritable evidence that Gunatitanand Swami was the manifest form of Akshar. Swaminarayan refers to this concept specifically in Vachnamrut Gadhada I-21, Gadhada I-71, Gadhada III-26, Vadtal 5. Following Gunatitanand Swami, the lineage continued on through Bhagatji Maharaj (1829–1897), Shastriji Maharaj (1865–1951), Yogiji Maharaj (1892–1971), and Pramukh Swami Maharaj (1921–2016). Today Mahant Swami Maharaj is said to be the manifest form of Akshar. =Swaminarayan praxis= According to BAPS doctrines, followers aim to attain a spiritual state similar to Brahman which is necessary for ultimate liberation. The practices of BAPS Swaminarayans are an idealistic \\"portrait of Hinduism.\\" To become an ideal Hindu, followers must identify with Brahman, separate from the material body, and offer devotion to godShikshapatri, shloka 116. It is understood that through association with Akshar, in the form of the God-realized guru, one is able to achieve this spiritual state. Followers live according to the spiritual guidance of the guru who is able to elevate the jiva to the state of Brahman. Thus devotees aim to follow the spiritual guidance of the manifest form of Akshar embedding the principles of righteousness (dharma), knowledge (gnan), detachment from material pleasures (vairagya) and devotion unto God (bhakti) in to their lives. The basic practices of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya are based on these four principles. Followers receive gnan through regularly listening to spiritual discourses and reading scriptures in an effort to gain knowledge of God and one's true self. Dharma encompasses righteous conduct as prescribed by the scriptures. The ideals of dharma range from practicing non- violence to avoiding meat, onions, garlic, and other items in their diet. Swaminarayan outlined the dharma of his devotees in the scripture the Shikshapatri. He included practical aspects of living life such as not committing adultery and respecting elders, gurus, and those of authority. Devotees develop detachment (vairagya) in order to spiritually elevate their soul (jiva) to a Brahmic state. This entails practices such as biweekly fasting (on the eleventh day of each half of each lunar month) and avoiding worldly pleasures by strongly attaching themselves to God. The fourth pillar, devotion (bhakti) is at the heart of the faith community. Common practices of devotion include daily prayers, offering prepared dishes (thal) to the image of God, mental worship of God and his ideal devotee, and singing religious hymns. Spiritual service, or seva, is a form of devotion where devotees serve selflessly \\"while keeping only the Lord in mind.\\" Followers participate in various socio-spiritual activities with the objective to earn the grace of the guru and thus attain association with God through voluntary service.Williams, Raymond Brady (2004). \\"The Holy Man as the Abode of God in Swaminarayan Hinduism\\". Williams on South Asian Religions and Immigration; Collected Works (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.) These numerous activities stem directly from the ideals taught by Swaminarayan, to find spiritual devotion in the service of others. By serving and volunteering in communities to please the guru, devotees are considered to be serving the guru. This relationship is the driving force for the spiritual actions of devotees. The guru is Mahant Swami Maharaj, who is held to be the embodiment of selfless devotion. Under the guidance of Mahant Swami Maharaj, followers observe the tenets of Swaminarayan through the above-mentioned practices, striving to please the guru and become close to God.  BAPS Charities  BAPS Charities is a global non-religious, charitable organization that originated from the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) with a focus on serving society. Their history of service activities can be traced back to Swaminarayan (1781-1830), who opened alms houses, built shelters, worked against addiction, and abolished the practice of sati and female infanticide with the goals of removing suffering and effecting positive social change. This focus on service to society is stated in the organization's vision, that \\"every individual deserves the right to a peaceful, dignified, and healthy way of life.

The screenplay by Garnett Weston, based on The Magic Island by William Seabrook, is about a young woman's transformation into a zombie at the hands of an evil voodoo master. Bela Lugosi stars as the zombie master \\"Murder\\" Legendre, with Madge Bellamy appearing as his victim. Other cast members include Joseph Cawthorn, Robert W. Frazer, John Harron, Brandon Hurst and George Burr MacAnnan.Staff (August 6, 1932) Variety. p.15Billing order per film opening credits Large portions of White Zombie were shot on the Universal Studios lot, borrowing many props and scenery from other horror films of the era. The film opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting. While the film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, it proved less popular than other horror films of the time. White Zombie is considered the first feature length zombie film. A sequel, Revolt of the Zombies, opened in 1936. Modern reception to White Zombie has been more positive. Some critics have praised the film's atmosphere and compared it to the 1940s horror films of Val Lewton, while others still have unfavorable opinions on the quality of the acting. Plot On arrival in Haiti, Madeleine Short reunites with her fiancé Neil Parker, with imminent plans to be married. On the way to their lodging, the couple's coach passes Murder Legendre, an evil voodoo master, who observes them with interest. Neil and Madeleine arrive at the home of the wealthy plantation owner, Charles Beaumont. Charles' love of Madeleine prompts him to meet Murder secretly in Murder's sugar cane mill, operated entirely by zombies. Charles wants to convince Madeleine to marry him and solicits Murder's supernatural assistance. Murder states that the only way to help Charles is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont agrees, takes the potion, and surreptitiously gives it to Madeleine. Shortly after Madeleine and Neil's wedding ceremony, the potion takes effect on Madeleine, who soon dies and is buried. Murder and Charles enter Madeleine's tomb at night and bring her back to life as a zombie. In a drunken state, a depressed Neil sees ghostly apparitions of Madeleine and goes to her tomb. On finding it empty, Neil seeks out the assistance of the local missionary, Dr. Bruner, who recounts how Murder turned many of his rivals into zombies, who now act as Murder's closest guardians. The two men journey to Murder's cliffside castle to rescue Madeleine. At the castle, Charles has begun to regret Madeleine's transformation and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is also transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence and silently orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner grabs her hand from behind a curtain, making her drop the knife and walk away. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.

Hoping to cash in on the country's interest in voodoo, which began with William B. Seabrook's 1929 book on Haitian voodou, The Magic Island, the film, then titled Zombie, went into development in early 1932.Rhodes 2001, p. 89 The Halperins leased office space from Universal Studios.Rhodes 2001, p. 91 Garnett Weston's story focuses more on action than dialogue.Rhodes 2001, p. 95 To aid the Halperins, producer Phil Goldstone helped secure funds for White Zombie as he had for other independent films at the time.Rhodes 2001, p. 92 Much of the funding came from Amusement Securities Corp. White Zombie was filmed in eleven days in March 1932 and was shot at the Universal Studios lot, at RKO-Pathé, and in Bronson Canyon on such a small budget - approximately $50,000 - that it had to be filmed at night. Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn, the majority of the cast in White Zombie were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era. By the time Bela Lugosi appeared in White Zombie, he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, Dracula and 1932's Murders in the Rue Morgue, and film historians have found it surprising that he would sign on to a low-budget film by producers (the Halperin brothers) with no track record in Hollywood.Stafford, Jeff (ndg) \\"White Zombie (1932)\\" TCM.com. Retrieved: March 19, 2018 Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for his week of work on White Zombie. Claims range between US$500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for White Zombie on Lugosi's tax returns.Rhodes 2001, p. 97Rhodes 2001, p. 105 The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they would come on to the set.Rhodes 2001, p. 98 In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that \\"Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type\\" on set. Actor Clarence Muse, who played the coach driver, claimed that some scenes were partly re-written or re-staged by Lugosi, who also helped to direct some re-takes. Lugosi's model for his portrayal of \\"Murder\\" Legendre in White Zombie may have been the character he played in 1919's Slaves of a Foreign Will (Sklaven fremden Willens), his first German film, in which he played a Svengali-like hypnotist with mesmerizing eyes. Phil Goldstone had previously worked with Bellamy and offered her the role of Madeleine Short for a salary of $5,000.Rhodes 2001, p. 99 For the role of Dr. Bruner, the Halperins looked for an actor with name value and decided to cast Joseph Cawthorn, who was then known to audiences only as comic relief in stage and film roles.Rhodes 2001, p. 100 Set designer Ralph Berger utilized the rented sets of previous films. These sets included the great halls from Dracula, pillars and a hanging balcony from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), the dark corridors from Frankenstein (1931) and chairs from The Cat and the Canary (1927). At RKO-Pathé sets from The King of Kings (1927) were used for the interior of Legendre's castle. In addition to Berger, assistant director William Cody and sound director L.E. \\"Pete\\" Clark earned their first film credit by working on White Zombie.Rhodes 2001, p. 103 Jack Pierce, Lugosi's make-up artist on White Zombie, had been responsible for the make-up of several other famous horror films of the era including Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and The Mummy (1932).Rhodes 2001, p. 104 Clarence Muse took over the role of the coach driver after principal photography has already begun. Some footage of the unknown original was used in White Zombie. The music of White Zombie was supervised by Abe Meyer. Instead of using pre-recorded music, Meyer had orchestras record new versions of compositions for each specific film he was involved in. The music in White Zombie draws from works including Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\", Gaston Borch's \\"Incidental Symphonies\\", and Hugo Riesenfeld's \\"Death of the Great Chief\\".Rhodes 2001, p. 109 Other pieces on the White Zombie soundtrack include music written by Richard Wagner, H. Maurice Jacquet, Leo Kempenski, and Franz Liszt. The film begins with \\"Chant\\", a composition of wordless vocals and drumming, created by Universal Studios employee Guy Bevier Williams, a specialist in ethnic music.Rhodes 2001, p. 110 Footage shot for White Zombie was recycled for the film's sequel, Revolt of the Zombies - also made by Halperin Productions - which was released in 1936. Release White Zombie experienced distribution problems from the beginning, and went through several film studios including Columbia Studios and Educational Pictures before its initial release.Rhodes 2001, p. 111 United Artists had been distributing several independent and foreign films that year and bought the rights to release White Zombie.Rhodes 2001, p. 113 A preview of White Zombies first cut was shown on June 16, 1932, in New York City.Rhodes 2001, p. 112 This print of White Zombie had a running time of 74 minutes, whereas the regular distribution prints ran for only 69 minutes.Rhodes 2001, p. 194 =Critical response= Most critical reviews focused on the poor silent era-style acting, stilted dialogue, and over-the- top storyline. William Boehnel of the New York World-Telegram stated: \\"The plot...is really ridiculous, but not so startlingly so as the acting.\\"Rhodes 2001, p. 265 Thornton Delehaney of the New York Evening Post wrote, \\"[T]he story tries to out-Frankenstein Frankenstein, and so earnest is it in its attempt to be thrilling that it overreaches its mark all along the line and resolves into an unintentional and often hilarious comedy.\\" Irene Thirer of the New York Daily News wrote, \\"Many fantastic and eerie scenes are evolved, but most of them border on ludicrous\\".Rhodes 2001, p. 266 Industry trade reviews were more positive. The Film Daily wrote: \\"It rates with the best of this type of film [...] Bela Lugosi is very impressive and makes the picture worthwhile\\". Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"[The film] is certainly not up to the standards of Dracula or Frankenstein, but the types of audience that go for horror pictures will enjoy it\\".Rhodes 2001, p. 267Harrison's Reports film review; August 6, 1932, page 126. National media outlet reviewers were generally negative. Commonweal opined, \\"[The film is] interesting only in measure of its complete failure\\". Liberty wrote, \\"If you do not get a shock out of this thriller, you will get one out of the acting\\". In Vanity Fairs \\"Worst Movie of 1932\\" article, Pare Lorentz wrote about a \\"terrific deadlock with Blonde Venus holding a slight lead over White Zombie, Bring 'Em Back Alive, and Murders in the Rue Morgue\\".Rhodes 2001, p. 268 In the United Kingdom, press was mixed. The Kinematograph Weekly thought the film was \\"quite well acted, and has good atmosphere\\" but thought, too, it was \\"not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent\\".Rhodes 2001, p. 162 The Cinema News and Property Gazette thought the film was for the \\"less sophisticated\\" and that the \\"exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction\\".Rhodes 2001, p.163 Years after the film's release, Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films: \\"I don't believe in fear, violence, and horror, so why traffic in them?\\"Rhodes 2001, p. 237 Modern critical reception has been mixed, with critics praising the film's atmosphere while deprecating the acting. Time Out London wrote, \\"Halperin shoots this poetic melodrama as trance... The unique result constitutes a virtual bridge between classic Universal horror and the later Val Lewton productions.\\" TV Guide gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, comparing the film's atmosphere to Carl Dreyer's film Vampyr. However, the magazine described the acting as \\"woefully inadequate\\", with the exception of Lugosi. Edward G. Bansk, a Val Lewton biographer, identified several flaws in White Zombie, including poor acting, bad timing and other \\"haphazard and sloppy\\" film aspects. Bansk wrote, \\"Although White Zombie is a film with courage, a film difficult not to admire, its ambitions overstep competence of its principal players.\\"Bansk 109 Colored publicity shot for White Zombie, featuring Bela Lugosi, Madge Bellamy and John Harron =Box office= White Zombie premiered on July 28, 1932, in New York City's Rivoli Theatre. The film received a mixed box office reception upon its initial release, but was a great financial success for an independent film at the time.Rhodes 2001, p. 271Rhodes 2001, p. 233 In 1933 and 1934, the film experienced positive box-office numbers in small towns in the United States, as well as in Germany under the title Flucht von der Teufelsinsel. White Zombie was one of the few American horror films to be approved by the Nazis. The popularity of the film led Victor Halperin to a contract with Paramount Studios.Rhodes 2001, p. 266 Opening on July 29, 1932, in Providence, Rhode Island and Indianapolis, Indiana, the film grossed $9,900 and $5,000, respectively, following one-week engagements. Frankenstein and other contemporary horror films had grossed more in Providence, and the Indianapolis theater \\"wasn't too happy with White Zombie, but what audiences saw it were pleased enough.\\"Rhodes 2001, p. 269 In Cleveland, Ohio, White Zombie sold a record 16,728 tickets its first weekend on its initial release in August. In Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the film opened August 3 at the Princess Theatre. The facade had been transformed into a \\"House of the Living Dead\\" and \\"zombies\\" walked atop the marquee. The film failed to gross its estimated $8,000 and earned only $6,500 following a one-week run at the Princess Theatre. In comparison, Dracula had grossed $14,000 at Montreal's Palace Theatre during its first week in March 1931. =Home video= White Zombie was transferred from poor quality prints to VHS and Betamax in the 1980s. The film has been released on DVD from several companies – including K-Tel and Alpha Video — with varying image quality. The book Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide described the Roan's later DVD release of the title as the best available.Kay 2008, p. 313 The online film database Allmovie features a positive review of the Roan Group's transfer, stating the film \\"has never looked better\\". The film was released on Blu-ray on January 29, 2013, from Kino Video. Aftermath and influence Musician Rob Zombie appropriated the name of the film for his group White Zombie White Zombie is considered to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies.Rhodes 2001, p. 13Prawer 1989, p. 68 Not many early horror films followed White Zombie's Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology.Kay 2008, p. 5 These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966).Rhodes 2001, p. 183 These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.Rhodes 2001, p. 184 Victor Halperin directed a White Zombie sequel, Revolt of the Zombies, which was released in 1936. Béla Lugosi was considered for the role of villain Armand Louque, but the part went to Dean Jagger.Rhodes 2001, p. 171 Cinematographer Arthur Martinelli and producer Edward Halperin returned for the sequel. Modern critical response to Revolt of the Zombies is generally unfavorable. In a review from Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide, the review declares that \\"[T]here's no experimentation here, only dull composition shots and flatly lit shots of yakking characters in a by-the-numbers plot.\\"Kay 2008, p. 9 Allmovie rated White Zombie three stars out of five, while it gave Revolt of the Zombies only one star and deemed it far inferior to the original. Scenes from White Zombie have appeared in other films including Curtis Hanson's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Michael Almereyda's Nadja, and Tim Burton's Ed Wood.Rhodes 2001, p. 189 The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, \\"[It's] a great film that not a lot of people know about...It amazes me that a film that is so readily available can be so lost.\\"Rhodes 2001, p. 190 In 1997, the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character. In 2009, it was announced that Tobe Hooper would direct a remake of White Zombie. Screenwriter Jared Rivet worked on a script in 2007 with Hooper. The project was halted due to rights issues. Rivet explained that White Zombie \\"is clearly public domain, but there were question marks about uncredited source material.\\" See also * Bela Lugosi filmography * List of American films of 1932 * List of horror films of the 1930s References Notes Bibliography  * *  External links    Category:1932 films Category:1932 horror films Category:1930s independent films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American zombie films Category:English-language films Category:Films about Voodoo Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Victor Halperin Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films set in Haiti Category:Haitian Vodou in fiction Category:United Artists films Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"White Zombie (film)"},{"id":"1610333","text":"American Angleball Championship 2015 Angleball is a registered sports fitness organization and patented equipment manufacturer for North America's oldest sport, anejodi.http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/Culture/General/Stickball%28anejodi%29.aspx Angleball's anejodi rules were reestablished as an American tradition during World War 2 at Brown University by collegiate Hall of Fame football and basketball coach Charles \\"Rip\\" Engle (March 26, 1906 - March 7, 1983) to keep American World War 2 servicemen fit prior to deployment.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat;=19660525&id;=8wYrAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=SZgFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6627,5645232 Angleball equipment is currently played by 1,000,000+ people in the United States and worldwide and for conditioning in the NFL and by Team USA Olympic athletes. Since 2014, Angleball has inspired a recurring game-type in the world's best selling video game series, Call of Duty, called Uplinkhttp://www.angleball.net. International Angleball has 13 current member countries. The Angleball organization honors its ancient heritage by encouraging groups to produce their own anejodi equipment to Angleball's patented measurements, using available or natural materials, as long as the equipment is not sold. Angleball is a registered trademark and is sold exclusively by the Angleball company. Gameplay  Two large target-balls are placed on standards at opposite sides of a field, however half-field can also be played The Angleball can be run or passed. A goal is worth one point. Angleball can be played with varying levels of contact: non-contact, touch- contact, and full-contact; this is similar to flag, touch and tackle football. The means of stopping the offense depends on the level of contact that the group has decided on: in non-contact Angleball, the ball-carrier may not take a step with the angleball; in touch Angleball the ball-carrier must pass within 3 seconds after being tagged; in full-contact Angleball the ball must be passed or shot within 3 seconds of a tag and contact is allowed. It is also often played that a pass cannot touch the ground, and that a circle key surrounds each standard that the offense cannot step inside; club variations are welcome within the Angleball community. Complete competition rules can be found on the Angleball company website . Angleball can be played with as few as 1 v 1 with a single standard placed against a rebound wall, all the way up to 100 v 100 with a standard at both ends of a park or camp. The Angleball Championship has been held annually since 2014. History Notes The first high school game played was in the late 1960s at Pioneer Ranch in Tidioute, Pennsylvania, when the Corry High School Beavers football team hosted the Titusville Rockets team. Corry's athletic director and head football coach, Lou Hanna, and Titusville's athletic director, Roy Van Horn, had been teammates on the 1939 Slippery Rock State Teachers College undefeated championship football team., Roy Van Horn, Slippery Rock Hall of Fame. The game was won by Corry. Van Horn was the owner of Pioneer Ranch, a boys camp on the Allegheny River near Tidioute, Pennsylvania. With Hanna, he founded the Northwestern Pennsylvania Football Camp at Pioneer Ranch in 1961, the nation's first summertime football camp for high school gridders, and hired Penn State's coaches to staff it. It was here a relationship with Rip Engle was formed, and they were first introduced to anejodi. In the mid-1990s the game was also introduced to students at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana by Philosophy Professor, Dr. James Spiegel. On October 4, 2009 Angleball was introduced to a group of about 20 people in Tucson, Arizona. It remains a favorite in Gym classes at Bellefonte Area High School in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, Penns Valley Area High School in Spring Mills, Pennsylvania, Philipsburg-Osceola Area School District in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, as well as Park Forest and Mount Nittany Middle Schools in State College, Pennsylvania. Angleball sets are manufactured by the American association and are being used in the NFL and by Colleges, camps, schools, and all age groups throughout the United States and Canada. In 2011 at the 100th year celebration of the Dept. of Kinesiology at Penn State, an Angleball association set was featured in \\"The Ball Games of the World Exhibit\\" presented by Dr. Ken Swalgin, Associate Professor of Kinesiology. The exhibit includes over 80 balls, equipment, and posters depicting ball sports from around the world. Ball sports are categorized as follows: handball games, bowls and bowling, ball and bat games, racket and paddle games, football games, ball and raised goal games, invasion goal games, and other ball games.(Swalgin, K.L. 2011). In 2012, an Angleball set was adopted by the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles for preseason conditioning. In September 2013, American Angleball sponsored the first angleball match in Africa (Masaka, Uganda) with the help of Sporting Is The Answer.

Her 1970 essay, The Cress Theory of Color- Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy), offered her interpretation on the origins of what she described as white supremacy culture. She was the author of The Isis Papers: The Keys to the Colors (1991). Welsing caused controversy after she said that homosexuality among African-Americans was a ploy by white males to decrease the black population. Early life Welsing was born Frances Luella Cress in Chicago on March 18, 1935. Her father, Dr. Henry N. Cress, was a physician, and her mother, Ida Mae Griffen, was a teacher. In 1957, she earned a B.S. degree at Antioch College and in 1962 received an M.D. at Howard University. In the 1960s, Welsing moved to Washington, D.C. and worked at many hospitals, especially children's hospitals.This was from the previous wiki article While Welsing was an assistant professor at Howard University she formulated her first body of work in 1969, The Cress Theory of Color-Confrontation and self published it in 1970. The paper subsequently appeared in the May 1974 edition of the Black Scholar. This was an introduction to her thoughts that would be developed in The Isis Papers. Twenty-two years later she released The Isis Papers, a compilation of essays she had written about global and local race relations.  Career  In 1992 Welsing published The Isis Papers: The Keys to the Colors. The book is a compilation of essays that she had written over 18 years. The name \\"The Isis Papers\\" was inspired by an ancient Egyptian goddess. Isis was the sister/wife of the most significant god Osiris. According to Welsing, all the names of the gods were significant; however, also according to Welsing, Osiris means \\"lord of the perfect Black\\". Welsing specifically chose the name Isis for her admiration of \\"truth and justice\\" that allowed for justice to be stronger than gold and silver. In this book she talks about the genocide of people of color globally, along with issues black people in the United States face. According to Welsing, the genocide of people of color is caused by white people's inability to produce melanin. The minority status of whites has caused what she calls a preoccupation with white genetic survival. She believed that injustice caused by racism will end when \\"non-white people worldwide recognize, analyze, understand and discuss openly the genocidal dynamic.\\" She also tackled issues such as drug use, murder, teen pregnancy, infant mortality, incarceration, and unemployment, in the black community. According to Welsing, the cause of these issues is her definition of racism (white supremacy). Black men are at the center of Welsing's discussion because, according to her, they \\"have the greatest potential to cause white genetic annihilation.\\" Views In The Isis Papers, she described white people as the genetically defective descendants of albino mutants. She wrote that due to this \\"defective\\" mutation, they may have been forcibly expelled from Africa, among other possibilities. Racism, in the views of Welsing, is a conspiracy \\"to ensure white genetic survival\\". She attributed AIDS and addiction to crack cocaine and other substances to \\"chemical and biological warfare\\" by white people. Welsing created a definition of racism, which is her theory of non- white genocide globally. She refers to racism and white supremacy synonymously. Her definition is \\"Racism (white supremacy) is the local and global power system dynamic, structured and maintained by those who classify themselves as white; whether consciously or subconsciously determined; this system consists of patterns of perception, logic, symbol formation, thought, speech, action and emotional response, as conducted simultaneously in all areas of people activity: economics, education, entertainment, labor, law, politics, religion, sex, and war. The ultimate purpose of the system is to ensure white genetic survival and to prevent white genetic annihilation on Earth --- a planet in which the overwhelming majority of people are classified as non-white, (black, brown, red, and yellow) by white skinned people. All of the non-white people are genetically dominant (in terms of skin coloration) compared to the genetic recessive white skinned people\\". Welsing was against white supremacy and the emasculation of black men. Criticisms Welsing stated that the emasculation of the black man prevents procreation of black people. According to Welsing, this is one of the goals of racism (white supremacy). She calls this effeminization as a form of oppression.

Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov () (27 July 1827, Saint Petersburg – 22 March 1889, Saint Petersburg) was an influential Russian statesman and a counselor to Tsar Alexander II. Referring to his court influence and reactionary policies, his more liberal opponents sometimes called him \\"Peter IV\\" (Pyotr is the Russian form for Peter, referring to the three emperors of Russia named Peter) and \\"Arakcheyev II\\". Biography Pyotr Andreyevich came from the Shuvalov family which has been prominent in the Russian culture and politics since the mid-18th century. His father, Count Andrey Petrovich Shuvalov, was a prominent figure at the courts of Nicholas I of Russia and Alexander II of Russia. His mother was Thekla Ignatyevna Walentinowicz, Prince Zubov's widow and heiress. Count Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov was his brother. Rundāle Palace was notable family estate. After graduating from the Corps of Pages, Pyotr Shuvalov rose through the ranks of Alexander II's retinue, making wing adjutant, major general of the retinue and adjutant general in short order. In 1857 he was put in charge of the Saint Petersburg police and went to France for training. In 1860 Shuvalov was appointed director of the Department of General Affairs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and, in 1861, was made Chief of Staff of the Special Corps of Gendarmes. He proposed for the Corps to be abolished, which contributed to his reputation as a liberal and an Anglophile. His plan was rejected, and he resigned in late 1861. He served elsewhere in the early 1860s and, in 1864, was appointed governor-general of the Baltic region. After Dmitry Karakozov's unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Alexander II in April 1866, Shuvalov was made Chief of Gendarmes and Executive Head of the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery, a ministerial position at the time. He formed a group of similarly-minded moderate ministers (A. P. Bobrinsky, S. A. Greig, K. I. Pahlen, Dmitriy Tolstoy) and, with the help of the Tsar's confidant Field Marshal Aleksandr Baryatinskiy, pursued a policy of moderate reform. Politically, he was simultaneously opposed to the Slavophiles and the so-called Russian Party as well as to the more liberal reformers like Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin and Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich. Shuvalov was in favor of developing local self-government but on the basis of strengthening the political position of the landed gentry. In the long run, he envisioned a system of national representation with a constitution and a bicameral parliament, modelled on the earlier aristocratic English model, but he disclosed his parliamentary ideas only in 1881, when he had safely retired: Pyotr Shuvalov :an advisory assembly can bring no benefit whatsoever. One must openly introduce a constitutional system by establishing two houses and giving them a decisive voice. If this cannot be done immediately, one must, at least, erect a foundation upon which real representative government could eventually arise. Shuvalov continued his predecessors' reforms although more cautiously. He reorganized zemstvos in 1870 and overhauled the military in 1874, reducing the length of service from 15 years to 6. At the same time, he strengthened the government's censorship system and limited the zemstvos' taxation powers. In 1872, he was promoted General of the Cavalry (1872, a rank equivalent to full General in other armies. In 1873, Shuvalov was sent to London on a mission to arrange a marriage between Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia and the Duke of Edinburgh. The mission was a success and the two married in January 1874. Shuvalov was also supposed to reassure the British government that Alexander II had no plans to conquer the Central Asian Khanate of Khiva. Although Khiva fell to Russian troops in 1874, he was able to blame it on the generals' excess of zeal and so it did not damage Shuvalov's reputation in London. In April 1874, the Committee of Ministers approved the creation of an experimental commission with representation from Zemstvo, local gentry and cities. Although the commission was charged only with reviewing a single previously prepared bill on hiring agricultural laborers, the very notion was apparently deemed so radical that in November 1874, Shuvalov was sent into honorary exile as ambassador to London. However, other more mundane explanations for his downfall, boasting about his influence on the tsar or making an incautious remark about his mistress Catherine Dolgorukov, have also been suggested. Shuvalov played an important role in the negotiations between Russia and Great Britain during and after the Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878 and was instrumental in avoiding conflict between the two powers after the Treaty of San Stefano. With the conclusion of the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, Russian public opinion turned against him since he was seen as too conciliatory and too willing to yield to British and especially German demands. Although Alexander II at first resisted public pressure to remove Shuvalov, further deterioration of Russo-German relations in 1879 forced him into retirement. Notes * See Richard S. Wortman.

Skip-stops are used in both rail transit and bus transit operations.http://trb.metapress.com/content/71732p1003377324/ It is also used to describe elevators that stop at alternating floors and hence also used to describe building designs that exploit this design and avoid corridors on alternating floors. History The Chicago Transit Authority invented skip- stop service in 1948 as a means of speeding up old trains it inherited when it took over from private operators. The first skip-stop service was run on April 5 of that year on the Lake Street line with the north-south (Howard- Englewood/Jackson Park) and Ravenswood lines beginning skip-stop service on August 1 of the following year. Rail operation Two types of trains stopping at different stations When skip stops are used in rail transit, the transit operator designates stations as either major or minor, typically by ridership. Usually, all vehicles stop at the major stations, but only some vehicles stop at the minor ones. Since one rail vehicle can only pass another by using an additional track, skip-stop may require additional investment in infrastructure if express services, where trains skip many stops along a route, are employed simultaneously with vehicles making stops on every station. In systems that have no extra track for a faster train to pass a slower train, skip-stop may be employed either during busier travel hours to reduce travel time of a particular train, or during off-peak hours to raise efficiency by not stopping at \\"unpopular\\" stations. A timetable from 1959 showing skip-stop service on the New York City Subway's 14 and 15 services. In some systems, such as the New York City Subway, these are considered as two separate services (, the / (which was discontinued in May 2005); and formerly the /—the latter of which were in fact two separate services), as if the two services were separate lines instead of two different stopping patterns on the same line. On other systems, such as Philadelphia's SEPTA Market-Frankford Line (which was discontinued in February 2020), they are distinguished by lights on the train, and stations skipped by half the trains are designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" stations depending on which trains stop there. The Chicago \\"L\\" used skip-stop service from the 1940s until the early 1990s, at which point it was discontinued in favor of all-stop service. This was done to reduce waiting times for passengers riding to or from \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" stations who could only take half of the trains. It also eliminated the need for a train transfer for passengers riding from an \\"A\\" station to a \\"B\\" station, which required a transfer at an \\"AB\\" (all trains stop) station to complete their trip. Further, the system was simpler to use for new riders and visitors. The Santiago Metro runs skip-stop services on line 2, line 4, and line 5 during the morning and evening rush hours; trains with marker lights stop only at the minor stations that are located on the (la ruta roja), and trains with marker lights stop only at the minor stations that are located on the (la ruta verde). There are some stations where all trains stop, which are known as common stations (estaciones comunes); common stations allow passengers to change between trains to get to their final destination. Bus operation In bus operations, skip-stop refers to a stopping pattern where buses do not stop at every block or at every designated bus stop, typically in a central business district. Skip-stop operation reduces travel time and increases the number of buses that the streets and bus stops are able to accommodate. With skip-stop operations, bus routes are typically grouped together by geographic area in order to provide a common stop for areas that are served by multiple routes. The skip- stop groups are sometimes identified by color or letter so that passengers and bus operators can easily identify their desired stop. A disadvantage with skip-stops is that passengers may have to walk farther or change buses to catch their intended bus, which increases travel time. Passengers may also be unsure about which bus stop to walk towards to catch their intended bus. Skip- stops work best when buses are able to easily pass each other at bus stops, such as on a low-traffic street, street with bus stop pockets or dedicated busway with at least two lanes in each direction. If there is a large amount of other traffic on the street or only a single bus lane is provided, then buses have difficulty passing each other and much of the benefit of using skip-stops is not realized. In Seattle, WA, which has an extensive local and regional bus system operated by three different transit agencies, skip-stops are used on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Avenues in the downtown area. Bus routes on 3rd Avenue are grouped into Blue and Yellow stops, while bus routes on 2nd and 4th Avenue are grouped into Red and White stops. In Portland, Oregon, buses of TriMet and C-Tran use skip stops on the Portland Transit Mall in Downtown Portland. The practice has been in use on the mall since its opening in 1977, and was continued (for buses) after MAX Light Rail was added to the mall in 2009. Buses stop at every third or fourth bus stop. Until 2007, the bus stops for the different groups of routes were identified by colors and symbols, such as \\"Yellow Rose\\" and \\"Orange Deer\\", but with the rebuilding for the addition of light rail, those designations were replaced by simple letters—A, B, C, D for southbound on 5th Avenue and W, X, Y, Z for northbound on 6th Avenue. This term may also refer to limited-stop bus services. See also * Limited-stop * Express train References Category:Passenger rail transport ","title":"Skip-stop"},{"id":"1610394","text":"K.J. Howe, Former Mint 400 Race Director being interviewed The Mint 400 is an annual American desert off-road race which takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was resumed in 2008 after a 20-year hiatus. The race was for both motorcycles, until 1977, and four-wheel vehicles (buggies, cars and trucks) sponsored by Del Webb's Mint Hotel and Casino.\\"The Mint 400\\" , Las Vegas Sun, Retrieved January 7, 2007 Del Webb, a real estate developer and friend of Howard Hughes, was owner of the Mint Hotel in downtown Las Vegas. It became known as The Great American Desert Race. History Norm Johnson created \\"The Mint '400' Del Webb Desert Rally\\" in 1968 in his role as promotions director of The Mint Hotel & Casino. The first race sent 101 vehicles across roughly of desert, from The Mint Hotel in Las Vegas to the Sahara Tahoe at Stateline (Lake Tahoe). The future of the Mint 400 race came into question in 1988 following the sale of Del Webb's Mint Hotel & Casino to Jack Binion, owner of the Horseshoe Club. However, as a testament to the race itself, the prestige and importance of the event created by veteran race director K.J. Howe and the Mint management team and the financial benefit this promotion brought to the City of Las Vegas, under new ownership the annual Mint 400 Off Road Race continued to be run in 1988 and 1989. New owner Binion felt the race and its ancillary activities along Fremont Street had a negative impact on his casinos. So, the race was no longer held after the 1989 Mint 400. The Mint was not held for nearly twenty years, then was restarted by long-time sponsor General Tire with help from the Southern Nevada Off-Road Enthusiasts group. General Tire has been the title sponsor of the race ever since. SNORE eventually sold the franchise to film and television producers Matt and Joshua Martelli – marking the next significant chapter in the Mints evolution. The race resumed on March 29, 2008. The race was preceded by inspections of the vehicles on Fremont Street in the Fremont East district. In 2012 The Martelli Brothers partnered with off-road industry veteran Casey Folks, owner of the largest off-road desert racing organization in the world, the Best in the Desert Racing Association. The Mint was added to the Best in the Desert championship schedule, and a new race loop was carved out for the contest. The number of entries swelled to an astounding three hundred and twenty three race teams, making the Mint 400 one of the largest off-road races in the world. The Martelli Brothers featured a brand new event this year called the Method Race Wheels Pit Crew Challenge! Sixteen pit crews from the top unlimited truck teams competed in a head-to-head battle to decide who had the best crew. Each of the three-man teams were given one jack, one impact gun, and one spare tire. The team who completed two tire changes the fastest, advanced to the next round. Over 10,000 spectators on Fremont Street, showed up to cheer on the teams. After several close and heated rounds the General Tire/THR team – which included drivers Mikey Childress, Rick Johnson, and crewmember James Walker – out pitted the field to win the inaugural Method Race Wheels Pit Crew Challenge.

He served in numerous positions during his life, and fought in the Glorious Revolution for William III and Mary II. Early life and family Murray was born in 1660 at Knowsley Hall, Lancashire, England to John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl and his wife, the former Lady Amelia Sophia Stanley. Murray's maternal grandparents were the 7th Earl of Derby and the Countess of Derby. He was the first of twelve children and, as opposed to continual speculation, he was not blind in any of his eyes at any time in his life.per his academic biographer, Dr Cheryl Garrett, thesis completed 2012, University of Aberdeen Academic Historical Biography for the Doctor of Philosophy Lord Murray matriculated from St. Andrews University in 1676. He was married twice and was the father of nineteen children. Later life and career He was created 1st Earl of Tullibardine by William III of England in 1696 and was created the 1st Duke of Atholl by Queen Anne in 1703. Lord Murray was a supporter of King William III during the Glorious Revolution, taking the oath of loyalty in September 1689, but was unable to prevent some of his clan from joining Lord Dundee under the command of his father's baillie, Stewart of Ballechin. Lord Murray laid siege to his family's ancestral home, Blair Castle, which Ballechin had fortified and held for King James VII/II but ended the siege just days prior to the Battle of Killiecrankie. In 1683 he married Katherine Hamilton, daughter of Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton and her husband William Douglas, the Duke of Hamilton, with whom he had six daughters and seven sons; only six of his children survived into adulthood. Arms of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl In 1693 he was appointed as one of the commissioners to the inquiry into the massacre of Glencoe. In 1695, Lord Murray was made Sheriff of Perth. In 1696 the earldom of Tullibardine was created for him, from whence he was known as the Earl of Tullibardine. Also in 1696, he became Secretary of State, and from 1696 to 1698 was Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland. With the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, he was made a Privy Councillor, and in 1703 became Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. The same year he succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Atholl, and in June 1703 he was created Duke of Atholl, Marquess of Tullibardine, Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle, Viscount of Balquhidder, Glenalmond and Glenlyon, and Lord Murray, Balvenie and Gask upon the death of his father. In 1704, Murray succeeded his father as a Knight of the Thistle. In 1704 an unsuccessful attempt was made by Lord Lovat, who used the Duke of Queensberry as a tool to implicate him in a Jacobite plot against Queen Anne. The intrigue was disclosed by Robert Ferguson, and Atholl sent a memorial to the Queen on the subject, which resulted in Queensberry's downfall. But the affair had a damaging effect on Murray's career, and he was deprived of office in October 1704. He subsequently became a strong antagonist of the government, and of the Hanoverian succession. He vehemently opposed Union during the years 1705–1707, and entered into a project which would have resisted the crown by force by holding Stirling Castle with the aid of the Cameronians but this plan was never followed. After the vote for Union, he accepted compensation of £1,000 for back pay from services owed him (although in Lord Polwarth's memoirs the monies were not a 'bribe' as has been suggested by the Jacobite, Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath, but remuneration owed him since 1698 for service to the crown). On the occasion, however, of the planned invasion of 1708 he took no part, on account of illness, and was placed under arrest at Blair Castle.

She was named after Venetian traveler Marco Polo. The ship carried emigrants and passengers to Australia and was the first vessel to make the round trip from Liverpool in under six months. Later in her career, the ship was used as a cargo ship before running aground off Cavendish, Prince Edward Island, in 1883. Design and description The vessel was initially designed as a cargo ship. The ship was of a medium clipper design which had an unusually sharp bow, tall masts and was broad amidships. The design was considered stable and able to withstand the punishment of the open sea.Hollenberg, pp. 13–14 Marco Polo was a long with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a hold depth of . Marco Polo weighed 1,625 tons. The ship was square rigged and fitted with the roller reefing system that allowed the sails to be reefed from the deck rather than have the crew go up into the sails. The vessel had three masts and carried up to of sail.Hollenberg, pp. 24, 71 Marco Polo was later reduced to barque rig in 1874. The clipper had three decks with a height between decks of . After conversion to a passenger ship in 1852, the vessel's hull was coated with a layer of felt and tar and then sheathed in copper to prevent fouling. The vessel had three classes of travel; steerage, intermediate and cabin class.Hollenberg, pp. 29, 60, 64, 66 Those in steerage were placed in berths of 6 feet square (36 square feet) with four to six people per berth. The passengers were divided up between single male, female and families over three decks, with single men given berths forward, single women aft and families placed in between. The berths usually contained double bunks and separate lavatories were maintained for each sex.Hollenberg, p. 60, 64 Intermediate passengers had quarters placed between the decks and received better fare than the steerage class and took their meals separately. They too were berthed four to six per berth, but had access to steward service.Hollenberg, p. 66 The cabin class passengers had individual cabins 6 feet square (36 square feet) located aft around the sides of the ship. The cabin class passengers had access to the poop deck for exercise. The cabins were furnished by the passengers with the aid of the ship's carpenters to prevent their movement during rough seas. For meals, the cabin class passengers ate in the dining saloon which lay at the end of the central corridor onto which all the cabins opened on to.Hollenberg, p. 64 Service history The vessel was constructed at Marsh Creek in Saint John, New Brunswick by James Smith. Construction began in Fall 1850. While under construction the ship's frame was scattered about the shipyard by a storm and the skeleton had to be reassembled. The construction was completed in April 1851 and the vessel was launched at Marsh Creek. The launch was disastrous, as Marco Polo touched the bank of the creek while sliding down the slipway. The vessel went over on her side and became stuck in the mud of Marsh Creek. The uneven pressure from the weight of the ship caused the keel to become curved so it was higher in the middle than at the ends. Marco Polo was refloated two weeks after launching and was registered on May 26, 1851 under the ownership of James Smith and his son, James Thomas Smith.Hollenberg, pp. 16, 21, 24–26 =Cargo trade= On May 31, 1851 Marco Polo sailed from Saint John to Liverpool, England with a cargo of timber, making the crossing in 15.3 days.Jefferson, p. 54 The vessel's maiden voyage under William Thomas was a success and upon arrival, was offered for sale by James Smith. Marco Polo did not sell and the clipper was sent in ballast to Mobile, Alabama to pick up a cargo of cotton. The clipper made a second voyage to Liverpool, this time under the command of Amor Crosby.Hollenberg, pp. 26–27Jefferson, p. 55 In February 1852, James Smith transferred all his shares in the clipper to his son, James Thomas Smith who then sold the vessel to Paddy McGee. McGee then flipped Marco Polo for profit to James Baines of James Baines & Co..Hollenberg, pp. 27–28 =Emigrant ship= In 1852, the ship was purchased by James Baines for the Black Ball Line and converted for passenger service between England and Australia to take advantage of the growing emigrant movement following the Australian gold rush.Hollenberg, p. 32 On Marco Polos first voyage to Australia, the clipper carried over 900 people.Lubbock, p. 32 Of them, 138 were Cabin or Intermediate class and 750 steerage and 60 crew. Of them 327 were children and 661 were Highland Scots. At the time of the clipper's departure, Marco Polo was the largest ship to travel to Australia.Lubbock, p. 34 Marco Polo sailed from Liverpool under the command of James Forbes on July 4, 1852 and arrived at Port Phillip, Australia in 68 days, on September 18.Jefferson, p. 60 After spending three weeks in port, the ship returned to Liverpool in another 76 days. The total trip time was 5 months 21 days, making this the first recorded round trip in less than six months.Lubbock, p. 35 During the first voyage, 52 children died from measles, which led to new rules about the age of young children allowed aboard on subsequent voyages.Hollenberg, p. 90 On her return voyage the ship carried £100,000 in gold dust and a 340-ounce gold nugget that was a gift to Queen Victoria from the colonial government.Lubbock, p. 36Hollenberg, p. 100 Upon the vessel's return to Liverpool, the ship carried a banner claiming \\"Fastest Ship in the World\\".Hollenberg, p. 1 On the clipper's second voyage, Marco Polo sailed with 648 passengers and £90,000 of specie.Lubbock, p. 37 Marco Polo departed on March 13, 1853 and arrived at Melbourne on May 29.Hollenberg, pp. 102–103 At the end of the second voyage, James Forbes was replaced as captain of the vessel by Charles McDonald. He captained the clipper for her third voyage, leaving in November 1853 with 666 passengers on board.Lubbock, p. 40 McDonald was replaced as captain by W. Wild, who sailed on the fourth voyage, taking 95 days from Liverpool to Australia and 85 days for the return trip. He was replaced by Captain Clarke for the fifth voyage to Australia, taking a total of 167 days, round-trip. The fifth voyage transported 520 emigrants to Australia and returned with 125,000 ounces of gold. It has been asserted, \\"One in every twenty Australians can trace his or her roots to Marco Polo.\\" In total, Marco Polo made roughly 25 round trip voyages to Australia and averaged between 80 and 90 days each way. The clipper made her final Melbourne to Liverpool voyage in 76 days, beating the passenger steamship by 8 days. In 1867, Marco Polo failed the passenger survey and was returned to service as a cargo ship.Hollenberg, pp. 104–105 =Incidents= During the England to Australia runs, Marco Polo suffered two near mutinies. The first occurred in October 1854 after the captain beat the third mate, attacked another member of the crew and challenged all on board to a fight. 17 members of the crew deserted and the same night, the captain fired his cannon off in the port. The third mate complained to the police and the captain was fined £180. The second near mutiny took place on September 17, 1863 when some of the crew broke into the store and raided the alcohol. Some of the crew were found drunk in the morning and during the captain's investigation of the matter, the captain was challenged by the crew. In the end all use of alcohol was prohibited aboard the ship except by married persons.Hollenberg, p. 80 On December 6, 1855, the clipper parted her tow rope while leaving the Mersey, collided with the barque Glasgow and ran aground. Marco Polo became unstuck without significant damage and sailed for Melbourne, Victoria on December 7. She made another trip to Melbourne in 1856. On March 4, 1861 Marco Polo collided with an iceberg north of Cape Horn, her bowsprit lost, her bow and foremast damaged. The clipper arrived in Valparaiso leaking badly on May 2. After repairs the clipper continued to Liverpool where she arrived on May 22, 183 days after leaving Melbourne.Lubbock, p. 41 =Last voyages= The clipper remained in passenger service until 1867. In 1867, Marco Polo was converted back to cargo use. During her career as a cargo ship, the vessel carried guano, coal and timber and visited ports from Aden to Rio de Janeiro and around the Mediterranean Sea. In 1871, James Baines and Co. sold the vessel to Wilson and Blair of South Shields, England and used in the coal and timber trade. The vessel was altered in 1874 to a barque rig and her wooden masts were removed and the clipper was fitted with an iron mast and the yards were shortened by . In the 1870s, Marco Polo waited at Callao for over 18 months for a load of guano. This was due to a dispute between the Guano Shipping Association and British shipping underwriters. In the early 1880s, the vessel's hull was deteriorating so to strengthen it, chains were wrapped around it and a windmill-driven pump was installed to counter increasing leakage. In 1881, Marco Polo was purchased by Bell and Lawes of South Shields and in 1882, the ownership was transferred to Captain A. Bull of Christiana. On June 27 a fire broke out while in port at Quebec with little damage.Hollenberg, pp. 113–114 On July 19, 1883 Marco Polo departed Montmorency, Quebec for Europe with a load of timber. On July 22, the clipper encountered a gale and began to take on water. The pumps were unable to keep up with the leakage and Captain Bull ran the ship aground off Cavendish, Prince Edward Island.Hollenberg, p. 114 After Marco Polo went aground, her masts were cut down to prevent the wind from blowing Marco Polo further onshore. The cargo was sold off to parties from Saint John. The timber had swollen so much that it was necessary to cut through the vessel's beams to retrieve them. In August 1883, a strong storm caused the vessel to break up along the coast.Hollenberg, pp. 116–118 Wreck and reconstruction Replica stern carvings from Marco Polo, on display in the Merseyside Maritime Museum. Replica stern carvings from Marco Polo, on display in the Merseyside Maritime Museum. The wreck site is in the waters immediately offshore from Prince Edward Island National Park and is considered a National Historic Site. A ship portrait and many artifacts from the ship are on display at the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John, New Brunswick. Another ship portrait is displayed at the Yarmouth County Museum & Archives in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The original half- model of Marco Polo now lies in the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.Hollenberg, pp. 17, 23, 122 A replica, named Marco Polo II, was constructed in Saint John over 30 years at the cost of over $50,000. The replica was located within the Port of Saint John in 2015. The replica was built by its creator, Barry Ogden, out of civic pride.

It is native to eastern North America, primarily east of the Mississippi River, where it is widespread. It is the most broadly distributed member of the genus Collinsonia, ranging north to Quebec and south to Florida. Its natural habitat is nutrient-rich mesic forests, most often in rocky, calcareous areas.IllinoisWildflowers It produces lemon-scented flowers in mid- summer, a time when little else is in bloom in densely shaded forests. Traditional herbal use Collinsonia canadensis was used by Native Americans to treat a variety of ailments. However, European-American settlers in North America did not often use this species after they initially discovered it, due to it lacking any conspicuous toxic qualities. It wasn't until the mid-1800s when it regained popularity as a medicinal herb. The leaves can be brewed into tea, and the subterranean stem was once used as a diuretic, tonic, and astringent.

In 1878 the school was named Högre allmänna läroverket, and in 1968 renamed Söderportskolan in connection with a nationwide reform. In 2002 the school received its current name to better illustrate the level of education conducted there (Swedish gymnasium = upper secondary school).

Although not a palm tree (Arecaceae), its growth habit is superficially similar to a palm; therefore it is commonly known as cardboard palm or cardboard cycad. Other names include cardboard plant, cardboard sago, Jamaican sago, and Mexican cycad (from Mexican Spanish Cícada Mexicana). The plant's binomial name comes from the Latin zamia, for \\"pine nut\\", and furfuracea, meaning \\"mealy\\" or \\"scurfy\\". Description and ecology The plant has a short, sometimes subterranean trunk up to 20 cm broad and high, usually marked with scars from old leaf bases. It grows very slowly when young, but its growth accelerates after the trunk matures. Including the leaves, the whole plant typically grows to 1.3 m tall with a width of about 2 m. Leaflets The leaves radiate from the center of the trunk; each leaf is 50–150 cm long with a petiole 15–30 cm long, and 6-12 pairs of extremely stiff, pubescent (fuzzy) green leaflets. These leaflets grow 8–20 cm long and 3–5 cm wide. Occasionally, the leaflets are toothed toward the tips. The circular crowns of leaves resemble fern or palm fronds. They are erect in full sun, horizontal in shade. This plant produces a rusty-brown cone in the center of the female plant. The egg-shaped female (seed-producing) cones and smaller male (pollen- producing) cone clusters are produced on separate plants. Pollination is by certain insects, namely the belid weevil Rhopalotria mollis. Cardboard cycads can only be reproduced by the fleshy, brightly crimson-colored seeds produced by the female plants. The germination process is very slow and difficult to achieve in cultivation; as a result, many plants sold for horticultural use are illegally collected in the wild, leading to the species being classified as endangered. This plant is easy to care for and grows best in moist, well- drained soil. They do well in full sun or shade, but not in constant deep shade. They are fairly salt- and drought-tolerant but should be protected from extreme cold. They should occasionally be fed with palm food. After Cycas revoluta, this is probably the most popular cycad species in cultivation. In temperate regions, it is commonly grown as a houseplant and, in subtropical areas, as a container or bedding plant outdoors. All parts of the plant are poisonous to animals, including humans. The toxicity causes liver and kidney failure, as well as eventual paralysis. Dehydration sets in very quickly. No treatment for the poisoning is currently known.

It is owned by The McClatchy Company and ranks fourth in circulation among the company's newspapers. The Fresno Bee was founded in 1922 by the McClatchy brothers Charles Kenny (C.K.) and Valentine Stuart (V.S.), sons of The Sacramento Bee's second editor James McClatchy. C.K.'s only son Carlos McClatchy became The Fresno Bee's first editor. The two Central Valley newspapers, closely linked by family ownership and editorial philosophy, formed the core of what later grew into The McClatchy Company. In 1926, the McClatchys purchased an older Fresno newspaper, The Republican. The Fresno Republican had been founded in 1876, by Dr. Chester A. Rowell and a group of investors that included inventor and entrepreneur Frank Dusy. In 1932, The Fresno Bee took over the subscription lists of The Fresno Republican and merged the newspapers. The Fresno Bee began publishing the Spanish newspaper Vida en el Valle in 1990.The paper launched its website in 1996; in November 2005, the paper integrated its online operations into the paper's other departments. The Bee was following the example of The New York Times and other newspapers hoping to combine the creative strengths of the worlds of digital and print journalism. In 2004, The Fresno Bee purchased the Sierra Star in Oakhurst. Since 2017, the paper's relationship with their hometown representative Devin Nunes has deteriorated. Nunes took issue with several op- eds the paper had published on his handling of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Nunes responded by airing TV ads attacking the paper and mailing constituents a 40-page glossy pamphlet solely focused on attacking The Bee's reputation.

The Solicitor-General for Ireland was the holder of an Irish and then (from the Act of Union 1800) United Kingdom government office. The holder was a deputy to the Attorney-General for Ireland, and advised the Crown on Irish legal matters. At least two holders of the office, Patrick Barnewall (1534–1550) and Roger Wilbraham (1586-1603), played a leading role in Government. As with the Solicitor General for England and Wales, the Solicitor-General for Ireland was usually a barrister rather than a solicitor. The first record of a Solicitor General is in 1511, although the office may well be older than that. Early Solicitors invariably held the rank of Serjeant-at-law. In the sixteenth century a Principal Solicitor for Ireland shared the duties of the office: confusingly both were usually referred to as \\"the Solicitor\\". Elizabeth I thought poorly of her Irish-born Law Officers, and from 1584 onwards there was a practice, which lasted for several decades, of appointing English-born lawyers as Solicitor General. At least one of them, Sir Roger Wilbraham (1586-1603), was a key figure in the Dublin government for many years. Unlike the Attorney General he was not as a rule a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, although he might be summoned by the Council to advise it.Delaney, V.T. H. Christopher Palles Allen Figgis and Co Dublin 1960 p.60 With the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the duties of both the Attorney General and Solicitor General for Ireland were taken over by the Attorney General of Ireland, and the office of Solicitor General was abolished, apparently as an economy measure. This led to complaints over many years about the undue burden of work which was placed on the Attorney General, whose office was seriously understaffed until the 1930s.

Currently, there are over 30,000 MIDI sequences hosted on the site across approximately 47 gaming platforms. The SNES directory has the most MIDI sequences of any directory on this site. VGMusic.com is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, video game music websites online. The owner of the website is Michael Newman (Yaginuma), who graduated from the University of Connecticut and who is a chemical engineer by day. Day-to-day site operations are maintained by a small team of volunteer staff members, performing tasks such as server administration, site updates and archive maintenance. General VGMusic.com accepts remakes/covers, arrangements, and remixes of video game music in MIDI format. The MIDI sequences are typically General MIDI and GM2 standard, but sequences that use proprietary MIDI standards like Roland GS and Yamaha XG are also available on the site. Formerly RIFF MIDI (RMI) format sequences were also available, but currently only MIDI types 0 and 1 (MID) are available. The community is driven by a user-base of musicians from around the world, who transcribe the music into midi format by ear using sequencing software. In addition to the music sections for game consoles and home computer systems, there is also a Medley section. Submitted medleys consist of music selections from anything between one game and multiple games and franchises; the style or theme of the medleys is at the discretion of the sequencers. There is also a Piano Only section, which hosts sequences transcribed to use two MIDI tracks, one for each hand on piano. These sequences can subsequently be opened using appropriate score-writing software, and printed out as sheet music. Arrangements for piano duet and organ are also accepted. No users receive money for submitting their sequences, and there are no paid staff sequencers employed by the site. Submission process and site standards When the site was initially launched, there was a greater emphasis on quantity rather than quality, but the expected quality of submissions has risen as the user base and popularity of the site has steadily increased over its life-time. The standards are typically lower for songs not currently in the archive, and are often elevated for songs that have been sequenced many times before. The expected quality of remixes is also high. Updates occur infrequently; the staff asserts that infrequent large updates are easier to perform than frequent smaller ones with the way the site is currently designed.Frequently Asked Questions - General Site Questions E-mail notifications are sent when files are accepted or rejected, occasionally with feedback with advice for improving the sequence for later revisions or informing the user on what they could do to ensure their sequence is accepted on subsequent submissions. However, there is currently no error-checking done on names or e-mail addresses, meaning users that submit false information will not receive e-mails. Any file can be removed at the discretion of the staff if they feel it is not up to the site's standards, even after approval. However, many files that were accepted in the site's early days have been grandfathered in, despite not meeting the current standards. =Controversy and reform= Some music is not permitted to be hosted on the site, at the request of the original composers. The PC section of the site was also removed, but reinstated again several years later, with a warning to not upload rips or conversions of music taken directly from games. There is also a list of composers whose work is not accepted on the site for any apparent reason.

In Russian, the word (; meaning 'nihilism', ) came to represent the movement's of pre-existing ideals. Even as it was yet unnamed, the movement arose from a generation of young radicals disillusioned with the social reformers of the past, and from a growing divide between the intelligentsia of the genteel and non-genteel social classes. Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, as stated in the Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"defined nihilism as the symbol of struggle against all forms of tyranny, hypocrisy, and artificiality and for individual freedom.\\" Though philosophically both nihilistic and skeptical, Russian nihilism was not a unilateral negation of ethics and knowledge as may be falsely assumed, nor did it necessarily espouse meaninglessness. It did, however, incorporate theories of hard determinism, atheism, materialism, positivism, and rational egoism. As such, it aimed to assimilate and distinctively recontextualize core elements of European Enlightenment thought into Russia while rejecting the Westernizers of the previous generation. Nihilists inevitably fell into conflict with religious authorities from the Orthodox Church, as well as with prevailing rigid family structures and the Tsarist autocracy. Although predominantly associated with revolutionary activism, most nihilists were not political—instead seeing politics as an outdated mode of society. They held that until a negation of current conditions had taken place the positive role of politics could not properly be formulated. Among some nihilists however, communal principles began to develop, though their formulations in this regard remained vague. With the widespread revolutionary arson of 1862, a number of assassinations and attempted assassinations of the 1860s and 70s, and the eventual assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881, Russian nihilism was fiercely mischaracterized throughout Europe as political terrorism and violent criminality. As Kropotkin states, terrorism was particular to given historical conditions of the revolutionary struggle and not to nihilist philosophy itself, which in turn however, scholar Gillespie adds, was central to revolutionary thought in Russia throughout the lead-up to the Russian Revolution.  Definition  The term nihilism has been widely misused in the West when discussing the Russian movement, especially in relation to revolutionary activity. Criticizing this misterming by Western commentators, Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky stated that revolutionaries themselves simply identified as socialist revolutionaries, or informally as radicals. However, from outside Russia, the term nihilist was misapplied to the entirety of the country's revolutionary milieu. The Encyclopædia Britannica attributes the probable first use of the term in Russian publication to Nikolai Nadezhdin who, like Vasilij Bervi and Vissarion Belinsky after him, used it synonymously with skepticism. Nadezhdin himself had applied the term to Aleksandr Pushkin. From there, nihilism was interpreted as a revolutionary social menace by the well-known conservative journalist Mikhail Katkov, for its negation of moral principles. The term came into favour when accusations of materialism proved no longer sufficiently derogatory. The intellectual origins of the nihilist movement can be traced back to 1855 and perhaps earlier, where it was principally a philosophy of moral and epistemological skepticism. However, it was not until 1862 that the term was first popularized, when Ivan Turgenev in his celebrated novel Fathers and Sons used nihilism to describe the disillusionment of the younger generation, the , towards both the traditionalists and the progressive reformists that came before them, the . This at a time when the terms faced by serfs under the emancipation reform of 1861 were seen as bitterly failing. The movement very soon adopted the name, despite the novel's initial harsh reception among both the conservatives and younger generation, and wherever the term was not embraced it was at least accepted. The term realist was used by Dmitry Pisarev to describe the nihilist position and was also the name of a literary movement, literary realism, which had flourished in Russia in the wake of Pushkin. Although Pisarev was among those who celebrated the embrace of nihilism, the term realism may have done away with the connotations of subjectivism and nothingness that burdened nihilism while retaining the rejection of metaphysics, sophistry, sentimentalism, and aestheticism. In a notably later political climate, Alexander Herzen instead presented nihilism as a product of the that the had adopted. Contemporary scholarship has challenged the equating of Russian nihilism with mere skepticism, instead identifying it with the fundamentally character of the nihilist movement. In fact, the nihilists sought to liberate the Promethean might of the Russian people which they saw embodied in a class of prototypal individuals, or new types in their own words. These individuals were seen by Nikolay Chernyshevsky as rational egoists, by Pisarev and Nikolai Shelgunov as the thinking proletariat, by Pyotr Lavrov as critically thinking personalities, by Nikolay Mikhaylovsky as the intelligentsia, and by others as cultural pioneers. Nihilism has also been attributed to a perennial temperament of the Russian people, existing long before the movement's nascency. Overlapping with forms of Narodism, the movement has also been defined in political terms. Soviet scholarship, for example, often interchanges the designation revolutionary democrats. However, the role of politics was seen as not suited to the current environment by most nihilists. Rather, they disregarded politics, and those who notably held political views or socialist sympathies remained vague. Russian nihilism has also been defined in subcultural terms, in philosophical terms, and incorrectly as a form of political terrorism.  Formative period  Russian nihilism, as stated in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\"is perhaps best regarded as the intellectual pool of the period 1855–66 out of which later radical movements emerged\\". During this foundational period, the countercultural aspects of the movement scandalized the country and even minor indiscretions left nihilists imprisoned for lengthy periods or in exile to Siberia, where grittier revolutionary attitudes fermented. At its core, Russian nihilism inhabited an ever-evolving discourse between the and the . While nihilism was not exclusive from them, the were on principle a generation given to idealism. \\"Their attraction to the airy heights of idealism was partly a result of the stultifying political atmosphere of the autocracy, but was also an unintended consequence of Tsar Nicholas I's attempt to Russian society\\", writes historian Michael Allen Gillespie. \\"Their flight from the harsh reality of everyday life into the ideal was prepared on an intellectual legel by the theosophy of Freemasonry, which exercised great intellectual force in Russian at the time, especially among those whose intellectual education had been shaped by Böhemian mysticism of the radical orthodox sects, the so-called Old Believers.\\" Despite this, the provided the fertile soil for the 's ideological advancements, even in their confrontations. = = Russian materialism, as its own tradition, dawned in the period 1855–1866 under the influence of post- Hegelian German materialism and the delayed influence of the French Enlightenment, and came to be synonymous with Russian nihilism. The origins of this followed from Ludwig Feuerbach as a direct reaction to the German idealism which had found such popularity under the —namely the works of Friedrich Schelling, Georg Hegel and Johann Fichte. However, it was in fact those among the who were characterized as nihilists at first, and it was Left Hegelianism that the Schellingians began to define as nihilism. One such materialist who worked to bring a radical slant to Hegelian thought was Mikhail Bakunin, himself an anarchist and gentry . In his 1842 \\"Reaction in Germany\\", Bakunin espoused the radical dictum: This celebration of destructive passion was almost in anticipation of the nihilist to come. Of those early materialists, Bakunin was of considerable influence to Russian nihilism, even contributing to its cause, though he denies a place among the nihilists himself and must be considered separate from radicals of the . As a Left Hegelian, and especially in his younger years, his political dedication stemmed from a more romantic, idealistic approach to the dialectical process of the . As well as this, Bakunin was a Westernizer—a group which on the whole was seen as obsolete to the nihilists. Despite this, Bakunin is often seen as among the first nihilists, a position he callously also assigns to the German philosopher Max Stirner. Among the Westernizers was another significant impact on the history of Russian nihilism, Alexander Herzen. As early as the 1840s, Herzen involved in radical circles in Moscow where he circulated the ideas of socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, in rejection of both utopian and Jacobin forms of socialism. Other preliminary figures of this generation include Ivan Turgenev and Vissarion Belinsky. It was not until the death of Nicholas I in 1855, and the end of the Crimean War the following year, that this Feuerbachian materialist trend developed into a broad philosophical movement. Alexander II's ascent to the throne brought liberal reforms to university entry regulations and loosened control over publication, much to the movement's good fortune. Where those early thinkers such as Bakunin and Herzen had found use of Fitche and Hegel, the that followed were set on their rejection of idealism. German materialists Ludwig Büchner, Jacob Moleschott, and Carl Vogt became favourites. The ideas of John Stuart Mill, though his bourgeois liberalism was detested, lent notable influence to the movement. Later, Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck also gained importance. Often considered the first of the , Nikolay Chernyshevsky became an admirer of Feuerbach, Herzen, and Belinsky towards the end of the 1840s. It was at this time that he drew towards socialist materialism and was in close contact with members of the Petrashevsky Circle. By the late 1850s however, Chernyshevsky had become politically radicalized and began to reject Herzen's social discourse, devoting himself instead to the revolutionary socialist cause. Alongside Chernyshevsky came Ivan Sechenov, who would later be credited as the father of Russian physiology and scientific psychology by Ivan Pavlov. Chernyshenvsky and Sechenov shared the argument that the natural sciences were wholly adequate to study human and animal life according to a deterministic model, and Sechenov lent particular influence to Chernyshevsky in this regard. This more subtle argument was favoured since state censorship made no allowance for outwardly challenging its religious doctrines. Yet another , Nikolay Dobrolyubov, further elborated the ideas of Russian materialism and is at times seen as a leading nihilist. Dobrolyubov had in fact occasionally used the term nihilism prior to its popularization at the hands of Turgenev, which he had picked up from sociologist and fellow Vasilij Bervi-Flerovskij, who in turn had used it synonymously with skepticism. Together with Chernyshevsky, of whom he was a disciple and comrade, Dobrolyubov wrote for the literary journal Sovremennik—Chernyshevsky being its principle editor. With their contributions, the journal became the primary organ of revolutionary thought in its time. The two of them, later followed by Maxim Antonovich and Dmitry Pisarev, had taken up the Russian tradition of social criticism crossed literary criticism which Belinsky had begun. The discoursing of Russian literature allowed them the vehicle to have their ideas published that censorship would not have otherwise granted. Pisarev himself wrote at first for Rassvet and then for Russkoye Slovo—the latter of which came to rival Sovremennik in its influence over the radical movement.  Emergence of the raznočinnaja intelligentsia  The , which began as an 18th-century legal designation for those of miscellaneous lower-class, by the 19th century had become a distinct yet ambiguously defined social class and gave rise to the stratum among the intelligentsia. The , meaning 'of indeterminate rank', were neither peasants, foreigners, tributary natives, nor urban taxpayers such as merchants, guildsmen, and townsfolk, but instead included lower-class families of clergymen, civil servants, retired military servicemen, and minor officials. While many of the most prominent nihilist were raised free from the extremes of poverty and repression, instead born to genteel families or clergymen, a connection between radicals of the generation and the has often been emphasized in comparison to the hegemony of the gentry intelligentsia among the previous generation. As early as the 1840s, the gained significant influence over the development of Russian society and culture, the intelligentsia of this class (or intelligentsia) also being referred to as the revolutionary intelligentsia. Vissarion Belinsky and members of the Petrashevsky Circle were among these, being prominent figures of the movement to abolish serfdom. Nikolay Chernyshevsky, who was born to a priest, spent his years as a student during the 1840s. He began writing for the literary journal Otechestvennye Zapiski in 1853, and then for Sovremennik.   Ilya Repin's portrait of Ivan Turgenev, who popularized the term nihilism with his character Bazarov , as popularized by Dmitry Pisarev, was the marked embrace of the style and cynicism of the nihilist character Yevgeny Bazarov from Ivan Turgenev's Fathers and Sons, in which the term nihilism was first popularized. Pisarev graduated university in 1861, the same year as serfdom was abolished and the first major student demonstration was held in St. Petersburg. Turgenev himself notes that as early as 1862, the year of the novel's publishing, violent protestors had begun calling themselves nihilists. The surge of student activism became the backdrop for Alexander II's education reforms, under the supervision of education minister Aleksandr Vasilevich Golovnin. These reforms however, while conceding an expansion of the intelligentsia, refused to grant more rights to students and university admittance remained exclusively male. Historian Kristian Petrov writes: Literary works and journals quickly became enrapt with polemical debate over nihilism. Nikolay Chernyshevsky for his part saw Turgenev's novel as a personal attack on Nikolay Dobrolyubov, and Maxim Antonovich excoriated it in his review. Pisarev famously published his own review at the time of the novel's release, where he championed Bazarov as the role model for the new generation and celebrated the embrace of nihilism. To him, Bazarovism was the societal struggle that must be toiled through rather than resisted—he attributed it to the exclusive and distinct spiritual strength of the young and their courage to face social disorder. The popularity of Pisarev's review rivaled that of even the novel itself. The atmosphere of the 1860s had led to a period of great social and economic upheaval across the country and the driving force of revolutionary activism was taken up by university students in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Mass arson broke out in St. Petersburg in the spring and summer of 1862 and, coinciding with insurrections in Poland, in 1863. Fyodor Dostoevsky saw Nikolay Chernyshevsky as responsible for inciting the revolutionaries to action and supposedly pleaded with him to bring a stop to it. Historian James Buel writes that while St. Petersburg faced threat of destruction, arson became rampant all throughout Russia. Turgenev's own opinion of Bazarov is highly ambiguous, stating: \\"Did I want to abuse Bazarov or extol him? I do not know myself, since I don't know whether I love him or hate him!\\" Nevertheless, Bazarov represented the victory of the intelligentsia over the gentry intelligentsia to which Turgenev belonged. Comparing to Ivan Goncharov's The Precipice, which he describes as a caricature of nihilism, Peter Kropotkin states in his memoirs that Bazarov was a more admiral portrayal yet was still found dissatisfying to nihilists for his harsh attitude, his coldness towards his old parents, and his neglect of duties as a citizen.  Climax of Russian materialism  With the death of Dobrolyubov in 1861 and the arrest of Chernyshevsky in 1862, the movement fell to Pisarev and others. Maxim Antonovich became head of Sovremennik's literary criticism department and entered into bitter disputes with other publications, namely with Pisarev at Russkoye Slovo. Tensions between the two journals boiled over into what Fyodor Dostoevsky deemed the schism between the nihilists, further pointing to Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin as giving the Sovremennik a now regressive character. Chernyshevsky published his landmark 1863 novel What Is to Be Done? while being held at Peter and Paul Fortress as a political prisoner. Ironically, despite being the most openly revolutionary work of its time and a direct product of the suppression Chenryshevsky had faced, the book passed censorship by an extraordinary failure of bureaucracy and was published without issue. Chernyshevsky continued to write essays and literature while incarcerated. In 1864, he was sentenced and given a mock execution before being exiled to Siberia, where he served seven years in forced labour camps followed by further imprisonment. Chernyshevsky gained a legendary reputation as a martyr of the radical movement and, unlike Mikhail Bakunin, not once did he plead for mercy or pardon during his treatment at the hands of the state. After struggling in the face of censorship, from which much of its core content is left unclear and obscured, Russian materialism among theoreticians would later be suppressed by the state after an attempted assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1866, and would not see a significant intellectual revival until the late nineteenth century. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy states: = Conspiratorial organizations = Revolutionary organizations during the 1860s took only the form of conspiratorial groups. From the revolutionary turmoil of the years 1859–1861, which had included peasant uprisings in Bezdna and Kandievka, the secret society Zemlya i volya emerged under the strong influence of Nikolay Chernyshevsky's writings. Among its key members were Nikolai Serno-Solovyevich, his brother Aleksandr Serno- Solovyevich, Aleksandr Sleptsov, Nikolai Obruchev and Vasily Kurochkin. The full extent of the organization spanned St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Perm, and several cities in Ukraine. The group supported the intellectual development of social and political thought that expressed the critical interests of the Russian peasantry, and also worked to publish and disseminate prohibited revolutionary writings and ideas to commoners, intellectuals, and soldiers. Alexander Herzen, Nikolay Ogarev, and Mikhail Bakunin all kept contact with its leadership. Zemlya i volya accrued supporters within the Russian military and allied itself with revolutionary activity in Poland. In league with the organization was the Ishutin Circle, founded in Moscow in 1863, under the leadership of Nikolai Ishutin. Historian Shneer Mendelevich Levin writes: After the disappearance of Zemlya i volya, the Ishutin Circle began to unite various underground groups in Moscow. The group arranged the escape of Polish revolutionary Jarosław Dąbrowski from prison in 1864. The same year, the group founded a bookbinding workshop, then in 1865, a sewing workshop, a tuition-free school, and a cotton wadding cooperative. They failed, however, in their attempts to arrange Chernyshevsky's escape from penal servitude. Ties were forged with Russian political , Polish revolutionaries, and fellow organizations in Saratov, Nizhny Novgorod, Kaluga Province, and elsewhere. The Circle then formed a steering committee, known as the Organization, and a sub-group within it known as Hell. Dmitry Karakozov, who was the cousin of Nikolai Ishutin, joined the Circle in 1866 and on April 4th of that year carried out an attempted assassination of Alexander II, firing a shot at the Tsar at the gates of the Summer Garden in Saint Petersburg. The attempt failed and Karakozov was sentenced to death. Nikolai Ishutin was also arrested and sentenced to be executed before ultimately being exiled to a life of forced labour in Siberia. In total, thirty-two members of the Circle were sentenced. = First wave of antinihilism = Russian nihilists tied to chairs on horse-drawn platforms and paraded past groups of soldiers on their way to execution in St. Petersburg Following the attempted assassination of the Tsar in 1866, the political environment in Russia began returning to that of Nicholas I's rule. The two leading radical journals Sovremennik and Russkoye Slovo were banned, liberal reforms were minimized in fear of reaction from the public, and the educational system was reformed to stifle the existing revolutionary spirit. In the meantime, extensive castigation of nihilism had found its place in Russian publication, official government documents, and a burgeoning trend of antinihilistic literature. Notable earlier works of this literary current include Aleksey Pisemsky's Troubled Seas (1863), Nikolai Leskov's No Way Out (1864), and Viktor Klyushnikov's The Mirage (1864). Also in 1864, Fyodor Dostoevsky published his novel Notes from Underground, countering and satirizing Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?. In it, Dostoevsky offers a philosophical critique of Chernyshevsky's rational egoism yet from the perspective of a satirical protagonist, whom Dostoevsky posits as a more realistic portrayal of egoism—a dislikable glorifier of self-will rather than a magnanimous rationalizer of self-interest. virtuous fictional creations were not the genuine, flesh-and-blood egoists whose growing presence in Russia Dostoevsky feared\\", writes contemporary scholar James P. Scanlan. \\"Yet the doctrine these pseudo-egoists advanced–rational egoism–was a genuine danger, because by glorifying the self it could turn the minds of impressionable young people away from sound values and push them in the direction of a true, immoral, destructive egoism.\\" Dostoevsky published his following work, Crime and Punishment, in 1866, particularly in response to Pisarev's writings.  Revolutionary period  Next followed the revolutionary period of the 1870s and early 1880s, when Sergei Nechayev's pamphlet Catechism of a Revolutionary heightened aggression within the movement and pressed for violent conflict against the tsarist regime, leading to dozens of actions against the Russian state. Karl Marx quickly became interested in the revolutionary activity in Russia, even offering his support towards Nikolay Chernyshevsky's freedom from penal servitude, whom he considered the most original contemporary thinker and economist, though this was declined under fear that outside pressure may worsen the situation. = Sergey Nechayev's nihilist revolution = Sergey Nechayev, nihilist revolutionary most often associated with propaganda of the deed and terrorism The shift from the formative period to the revolutionary period can be traced to the emergence of Sergey Nechayev and his impact on the movement. While the majority of nihilists have been equated to the lower middle class and desired an escalation of the discourse on social transformation, Nechayev was the son of a serf. He argued that – just as the European monarchies used the ideas of Niccolò Machiavelli and the Catholic Jesuits practiced absolute immorality to achieve their ends – there was no action that could not be used for the sake of the people's revolution. A scholar noted: \\"His apparent immorality derived from the cold realization that both Church and State are ruthlessly immoral in their pursuit of total control. The struggle against such powers must therefore be carried out by any means necessary\\". Nechayev's social cache was greatly increased by his association with Bakunin in 1869 and the use of resources from the Bakhmetiev Fund for Russian revolutionary propaganda. The image of Nechayev is as much from his Catechism of a Revolutionist (1869) as any actions that he actually took. His Catechism established the clear break between the formation of nihilism as a political philosophy and its transformation into a practice of revolutionary action. It documents the revolutionary as a much-evolved figure from the nihilist of the past decade. Whereas the nihilist may have practiced asceticism, they argued for an uninhibited hedonism. Nechayev assessed that by definition the revolutionary must live devoted to a singular aim, undistracted by emotions or attachments. Friendship was contingent on revolutionary fervor, relationships with strangers were quantified in terms of what resources they offered the revolution, and everyone had a role during the revolutionary moment that could be reduced to how quickly they would be lined up against the wall or when they would accept that they had to do the shooting. The uncompromising tone and content of the Catechism was influential far beyond the mere character Nechayev personified in the minds of the revolutionaries. It extended nihilist principles into a revolutionary program and gave the revolutionary project a form of constitution and weight that the \\"men of the sixties\\" did not. = Re-establishment of Zemlya i volya = Zemlya i volya was re-established in 1876, originally under the name (Northern Revolutionary- Populist Group), by Mark Natanson and Alexander Dmitriyevich Mikhaylov. As a political party, the organization became the first to separate itself from past conspiratorial groups with its open advocacy of revolution. The party was predominated by Bakuninists, though became the first truly organization to emerge. = End of Nechayev and the first nihilist revolution = Bakunin, an admirer of Nechayev's zeal and success, provided contacts and resources to send Nechayev back to Russia as his representative of the Russian section of the World Revolutionary Alliance, which was also an imaginary organization. Upon his return to Russia, Nechayev formed the secret cell based organization People's Vengeance. Student member Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov questioned the very existence of the Secret Revolutionary Committee that Nechayev claimed to represent. This suspicion of Nechayev's modus operandi required action. Author Ronald Hingley wrote: \\"On the evening of 21 November 1869 the victim [Ivanov] was accordingly lured to the premises of the Moscow School of Agriculture, a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment, where Nechayev killed him by shooting and strangulation, assisted without great enthusiasm by three dupes. [...] Nechayev's accomplices were arrested and tried\\". Upon his return from Russia to Switzerland, Nechayev was rejected by Bakunin for taking militant actions and was later extradited back to Russia where he spent the remainder of his life at the Peter and Paul Fortress. Due to his charisma and force of will, Nechayev continued to influence events, maintaining a relationship to Narodnaya Volya and weaving even his jailers into his plots. He was found dead in his cell in 1882.

The rooming house where he lived, and where that group often met, was similarly christened Niggerati Manor. The group included Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, and several of the people behind Thurman's journal FIRE!! (which lasted for one issue in 1926), such as Richard Bruce Nugent (the associate editor of the journal), Jonathan Davis, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Aaron Douglas. The African-American bourgeoisie tried to distance itself from the slavery of the past and sought social equality and racial integration. The Niggerati themselves appeared to be relatively comfortable with their diversity of gender, skin color, and background. After producing FIRE!!, which failed because of a lack of funding, Thurman persuaded the Niggerati to produce another magazine, Harlem. This, too, lasted only a single issue. Origin In his autobiographical novel, Infants of the Spring, Thurman referred to the Harlem literati, whose pretensions he often considered to be spurious and whose achievements he often considered to be second-rate, as the Niggerati. (In the novel, Sweetie May Carr, a character modelled on the real-life Hurston, christens the Harlem rooming house where Dr Parkes, modelled on the real life Alain Locke, establishes a salon of artists, Niggerati Manor, just as Thurman's own rooming house was in real life.) Thurman himself was infamous amongst that literati, although popular amongst the younger, bohemian, crowd. Thurman rejected what he called \\"society Negroes\\". He himself, as many others of the literati did, would hold parties on Saturday nights, which Langston Hughes described in The Big Sea by observing that \\"at Wallace Thurman's you met the bohemians of both Harlem and the Village.\\" Recalling the days of Niggerati Manor, Theophilus Lewis wrote: All three of Hughes, Hurston, and Thurman enjoyed the shock value of referring to themselves as the Niggerati. Hurston's biographer Valerie Boyd described it as \\"an inspired moniker that was simultaneously self-mocking and self- glorifying, and sure to shock the stuffy black bourgeoisie\\". Hurston was actually the coiner of the name. The quickest wit in what was a very witty group, which encompassed Helene Johnson, Countee Cullen, Augusta Savage, Dorothy West (then a teacher), Harold Jackman, and John P. Davis (a law student at the time), as well as hangers-on, friends, and acquaintances, Hurston dubbed herself the \\"Queen of the Niggerati\\". In addition to Niggerati Manor, the rooming house at 267 West 136th Street where both Thurman and Hughes lived, Niggerati meetings were held at Hurston's apartment, with a pot on the stove, into which attendees were expected to contribute ingredients for stew. She also cooked okra, or fried Florida eel. Whilst Hughes, Hurston, and Thurman were comfortable with the appellation, others were less so. Cullen, for example, found Carl Van Vechten's novel Nigger Heaven so offensive that he refused to talk to him for 14 years. Hurston, though, had no trouble with language that challenged the sensibilities of others. She dubbed the well- heeled white liberals who were involved in the Harlem Renaissance \\"Negrotarians\\" (c.f. rotarian). FIRE!! FIRE!! itself represented the aesthetic frustrations of the Niggerati. Its single issue was published in November 1926, a year after the publication of Alain Locke's The New Negro. Whilst The New Negro was viewed by the Niggerati as subtle propaganda, appropriating their talents for racial propagandist purposes, FIRE!! was intended to be \\"devoted to the younger Negro artists\\", and was edited, paid for, and published by the Niggerati themselves, with the intention both of being purely aesthetic and of causing outrage amongst black literary critics. The journal's title came from a poem that Hughes had written, which was a sinner's lament in the fashion of a Negro spiritual. In a letter written to Locke, Hurston stated that there needed to be \\"more outlets for Negro fire\\", and the Niggerati distanced themselves even from Locke, declining his offer of patronage for the journal. =Organization= In addition to Nugent; Bennett, Douglas, Thurman, Hurston, and Hughes formed the journal's editorial board, with Thurman at the head. Davis was the business manager. Each editor was supposed to contribute 50 dollars towards the publication costs, although only three (not including Hurston) actually did. Thurman signed an I.O.U. for the printer, making him personally liable for the bill of nearly $1,000. He borrowed $150 from the Harlem Community Church, and another $150 from the Mutual League, only to be mugged on a street corner in Harlem, losing both all of the money and his clothing. For the next four years, Thurman's pay was attached in order to pay the debt. Hurston solicited subscriptions on a folklore-collecting trip to the South in 1927, in order to help, and both she and Hughes submitted essays to World Tomorrow, which had loaned money to FIRE!, to repay that loan. This shaky financial foundation was symptomatic of the troubles that beset the journal, one of the most major of which was that none of the Niggerati had time to work on it. By the Autumn of 1926, Hurston had begun a course at Barnard, Hughes had returned to college in Pennsylvania, Davis was at Harvard and occupied with editing Crisis, Bennett was at Howard and occupied with her column for Opportunity, and even Thurman had taken a new job editing World Tomorrow magazine. Nugent and Douglas were artists, not editors. One of Nugent's stories, submitted for publication, was destroyed accidentally whilst stored at Hurston's apartment, and he had to rewrite it. He did so on a roll of toilet paper, which he gave to Thurman. Nugent himself stated that the most amazing thing about FIRE!! was that it was ever published at all. In a final irony, the printer gave the entire print run of the magazine to the Niggerati, in the hope that they would sell better in quantity, only for several hundred copies to be lost in a fire in the basement in which they were stored. Hurston later commented \\"I suppose that 'Fire' has gone to ashes quite, but I still think the idea is good.\\". =Content= The one issue of FIRE!! to be published contained stories by several of the Niggerati, most of which had transgressions of moral and aesthetic boundaries as their themes. Thurman's story Cordelia the Crude was a story about a sixteen-year-old black girl becoming a prostitute -- an image that would have outraged black critics of the time, whose view of black female sexuality was that images of it should be moral. Nugent's story was Smoke, Lilies and Jade, an overtly homoerotic story with black and Latino protagonists, and the first such story published by an African American. Hurston submitted two stories, one of which, her play Color Struck (a reworked version of what she had won the 1925 'Opportunity contest with), Thurman had considered printing under a nom de plume, in order to prevent the issue being too \\"Zoraish\\". Like the other stories, Color Struck condemned the bourgeois attitude of envying whites, on biological and intellectual grounds, its subject being that of a woman who was so conscious of the colour of her skin that she missed out on the love of a good man. Her other submission was a short story entitled Sweat, which Hemenway praises as being \\"a remarkable work, her best fiction of the period\\", and observes that such stories could have led to the magazine's eventual success, had it not suffered from the other problems. =Reception= The Niggerati sought to challenge borgeoise attitudes with FIRE!!, and intended it (in Thurman's own words from his solicitation letters) to be \\"provocative ... to provide the shocks necessary to encourage new types of artistic interest and new types of artistic energy\\". However, their efforts failed. They were not taken very seriously. Most of the negative reactions were little stronger than slaps on the wrist. Locke criticized their \\"effete echoes of contemporary decadence\\" and yet praised their anti-Puritanism. The NAACP even handled some of the journal's prepublication publicity. Du Bois, editor of Crisis, simply ignored them. The way in which the Niggerati thought that FIRE!! was received reveals much about their intent in publishing it. Hughes wrote in The Big Sea that \\"None of the older Negro intellectuals would have anything to do with FIRE. Dr. Du Bois in Crisis roasted it.\\". In fact, Du Bois did no such thing. The only mention that FIRE!! received was a brief announcement in the January 1927 issue, calling it \\"a beautiful piece of printing\\" that was \\"strikingly illustrated by Aaron Douglas\\" and concluding \\"We bespeak for it wide support.\\". Hughes thought that Du Bois panned FIRE!! because he expected him to pan it, that being the reaction that he and the other Niggerati had intended to elicit. Nugent reported that once all initial submissions had been made, Thurman had asked the group for something that would get the journal banned in Boston, which led to the inclusion of Cordelia the Crude and Smoke, Lilies and Jade. Harlem The Niggerati's next magazine, Harlem, published in November 1928, was subtly different in tone to FIRE!!. Whilst still choosing themes that critics considered inappropriate and shocking, the magazine was more politically oriented, was more commercially viable, and had a wider variety of articles, stories, advertisements, and other contents. It also had a different look, and lacked the inter- generational rhetoric of FIRE!!. Thurman himself described it as a \\"wholly new type of magazine\\", with a new outlook, celebrating \\"a new day in the history of the American Negro\\". Thurman aimed the magazine squarely at the New Negroes envisioned by Locke and others. Unlike FIRE!!, Harlem was not intended solely a vehicle for the Niggerati themselves, but was intended to accept articles from anyone, as long as the authors had skill. =Organization= Most of the editors of FIRE!! also contributed to Harlem. They also approached other writers. One such was Nella Larsen, a friend of Peterson. Peterson had wanted no part in another magazine published by Thurman, and had been approached by Nugent and Scholley Alexander, to write a monthly theatrical column, under the pretext that Alexander was the editor. Upon receiving a thank-you letter with Thurman's name as editor on the letterhead, she withdrew, despite pleas from Alexander acknowledging Thurman's \\"selfish treatment of those who have helped him gain a place in the literary world\\" and stating that he would not let Thurman run amok. Alexander asked Peterson to ask her friends \\"to forbear -- to with-hold their criticism until they have the _first issue at hand_ to criticize\\" (original emphasis and underlining). Larsen also declined, on the grounds that she was not going to be paid for her submissions, confessing that her ultimate goal in writing was \\"money\\". \\"I write so slowly and with such great reluctance that it seems a waste of time.\\", she also observed. =Content= The first issue of Harlem contained essays by Lewis, Locke, Nugent, and Walter Francis White; poems by Helene Johnson, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Alice Dunbar Nelson, and Effie Newsom; stories by Roy de Coverly and George Little; and illustrations. Although intended to be more moderate than FIRE!!, Thurman abandoned this stance in later pages of the issue. His review of Larsen's Quicksand gave closer attention to the review of the novel given by Du Bois than it did to the novel itself, saying that Larsen \\"no doubt pleases Dr. Du Bois for she stays in her own sphere and writes about the sort of people one can invite to one's home without losing one's social prestige. She doesn't give white people the impression that all Negroes are gin drinkers, cabaret hounds and of the half world. Her Negroes are all of the upper class. And how!\\". =Reception= Like FIRE!!, Harlem also failed, with the readership responding unfavourably. Nugent wrote to Peterson after the publication of the first issue, expressing his disappointment and blaming the failure on \\"Wally's\\" editorship. According to Nugent, neither Alexander nor Douglas had been able, nor had had the strength, to counteract Thurman. Nugent himself had been on tour, with the cast of Porgy, whilst the issue was being edited. Nugent distanced himself from the magazine, and wanted it made clear to Van Vechten that he had not been \\"in any way responsible for the perpetration of Harlem\\". In December 1928, Thurman resigned from the magazine's editorial board.

The population in 2011 was 2,597,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 25.22 km².Eurostat History Church of Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe in central Porto Da Cruz The origin of the community's name came from the fact that the original discoverer affixed a steel cross at the port, in order to better identify the location to ocean travelers. During the early settlement of the northern coast, goods destined for the northern communities (such as Santo António da Serra) were offloaded in the harbor. The parish of Porto da Cruz was created on 26 September 1577, by Jerónimo Barreto, establishing as its patron Nossa Senhora da Piedade (). During the contract signing, the formal donation identified the new church as Nossa Senhora da Glória (), but after completion, it was consecrated as Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe (). Since its establishment, the parish pertained to the Captaincy of Machico, but in 1835, it was integrated into the municipality of Santana with the administrative reforms of the Liberal regime. On 19 October 1852, these changes were nullified and the parish returned to the municipality of Machico. Cultivation and harvesting of sugarcane occupied the activities of early settlers. The aguardente factory, completed after 1858, was part of this industry, converting the grapes and juice into a local spirit, uniquely cultivating the American caste of grape in this territory. Geography The northern parish is enveloped by the mountains of Paul da Serra: Pico da Suna (1040 metres), Pico do Larano (765 metres) and Pico da Maiata (766 metres) are the highest points in the parish. Even along the coast, Penha de Águia (a mountainous escarpment 580 metres in altitude) is difficult to climb; the area, Penha da Águia, means mountain of the eagles, giving the impression that only the birds settle these lands.

CEA is normally produced in gastrointestinal tissue during fetal development, but the production stops before birth. Consequently, CEA is usually present at very low levels in the blood of healthy adults (about 2-4 ng/mL). However, the serum levels are raised in some types of cancer, which means that it can be used as a tumor marker in clinical tests. Serum levels can also be elevated in heavy smokers. CEA are glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) cell-surface-anchored glycoproteins whose specialized sialofucosylated glycoforms serve as functional colon carcinoma L-selectin and E-selectin ligands, which may be critical to the metastatic dissemination of colon carcinoma cells. Immunologically they are characterized as members of the CD66 cluster of differentiation. The proteins include CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, CD66d, CD66e, CD66f. History CEA was first identified in 1965 by Phil Gold and Samuel O. Freedman in human colon cancer tissue extracts. Diagnostic significance The CEA blood test is not reliable for diagnosing cancer or as a screening test for early detection of cancer. Most types of cancer do not result in a high CEA level. Serum from individuals with colorectal carcinoma often has higher levels of CEA than healthy individuals (above approximately 2.5 µg/L). CEA measurement is mainly used as a tumor marker to monitor colorectal carcinoma treatment, to identify recurrences after surgical resection, for staging or to localize cancer spread through measurement of biological fluids. CEA levels may also be raised in gastric carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma, as well as some non-neoplastic conditions like ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, COPD, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism as well as in smokers. Elevated CEA levels should return to normal after successful surgical removal of the tumor and can be used in follow up, especially of colorectal cancers. CEA elevation is known to be affected by multiple factors. It varies inversely with tumor grade; well- differentiated tumors secrete more CEA. CEA is elevated more in tumors with lymph node and distant metastasis than in organ-confined tumors and, thus, varies directly with tumor stage. Left-sided tumors generally tend to have higher CEA levels than right-sided tumors. Tumors causing bowel obstruction produce higher CEA levels. Aneuploid tumors produce more CEA than diploid tumors. Liver dysfunction increases CEA levels as the liver is the primary site of CEA metabolism. Regions of high CEA levels in the body can be detected with the monoclonal antibody arcitumomab. Antibodies to CEA are also commonly used in immunohistochemistry to identify cells expressing the glycoprotein in tissue samples. In adults, CEA is primarily expressed in cells of tumors (some malignant, some benign) but they are particularly associated with the adenocarcinomas, such as those arising in the colon, lung, breast, stomach, or pancreas. It can therefore be used to distinguish between these and other similar cancers. For example, it can help to distinguish between adenocarcinoma of the lung and mesothelioma, a different type of lung cancer which is not normally CEA positive. Because even monoclonal antibodies to CEA tend to have some degree of cross-reactivity, occasionally giving false positive results, it is commonly employed in combination with other immunohistochemistry tests, such as those for BerEp4, WT1, and calretinin. Genetics CEA and related genes make up the CEA family belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In humans, the carcinoembryonic antigen family consists of 29 genes, 18 of which are normally expressed. The following is a list of human genes which encode carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion proteins: CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM4, CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, CEACAM8, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20, CEACAM21  See also  * List of histologic stains that aid in diagnosis of cutaneous conditions  References   External links  * * CEA at Lab Tests Online * CEA: analyte monograph from The Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine Category:Tumor markers Category:Immunoglobulin superfamily ","title":"Carcinoembryonic antigen"},{"id":"1610483","text":"Divali NagarDeyas flickering in the wind Divali Nagar (City of Lights) is an annual exposition of Hindu culture (broadly) and Indo-Trinidadian culture (specifically), it is associated with the celebration of Diwali in Trinidad and Tobago. The exposition is staged at the Divali Nagar Site, located in the borough of Chaguanas. This event was started in the Mid Centre Mall car park in late 1986. It was given a permanent site on the John Peters Road Extension off the Uriah Butler Highway a couple of years after. Although organised as a religious and cultural presentation, Divali Nagar has been criticised by some for the level of commercialization associated with the endeavour. Commercial activity, however, partly funds the Nagar, which really consumes a lot of resources. Emphasis must be placed on the several cultural and religious parts of the programme every year and the enormous positive impact it has had in Trinidad and the Caribbean as well as the diaspora living abroad. Diwali Nagar is the most significant Indian cultural event of the T&T; and possibly in the wider Caribbean and North America. It has set a trend in that now South Florida and other places have Diwali Nagars of their own. The festivities usually start one week prior to the annual Divali day holiday and finishes the night before Divali. The Nagar culminates with extensive fireworks show on the final night. Diwali Nagar was born out of a concept enunciated by Hans Hanoomansingh, then President of the National Council of Indian Culture and was organized by a team of dedicated individuals, led by Rampersad Parasram, first chairman of Diwali Nagar. Deokinanan Sharma, current president of NCIC, was chairman for many years At the commencement of Divali Nagar 2011, which marked its 25th anniversary, pioneers of Diwali Nagar were honoured. The Divali Nagar site is utilised during the year for educational seminars, Indian Arrival Day festivities, charitable events, religious festivities and wedding receptions.

They eventually moved into the Nile region of Upper Egypt and then into Sudan around 1504. They settled in the area of Southern Darfur and they called the land Dar El Taisha. Their main city is Rehaid Al Berdi, the Taisha participated with the rest of western Sudan tribes in the Mahadia revolt (1882-1885) against Turko-Egyptian occupation of Sudan 1821-1885. The most notable leader from the Ta'isha is Khalifa Abdulla Al Ta'ishi who ruled Sudan after the death of Mohamed Ahmed Al Mahdi in 1885 till it was recaptured by the Anglo-Egyption forces in 1899. Taaisha land (hakura) located on the south west of Darfur region, between latitudes 10 - 11° N. Headquarters of Taaisha located at Reheid El Berdi, a beautiful city and among the most mesmerized cities of Western Sudan, all over Sudan. The picturesque landscape of Reheid El Berdi city inspired many singers and artists to include the name of the city in their artistic works. One of the best songs sung by the famous singer Saleh ibn Al Badia has part of it says: \\"and a glimpse of beauty from the beautiful Reheid El Berdi.\\" Singer Saleh ibn Al Badia song, which includes Reheid Al Berdi city, is sensational for Sudanese people just like the famous \\"America, The Beautiful\\" lyrics by Ray Charles. The high fascination of Sudanese artists by the landscape of Reheid Al Berdi city is a testament to the beauty of the natural habitat and landscape of Taaisha land. Taaisha hakura bordered from the north by Beni Halba hakura, where Shaib valley represents their natural border. It extends toward the south until the Republic of Central Africa, where Taaisha cross its border during their summer seasonal journey. On the east side, there, they bordered by Habbaniya tribe, while on the west side, bordered by Chad. During their summer seasonal migration, Taaisha cross Chad border, just like what they do in the case of the Republic of Central Africa, to graze their animals. In Addition to Taaisha hakura in south west of Darfur, they migrated in large numbers during Mahadism and settled in Omdurman city – where residential areas such as Hay Al Umara, Al Shouhada, and Al Malazimiin were all established by Taaisha people, who migrated from south west of Dafur – dar Al Taaisha.

Angelides served as the Chair of the Apollo Alliance and of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Personal life Angelides was born in Sacramento, California, to Helen (née Papadopoulos) and Jerry Angelides, who were Greek immigrants. Growing up, Phil and his brother Kimon were encouraged by their father to learn about geography and the United States government. Their father would quiz them weekly on these topics. Angelides was educated at The Thacher School in Ojai, California and graduated from Harvard University in 1974, majoring in government as a Coro Foundation Fellow. Angelides and his wife, Julie, reside in Land Park with their three now grown-up daughters, Megan, Christina, and Arianna. His eldest daughter, Megan Garcia-Angelides, was the campus coordinator for his 2006 campaign. Early political career Angelides' interest in politics was ignited in 1971, during his college freshman year, when he met anti-war activist Allard Lowenstein. In 1973, while in college, Angelides unsuccessfully ran for Sacramento City Council against a popular incumbent. From 1975 to 1983, Angelides worked for California's Housing and Community Development agency. During that time, he again ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 1977. Angelides was an early supporter and fundraiser of the eventual 1988 Democratic Presidential Nominee, Michael Dukakis, and maintains a strong friendship to the present. Dukakis has referred to Phil as \\"one of the five or 10 best people in American politics today.\\" His work with Dukakis led him to serve as the chairman of the California Democratic Party from 1991 to 1993. Angelides first ran for State Treasurer in 1994, losing in the general election to Matt Fong. He served as Co-Chair of the Sacramento Mayor's Commission on Education and the City's Future from 1995 to 1996. He then ran again for State Treasurer in 1998 as a Democrat and won, and was re-elected in 2002. California State Treasurer From 1999 to 2007, Angelides served as California State Treasurer. As Treasurer, he was an ex-officio member of the boards of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS),Raine, George.

He was considered a leader in the corporate reform movement and advocated for investment in socially and environmentally conscious businesses and for businesses with increased standards of financial disclosure.

Despite this, polls from around that time showed that his opponent in the race, California State Controller Steve Westly, had an advantage in the primary. Angelides then won the endorsements of the Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times, two of California's largest newspapers, and the California League of Conservation Voters, after a head-to-head debate with Westly. He also received the endorsement of the liberal San Francisco Bay Guardian. A Field Poll held on June 2, 2006, had Westly leading Angelides by one percentage point, 35% to 34% with 26% undecided. Angelides was also endorsed by former Vice President Al Gore, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, Former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, United States Senator from Massachusetts and 2004 Democratic Presidential nominee John Kerry, Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the California Labor Federation, the California Teachers' Association, the California Professional Firefighters, the California Sierra Club, California League of Conservation Voters, California NOW, Vote the Coast and Clean Water Action. Following his primary defeat on June 6, California State Controller Steve Westly endorsed the victorious Angelides as did Assemblyman Mark Leno and San Francisco Supervisor Fiona Ma. For a time, Angelides used California Democratic Party political operative Bob Mulholland. On July 7, 2006, Angelides expressed his support for gay rights, and pledged to legalize same-sex marriage if elected governor, stating \\"I would sign the marriage equality bill because I believe if we can get behind people to build a lasting relationship, that is a good thing.\\" Angelides also called for reducing tax breaks for corporations and individuals earning $500,000 or more per year, in a plan to earn revenue to increase funding for public K-12 education and higher education. The plan would halt and repeal increases made in the tuition fees of the University of California system, and the California Community College system.Raising taxes will help education, treasurer says The San Diego Union-Tribune He stated his opposition to sending National Guard troops to the California-Mexico border and wanted to seek closer ties with the then-President of Mexico, Vicente Fox. This plan was criticized by his opponents as a tax hike. On May 22, 2006, Angelides announced his support for Vinod Khosla's Clean Alternative Energy Initiative (prop. 87), which would assess oil company profits by $4 billion over the next ten years and use the proceeds to invest into research for alternative energy such as ethanol. On May 23, 2006, Angelides wrote Barbara Boxer, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, urging her to support net neutrality. Angelides also endorsed the Clean Money Initiative (Prop. 89), which would provide public financing to candidates who can obtain at least 750 $5 contributions from voters and who have participated in at least one primary and two general election debates. It would also place new restrictions on contributions and expenditures by lobbyists and corporations. Angelides presented himself as a more progressive and liberal candidate, and accused Westly of working too closely with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Westly accused Angelides of being an anti-environment real estate developer. Westly's ads in that matter were later criticized by the executive directors of Vote the Coast, Sierra Club, California League of Conservation Voters, and California Coastal Protection Network in a letter saying \\"All of the environmental organizations who do endorsements believe Phil has the vision to be the greenest governor California has ever had.\\" On June 6, 2006, Angelides won the Democratic primary over Westly with 48 percent of the vote over his opponent's 43 percent. On August 16, Angelides announced his plans to cut taxes by $1.4 billion for California's middle class and small businesses. An unauthorized MySpace web page for Angelides was embraced by his campaign. During the Democratic primary, both Angelides and Westly used MySpace to rally supporters and spread their messages to potential voters. He stated his intent to increase high school funding by $200,000,000 to hire more counselors in high schools and middle schools as well as increasing admission quotas for the UC and CSU systems by 20,000 students. He has stated that he would \\"seriously consider\\" lowering the minimal voting age from 18 to 16 if elected governor. =Alleged campaign involvement in Schwarzenegger remark controversy= On September 7, 2006, it was revealed that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger referred to Latino Republican Assemblymember Bonnie Garcia as being fiery and hot-tempered because \\"black blood\\" mixed with \\"Latino blood\\" equals \\"hot\\". He further stated \\"I mean, they [Cubans and Puerto Ricans] are all very hot...they have the, you know, part of the black blood in them and part of the Latino blood in them and together that makes it.\\" It was a front- page story on the Los Angeles Times and was revealed by reporter Robert Salladay. Schwarzenegger then apologized for the remarks the next day, in a joint press conference with Garcia in Santa Monica. A few days later, the Schwarzenegger campaign claimed that it was the victim of a breach of security protocols, and Andrea Lynn Hoch, Schwarzenegger's legal affairs secretary stated that the file was stored \\"in a password-protected area of the governor's office network computer system.\\" The California Highway Patrol was asked to investigate. On September 13, it was discovered that the recording was obtained by members of the Angelides campaign on August 29 and August 30 stored in an MP3 file and that campaign researcher Sean Sullivan and press spokesman Dan Newman submitted it to the Los Angeles Times. Katie Levinson, a spokeswoman for the Schwarzenegger campaign wanted Angelides to \\"denounce the unethical actions taken on his behalf\\", stating that he was trying to personally smear Schwarzenegger. In response to the claims from Schwarzenegger's camp, Angelides campaign manager Cathy Calfo dismissed the claims as being politically motivated and \\"completely false.\\" In regards to the recording she stated: \\"What I have been told is, there was information accessed by one of our computers off of a taxpayer-funded, publicly available Web site that any member of the public would have access to...\\" She also expressed regret that Sullivan and Newman submitted the tape without consulting with other members of the campaign. According to The Inquirer, the supposed URL where the recording was taken from is http://speeches.gov.ca.gov/dir/06-21.htm (now offline) Roger Salazar, a California Democratic Party spokesman also was quoted as saying - \\"They want to put it off onto some massive conspiracy theory... The governor's office is trying to play up the nefarious angle to deflect attention from their own incompetence -- accidentally posting the recording on its own Web site. And from the recordings themselves.\\" In early 2007, the CHP issued a report clearing the Angelides campaign and Sullivan and Newman of any wrongdoing. The CHP concluded in its 38-page report that the digital audio files were placed on a website that was \\"accessed by backwards browsing ... which does not constitute a crime.\\" The CHP recommended that no criminal charges be filed against anyone involved in \\"Tapegate\\". =Aftermath= In the 2006 California gubernatorial election, incumbent governor Schwarzenegger defeated Angelides in a landslide. Due to lack of name recognition, Angelides was considered an unknown by comparison. His campaign did not air a single biographical ad until very late into the campaign. In the Democratic primary, Steve Westly spent $43 million ($35 million was of Westly's own fortune), compared to Angelides' $28.1 million (though an additional $10.4 million though independent campaigns on Angelides' behalf helped narrow the gap with Westly). Schwarzenegger spent around $42 million during the whole of 2006, likely most of it in the general election as he did not face a serious primary challenge, while Angelides was estimated to only spend around $10 million after winning the nomination. Garry South, Steve Westly's campaign manager, stated Angelides' attacks on Schwarzenegger came across as boastful and partisan to the electorate. The attacks failed to register and perhaps backfired, because Angelides' failed to take into account Schwarzenegger shift back to the political center, moderating his policies and returning to close co-operation with the Democratic-dominated assembly since his widely unsuccessful 2005 special election. According to campaign aides, Angelides was said to have micromanaged his campaign, down to minute and esoteric details such as paper shredders and the color of briefing papers. After his defeat, Angelides stated that he would stay involved in California politics, not ruling out another run for Governor or other statewide office. Angelides was interviewed in the documentary Meltdown on the 2008 financial crisis, where he blamed the crisis on banks lending out loans to people who clearly couldn't afford to pay them back.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQzEWeGJLP0 Real estate development Angelides was appointed president of AKT Development Corp. (a company owned by one of his business mentors, Angelo Tsakopoulos) in 1984. In 1986, Angelides founded his own land development company, River West. Angelo Tsakopoulos, Angelides' former business partner, has been a major campaign donor to California office-holders, who, together with Angelides as chair of the California Democratic Party in the early 1990s, disbursed millions of dollars to Democratic candidates. Tsakopoulos has donated over $3,200,000 to Angelides' campaigns beginning in 1993 and for the 2006 gubernatorial race, Tsakopoulos has donated $3,750,000 to Mr. Angelides with his daughter, Eleni Tsakopoulous-Kounalakis donating $1,250,000. Angelides' development firm, River West, is most known for their development in a floodplain\\"But will he be running against his own past?\\" January 18–24, 2006 Metro, Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper by Peter Byrne called Laguna West, which is located outside Sacramento in Elk Grove, California. Laguna West was one of the first developments designed along the principles of New Urbanism. For this project, as well as his history of promoting New Urbanism, Angelides was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Congress for the New Urbanism on June 11, 2005. However, since completion, the development at Laguna West has been described as a \\"catastrophic failure\\" that replicates many of the features of conventional suburban sprawl. The Sierra Club has described Laguna West as a \\"conventional suburb.\\" Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Chair On July 15, 2009, Angelides was named Chairman of the bi-partisan 10-member Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. The Commission was created by a law passed by Congress and signed by President Obama in May 2009 and was charged with investigating the events that led to the monumental 2008 collapse of the financial markets. The Commission was mandated with reporting back to Congress by the end of 2010, \\"with a series of conclusions about what occurred, and recommendations as to how to avoid future market breakdowns.\\"\\"Angelides, Thomas to Lead Financial-Crisis Probe\\", Wall Street Journal, July 15, 2009 The Commission presented its report to the President and Congress in January 2011, concluding that the crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures of regulation, excessive risk taking by Wall Street, government leaders ill- prepared for crisis, and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics. The report made the New York Times and Washington Post best sellers lists and The New York Review of Books hailed it as \\"the most comprehensive indictment of the American financial failure that has yet been made\\" and \\"the definitive history of this period.\\" Quotes *For us to live in an oil-dependent society is to live in fear. The fear of terrorism funded with the very dollars we spend at the gas pump. The fear of war to defend or defeat oil-fueled regimes in the Mideast. The fear of what happens to our families and our jobs when, inevitably, oil prices soar out of sight. The fear of what is happening to our planet and the legacy we are leaving to our children and grandchildren. *I believe President Bush is running deficits in Washington very deliberately. His plan is to finally run up so much debt that it inevitably creates pressure on the funding of things that count, in terms of the long-term strength of the society: educating kids, retirement security for American families. A mini version of that is going on in Sacramento. *It takes more than empty soundbites to educate a child, more than scorched-earth rhetoric to balance a budget, more than celebrity swagger to care for the sick and the aged. Trivia *In a 2000 episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"Pygmoelian\\", there is a character who takes Moe's picture for the Duff calendar, introduced by Duffman as \\"Duff's Vice President in charge of calendars and fake IDs, Phil Angelides.\\" When asked about the episode, the real-life Angelides acknowledged Simpsons creator Matt Groening as \\"a friend\\" and said \\"By the way, that made me very popular among my three daughters. It raised my hip status among all my daughters and their friends.\\" *According to seized Enron emails, during the California energy crisis, Jeff Dasovich, Enron's Director for State Government Affairs, called Angelides a \\"chowder head\\" and said that he was throwing a \\"tantrum\\" after Angelides wrote a letter to the president of the CPUC, urging the commission to end direct access for large business energy consumers.

It stars the cat and mouse pair Itchy & Scratchy from the American animated television series The Simpsons, and features the classic gory violence from the show. The main character is Itchy, who has to fight Scratchy. Reception of the game has been generally negative. The game was also developed for the Genesis but it was never commercially released. Gameplay The Itchy & Scratchy Game is a side-scrolling platformer based on The Itchy & Scratchy Show, a show within a show in the animated television series The Simpsons. There are seven levels in the game. The player controls Itchy, a mouse whose goal is to torture and kill the cat Scratchy. The game is played by running around the level and attacking Scratchy and various other enemies. Both Itchy and Scratchy carry mallets as their standard weapons, although various other weapons—coordinating with the theme of the level—can also be used. Every few moments, Scratchy will come onto the screen and then run away after attacking Itchy or Itchy has inflicted damage on Scratchy. Once Scratchy's health has been depleted, a boss battle will ensue. Development The game was developed by Bits Studios and published by Acclaim. The game was rated \\"Kids to Adults\\" (suitable for children aged six and older) by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, \\"despite a plethora of chainsaws, axes, and flamethrowers,\\" as a reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote. The SNES version has several censored dying animations compared to the unreleased but dumped Mega Drive/Genesis version. Reception Reviews of The Itchy & Scratchy Game have been generally negative, with much criticism being directed at the gameplay. Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro commented that \\"If the video game industry ever comes crashing down, Itchy and Scratchy will be near the top of the 'Blame Us' list.\\" They cited the overly easy gameplay and absence of the excessive violence and theme song which made Itchy and Scratchy popular. A different GamePro reviewer made similar remarks of the Game Gear version, and further criticized it for its \\"grainy\\" sound and for omitting the boss battles of the console version. Game Players gave the SNES version a 35/100 rating in March 1995, commenting that the \\"gameplay suffers from extensive repetition and poor control and, despite the large number of weapons included in the game, there are too few opportunities to pick them up.\\" Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro criticized the \\"mindless\\" gameplay, drab graphics, and tiresome animations, but concluded that \\"the control is the worst part. In a game of jumping and hitting, the lack of jumping attacks and the inaccurate weapons make you itch for a different game.\\" The Game Players review noted that \\"for true Simpsons fans, the Itchy and Scratchy level in Bart's Nightmare [from 1992] is still the best place to look for this duo.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the SNES game a grade of \\"C\\" in May 1995, and commented that \\"there's a reason Itchy & Scratchy cartoons rarely occupy more than 30 seconds of any Simpsons episode: stretch the concept to the full half- hour, and the ratings would plummet. It's the same for videogames. While Itchy and Scratchy appeared in a hilarious cameo on the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis game Bart's Nightmare, here they duke it out in an interminable, multistage whackfest.\\" The gaming website UGO Networks was more positive, writing that the game \\"had great animation and was actually (gasp!) pretty funny.\\" References External links * Category:1995 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Cancelled Sega Genesis games Category:Video games based on The Simpsons Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Game"},{"id":"1610560","text":"Official portrait of Farley, the 53rd Postmaster General A Farley file is a set of records kept by politicians on people whom they have met. The term is named for James Farley, Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager. Farley, who went on to become Postmaster General and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, kept a file on everyone he or Roosevelt met. Whenever people were scheduled to meet again with Roosevelt, Farley would review their files. That allowed Roosevelt to meet them again while knowing their spouse, their children's names and ages, and anything else that had come out of earlier meetings or any other intelligence that Farley had added to the file. The effect was powerful and intimate. Farley files are now commonly kept by other politicians and businesspeople.

It was scored by Stewart Copeland, a member of The Police. Marketed as a hip hop 'hood film, Fresh went relatively unnoticed by the public, but won critical acclaim. An emotional coming of age story, it offers a realistic glimpse of the dangerous life in New York City's projects during the crack epidemic. \\"There's shocking resonance to the notion of a grade-school boy who's become a criminal out of sheer pragmatism,\\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman. Summary Michael, nicknamed Fresh (portrayed by Sean Nelson), is a 12-year-old kid running drugs for gangsters, notably Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito). Inspired by the chess lessons of his father, an alcoholic speed-chess master (Samuel L. Jackson), Fresh devises and executes a brilliant plan to extricate himself and his drug-addicted sister (N'Bushe Wright) from their hopeless lives.Berry & Berry (2007), p. 128. Plot 12-year-old Michael a.k.a. \\"Fresh\\" stops at a Latina woman's apartment to pick up dime bags of heroin before he goes to school. Fresh notices that she has given him the wrong amount, trying to swindle him out of his delivery. Fresh warns her that his boss Esteban will be angry with the incorrect amount. The woman, a drug addict, \\"finds\\" the missing bag. He leaves, disgusted. Next, he visits another apartment where several women and one man, Herbie (Victor Gonzalez), are measuring and cutting bricks of heroin. Herbie insults Fresh and makes crude comments about Fresh's sister, which angers Fresh. He rushes out because he is late for school. He meets up with another of Esteban's employees to count the drugs. The employee tells Fresh that Esteban wants to see him after handing Fresh his share of the money. Fresh arrives late at school where he is his scolded by his teacher, Mrs. Coleman. At recess, Fresh and his best friend, Chuckie (Luis Lantigua), watch the girls' cheerleading team and Fresh talks to one of them, Rosie (Natima Bradley). After school, Fresh goes to a wooded, abandoned area. In a secret hiding place where he stashes his earnings, his savings now come to a substantial amount. From there, he goes to his grandmother's house where his aunt and eleven cousins reside. The next morning, Fresh is selling drugs when a desperate drug addict offers sex to Fresh in exchange for drugs, but he sends her away. At the end of the day, Jake (Jean-Claude La Marre) (one of the lookouts) becomes angry and threatens to kill Kermit (who didn't show up to pay $50 Kermit owes him). Fresh seeks out Corky (Ron Brice) —his boss as well as Jake's— in order to get paid but Corky tries to short him. Fresh demands more money since the lookouts like Jake make $50 while his pay is $100 for selling the drugs. Corky agrees. Fresh takes the subway to Washington Square to play chess for cash with a man who is undefeated while his father Sam, a skilled chess player, sits at another table watching him. After winning, Fresh plays his father but loses. Fresh visits Chuckie, who proposes to enter their dog, Roscoe, in a dogfight to earn cash and urges Fresh to get him a job with Esteban. Fresh leaves him to visit Esteban, who is annoyed that Fresh is selling crack for other drug dealers. He leaves Esteban to go where his sister Nichole works. He bumps into James, Nichole's drug-dealing boyfriend. Fresh warns Nichole that Esteban is interested in her. She tells him that she doesn't like the way Esteban looks at her \\"like a queen\\" and that she doesn't love James either, only the drugs he can supply her with. Fresh goes to watch a neighborhood basketball game, where Jake begins to show jealously towards a smaller kid, Curtis. During the game Curtis humiliates Jake by scoring the winning basket. Jake, angered, seems to leave the court. Rosie sees Fresh and walks over to talk to him. Jake returns with a gun and begins shooting Curtis repeatedly, killing him. Everyone leaves except Fresh. He walks past Curtis' dead body and finds Rosie on the ground, choking on blood, having been struck in the neck by a stray bullet and dying moments later. The police arrive shortly, demanding information which Fresh refuses to provide. Next day, Fresh plays chess with his father Sam again who scolds him for being distracted. Fresh loses but is able to put his Father's king in \\"check\\" for the 1st time. Later, Chuckie and Fresh arrive at the dogfight. Their dog wins. Chuckie wants to enter him into another fight but Fresh stops him, agreeing to get him a job with Esteban. They go to Esteban's apartment where Esteban and Nichole are finishing having sex. Finally, Esteban dismisses Chuckie after Chuckie boasts of \\"busting those dope moves\\" and tells Fresh that he plans to groom Fresh to his protege and wants Fresh to stop selling for other dealers. Meanwhile, Corky has the police's attention since Jake's shooting. Fresh takes his own savings to a cocaine source, Hector (Anthony Ruiz), under the pretense of being the runner for Corky. Hector refuses to hand over the drugs to Fresh. Fresh threatens him and offers him a big sum of cash (the entirety of Fresh's personal savings). Hector takes the cash and tells Fresh where to pick up the drugs. Fresh says that the police have wire-tapped Corky's phone numbers and tells Hector not to call Corky. At school, Chuckie can't resist bragging about his supposed new job for Esteban. After school, he and Fresh buy science textbooks to hide the drugs. During the trip back, Chuckie almost gets arrested on the train for talking back to an officer. Fresh had to intervene and deescalate the situation. They go to an abandoned house where Fresh is replacing their Heroin stash with Hector's Cocaine while Chuckie keeps lookout thinking he's just there to hide it. When leaving, three men step out from behind the corner, armed. Fresh begins to run. Chuckie shoots at the men and runs, but trips. The gun falls under a car's tire. Chuckie tries to grab it but the tire is shot and it flattens over Chuckie's left hand, crushing it. Fresh runs back over to help him, to no avail. Another assailant fires a shot at the car, prompting Fresh to run away. The assailants kill Chuckie. Fresh is questioned by the police at the police station, since Fresh has been again at the scene of a death. But having no evidence to detain him, they let him go. Back at home, Fresh's aunt tells him that she cannot risk the lives of her eleven other children for him. She informs him that he will be sent to a group home in a month. At school, Fresh's friends blame him for Chuckie's death and now truly alone, Fresh kills Chuckie's dog, Roscoe. When Fresh goes outside, Jake forces him in the car with the three assailants (revealing that Jake was behind the ambush on the kids). They bring Fresh to Corky. Corky is upset with Chuckie's bragging about moving base for Esteban (the same drugs that Corky is selling) and that Esteban is encroaching on his product. The drugs that Jake and the assailants took off of Chuckie's bag reveal that both Fresh and Chuckie were carrying crack cocaine. Corky grabs big chain links and threatens to beat Fresh to death to send a message to rival dealers. However, Fresh lies, stating he was being forced to sell for Jake. An astonished Jake pulls out his gun to shoot Fresh, but Corky's henchmen turn on Jake and Jake's friend, Red (Anthony Thomas), who try to convince everyone that Fresh is lying. However, Fresh insists that Jake and Red were planning to oust Corky and he was only saying that he was selling for Esteban as protection. Fresh tells them to call Hector, who will reveal the truth. Corky calls Hector. The conversation is short, with Hector expressing concern over Corky' phone being wire-tapped, as Hector was told by Fresh. Corky then whips Red and Jake to death. Corky turns to Fresh and asks who else is involved. Fresh names James. Fresh then goes to Esteban's warehouse and tells him that Corky's crew had jumped him and that Corky is planning to sell heroin as well. He tells Esteban that Corky's distributor is James and the two are planning to meet that night. He also adds that Nichole is seeing James secretly because James is plotting with Corky to take Esteban out. Corky and his men arrive at James' place and storm in while Esteban, Fresh, and two other men wait in Esteban's car. Inside, Esteban's crew kills James, Corky, and Corky's men. Afterwards, they drive to Esteban's place and Esteban sees Nichole is there. He tells his henchmen to take Fresh home but Fresh makes them stop the car, claiming that he will spend the night at a friend's house. Then he runs into a convenience store and makes a phone call. He then shows up at Esteban's apartment. Esteban lets him stay because he wants to confront Fresh for telling Nichole that he found her father in Staten Island and for urging her to leave for a rehabilitation center. Angry, Esteban demands to know what else Fresh is hiding from him. The police arrive and as Esteban goes to answer the door, Fresh hides something under the bed. The police officer turns out to be Sgt. Perez (Jose Zuniga), responding to a call about a domestic dispute. Esteban denies any argument. Fresh comes forward and tells Perez that Esteban is a drug dealer who killed James, Corky, and several others earlier that night, and his sister is scared to speak up since he is now threatening her. Esteban swears that he is clean but Fresh tells Sgt. Perez to check under the bed. The policeman does so and find Esteban's gun (which he removed from the car after the shooting earlier) and the drugs Fresh planted. The police take Esteban away with a promise that he will effectively go to prison for the rest of his life. Sgt. Perez promises protection for Fresh and his sister. Fresh expresses that he no longer wants to live in any \\"projects\\". The movie concludes with Fresh meeting his father again to play chess. His father berates him for being late and antagonizes Fresh before their game. Fresh's father looks up and discovers Fresh sobbing, with tears quietly streaming down his face.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on reviews from 40 critics, with an average rating of 7.61/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Well cast and sharply directed, Fresh serves as an attention-getting calling card for writer-director Boaz Yakin as well as a gripping urban drama.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times commended the \\"thoughtfulness of [Boaz] Yakin's direction\\" and wrote that he \\"doesn't include many violent episodes in this film, but the ones he stages are made so meaningful that their impact is brutalizingly intense.\\" She also complimented Adam Holender's cinematography and commented that he makes the film \\"extraordinarily handsome, with a sharply sunlit look that brings out the hard edges in its urban landscapes. The subject and visual style could not be more forcefully matched.\\" Although he did not find its second half believable, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B rating and called Nelson a \\"wondrous young actor\\". James Berardinelli called Jackson's supporting role \\"an example of an actor at his most focused\\" and called Fresh \\"an atypical thriller -- a film that succeeds because it defies many conventions of its genre.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and called it \\"a movie filled with drama and excitement, unfolding a plot of brilliant complexity\\". He praised Nelson's performance as \\"extraordinary\\" and found its plot \\"focused and perceptive\\", praising it for its social commentary: Other reviews of the film are more critical, suggesting that the main character Fresh becomes less human, and more of a product of the screenwriters as the film progresses in its second half. The film won the Filmmaker's Trophy at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, and in 1995, Nelson won for Best Debut Performance at the Independent Spirit Awards.

The \\"weapon\\" in question is not alleged to be a standard nuclear weapon powered by nuclear fission, but something closer to either a radiological weapon (a so-called \\"dirty bomb\\") or a hybrid-nuclear fusion weapon. Its new evidence is concerned primarily with the parts of the German nuclear energy project under Kurt Diebner. Summary Under supervision of the SS, from 1944–45, German scientists in Thuringia tested some form of \\"nuclear weapon\\", possibly a dirty bomb (for the differences between this and a standard fission weapon, see nuclear weapon design). Several hundred prisoners of war are alleged to have died as a result. Karlsch's primary evidence are alleged vouchers for the atomic weapon attempts, a preliminary plutonium bomb patent from the year 1941 (which had been known about, but not yet found), and conducted industrial archaeology on the remains of the first experimental German nuclear reactor. Follow-up research In February 2006, full tests on the soil at the proposed test site were released by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), revealing no abnormal background levels of radiation after taking into account the already elevated background levels as a result of the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The PTB release emphasized that while it could not necessarily rule out a German test conclusively, that soil analysis of that site revealed absolutely no evidence of it.In Bodenproben keine Spur von \\"Hitlers Bombe\\" Criticism Karlsch has been criticized for displaying \\"a catastrophic lack of understanding of physics\\" by physicist Michael Schaaf, who is himself the author of an earlier book about Nazi atomic research, while Karlsch himself has acknowledged that he lacked absolute proof for the claims made in his book.

BACE2 is a close homolog of BACE1.  Function  Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta peptide is an early and critical feature of Alzheimer's disease and a frequent complication of Down syndrome. Amyloid beta peptide is generated by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by 2 proteases, one of which is the protein encoded by this gene. This gene localizes to the 'Down critical region' of chromosome 21. The encoded protein, a member of the peptidase A1 protein family, is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein and aspartic protease. Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. It has been reported that BACE2 is the main protease that mediates the release of the amyloidogenic ectodomain of Pmel17 in melanocytes. BACE2 processes PMEL to form the melanosome amyloid matrix in pigment cells Pubmed  Interactions  BACE2 has been shown to interact with GGA1 and GGA2.

Moog became a waiter and later a tavern owner, getting married in 1900 to a woman with whom he had three children. Throughout his life, he had been prone to a \\"loose life style, alcoholism, and sexual excess\\" (Prinzhorn 1972, p. 144) and had suffered from gonorrhea. He had his first schizophrenic episode in 1908, shortly after his wife's death in 1907. His episode convinced him to become a poet, and he drifted from town to town attempting to give lectures and start his own printing press. Six weeks afterward, his relatives finally committed him to an asylum. In the asylum he wrote lewd poetry, starting to paint in 1912. In a surprising contrast to his verses, all of his paintings were of saints and religious images. The style of his paintings is reminiscent of a stained glass window. Figures are composed of many narrow strips, each decorated with its own ornamental pattern and each of a different color. Moog displays the common outsider horror vacui, filling every space with decoration. He painted saints in order to atone for his earlier sins, and renounced his earlier lifestyle, equating sexuality with sin and renouncing tobacco and alcohol during his years in the asylum.

He finished the interview with the words \\"Tommy, we got your back and we'll definitely look to keep in touch, it's great what you're doing\\". Kilmeade has said that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi calling President Donald Trump a \\"racist\\" is \\"personally offensive\\". Previously, when then-Fox News colleague Glenn Beck called President Barack Obama a \\"racist\\" while appearing with Kilmeade on Fox & Friends, Kilmeade did not protest Beck's statement. = \\"We keep marrying other species and other ethnics\\" = On July 8, 2009, Kilmeade and two co-hosts were discussing a study that, based on research done in Finland and Sweden, showed people who stay married are less likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Kilmeade, who is Italian-Irish American, commented, \\"[In the United States] we keep marrying other species and other ethnics...\\" Ignoring attempts by co-host Gretchen Carlson (who is of Swedish descent) to interrupt him, he added, \\"See, the problem is the Swedes have pure genes. Because they marry other Swedes... Finns marry other Finns, so they have a pure society. In America we marry everybody, we marry Italians and Irish.\\" On July 20, 2009, Kilmeade apologized for his remarks, saying, \\"I made comments that were offensive to many people. That was not my intention, and looking back at those comments I realize they were inappropriate. For that I sincerely apologize.

Well, your son's out now. So if you really don't want to no longer look like a member of the Taliban, you don't have to look like a member of the Taliban. Are you out of razors?\\" = \\"Not our kids\\" = On June 22, 2018, Kilmeade on Fox & Friends defended the Trump administration family separation policy by saying, \\"Like it or not, these are not our kids\\" in reference to children of illegal immigrants who had been separated from their parents and put in detainment. = Climate change = In 2018, Kilmeade criticized Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes for asking President Donald Trump about climate change. Kilmeade said that Stahl was pushing an \\"agenda\\" and injecting her \\"point of view\\" into the interview by asking the President whether he truly believed climate change was a hoax. Kilmeade said, \\"She really believes in global warming and that's fine, and man's role in climate change and that's okay. But I don't think you should bring your point of view ― she was trying to win over the president with her point of view. There are other scientists. Something is going on out there.

He attended the Pennsylvania Nautical School and served as navigator and watch officer in SS Adams and SS Mexico prior to assuming duties as Port Captain, Port of Philadelphia, in 1914. Commissioned Ensign in the Naval Militia of Pennsylvania on 14 July 1916, he was mustered into Federal service 7 April 1917, and assigned in May to the interned Prinz Eitel Friedrich, later renamed DeKalb. On 1 July 1918, he transferred to the U.S. Naval Reserve Force. In September, he reported for duty with Destroyer Forces at Queenstown, Ireland. He served in USS Allen (DD-66) during November 1918; in USS McCall (DD-28) from December 1918 to March 1919; and under Commander, Flotilla B, Destroyer Force, Atlantic, between March and June 1919. Relieved from active duty on 25 June 1919, he remained in the Naval Reserve until transferred to the Honorary Retired List on 1 September 1939. On 3 January 1942, shortly after World War II broke out, while Superintendent and Commanding Officer of the Pennsylvania Nautical School Ship Seneca, Lieutenant Commander Rudderow was recalled to active duty and assigned to the yacht Cythera (PY-26), another World War I veteran being fitted out for coastal patrol work. Assuming command of Cythera when she commissioned on 3 March, Lieutenant Commander Rudderow was killed when his ship was torpedoed by U-402 off the North Carolina coast on 2 May 1942. Only two of Cythera's crew survived. They were picked up by the German submarine, taken to Germany, and interned for the duration of the war. Namesake The Rudderow class destroyer escort Rudderow (DE-224), is named in his honor.

The name derives from the Dun of King Guaire, the legendary king of Connacht. The castle's tower and its defensive wall have been restored, and the grounds are open to tourists during the summer. The castle's slates are from an old school in Kinvara. History The 19th century Gaelic scholar John O'Donovan states in his Ordnance Survey letters for County Galway, and his book, The Genealogies, Tribes and Customs of the Hy-Fiachrach, that Dunguaire was built by the Ó hEidhin clan, chiefs of Coill Ua bhFiachrach, the district around Kinvara, and also of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne an area coextensive with the diocese of Kilmacduagh covering the part of County Galway between the Burren and Galway Bay to the west and Slieve Aughty to the east. Dunguaire Castle was used in the 1969 Walt Disney movie Guns in the Heather, featuring Kurt Russell, in which the castle was featured as Boyne Castle. It was also the Scottish castle home of the main character in the 1979 film North Sea Hijack. Legends Another regionally well known legend is the \\"Road of the Dishes\\" (Bothar na Mias), involving King Guaire and St. Colman of Kilmacduagh.

History The alternative rock quartet Sinch formed in 1994 while its members were attending different high schools in Doylestown and Willow Grove in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. To the dismay of parents and the bemusement of friends, the members of Sinch made a pact that upon leaving school they would dedicate themselves to the band rather than pursue college or the military. In 1996 the band self-produced its first album titled, The Strychnine, earning it regular live slots along the East Coast. Two years later, Sinch released its second record titled, Diatribe, which gained them further notoriety and won them supporting slots with major label artists including KoЯn, Rob Zombie, Linkin Park and Chevelle. This exposure was sufficient to garner the band a major label deal. In 2001, they signed with Roadrunner Records and produced their self-titled Sinch album with producer Malcolm Springer. The first single from the album was \\"Something More\\". It was released to radio stations worldwide and became one of the Top 100 active rock singles of 2002. Sinch's self-titled album became one of Roadrunner's highest selling debut releases, and ultimately went on to sell over 100,000 copies worldwide.http://ampkicker.com/2012/03/sinch-hive-mind-review-interview/ During this period, Sinch became known for their use of the \\"Ocular Noise Machine\\" or \\"Viditar\\", a guitar-shaped video device made of transparent lucite (acrylic glass) which is operated by the band's fifth member, Jay Smith. The device feeds computerized footage on to projector screens, and edits it in real-time during the band's live performances. The footage is edited via buttons on the machine's neck and knobs and sliders on its body. Used in conjunction with a PowerBook, the buttons allow the operator to select video files to display, whilst employing knobs and sliders to manipulate and apply special effects to the images. Fearing the device would be copied by another band or, worse, a corporation, Smith applied to have the device patented. Smith is also the founder of Livid Instruments, where he creates and sells his own line of video instruments. Sinch were released from Roadrunner Records mid-2004, after the label decided to pass up the option of renewing the band's contract. Their second major album titled, Clearing the Channel, was released on March 22, 2005 via independent label Rock Ridge Music. At the start of 2009, Sinch started work on a fan-funded album since they were no longer supported by a record label. They began recording in June of the same year, but due to the band members also holding down full-time jobs recording would take around 2 years to complete. By August 2011 the album was in the mixing stage and the release was being planned.http://contribute.sincharmy.com/#blog The album, Hive Mind, finally saw the light of day as a digital download, available to those that contributed to the making of the album, on March 20, 2012.

He dramatically reshaped the company by acquiring Boeing's long-time rival McDonnell Douglas and relocating Boeing headquarters from Seattle to Chicago. He resigned to take symbolic responsibility for a military procurement scandal, although he was not accused of any ethical breaches. Education  He was born in Berkeley, California, and became an aviation enthusiast at an early age, earning his pilot's certificate at age 18. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963, a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1965, a Master's in Management from the Sloan Fellows program of the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1975, and a Ph.D. in engineering from the Tokyo University of Science . (He is the first Westerner to earn such a degree from that institution.)  Boeing career Phil Condit joined the Boeing company in 1965 as an aerodynamics engineer, and worked on the since-canceled Supersonic Transport program (SST). The same year he was awarded a patent for a flexible wing design called a \\"sailwing.\\" In 1968, he became a lead engineer on the Boeing 747 high-speed configuration. He advanced into management within a year, then became manager of the Boeing 727 marketing in 1973. In 1974, he entered the Sloan Fellows program at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he completed his Master's degree in Management a year later. He returned to Boeing as manager of new-program planning. He then advanced to director of program management for the 707/727/737 division in 1976, and 757 chief program engineer in 1978, then director of 757 engineering in 1981. Condit later became vice president and general manager of the 757 division in 1983; vice president of the Renton division the same year, and vice president of sales and marketing for Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company (BCAC) in 1984. In 1986, he was named as executive vice president and general manager of BCAC, then executive VP and general manager of the 777 program division. = Chairman and retirement= In 1992, he was elected president of Boeing and a member of the board of directors. Four years later he became CEO as well. In 1997, he was elected chairman, becoming the seventh chairman since the company was founded. He remained in this position until resigning on 1 December 2003, followed by retirement in March 2004. He resigned one week after firing Chief Financial Officer Michael M. Sears and Vice President Darleen Druyun when an internal investigation determined that the two had discussed a job for Druyun while she was still an Air Force procurement officer helping pass judgment on proposed Boeing contracts. Condit resigned to take symbolic responsibility, and Sears and Druyan served prison terms.Palmer, Kimberly, \\"Former Air Force acquisition official released from jail,\\" Government Executive.com, 3 October 2005. Cahlink, George, \\"Ex-Pentagon procurement executive gets jail time\\" . Government Executive, 1 October 2004. A member of the Boeing board, Lewis E. Platt, said the Boeing initially declined Condit's offer to step down, but relented after agreeing with Condit that his departure would help give the company a fresh start with its biggest customer, the U.S. government. Many Boeing workers were unhappy Condit left, according to the Seattle Times. = Mergers and acquisitions= Condit utterly transformed Boeing during his seven-year tenure as CEO, making numerous space and defense acquisitions and growing annual revenue from $23 billion to $54 billion. It was also during his tenure, however, that Airbus reached rough parity with Boeing's commercial airplane division and in some years exceeded Boeing in jetliner orders or deliveries. Boeing acquired Rockwell Aerospace and Hughes Space & Communications, then performed a merger with the McDonnell Douglas company in 1997. These acquisitions consolidated much of the nation's aerospace capacity into Boeing. After the September 11 attacks there was a nearly 20% decline in North American air travel, which created severe financial problems for both Boeing and the U.S. airline industry. At the time of his retirement, Condit told a reporter that the defense acquisitions had been intended to reduce the company's reliance on commercial airplanes: \\"We knew that commercial airplanes was going to be a capital goods, cyclic industry. We needed breadth.\\"  Personal life  Condit has been married four times. For his fourth (and current) marriage, he wed Geda Maso.

It was available for Microsoft Windows. Xfire was originally developed by Ultimate Arena based in Menlo Park, California. As of January 3, 2014, it had over 24 million registered users. Xfire's Livestream (formerly known as Mogulus) allowed users to broadcast live video streams of their current game to an audience. The Xfire website also maintained a \\"Top Ten\\" games list, ranking games by the number of hours Xfire users spend playing each game every day. World of Warcraft had been the most played game for many years, but was surpassed by League of Legends on June 20, 2011. Social.xfire.com was a community site for Xfire users, allowing them to upload screenshots, photos and videos and to make contacts. Xfire hosted events every month, which included debates, game tournaments, machinima contests, and chat sessions with Xfire or game developers. Xfire's web based social media was discontinued on June 12, 2015, and the messaging function was shut down on June 27, 2015. The last of Xfire's services were shut down on April 30, 2016. History Xfire, Inc. was founded in 2002 by Dennis \\"Thresh\\" Fong, Mike Cassidy, Max Woon, and David Lawee. The company was formerly known as Ultimate Arena, but changed its name to Xfire when its desktop client Xfire became more popular and successful than its gaming website. The first version of the Xfire desktop client was code-named Scoville, which was first developed in 2003 by Garrett Blythe, Chris Kirmse, Mike Judge, and others. The services ability to track game play hours and quickly launch web games, compared to other services at the time quickly gained it popularity. On April 25, 2006, Xfire was acquired by Viacom in a US$102 million deal. In September 2006, Sony was misinterpreted to have announced that Xfire would be used for the PlayStation 3. The confusion came when one PlayStation 3 game, Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom, was to use some of Xfire's features with more game support planned for the future. On May 7, 2007, Xfire announced that they had reached 7 million registered users. Shortly after, on June 13, 2007, co-founder and former CEO Mike Cassidy departed the company to work for venture capital firm Benchmark Capital. Adam Boyden, Vice President of Business Development & Marketing, was assigned to take his place and manage the company for a temporary period. On August 2, 2010, Xfire was acquired by Titan Gaming. On June 10, 2015, Xfire announced that its social services would be shut down on Friday, June 12 with only 2 days' notice. The home page for the social part of Xfire at that time linked to an export page where users could download all their previously uploaded screenshots and videos. On April 30, 2016, the homepage of Xfire's site (http://www.xfire.com) was replaced with the following text: > \\"In 2003, Xfire released the Xfire Client, the first product to bring the > outside world into your games.

As of June 1, 2020, the Xfire domain (https://www.xfire.com) is owned by a website that functions as a directory for online gambling sites and online casinos. The domain itself redirects to a subpage of that website explaining what Xfire was and offering alternatives to it. =Lawsuits= Yahoo! filed a lawsuit against Xfire, Inc. on January 28, 2005, claiming that Xfire has infringed Yahoo!'s U.S. patent No. 6,699,125 for a \\"Game server for use in connection with a messenger server\\". Xfire, Inc. filed a countersuit against Yahoo! on March 10, 2005, which was eventually disqualified by the judge. There has been a settlement between the companies as of January 31, 2006. More details were posted to Xfire's forums. Features Xfire had many features, the majority of which could only be used while in-game. Xfire featured the ability to detect the video game a particular user was running. By analyzing running processes, Xfire could detect active games and then send that information to the Xfire servers. Other user's clients would then be updated with this information. For many games, it could also detect which server users were playing on, the level which was running, and ping times. Using these features, users were also able to see what games their friends were playing, and to join any friends who were currently in-game by having Xfire launch the game and join the friend's server automatically. Xfire logged what games users were playing, how many hours they had played them, and saved other information (such as scores) from game servers. This information could be converted into a PNG image by the server via PHP for every user to use as a signature. Xfire allowed players to take screenshots in-game and save them to a specified folder, though this only worked with games that had Xfire in-game support. Users could select and caption any screenshots they wished to upload and share on their Xfire profile page. Xfire also had the ability to record video in- game, though this often had a significant impact on game performance and recording quality if one had a low-performance system, causing the frame rate to drop dramatically. However, this is typically true of all video recording during gaming, and was not unique to Xfire. The clients main function was as an instant messenger. Similar to other such online services, any user who had been added as a 'friend' could be immediately contacted through text chat. To communicate with other users in-game, Xfire users could send and receive instant messages from inside any game that was running in full screen mode, regardless of the games the sender or recipient were in. This eliminated the need to minimize the game window. Users were also able to directly send files to one another via the chat window. On August 2005, Xfire updated to version 1.43, which added a beta voice chat feature using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to the application called \\"Xfire Pro-Voice\\". Until early 2009, if voice chat was being used in a chat room, users had to host the voice chat, causing quality problems and lag due to some users have better system capabilities than others. Xfire hosted the voice chat sessions to resolve quality problems. On May 4, 2009, a built-in alpha AOL Instant Messenger and Windows Live Messenger plugin was released in 1.108. As of May 4, 2009, it only supported chatting, and none of AIM's other features. From December 1, 2009, users could access their Twitter accounts through Xfire, allowing players to view updates posted by other users, as well as post their own. Google Talk was also subsequently been added. In December 2011, Xfire added support for Facebook chatting, enabling users to chat with their Facebook friends from within the game. On December 16, 2011, Xfire added a feature to allow its users to capture in-game video and upload it to YouTube. This feature was similar to other popular in-game video recording software products, but allowed users to record videos up to 10 minutes in length for free. Xfire added a video streaming feature in version 1.97. To view a broadcast, a web browser plugin was required, supporting only Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. In version 1.113, released on August 17, 2009, the broadcast system was changed to allow a plugin-less, Flash-based view compatible with any Flash-enabled browser. This feature let anyone watch a live feed of a user's screen while they were playing a game. Live streams had accompanying chat rooms that let anyone who was watching a live feed communicate. In-game internet browsing capabilities were added to Xfire in version 1.103. Its homepage was set as a statistics page of the game currently being played by the user, including listing other players and any clans and guilds based around the game being played. Support As of December 1, 2012, Xfire provided support for more than 3,000 games, of many different genres. Support for Windows 98 and Windows Me was discontinued as of January 2007. =Third-party modifications and software forking= There were many third party modifications for Xfire's client and services, including skins, infoview templates, plugins, and protocol implementations. Some of these may or may not violate Xfire's terms of service. Skins could be used to provide a new look to the Xfire client and chat windows, while Infoview skins could be used to provide extra functionality in the Xfire Infoview pane. Skins were made using XML and image files, while Infoviews were made using HTML, JavaScript, and images.

Putti is inhabited largely by the Abayudaya people. The villagers of Putti are currently undergoing an Orthodox Jewish conversion to Judaism.  Community life  Putti is an agrarian village. The community centers around the She'erit Yisra'el Synagogue, which has about 150 members. The congregation is collectively known as the Kahal Kadosh She'erit Yisra'el or KKSY (Holy Congregation Remnant of Israel). Putti villagers currently practice Judaism according to Orthodox (Sephardi) halakha, as candidates for Orthodox conversion. Local members perform berit milah on baby boys at eight days old, keep kashrut, observe the Shabbat, the Jewish holy days and the laws of family purity Taharat haMishpacha. The community was founded around 1920 when the Chief of the District Semei Kakungulu, angry at the (British) Christians who had betrayed him, felt an affinity for the Jews of the Old Testament. He declared his community would now be Jewish and based their practices on what he understood from reading the Bible and meeting Jewish travelers. After the period of harsh oppression under Idi Amin, a few of the community members visited the Synagogue in Nairobi and connected to traditional Judaism. They began to incorporate the practices they observed into their own worship. Eventually the worldwide Jewish community became aware of a Jewish presence in Uganda through the efforts of a young peace corp volunteer. Reform and Conservative Jews, impressed with their desire to be Jewish offered to assist them. The majority of Jewish settlements around Mbale accepted this support, which included Jewish artifacts, financial support and non-orthodox conversion and acceptance. However, the community in Putti, to the present day, did not go along with the rest of the Abayudaya and is holding out till the present day in the hope to receive orthodox-accepted conversion. An interesting latest development occurred in 2012 with the possible recognition of the Putti Abayudaya by Israel and the Orthodox Jewish world, thanks to the efforts of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founding Chief Rabbi of Efrat and Chancellor of the Ohr Torah Stone institute, in coordination with PVAO (Putti Village Assistance Organization). A new mikveh (ritual bath) has been built and fundraising efforts are in process to finish a new synagogue. The community is governed by an elected board, currently chaired by Tarphon Kamya. Putti village receives outside support from PVAO (Putti Village Assistance Organization).  Persecution  During the reign of Idi Amin, a ban was placed on Judaism in Uganda. Many practitioners of Judaism converted to other religions due to the ban. Later, the community called itself 'Remnant of Israel' because as a result of Idi Amin's persecution, the entire community had almost disappeared.

A wingman (or wingmate) is a pilot who supports another in a potentially dangerous flying environment. Wingman was originally the plane flying beside and slightly behind the lead plane in an aircraft formation. According to the U.S. Air Force, > The traditional military definition of a \\"Wingman\\" refers to the pattern in > which fighter jets fly. There is always a lead aircraft and another which > flies off the right wing of and behind the lead. This second pilot is called > the \\"Wingman\\" because he or she primarily protects the lead by \\"watching his > back.\\"Air Force Reserve Description The wingman's role is to support aerial combat by making a flight both safer and more capable: amplifying situational awareness, increasing firepower, and allowing more dynamic tactics. The concept of a wingman is nearly as old as fighter aviation. On 9 August 1915, Oswald Boelcke was already acting in the role when he shot down a French airplane pursuing Max Immelmann. Colonel Robert Smith provided an extensive description of the work and role of wingmen during the Korean War. Among a wingman's primary responsibilities are remaining close to the leader of the aerial formation and warning the leader of any immediate threats at the cost of losing mutual protection. Smith described the responsibilities as mutually exclusive: to never lose the leader requires that the wingman watch what is in front of him/her while warning the leader of threats requires focusing on the rear. In order to protect the leader, the wingman needs to react constantly according to his surroundings and movements. Smith described the difficulties of flying under conditions of poor visibility and the trying effects on human perception under such conditions, especially considering the danger of becoming separated from the formation leader. According to Smith, wingmen are expected to remain with the leader, even at the cost of scoring an easy kill. In popular culture The term appeared in 1986 American action drama film Top Gun.

Dealey (1906-1944), who was awarded the Medal of Honor as commanding officer of the famous World War II submarine . History Dealey was launched 8 November 1953 by Bath Iron Works Corporation, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Mrs. Samuel D. Dealey, widow of Commander Dealey, and commissioned on 3 June 1954 with Lieutenant Commander R. H. Rossell in command. Homeported at Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island, Dealey steamed on local exercises, cruised to Key West, Florida, to serve with the Fleet Sonar School, and joined in convoy exercises in the Caribbean during her first two-and-a-half years of service. On 4 January 1957 she departed Newport for a South American cruise, returning 21 March 1957 for exercises off the United States East Coast. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises in the Irish Sea in September and October 1957 took her to Plymouth, England, and Brest and Cherbourg, France. On 12 May 1958 Dealey sailed for the Mediterranean as flagship of Escort Squadron 10 (CortRon 10), screening the aircraft carrier to her duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. Dealey patrolled the eastern Mediterranean during the Lebanon crisis and returned to Newport on 7 October 1958. On 3 February 1959 Dealey put to sea for Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, and after exercises there transited the Panama Canal for calls at Buenaventura, Colombia; Salinas, Ecuador; Talara and Callao, Peru; and Valparaíso and Antofagasta, Chile. During this cruise she exercised with the navies of all four countries. She returned to Newport on 20 April 1959, and sailed on NATO exercises, calling at Derry, Northern Ireland; Greenwich, England; and Lisbon, Portugal, before returning to Newport on 11 October 1959. She operated in the Narragansett Bay area for the remainder of 1959. Dealey continued these operations, plus a cruise to the Caribbean and an amphibious exercise off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts, until 20 June 1960 when she began a short overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York. Returning to Newport on 22 July 1960, she prepared for distant duty. On 22 August 1960, she sailed for exercises in the Caribbean, and continued on a voyage around South America. After visits to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia, Dealey sailed through the Panama Canal, down the coast of South America, calling in Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, transited the Straits of Magellan, and turned northward, visiting Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Trinidad. After riding out a wild storm, Dealey arrived home in Newport coated in ice on 13 December 1960; she passed the remainder of 1960 there.  ROU 18 De Julio (DE-3)  Dealey was decommissioned on 28 July 1972 and simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. She was transferred to the Uruguayan Navy the same day, and renamed ROU 18 De Julio (DE-3), the third ship to commemorate the date of the adoption of Uruguays first constitution.

Wickersham moved the Third District court headquarters to Fairbanks in 1903. Judge Wickersham (center) in council with Indian chiefs, Fairbanks, Alaska James Wickersham (August 24, 1857 – October 24, 1939) was a district judge for Alaska, appointed by U.S. President William McKinley to the Third Judicial District in 1900. He resigned his post in 1908 and was subsequently elected as Alaska's delegate to Congress, serving until 1917 and then being re-elected in 1930. He was instrumental in the passage of the Organic Act of 1912, which granted Alaska territorial status, introduced the Alaska Railroad Bill, legislation to establish McKinley Park, and the first Alaska Statehood Bill in 1916. He was among those responsible for the creation of the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, which later became the University of Alaska. A residence hall on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus is named in his honor. Wickersham was born near Patoka, Illinois and moved in 1883 with his wife, Deborah, to Tacoma, Washington Territory, where he became a judge. While in Tacoma he helped lead a mob which forced the city's Chinese population out of town, and was later arrested as one of the \\"Tacoma Twenty- Seven,\\" though he was never convicted. He was a member of the Tacoma Academy of Science and was President of that organization in 1893. He presented a paper to the Academy on 6 Feb, 1893, entitled, Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier? During the presentation the \\"following prominent Indians representing the Puyallup, Nesqually and Klickitat tribes were seated on the platform: George Leschi, son of Quiemuth, a leader in the Indian war of 1855; Jack Simmons; John Hiaton, one of the patriarchs of the reservation, 80 years of age, and a signer of the treaty of 1854; Mrs. John Hiaton and John Powers\\". The presentation has been reproduced by a digital file created at the Library of Congress.Is it Mount Tacoma, or Rainier? Originally published in Tacoma: News Publishing Company 1893, reproduced by the Library of Congress from a digital file. Arrival in Alaska When Wickersham set off for Alaska he was allegedly dodging a government posting in Japan, and he told anyone who asked that he preferred the Eagle post, saying he \\"yearned for the Yukon, not Yokohama\\". With the introduction of federal oversight in the form of three district court judges, Wickersham being one of the two new appointees, his peers being Arthur H. Noyes in Nome and the previously established Melville C. Brown in Juneau, he was now one of the three most powerful people in Alaska, with no one within 3,000 miles to overrule his decisions or stand in his way. After the Nome Gold Conspiracy involving prominent Republican National Committee member Alexander McKenzie, it was Wickersham they turned to clean up the legal mess left by then ousted Judge Noyes, allegedly involved. Through his hard work, and his tenacity, he made sure everyone understood his authority. His start into Alaskan official law was a litigation of most profound simplicity, and the epitome of Alaskan frontier spirit. \\"Chief Charley, head of the Charley River band of the Tena Indians, was the first litigant to appeal to the new court officials for justice.\\" Someone from upriver had stolen his dog, a very serious offense that warranted violence if this new American law official could not have it solved within his power peacefully. After being given the run around, Charley finally reached Wickersham and consulted the highest court in the land. After listening carefully Wickersham appointed a deputy to retrieve the stolen animal, and waited with the chief for his return, chatting about everyday problems. When the dog was safely returned two points were driven home, the concrete authority of Judge Wickersham, and that his tenure in Alaska would be one of action. As the most powerful personage of Federal oversight for the vast majority of the interior of Alaska, Wickersham was an important man to have on your side. His relationship with the development of Fairbanks helped shape not only the future of the Interior's steadily expanding city, but also the shape of things to come for the state. Wickersham's working relationship with Captain E.T. Barnette led to the initially small settlement developing into a city that became a gateway to the arctic. Through Barnette and Wickersham's efforts, Fairbanks became incorporated, initiated federal development, and settled locations for key federal positions in the city thus insuring its future relevance. Though they worked well together for the betterment of Alaska, and particularly the interior, they did not always have the best personal relationship. When presiding over one of Barnette's many gold claim cases, he inferred that if the case went in his favor, Wickersham could benefit from the decision himself after his term was over. \\"It was an outright bribe.\\" Quoted one historian. Personal opinions and ever changing allegiances aside, as far as the future of Fairbanks went, Barnette could always count on Wickersham to have his back as what Barnette wanted usually was what was best for Fairbanks. As Wickersham finished up his time as judge, he moved on to represent Alaskas' interests in Washington. Congressional delegate From the position of the judge on the trail in Alaska, Wickersham successfully ran for the position of congressional delegate for the District of Alaska in 1908 beginning his term in 1909. In his first two terms as delegate, Wickersham focused on two aspects: territorial status for Alaska and trust-busting the Alaska Syndicate. Photo of James Wickersham standing in front of a First National Bank Assay Office, holding a gold (?) brick, cigar in mouth. The issue of home-rule in Alaska falls under the popular idea that Alaska had been neglected by the United States federal government since its purchase from Russia in 1867 and was denied any form of self-government. The first semblance of self-government came through the First Organic Act in 1884. This act instated \\"…a governor, judge, attorney, clerk of court, marshal, four deputy marshals, and four commissioners, who were to function as justices of the peace.\\" Mainly as a reactionary to the huge population increase during the Klondike gold rush, these government offices were not voted in by Alaskans, but appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate each for a four- year term. This act also moved Alaska from simply a purchased piece of property ruled by the U.S. military to the status of District. However, the Organic Act of 1884 was simply a start to government in Alaska and it still left the control of Alaska's resources to the federal government and largely, outside private interests. James Wickersham Portrait photo, 1921-1922The Alaska Syndicate, a conglomeration of privately owned businesses headed by Guggenheim interests, represented outside rule of Alaska's resources. Their main focus was \\"…the development of copper, holdings. It was for this purpose that it acquired and operated transportation lines.\\" Thus, the Alaska Syndicate not only ruled the copper fields but the steamship lines that moved the copper back to the United States. When Wickersham became the Delegate for Alaska, he vowed to relinquish the Alaska Syndicate's hold on copper and transportation. One of the first issues that brought the Alaska Syndicate and Wickersham into battle was over Wickersham's first attempt to create a territorial legislature in 1909. According to Wickersham's first bill as delegate, \\"it provided for a legislature of twenty-four members – eight in the Senate and sixteen in the House.\\" However, President Taft believed that Alaska was not ready for territorial government and status. For the Alaska Syndicate, this brought relief. Those interested in Alaska's resources had opposed Wickersham due to the fear of industry taxes on their copper holdings if Alaska progressed to territorial status, or even worse, statehood. Only two years later in Wickersham's second term as delegate, the home-rule bill passed as the Second Organic Act in 1912 establishing Alaska officially as a United States territory with a legislature. While Congress still maintained heavy control over the territory, it allowed Wickersham to move against the Alaska Syndicate. Continuing on the forward momentum of the Second Organic Act, Wickersham sought, \\"…congressional authorization for a federal railroad in Alaska.\\". While this again would bring more government control to Alaska, it did mean that the Guggenheim hold on transportation would be severely weakened. In order to see this bill passed in the senate, Wickersham stood for over five hours delivering a speech to Congress, at that time the longest speech on record. His effort was not wasted and \\"the bill passed the Senate on January 24 by a vote of 46 to 16.\\" Wickersham would go on to serve several more terms as Alaska's delegate to Congress, his last term running from 1931-1933. His time as delegate began major political themes in Alaska's history that still hold today. Alaska exists on the paradoxical theory of demanding state rule over its resources and yet still incredibly dependent on the federal government largely through, presently, the investment of the Department of Defense. Wickersham's dilemma began this mindset of federal dependence because he saw that as a better alternative than having private interests and \\"Robber-Barons\\" ruling over Alaska's resources. =Oratory= The 1903 Denali climb Wickersham made the first recorded attempt of Mt. Denali (first Dinmore's Mountain, then Mt. McKinley). Departing from Fairbanks May 16, 1903, on the Tanana Chief steamer with two mules, Mark and Hannah. There were four companions that joined him on the trip: George Jeffrey, Mort Stevens, Charlie Web and John McLeod. To finance the venture the men published the first Tanana region Newspaper \\"The Fairbanks Miner, Vol. 1, No.1, May, 1903\\", eight pages typed up on a typewriter. On the second day of being on the steamer, Wickersham's party had a stroke of luck and discovered a boat drifting through the river ice flow. The team dubbed Wickersham the Admiral of the newly named Mudlark and used the boat while traversing the Kantishna River. By June 4 the excursion party had staked Gold Claims on Chitsia Creek, and thanks to a map with description filed at Rampart, led to larger prospecting for the Kantishna Mining. The trip took a turn of misfortune when the party came to an impassable mountain face, later known as Wickersham Wall. It was June 20 Wickersham wrote in his diary \\"...and have reluctantly concluded there is no possible chance of further ascent from this side of Denali at this season--or any other season for that matter.\\" Even more defeating for the party, is a wreck of their raft in a glacial stream on the descent that destroys their food supply and equipment. Hungry, tired, and terrorized by mosquitoes the group \\"happily ended the first attempt of white men...to scale the mighty walls of Denali.\\" ... The first attempted summit of Denali took place in 1903. The mountaineer was Judge James Wickersham. He attempted to climb the mountain via Peters Glacier and the North Face, but he fell far short of his goal. The route Wickersham tried to ascend wasn’t accomplished until 1963 due to avalanche dangers. The summit he attempted is now known as Wickersham’s Wall. Legacy Wickersham Dome, 3,207 feet, between Fairbanks and Livengood was named after the former judge and congressman. In 1960, Mount Wickersham in the Chugach Mountains was named after him.

WWPR-FM is owned by iHeartMedia and broadcasts from studios in the former AT&T; Building in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan; its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. The station is the flagship station of the nationally syndicated morning show, The Breakfast Club. History =WWRL-FM and WRFM (1953–1985)= The station first signed-on the air on December 14, 1953 as WWRL-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1954 p. 226 The station was co-owned with WWRL (1600 AM) by radio enthusiast William Reuman, studios were in Woodside, Queens. The call sign was changed to WRFM in October 1957, breaking away from the AM simulcast with a diversified and classical music format. Bonneville International, the broadcast arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, purchased WRFM in 1967. The following year, WRFM, billing itself as \\"Stereo 105\\", adopted a beautiful music format. WRFM played mostly instrumental music with about one vocal every 15 minutes. It featured the works of such artists as Mantovani, Henry Mancini, Ferrante & Teicher, Percy Faith, Hollyridge Strings, Leroy Anderson, Frank Mills and Richard Clayderman. Mixed in were vocals by such artists as Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, Peggy Lee, the Lettermen, Nat King Cole and Barbra Streisand. Ratings for the station were good, and for a couple of times, WRFM was the top-rated FM station in New York. WRFM competed for Beautiful Music listeners with simulcasters WPAT AM/-FM, with two other easy listening stations, WTFM and WVNJ-FM usually trailing. As the 1980s began, WRFM started mixing in some soft contemporary artist vocals including the Carpenters, Barry Manilow, Kenny Rogers and Dionne Warwick, and it was also used on an electronic program guide in Manhattan throughout the '80s. In 1984, the station increased vocals to six per hour and cut back on adult standards titles, while also adding softer songs by top 40 artists, such as Billy Joel, Michael Jackson, Chicago, Elton John, the Beatles and Whitney Houston. =Soft Rock 105FM (1986–1990)= The WNSR logo that was in use from 1986 until rebranding as \\"Mix 105\\" in 1990. The station's ratings continued to be strong, but by 1985, the easy listening audience was starting to age and was not as attractive to advertisers. On April 17, 1986, the station switched to a gold-based adult contemporary format with the call letters WNSR, for New York's Soft Rock.\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, April 28, 1986, pg. 96 WNSR focused on songs from the 1960s and 1970s, with some 1980s titles and a moderate amount of current adult contemporary songs as well. Initially, the station's ratings were modest. However, once AC competitor 103.5 WYNY went to a country music format, WNSR's ratings went up. =Mix 105 (1990–1996)= By 1990, the station became known as \\"Mix 105\\", and shifted to more of a hot adult contemporary format, focusing on 1970s, 1980s and current hits, with only a few 1960s titles. By April 1992, when the station changed its call letters to WMXV, the 1960s hits were gone, and more recent music was added. By 1995, the station was only playing hits of the 1980s and 1990s, and even mixing in some lighter modern rock songs, as many other Hot AC stations were doing at this time. =105.1 The Buzz (1996–1997)= On November 13, 1996, the Hot AC format at WMXV abruptly ended, and after a day of playing music from Broadway musicals, the station switched formats to an adult-friendly Modern AC format as WDBZ (\\"The Buzz\\"). On August 5, 1997, with ratings on the decline, the call sign changed back to WNSR. The original plan was for the station to drop the \\"Buzz\\" format in favor of an oldies-based AC format, playing songs from 1964 to current hits. The station was to have launched on August 18, 1997, with television commercials set to air. However, Bonneville instead decided to sell the station to Chancellor Media, which also owned WHTZ, WLTW, WKTU, and WAXQ.\\"WDBZ is Optioned to 2 Broadcasters\\", Geraldine Fabrikant, New York Times, August 8, 1997 \\"Signals Getting Stronger: Chancellor Broadcasting Set to Add WDBZ to City Collection\\", Phyllis Furman, The Daily News, August 6, 1997 As a result, the format change for 105.1 was canceled and the station remained \\"The Buzz\\" for a while longer, with the reverted WNSR call letters. Gradually, from September through November 1997, the station returned to Hot AC, and then Mainstream AC. For the next few months, the station would simply be known on-air as \\"FM 105.1\\", and only used the WNSR call sign for the legal station identification. =Big 105 (1998)= On January 21, 1998, at 6:30 p.m., the station relaunched as \\"Big 105\\", with the call letters WBIX (which took effect on April 13). The first song on \\"Big 105\\" was \\"Big Time\\" by Peter Gabriel. Despite this relaunch, the station played basically the same music as it did in the months before, and could not compete with highly rated WLTW. Initially, Big 105 was musically very close to WLTW, but evolved to a Hot AC format by that May, similar to what WPLJ was playing at the time. WBIX also added Danny Bonaduce of The Partridge Family TV show fame as its morning show host. It also added Casey Kasem's American Top 20 syndicated countdown program on Sundays, coinciding with Kasem's move to Chancellor Media from Westwood One earlier in the year. Ratings continued to fail, and by October 1998, WBIX leaned toward Modern AC, similar to the former \\"Buzz\\" format, but not as deep. =Jammin' 105 (1998–2002)= The Jammin 105 logo that lasted from 1998 through early 2002. On December 10, 1998, at 6 p.m., after playing \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\\" by Green Day, the station flipped to then-growing \\"Jammin' Oldies\\" format, and (after a \\"name the station\\" contest) branded as \\"Jammin' 105\\". The first song on \\"Jammin'\\" was \\"Celebration\\" by Kool & the Gang. On March 1, 1999, WBIX changed call letters to WTJM, in order to match the \\"Jammin'\\" branding. The station played rhythmic and dance pop hits of the mid-1960s through the 1980s. TV comedian Jay Thomas was hired for morning drive time. WTJM did better in the ratings than the previous format, and its results initially challenged those of longtime oldies station WCBS-FM. Chancellor merged with Capstar Broadcasting to form AMFM Inc. in 1999. Then, in 2000, Clear Channel Communications merged with AMFM Inc., giving WTJM and the other four stations a new owner. Under Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia), WTJM evolved into an urban oldies direction, and then to an urban adult contemporary format, while keeping the \\"Jammin' 105\\" moniker. Frankie Blue was brought in to program the shift to urban AC. He immediately brought in Jeff Foxx (formerly of WRKS and WBLS) and teamed him with comedian George Wallace to form the \\"Jammin' New York Wake-up Club\\". While the morning show was a hit, it did not warrant keeping the format due to the station's low ratings in other dayparts. =Power 105.1 (2002–present)= At 6:05 a.m. on March 14, 2002, the station abruptly changed, as it flipped to its current mainstream urban format as WWPR-FM \\"Power 105.1\\". A speculated reason for the format change is that while they could not beat competitor WQHT (\\"Hot 97\\"), they could take enough ratings away from them to keep them from being number one, which would leave WWPR's sister station WLTW with a comfortable lead in that race (prior to the change, WQHT and WLTW had alternated at the top spot). By 2004, WWPR-FM technically became the market's only urban contemporary station due to the transition of 107.5 WBLS from urban contemporary to urban adult contemporary. WQHT reports as rhythmic contemporary to Mediabase & Nielsen BDS, although WQHT was an urban reporter on Nielsen BDS from 2006-2007. WWPR-FM and WQHT's playlists are similar, and the two stations aim at roughly the same audience. WQHT had been the only New York station featuring current hip hop and R&B; since its owner, Emmis Communications, purchased WRKS in 1994 and moved that station towards an adult R&B; format. In an effort to build an audience, WWPR- FM brought in former Hot 97 personalities and Yo! MTV Raps hosts Ed Lover and Doctor Dré to anchor the station's morning show. The station then entered into the top five of the Arbitron ratings, a position it maintained for several years. The station terminated Doctor Dre's contract in December 2003 and gave Ed Lover a new co-host in rapper-turned-radio personality Monie Love. The morning team lasted for about a year. By the end of 2004, WWPR decided to heat up the rivalry with WQHT by bringing in ex-Hot 97 morning show hosts Star & Buc Wild as their new morning drive team, as well-known disc jockeys were deemed critical to the station's success. The \\"Star and Buc Wild Morning Show\\" was replaced in 2006 by Live with Big Tigger and Egypt. That team was later replaced by a returning Ed Lover, who was later joined by Malikha Mallette. This last show incarnation ended on November 19, 2010, when Ed Lover was released from the station and Mallette was reassigned to the midday shift, replacing De Ja. =Star controversy= Troi Torain (born May 3, 1964), who previously worked at Power 105's rival hip-hop station WQHT with his half- brother Timothy Joseph (born January 3, 1979) who took Torain's old stage name \\"Buc Wild\\" until he switched to Power 105, is known as \\"Star\\" from the Star & Buc Wild morning show. Star stands for \\"Strange Thoughts and Revelations\\". He had a running on-air feud with Power 105.1's DJ Envy, whose real name is Raashaun Casey. In a May 3, 2006 broadcast, Torain mentioned DJ Envy's wife and child. Torain said he would pay $500 to any listener who told him where the girl attended school. Torain, who is bi-racial, also used racial and sexual epithets about DJ Envy's wife, Gia Casey, who is part Asian. New York City Council members called for an investigation by law enforcement and the Federal Communications Commission. After the protests, Clear Channel Communications, the corporate owner of Power 105, suspended Torain. After reviewing transcripts of the broadcast, New York City law enforcement officials called Torain to police headquarters in Lower Manhattan to surrender his target pistol license and 9-millimeter handgun. Detectives from the Hate Crimes Unit charged him with endangering the welfare of a child. Leaving the precinct house, Torain leaned back and grinned for television cameras, saying \\"You're looking at the new Lenny Bruce.\\" Torain's lawyer's defended his broadcasts on first amendment grounds.\\"D.J. Is Arrested Over His Threat to Rival's Child.\\" The New York Times May 13, 2006. Star and Buc Wild were replaced with Live with Big Tigger and Egypt on May 4, 2006.

Its Finnish part is within Urho Kekkonen National Park in the municipality of Savukoski. Its name literally means \\"Ear Fell\\" in Finnish due to its unique shape. Characterised by its thick pine forest, frozen lakes and hundreds of thousands of reindeer which roam the land, Korvatunturi stands above sea level. It has three peaks, with the middle one between Finland and Russia's borders. Since Korvatunturi is located within the boundaries of the country, all visitors are required to secure written permission from the Finnish Border Guard. There are also no roads that directly lead to the fell, but there are hike trails that provide access, such as the one found in the Savukoski area.  Cultural significance  Korvatunturi in winter Korvatunturi is best known as the home of Father Christmas (or Joulupukki in Finnish). According to Finnish folklore, this land is the location of Father Christmas’ secret workshop, where toys, trinkets and gifts are made and eventually wrapped by elves. Known for their good-natured demeanour and their role as guardians of homes, these gnomes are also responsible for analysing weather patterns for the yearly gift-giving trip around the world. People have also said that the ear-shaped structure of the fell allows Father Christmas to hear the wishes of every child on Earth. In popular media, this legend has been adapted into the film Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale.

Released on 21 February 1986, it peaked at No. 11 on the UK album chart and No. 39 on the Billboard 200. It was selected as one of Rolling Stone's top twenty albums of the year. In 2000 it was voted number 540 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Released in the United Kingdom as F-Beat ZL 70946, and in the United States as Columbia JC40173, some songs have a Country feel, reflecting his interest in Americana, whilst 'American Without Tears' deals with the experience of Irish immigrants in the US, and 'Little Palaces' references Costello's working-class roots. Content During late 1984 and early 1985, Costello undertook a series of solo tours, sharing the bill with musician T-Bone Burnett. Costello and Burnett recorded a single together in early 1985, \\"The People's Limousine\\" (credited to 'The Coward Brothers'), and ventured to imagine appropriate backing musicians for Costello's new songs. They booked time at Ocean Way and Sunset Sound studios in Los Angeles, and assembled members of the TCB Band who had backed Elvis Presley in the 1970s (Costello being more familiar with their work on records by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris). Other sessions included the jazz bassist Ray Brown and New Orleans drummer Earl Palmer, and a group of musicians dubbed 'the Confederates', featuring T-Bone Wolk, Mickey Curry, and producer Mitchell Froom. Costello's usual backing musicians the Attractions appear on only one track, \\"Suit of Lights\\", but returned to record in full his next album Blood & Chocolate. In the album credits, Costello uses three different noms de plume for himself: his given name of Declan MacManus; his stage name of Elvis Costello; and the nickname given him by producer Nick Lowe earlier in his career, the Little Hands of Concrete, this being a reference to his habitual breaking of guitar strings during recording sessions. The version of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\", a song first recorded in 1964 by Nina Simone, was released as a single and peaked at No. 33 on the UK singles chart. However, it missed the Billboard Hot 100, as did the follow-up single released only in America: \\"Lovable\\". The single by Burnett and Costello as the Coward Brothers did not chart in either nation. Though not released in 1986, \\"Brilliant Mistake\\" saw release as a single in 2005. Release history The album was released initially on vinyl in 1986, with the Rykodisc Records reissue arriving nine years later on a single compact disc with five bonus tracks, including the Coward Brothers single. Early limited edition pressings also included a six-track bonus disc: Elvis Costello & The Confederates – Live on Broadway, 1986.

Hypermetabolism is accompanied by a variety of internal and external symptoms, most notably extreme weight loss, and can also be a symptom in itself. This state of increased metabolic activity can signal underlying issues, especially hyperthyroidism. Patients with Fatal familial insomnia, an extremely rare and strictly hereditary disorder, also presents with hypermetabolism; however, this universally fatal disorder is exceedingly rare, with only a few known cases worldwide. The drastic impact of the hypermetabolic state on patient nutritional requirements is often understated or overlooked as well. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may last for days, weeks, or months until the injury is healed. The most apparent sign of hypermetabolism is an abnormally high intake of calories followed by continuous weight loss. Internal symptoms of hypermetabolism include but are not limited to: peripheral insulin resistance, elevated catabolism of protein, carbohydrates and triglycerides, and a negative nitrogen balance in the body. Outward symptoms of hypermetabolism may include: * Weight loss * Anemia * Fatigue * Elevated heart rate * Irregular heartbeat * Insomnia * Dysautonomia * Shortness of breath * Muscle weakness * Excessive sweating Pathophysiology During the acute phase, the liver redirects protein synthesis, causing up-regulation of certain proteins and down-regulation of others. Measuring the serum level of proteins that are up- and down-regulated during the acute phase can reveal extremely important information about the patient's nutritional state. The most important up-regulated protein is C-reactive protein, which can rapidly increase 20- to 1,000-fold during the acute phase. Hypermetabolism also causes expedited catabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and triglycerides in order to meet the increased metabolic demands. Diagnosis Quantitation by indirect calorimetry, as opposed to the Harris-Benedict equation, is needed to accurately measure REE in cancer patients. Differential diagnosis Hypermetabolism is one symptom of Astrocytoma. Shown above is a PET scan of hypermetabolic Astrocytoma in the brain. Many different illnesses can cause an increase in metabolic activity as the body combats illness and disease in order to heal itself. Hypermetabolism is a common symptom of various pathologies. Some of the most prevalent diseases characterized by hypermetabolism are listed below. * Hyperthyroidism: Manifestation: An overactive thyroid often causes a state of increased metabolic activity. * Friedreich's ataxia: Manifestation: Local cerebral metabolic activity is increased extensively as the disease progresses. * Fatal familial insomnia: Manifestation: Hypermetabolism in the thalamus occurs and disrupts sleep spindle formation that occurs there. * Graves' disease: Manifestation: Excess hypermetabolically-induced thyroid hormone activates sympathetic pathways, causing the eyelids to retract and remain constantly elevated. * Anorexia and bulimia: Manifestation: The prolonged stress put on the body as a result of these eating disorders forces the body into starvation mode. Some patients recovering from these disorders experience hypermetabolism until they resume normal diets. * Astrocytoma: Manifestation: Causes hypermetabolic lesions in the brain Treatment Ibuprofen, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and beta-blockers have been reported in some preliminary studies to decrease REE, which may allow patients to meet their caloric needs and gain weight.

Though he did not create many character designs, he was famous for his character animation skills. His work on Galaxy Express 999 (1979) and Harmagedon (1983) were very influential to an entire generation of animators in Japan. These two works also served as partial inspiration for Takashi Murakami's Superflat art movement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he worked closely with director Hayao Miyazaki on several movies from Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind to Princess Mononoke. He was also known for breaking down the directorial system in animation, allowing individual key animators to exert their own style into a particular work. He died at the age of 57 of a heart attack on July 21, 2009. His works inspired the art and works of animators such as Hiroyuki Imaishi, Masahito Yamashita, Akira Amemiya and Masami Obari. The final episode of Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt was dedicated in memory of him, and his influential work garnered special praise from many industry figures, such as Hayao Miyazaki.

Early life Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, age 10 (Beaulieu Palace House) Montagu was born at his grandparents’ home in Thurloe Square, South Kensington, London, and inherited his barony in 1929 at the age of two, when his father John died of pneumonia. He held his peerage for the third longest time (86 years and 155 days) anyone has held a British peerage (the others being The 7th Marquess Townshend at 88 years, and The 13th Lord Sinclair at 87 years). His mother was his father's second wife, Alice Crake (1895–1996). He attended St Peter's Court, a prep school at Broadstairs in Kent, then Ridley College in Canada, Eton College and finally New College, Oxford. He served as a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, including service in Palestine before the end of the British Mandate. On coming of age, Lord Montagu immediately took his seat in the House of Lords and swiftly made his maiden speech on the subject of Palestine. He read Modern History at Oxford, but during his second year an altercation between the Bullingdon Club, of which he was a member, and the Oxford University Dramatic Society led to his room being wrecked, and he felt obliged to leave. Activities Lord Montagu gained an interest in motoring from his father — who had commissioned the original \\"Spirit of Ecstasy\\" mascot for his Rolls-Royce — and with his family collection of historic cars this led him to open the National Motor Museum in the grounds of his stately home, Beaulieu Palace House, Beaulieu, Hampshire, in 1952. From 1956 to 1961 he held the influential Beaulieu Jazz Festival in the grounds of Palace House; this was a leading contribution to the development of festival culture in Britain, as it attracted thousands of young people who, from 1958 on, would camp out and listen and dance to live music. The 1960 festival saw an altercation between modern and trad jazz fans, in a very minor riot that became known as the Battle of Beaulieu.See George McKay (2005). Circular Breathing: The Cultural Politics of Jazz in Britain. Durham NC: Duke University Press. Montagu founded The Veteran And Vintage Magazine in 1956 and continued to develop the museum, making a name for himself in tourism. He was chairman of the Historic Houses Association from 1973 to 1978, President of the Institute of Traffic Administration from 1973 to 1974 and chairman of English Heritage from 1984 to 1992. Whilst there he appointed Jennifer Page (later of the Millennium Dome) as Chief Executive in 1989. In the 1999 reform of the House of Lords, Montagu was one of 92 hereditary peers who remained in Parliament. In 2007, he was Vice-Commodore of the House of Lords Yacht Club.Dod's Parliamentary Companion 2007, p. 772 He gave a notice of his intention to retire from the House of Lords on 17 September 2015, but he died before that. Sexuality Lord Montagu of Beaulieu on his 80th birthday by Allan Warren Montagu knew from an early stage of life that he was bisexual, and while attending Oxford was relieved to find others with similar feelings. In a 2000 interview he stated, \\"My attraction to both sexes neither changed nor diminished at university and it was comforting to find that I was not the only person faced with such a predicament. I agonised less than my contemporaries, for I was reconciled to my bisexuality, but I was still nervous about being exposed.\\" =Trial and imprisonment= Despite keeping his homosexual affairs discreet and out of the public eye, in the mid-1950s, Montagu became \\"one of the most notorious public figures of his generation,\\" after his conviction and imprisonment for \\"conspiracy to incite certain male persons to commit serious offences with male persons,\\" a charge which was also used in the Oscar Wilde trials in 1895, which was derived from a law that remained on the statute books until 1967. In old age, Montagu reminisced about it in these terms: > In the cold war atmosphere of the 1950s, when witch hunts later called the > Lavender Scare were ruining the lives of many gay men and lesbian women in > the United States, the parallel political atmosphere in Britain was > virulently anti-homosexual. The then Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, > had promised \\"a new drive against male vice\\" that would \\"rid England of this > plague.\\" As many as 1,000 men were locked up in Britain's prisons every year > amid a widespread police clampdown on homosexual offences. Undercover > officers acting as \\"agents provocateurs\\" would pose as gay men soliciting in > public places. The prevailing mood was one of barely concealed paranoia. On two occasions Montagu was charged and committed for trial at Winchester Assizes, firstly in 1953 for having underage sex with a 14-year-old boy scout at his beach hut on the Solent, a charge he always denied. The American Institute of Public Relations had just voted him the most promising young PR man when he was arrested. Although he enjoyed the support of his close family and a wide variety of friends, for a year or so he became \\"the subject of endless blue jokes and innumerable bawdy songs\\". When prosecutors failed to achieve a conviction, in what Montagu has characterised as a \\"witch hunt\\" to secure a high-profile conviction, he was arrested again in 1954 and charged with performing \\"gross offences\\" with an RAF serviceman during a weekend party at the beach hut on his country estate. Montagu always maintained he was innocent of this charge as well (\\"We had some drinks, we danced, we kissed, that's all\\"). Nevertheless, he was imprisoned for twelve months for \\"consensual homosexual offences\\" along with Michael Pitt-Rivers and Peter Wildeblood. =Role in LGBT history= Unlike the other defendants in the trial, Montagu continued to protest his innocence. The trial caused a backlash of opinion among some politicians and church leaders that led to the setting up of the Wolfenden Committee, which in its 1957 report recommended the decriminalisation of homosexual activity in private between two adults. Ten years later, Parliament finally carried out the recommendation, a huge turning point in gay history in Britain, where anal sex, a form of \\"buggery\\", had been a criminal offence ever since the Buggery Act 1533. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu with his first wife, Belinda, whom he married in 1958 Lord Montagu of Beaulieu and his second wife, Fiona, on their wedding day in 1974, by Allan Warren In 2000, when his autobiography appeared, Montagu broke down in tears when it was suggested to him that the reform of the law on homosexuality would be his monument. In a 2007 interview, when asked if he felt that he and his co- defendants had been instrumental in the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain, Lord Montagu said, \\"I am slightly proud that the law has been changed to the benefit of so many people. I would like to think that I would get some credit for that. Maybe I'm being very boastful about it but I think because of the way we behaved and conducted our lives afterwards, because we didn't sell our stories, we just returned quietly to our lives, I think that had a big effect on public opinion.\\" Personal life and death In 1958, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu married Belinda Crossley, a granddaughter of The 1st Baron Somerleyton, by whom he had a son and a daughter before the couple divorced in 1974: * Ralph Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 4th Baron Montagu of Beaulieu (born 13 March 1961) * Hon Mary Montagu-Scott (born 1964), married with issue to Rupert Scott (who took the surname Montagu-Scott, 4th son of Christopher Bartle Hugh Scott, 12th of Gala) In 1974, he married his second wife, Fiona Margaret Herbert, with whom he had a son: * Hon Jonathan Deane Douglas-Scott-Montagu (born 11 October 1975). Fiona, Lady Montagu of Beaulieu, was born in about 1943 in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe),Murtha, William (2010). 100 Words: Two Hundred Visionaries Share Their Hope for the Future, Conari Press, pp 256–257. the daughter of Richard Leonard Deane Herbert, of Clymping, Sussex.Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, Kelly's Directories, page 1171, 2000. She attended school in Switzerland, and following her education, she worked as film production assistant. She is a director of Beaulieu Enterprises and a trustee of the Countryside Education Trust. She serves as an international advisor to the World Centre of Compassion for Children, led by Nobel Peace Laureate, Betty Williams, as well as a Trustee of Vision-in-Action, led by Yasuhiko Kimura. She additionally serves on The World Wisdom Council, alongside Mikhail Gorbachev, former head of state of the Soviet Union. She was appointed the first global ambassador to the Club of Budapest. Montagu died after a short illness, on 31 August 2015 at the age of 88, at his Beaulieu Estate in the New Forest. He was survived by his three children and two grandchildren. Memoirs and documentary film For nearly half a century, Montagu steadfastly refused to speak publicly about the conviction, instead focusing his energies on the National Motor Museum and other activities. However, in 2000, he finally broke his silence with the publication of his memoirs, Wheels Within Wheels, of which two chapters are devoted to the story of his trial and imprisonment. In interviews, he has stated that by publishing his story, he wanted to \\"put the record straight\\", because he \\"felt it was important to get it accurate.\\" The story of Montagu's trial is told in a 2007 Channel 4 documentary, A Very British Sex Scandal,A Very British Sex Scandal at Channel 4 and the 2017 BBC drama-documentary Against The Law. In April 2013, the Newport Beach Film Festival, at Newport Beach, California, screened Lord Montagu, a documentary by Luke Korem on Montagu's life and accomplishments. The film was also shown at the Napa Valley Film Festival in November 2013.

The decision was made on a simple majority of votes cast. Background The Act was a result of the strong temperance movement in Scotland before the First World War. Brewers and publicans formed defence committees to fight temperance propaganda, and publicans became unwilling to spend money on improvements to their premises in case the district went \\"dry\\". The Act was superseded by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1959 which incorporated the same provisions as the 1913 Act and consolidated Scottish licensing law. These provisions and the local polls were abolished by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. There was resistance from the House of Lords to the passing of the Act, leading to threats to use the (relatively new) Parliament Act 1911 to pass it. In the end, these threats pressured the Lords to pass the act. 1920 referendums The first opportunity to petition for a poll on local prohibition was in June 1920. In order for a poll to be called, there had to be a petition signed by 10% of the registered voters in a burgh, parish or ward.\\"Temperance Reform: Local Poll in Scotland\\", The Age, 6 November 1920 The first batch of polls were then held alongside municipal elections in November and December, the first being in Glasgow on 2 November.\\"Worldwide Movement: Comprehensive Address\\", Ashburton Guardian, 12 March 1921 The conditions required to prohibit the sale of alcohol in an area were strict. Three options appeared on the poll: no change, a 25% reduction in licences to sell alcohol, and the abolition of all existing licences. In order for prohibition to be implemented, that option required the support of at least 55% support of voters, and at least 35% of everyone registered to vote in the constituency. However, if this option was not successful, all votes for \\"no licence\\" would be counted towards the 25% reduction tally. The prohibition was also limited. There was no proscription of the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, nor of their wholesale, or their consumption in private. Local authorities were still permitted to license hotels and restaurants, providing that alcohol was only consumed with a meal. Although temperance campaigners initially hoped to hold polls in at least 1,000 of the 1,200 licensing districts of Scotland, ultimately there were 584 successful petitions.\\"Veto polls: the constant threat to licensees\\", Glasgow Herald, 7 December 1970 By the end of polling, in late December, 60% of votes had been cast for \\"no change\\", 38% for \\"no licence\\", and 2% for the reduction of licences.\\"Local option: how Scotland voted\\", Sydney Morning Herald About 40 districts voted in favour of prohibition, including Airdrie, Cambuslang, Kilsyth, Kirkintilloch, Parkinch, Stewarton and Whitehead.Callum G. Brown, Religion and society in Scotland since 1707, p.146 Glasgow was a particular target for the prohibitionists. At the 1920 poll, a majority of voters plumped for \\"no licence\\" in eleven wards, but due to the turnout and supermajority requirements, it was only successful in four. Repeal attempts In many newly dry districts, new polls were sponsored by licensees at the earliest possibility, three years later. 257 polls were held, in total, the majority being a second attempt at prohibition. The next big wave came in 1927, when 113 were held, following which, prohibition remained in place in only seventeen wards. Among these was Lerwick, where alcohol remained prohibited until 1947.Callum G. Brown, Up- helly-aa: custom, culture, and community in Shetland, p.169 Between 1913 and 1965 1,131 polls were held under the Act and the same provisions in the 1959 Act, with the vast majority (1,079) held before 1930. The holding of votes continued to tail off during the 1930s and 40s. By 1970, there were still sixteen districts with prohibition, but just one or two new polls held annually.

It is located east of Arima and southwest of the village of Toco. It is the seat of the Sangre Grande Regional Corporation and capital of the region.  Overview  The name Sangre Grande means \\"big blood\\", and it has been suggested that the town was named for a battle that took place between the native Amerindians and the Spanish settlers. However, this interpretation is not supported by historical records. The true origin of the name refers to when, in the late 1770s, Spanish surveyors who were charting the island for the purposes of creating a map, found that the waters of two of the tributaries of the nearby Oropouche River were red as blood, hence the name. Similarly, the neighbouring town is called Sangre Chiquito (\\"small blood\\") is named for the presence of a smaller, similarly colored river in that town. Sangre Grande grew as a result of the growth of cacao cultivation in the late nineteenth century. It grew further when it became the terminus of the railroad. Construction of the railroad caused the town to migrate down the hill to meet the railroad. When the town relocated to the foot of the hill, the name Sangre Grande moved with it. As a result, the name of the pre-existing village, Cunapo, was largely, but not entirely, lost. Climate Sangre Grande has a tropical rainforest climate according to the Köppen climate classification, characterized by high temperatures and rainfall. Temperatures climb to a maximum of around 30°C throughout the year, hovering at a low of around 23°C at night in Summer and 19°C in winter. Temperatures outside of the immediate town center are usually around 2-3°C lower due to abundant moisture and cloud clover of the lush surrounding forest. Rainfall is heavy all year, but especially so June through December, peaking in November at 342mm, and being at its driest in March with 88mm., Climate Sangre Grande, Cli> Infrastructure Sangre Grande is more developed than its surrounding areas. Many residents from surrounding areas depend on Sangre Grande for Government facilities as well as for shopping. Many residents in surrounding villages also come to Sangre Grande as a means of getting transportation to larger towns for example Arima and Port of Spain. =Healthcare= Sangre Grande has both a Government hospital (located on Ojoe Road) and a Government Health Clinic. = Transportation = The Eastern Main Road is the most important road leading into Sangre Grande as the Churchill Roosevelt Highway ends in Wallerfield. The Eastern Main Road connects Sangre Grande to the east to Sangre Chiquito and Manzanilla and to the west to Arima and Port of Spain. The second major road in Toco Road connects Sangre Grande to villages in the northeast, for example Toco and Matelot. =Railroad= The railways in Trinidad closed in the late 20th century, but many traces of the railroad's passage through Sangre Grande still exist. The current Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) terminal was formerly the train station. Additionally, tracks leading into Sangre Grande have been converted into roads, although it still bears the name of Railway Road. However, with growing road traffic congestion on the nation's roads, there are plans in to introduce a rapid rail whose first stage of development will stretch from Sangre Grande to Port of Spain. =Bus= Buses still ply the routes in and out of Sangre Grande. The bus terminus in the heart of Sangre Grande was recently upgraded. =Maxi taxi= Maxi taxis as well as traditional taxis service Sangre Grande. The Maxi taxis were first situated in the vicinity of the PTSC bus terminus, however the busyness of this location combined with the growing number of Maxi taxis had exacerbated traffic problems in the area and the old PTSC service station and washing bay on Brierly Street was converted to a maxi taxi hub instead. Here, Maxi taxis heading to both Arima and Port of Spain can be found. Education As in the rest of the country, Sangre Grande is home to primary and secondary schools which fall into three categories: Government- run, Government-assisted and private. In Sangre Grande there are 2 private secondary schools and one private primary school. =Primary schools= Government-run primary schools: *Sangre Grande Government Primary School *Guaico Government Primary School *North Oropouche Government Primary School Government-assisted primary schools: *Cunapo (St. Francis) R.C.

Steel orchestras Sangre Grande is also home to the Sangre Grande Cordettes which has been a mainstay panside in the area for many years. The band often makes the national finals of the Panorama competition, where it currently competes in the medium band category. The band's music used to be arranged by one of the most famous pan arrangers in Trinidad, Jit Samaroo. For the past few years, the band has had a new secret weapon, choosing the wildcard arranger from Denmark, Anders Kappel to carry it forward into the panorama competition. Other bands exist in the area, including the Tamana Pioneers (small band category). Several schoolbands in the area also participate in the school panorama competition every year.

Chapter 5: \\"The Schism between Qumran and Enochic Judaism: The Damascus Document (CD)\\". It forms part of the Dead Sea Scrolls, found after 1947 near Qumran, but two fragments had already been discovered in 1897 in the Cairo Geniza. The redactor of the CD text allows that the covenant is open to all Israelites who accept the sect's halakha, while condemning the others as the \\"wicked of Judah\\" against whom God would direct \\"a great anger with flames of fire by the hand of all the angels of destruction against persons turning aside from the path\\". The text states that those who abandon the true covenant \\"will not live\\". The Damascus Document is a composite text edited together from different sections of a larger source, and scholars have attempted to place the different sections in a chronological order to generate a more complete work of the original using evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Discovery The fragments were discovered by Solomon Schechter in 1897 in the Cairo Geniza, a storeroom adjoining Ben Ezra Synagogue in Old Cairo, among over 190,000 manuscripts and fragments that were written in mainly Hebrew and Judaeo-Arabic. The fragments were quite large, and a number of them matched documents found later in Qumran. They were divided into two separate sections, CDa, and CDb. Schechter dated CDa to the 10th century C.E and CDb to 11th or 12th century C.E. In contrast to the fragments found at Qumran, the CD documents are largely complete, and therefore are vital for reconstructing the text. The fragments found by Solomon Schechter were originally called the Zadokite Fragments, but after the work was found at Qumran, the name was changed because the document had numerous references to Damascus. The way this Damascus is treated in the document makes it possible that it was not a literal reference to Damascus in Syria, but to be understood either geographically for Babylon or Qumran itself. If symbolic, it is probably taking up the Biblical language found in Amos 5:27, \\"therefore I shall take you into exile beyond Damascus\\"; Damascus was part of Israel under King David, and the Damascus Document expresses an eschatological hope of the restoration of a Davidic monarchy.  Structure  The combined text of CDa and CDb contains twenty columns of writing. As it has come down to us, two columns have been mislocated: columns 15 & 16 originally preceded col 9. Fragments of this text from Qumran include material not found in CD. The document divides into two parts, commonly called Admonition and Laws. Davies divides the Admonition into four sections: History, Legal, Warnings, a Supplement (which Wise refers to as exhortations).Davies 1983, pp. 52–53.Wise 1996, p. 59. The Laws feature Oaths & vows, Sundry rulings (halakhot), Camp laws, and a fragment of Penal codes (more of which were found in the Qumran fragments). The Damascus Document can be divided into two separate sections of work, The Admonition and the Laws. The Admonition comprises moral instruction, exhortation, and warning addressed to members of the sect, together with polemic against its opponents; it serves as a kind of introduction to the second section. Meanwhile, the Laws looks at this new covenant community expressed to them through the Teacher of Righteousness. It goes into great detail of the different social arrangements that were taking place at the time. = The Admonition = This part is divided into four subsections that each outline different parts of information that were especially relevant to the new covenant community. Section I, I:1–IV:12a there is a strong description of the community and how they originated with their purpose and goals. Section II, IV:12b–VII:9 it outlines the views of people in and outside the community, and discusses that these people are straying from the real law. Meanwhile, the people in this community are drawn together by the covenant, and strict laws they follow together. It is said that people who follow this law will attain salvation. Section III, VII:5–VIII:19 outlines the strong warnings given to the people who stray from the law, and gives vivid critiques of the Prince of Judah, and also three nets of Belial. Section IV, XIX:33–XX:34 has more warnings of not betraying the community, and making promises to be faithful.Philip Davies, The Damascus Covenant, pp. 52, 53 A. Admonition (1–8 + 19–20) :1. History (1.1–4.12a) :background to the community :2. Legal (4.12b–7.9) :the significance of being outside and inside the community, some of the laws :3.

Camp laws (12.22b–14.18a) :laws for camp living, qualification for an overseer, relations with outsiders, ranks and needs of camp members :4. Penal code (14.18b–22) :fragment concerning punishments  CD and the Community Rule  The document contains prominent reference to a cryptic figure called the Teacher of Righteousness, whom some of the other Qumran scrolls treat as a figure from their past, and others treat as a figure in their present, and others still as a figure of the future. (Some of these other scrolls where he is mentioned are the Pesharim on Habakkuk Pesher (numerous times), Micah (once) and Psalms, as well as 4Q172.) The document introduces the group led by the Teacher as having arisen 390 years after the first fall of Jerusalem (circa 200 BCE): “And God observed their deeds, that they sought Him with a whole heart, and He raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide them in the way of His heart.” On the basis of that reference, historians date the Teacher to circa 150 BCE. Scholars have also believed that he was a priest based on other variations in the text that are also thought to be him. These include: “the teacher”, “the unique teacher” and “the interpreter of the law. This Teacher of Righteousness does not feature at all, however, in the Community Rule, another document found amongst the Qumran scrolls. To some scholars, this suggests that the two works are of different Second Temple groups. Most scholars, however, focus on the high degree of shared terminology and legal rulings between the Damascus Document and the Community Rule, including terms like sons of light, and their penal codes and on the likelihood that fragment 4Q265 is a hybrid edition of both documents. They turn to the fact that the Damascus Document describes the group amongst whom the Document was created as having been leaderless for 20 years before the Teacher of Righteousness established his rule over the group to explain that both works are from the same group under different situations. Within this approach of the majority of scholars, the textual relationship between the Damascus Document and Community Rule is not completely resolved, though there is a general agreement that they have some evolutionary connection. Some suspect that the Community Rule is the original text that was later altered to become the Damascus Document, others that the Damascus Document was redacted to become the Community Rule, a third group argues that the Community Rule was created as a utopian ideal rather than a practical replacement for the Damascus Document, and still others that believe the Community Rule and Damascus Document were written for different types of communities, one enclosed and the other open.

(They were to be segregated and be in the \\"colored- only\\" regions if they were to be present in the theaters at all.)

Paramount Pictures, Inc. case divested studios of ownership of theater chains in 1948, many MGM films made afterward still had their first showings in Atlanta at this theater, including Singin' in the Rain, the 1959 Ben-Hur and Doctor Zhivago. The theater was built as DeGive's Grand Opera House in 1893 by entrepreneur and Belgian consul Laurent DeGive, and hosted many concerts and touring opera productions. It is often confused with DeGive's first opera house, which opened in 1870 four blocks south, at the corner of Marietta and Forsyth streets. The confusion is understandable, as DeGive had his name carved prominently above the entrance of the Grand Theater. The wreckage of the Loew's Grand being demolished after the fire in 1978 The Grand was bought by the Loews organization in 1927\\"Condensed Exclusive Items of Financial Interest from Metropolitan Newspapers\\", The Wall Street Journal, Feb 5, 1927 and renovated into a movie theater by architect Thomas W. Lamb. The one-screen theater had 2,088 seats. It was extensively damaged as the result of a fire on January 30, 1978. Although the real estate where the theater had stood was of high value, the theater could not be demolished because of its historic status. This led many to speculate that the cause of the fire was arson, although this speculation has never been proven. The Georgia-Pacific Tower was built on the former site of the theater. Bricks from the building were recycled and used to build a popular Atlanta restaurant, Houston's which features a plaque of remembrance of the theater in the waiting area of its original location five miles north, at 2166 Peachtree. A chandelier from the building now hangs prominently at the center of The Tabernacle, a church turned concert venue in Atlanta.

Centralwings, as its name suggests, competed in the Central European market, namely Poland, with a fleet of LOT Boeing 737 aircraft. Centralwings operated scheduled services from Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, Łódź, Poznań, Szczecin, Warsaw and Wrocław. For most of this time around 60% of its capacity was allocated to routes serving Ireland and the UK, where it faced fierce competition from ultra-low-cost competitors such as Ryanair and Wizz Air. However, it also operated flights to a range of Mediterranean beach and island destinations as well as cities such as Amsterdam, Bologna, Lille, Lisbon, Paris Beauvais and Rome. Its schedule of just under 30 routes ceased in October 2008. On 26 March 2009 Centralwings ceased some of its operations.

Tunturi Bicycle History Tunturi's history began in 1922. The foundations of the Tunturi brand began when brothers Aarne and Eero Harkke set up a small bike shop, Pyöräkellari Oy, in Turku, Finland. The name Tunturi comes from the Finnish word for a fell. Bike repairs were the shop's main focus at first, and then gradually they added some small-scale production, manufacturing Tunturi branded bicycles. The brand was very successful and within a few years the small shop was exchanged for a factory. By the 1950s the Tunturi brand was the domestic market leader in mopeds. Utilising technology and expertise gained from bicycle production, Tunturi expanded into fitness equipment development. In the 1970s, Tunturi became recognized internationally as a producer of fitness equipment. In the 1990s, a strategic decision was made to focus on the production of Tunturi fitness products and Tunturi bicycles. This decision was important for the further development of the brand. Tunturi is now a well- known brand in Scandinavian countries and Tunturi fitness products are sold in over 40 countries worldwide.

It is one of Hitchcock's nine surviving silent films. Plot A previously undefeated fairground boxer named \\"One Round\\" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) is beaten in the ring by a mysterious challenger, who later is revealed to be Australian Heavyweight champion Bob Corby (Ian Hunter). Bob's manager is impressed with Jack's performance and offers him the chance to become Bob's full-time sparring partner, on the condition that he win a trial fight to be arranged at a later date. Bob begins spending more time with Jack's girlfriend Mabel (Lillian Hall-Davis) and buys a bracelet for her to express his feelings. The two kiss but Mabel reluctantly puts a stop to it. The next day when Jack inquires about the bracelet, Mabel lies to Jack, telling him that Bob bought it for her because he didn't want to take the money. Jack wins his trial fight and is made Bob's official sparring partner. Keeping his earlier promise to Mabel, he agrees to marry her the next day. Mabel goes through with the wedding, although somewhat reluctantly due to her new-found feelings for Bob. At the wedding reception Bob jokingly states that he wishes Mabel had been the prize at his and Jack's original fight. Jack boldly states that he would defend his wife in a fight against any man. A friendly exhibition match is arranged between the two fighters which Bob wins. After the fight Jack sees his bride flirting with Bob and suspects that they are having an affair. Jack declares his intent to fight Bob for the heavyweight championship, but is told he is not yet ranked high enough in the league to challenge Bob. Training intensively, Jack works his way up the rankings and eventually becomes the number one contender. Jack arranges a party with his friends in his apartment as a way to surprise Mabel and let her know that he has won his latest fight and will now be fighting for Bob's title. Jack and his friends wait long into the night but Mabel does not show up. After Jack's friends leave, Jack stays up and waits for Mabel and eventually she sees her getting out of Bob's car. Jack angrily confronts Mabel about her liaisons with Bob and smashes a framed picture of him. Jack then goes to the club where Bob is and confronts him. Bob throws a punch but Jack knocks him out before he connects. Jack informs Bob that he is officially the number one contender and they will settle their differences in the ring. On the day of the fight, the two fighters seem evenly matched until the final rounds where Bob starts to dominate Jack. Jack considers giving up until Mabel, seeing him in pain, runs over to his corner and declares that she wants to be with him, not Bob. Jack musters up his remaining energy and unleashes a flurry of punches in the final round, eventually knocking Bob out and winning the fight. Jack and Mabel embrace as Bob accepts defeat.

It was Hitchcock's first film for the company after joining from Gainsborough Pictures. It was also the first film to be released by the company. =Inception= Hitchcock was 28 years old when he directed The Ring, and this was the young filmmaker's fourth film. Hitchcock regularly attended boxing matches in London where he lived, and he was struck by the fact that a good number of the spectators appeared to be from good backgrounds and dressed in white. He also noticed that fighters were sprinkled with champagne at the end of each round. These details persuaded Hitchcock to start work on The Ring. =Screenplay= After directing Downhill and Easy Virtue, two stage adaptations for the Gainsborough company, Hitchcock was frustrated and jumped at the chance to develop an idea of his own. The Ring is commonly described as Hitchcock's only original screenplay although it actually had input from at least Eliot Stannard, who wrote all of Hitchcock's other silent films. Colleagues at the studio were impressed by the neatness of Hitchcock's script and his grasp of structure. What's more, writing for silent films came naturally to a director who already thought in visual terms. He was much less comfortable with dialogue, which goes some way to explain why he took no sole writing credit in any later films and worked extensively alongside other writers throughout his career. =Directing= The film, was considered a major technical work by François Truffaut in the book Hitchcock/Truffaut and by Thomas Chabrol and Eric Rohmer in their book about Hitchcock. It features use of the Schüfftan process to simulate a large audience in climactic scenes set in the Royal Albert Hall. Hitchcock returned to this technique years later in films like The Man Who Knew Too Much in its Royal Albert Hall sequence. Reception The film was a major success with critics; however, when it went on general release it was considered a box- office failure.Ryall Preservation and home video status A restoration of The Ring was completed in 2012 as part of the BFI's £2 million \\"Save the Hitchcock 9\\" project to restore all of the director's surviving silent films. Like Hitchcock's other British films, all of which are copyrighted worldwide, The Ring has been heavily bootlegged on home video. Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray and video-on-demand services from Optimum in the UK as well as Lionsgate and Kino Lorber in the U.S. References External links  The Ring at the British Film Institute's Screenonline * Alfred Hitchcock Collectors’ Guide: The Ring at Brenton Film Category:1927 films Category:English-language films Category:1920s sports drama films Category:British boxing films Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:British silent feature films Category:British sports drama films Category:Films set in England Category:1927 drama films ","title":"The Ring (1927 film)"},{"id":"1610943","text":"X-Jet or XJet may refer to: *Williams X-Jet, a single-person lightweight aircraft *X-Jet (comics), also known as Blackbird, a fictional aircraft in Marvel comic books * xjet, a YouTube channel by Bruce Simpson See also *ExpressJet, an American airline *Cross-Jet, a Rabasa Cycles model * JET-X, Joint European Telescope for X-ray astronomy ","title":"X-Jet"},{"id":"1610950","text":"Ajax (also AJAX ; short for \\"Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\\") is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML. Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and allow the user to interact with—the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest object, or since 2017 the new \\"fetch()\\" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages, allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.  History  In the early-to-mid 1990s, most Web sites were based on complete HTML pages. Each user action required that a complete new page be loaded from the server. This process was inefficient, as reflected by the user experience: all page content disappeared, then the new page appeared. Each time the browser reloaded a page because of a partial change, all of the content had to be re-sent, even though only some of the information had changed. This placed additional load on the server and made bandwidth a limiting factor on performance. In 1996, the iframe tag was introduced by Internet Explorer; like the object element, it can load or fetch content asynchronously. In 1998, the Microsoft Outlook Web Access team developed the concept behind the XMLHttpRequest scripting object. It appeared as XMLHTTP in the second version of the MSXML library, which shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0 in March 1999. The functionality of the Windows XMLHTTP ActiveX control in IE 5 was later implemented by Mozilla, Safari, Opera and other browsers as the XMLHttpRequest JavaScript object. Microsoft adopted the native XMLHttpRequest model as of Internet Explorer 7. The ActiveX version is still supported in Internet Explorer, but not in Microsoft Edge. The utility of these background HTTP requests and asynchronous Web technologies remained fairly obscure until it started appearing in large scale online applications such as Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002). Google made a wide deployment of standards- compliant, cross browser Ajax with Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005). In October 2004 Kayak.com's public beta release was among the first large-scale e-commerce uses of what their developers at that time called \\"the xml http thing\\". This increased interest in AJAX among web program developers. The term AJAX was publicly used on 18 February 2005 by Jesse James Garrett in an article titled Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications, based on techniques used on Google pages. On 5 April 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first draft specification for the XMLHttpRequest object in an attempt to create an official Web standard. The latest draft of the XMLHttpRequest object was published on 6 October 2016, and the XMLHttpRequest specification is now a living standard.  Technologies  The conventional model for a Web Application versus an application using Ajax The term Ajax has come to represent a broad group of Web technologies that can be used to implement a Web application that communicates with a server in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page. In the article that coined the term Ajax, Jesse James Garrett explained that the following technologies are incorporated: * HTML (or XHTML) and CSS for presentation * The Document Object Model (DOM) for dynamic display of and interaction with data * JSON or XML for the interchange of data, and XSLT for XML manipulation * The XMLHttpRequest object for asynchronous communication * JavaScript to bring these technologies together Since then, however, there have been a number of developments in the technologies used in an Ajax application, and in the definition of the term Ajax itself. XML is no longer required for data interchange and, therefore, XSLT is no longer required for the manipulation of data. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is often used as an alternative format for data interchange, although other formats such as preformatted HTML or plain text can also be used. A variety of popular JavaScript libraries, including JQuery, include abstractions to assist in executing Ajax requests.  Drawbacks  * Any user whose browser does not support JavaScript or XMLHttpRequest, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax. Simple devices (such as smartphones and PDAs) may not support the required technologies. The only way to let the user carry out functionality is to fall back to non-JavaScript methods. This can be achieved by making sure links and forms can be resolved properly and not relying solely on Ajax. * Similarly, some Web applications that use Ajax are built in a way that cannot be read by screen-reading technologies, such as JAWS. The WAI-ARIA standards provide a way to provide hints in such a case. * Screen readers that are able to use Ajax may still not be able to properly read the dynamically generated content. * The same-origin policy prevents some Ajax techniques from being used across domains, although the W3C has a draft of the XMLHttpRequest object that would enable this functionality. Methods exist to sidestep this security feature by using a special Cross Domain Communications channel embedded as an iframe within a page, or by the use of JSONP. * Ajax is designed for one-way communications with the server. If two way communications are needed (i.e. for the client to listen for events/changes on the server), then WebSockets may be a better option. * In pre-HTML5 browsers, pages dynamically created using successive Ajax requests did not automatically register themselves with the browser's history engine, so clicking the browser's \\"back\\" button may not have returned the browser to an earlier state of the Ajax-enabled page, but may have instead returned to the last full page visited before it. Such behavior — navigating between pages instead of navigating between page states — may be desirable, but if fine- grained tracking of page state is required, then a pre-HTML5 workaround was to use invisible iframes to trigger changes in the browser's history. A workaround implemented by Ajax techniques is to change the URL fragment identifier (the part of a URL after the \\"#\\") when an Ajax-enabled page is accessed and monitor it for changes. HTML5 provides an extensive API standard for working with the browser's history engine. * Dynamic Web page updates also make it difficult to bookmark and return to a particular state of the application. Solutions to this problem exist, many of which again use the URL fragment identifier. On the other hand, as AJAX-intensive pages tend to function as applications rather than content, bookmarking interim states rarely makes sense. Nevertheless, the solution provided by HTML5 for the above problem also applies for this. * Depending on the nature of the Ajax application, dynamic page updates may disrupt user interactions, particularly if the Internet connection is slow or unreliable. For example, editing a search field may trigger a query to the server for search completions, but the user may not know that a search completion popup is forthcoming, and if the Internet connection is slow, the popup list may show up at an inconvenient time, when the user has already proceeded to do something else. * Excluding Google, most major Web crawlers do not execute JavaScript code, so in order to be indexed by Web search engines, a Web application must provide an alternative means of accessing the content that would normally be retrieved with Ajax. It has been suggested that a headless browser may be used to index content provided by Ajax-enabled websites, although Google is no longer recommending the Ajax crawling proposal they made in 2009.  Examples  = JavaScript example = An example of a simple Ajax request using the GET method, written in JavaScript. get-ajax-data.js: // This is the client-side script. // Initialize the HTTP request. var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', 'send-ajax-data.php'); // Track the state changes of the request. xhr.onreadystatechange = function () { var DONE = 4; // readyState 4 means the request is done. var OK = 200; // status 200 is a successful return. if (xhr.readyState = DONE) { if (xhr.status = OK) { console.log(xhr.responseText); // 'This is the output.' } else { console.log('Error: ' + xhr.status); // An error occurred during the request. } } }; // Send the request to send-ajax-data.php xhr.send(null); send-ajax- data.php: Many developers dislike the syntax used in the XMLHttpRequest object, so some of the following workarounds have been created. = jQuery example = The popular JavaScript library jQuery has implemented abstractions which enable developers to use Ajax more conveniently. Although it still uses XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes, the following is a client-side implementation of the same example as above using the 'ajax' method. $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: 'send-ajax-data.php', dataType: \\"JSON\\", // data type expected from server success: function (data) { console.log(data); }, error: function(error) { console.log('Error: ' + error); } }); jQuery also implements a 'get' method which allows the same code to be written more concisely. $.get('send-ajax-data.php').done(function(data) { console.log(data); }).fail(function(data) { console.log('Error: ' + data); }); = Fetch example = Fetch is a new native JavaScript API. According to Google Developers Documentation, \\"Fetch makes it easier to make web requests and handle responses than with the older XMLHttpRequest.\\" fetch('send-ajax-data.php') .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch (error => console.log('Error:' + error)); ES7 async/await example: async function doAjax() { try { const res = await fetch('send-ajax-data.php'); const data = await res.text(); console.log(data); } catch (error) { console.log('Error:' + error); } } doAjax(); As seen above, fetch relies on JavaScript promises.

He was also credited for albums by dozens of singers in the Oromo language including the pop star Saiha Sami, and Desaligne Mersah in the Gurage language. He also arranged the popular Amharic song \\"ሕልሜን የት ልክሰሰው\\" sung by Gosaye Tesfye. Mulugeta Abate was born in Kombolcha, Wollo, Ethiopia. He was also known by another name, Roobaa Dhaabaa (Oromo name). In his latest interview with Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation/EBC3, Mulugeta explained that the name Roobaa Dhaabaa was given to him by Oromos as a reward for his wonderful contribution in the development of Oromo song industry. In Ethiopia, the vocalist receives most of the credit for the songs he or she performs, while the lyricist and melodist are often not credited, or barely mentioned, and are generally unrecognized by the public. Thus, most Ethiopians do not know the authors of songs, as in the case of Mulugeta Abate. He died in November 2016.

In some cases, the fetish is enhanced by the material of the glove (e.g., leather, cotton, latex, nitrile, PVC, satin or nylon). Often, the actions of a gloved hand are as arousing as the glove itself, because the glove provides a second skin, or in other words a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. Medical gloves and rubber gloves provide not only a safer sex environment, but also give a latex glove fetishist great pleasure. Subtle movements by the gloved fingers or the hand as a whole can provide the individual with a great visual stimulus and ultimately sexual arousal. The act of putting gloves on, or slipping them off the hands, can also be a source of glove fetish fantasy. Smell is also a factor when it comes to latex, rubber, and leather gloves. This is also often an extension of hand fetishism. Gloves are also used for fisting and sounding. It's also a big part of the superhero, leather, rubber, and cosplay scenes and is a staple accessory in any crime fetish. There is something immediately different when one is wearing gloves during sex. It almost makes one feel more naughty and kinky adding to the experience. Most glove fetishists prefer tight and shiny gloves. It is a fetish which crosses gender and sexuality stereotypes needing no anchor to one or another. It is also sometimes associated with strangle or rape fetishes. Medical glove fetishism involves thin latex gloves, which come in many different types. Personal preference ranges from color, smell, size, textured, smooth, powdered, or un-powdered. Fetishists are proud of their collection of medical gloves, as well as rubber gloves. Household rubber gloves tend to be more thick, longer, and are mostly used for cleaning purposes. There is a fetish called GOM which stands for 'Glove Over Mouth' where a gloved hand is placed firmly over ones mouth and/or nose and is sometimes associated with breath control. This can be arousing to the giver and/or the receiver. Some glove fetishists prefer certain lengths, for example the long opera-style or short cuff length. Some also like them as a part of an outfit, such as a nurse, policewoman or French maid uniform. Some who are of a sexually submissive nature are stimulated by their dominant partner's wearing and use of gloves. Dominant partners may likewise prefer that their submissives wear gloves. As with all fetishes however, there need not be a BDSM connection to an affinity for gloves. Apart from their appearance, some individuals prefer to use them on oneself or others as a form of sexual stimulation. The ones most commonly used for this are made of leather, latex , (such as those doctors or nurses use for examination) nitrile or shoulder length thick black latex. Some prefer the household rubber glove. The appeal behind the household glove may be due to the colours they come in but also offering what the latex examination gloves cannot; household gloves are thicker, some more than others depending on what their use is. Its also possible that people use these as they are commonly found in ones home so are easily available. Many enjoy erotic spanking with gloves donned. It offers a different feeling and sound to the \\"spankee\\", which can be a large part of the fetish.

There are vestiges of human settlement dating to the Roman occupation of the peninsula, as well as early naval activity in the area. The region was historically unspared from frequent pirate and military assaults along the coast, with a number of naval battles occurring off the coast. Most notably, in 1544, a squadron of ships under D. Pedro da Cunha, battled the Turkish barbary coast pirate, Xarramet. From historical records, the earliest settlement originated in the name Caboiere, an old name for a hamlet of fishermen from the Islamic-medieval period. For most of its history, fishing was the mainstay of the local economy. However, from the 1960s onward, tourism gradually became the economic base of the area, with many new hotels, apartment complexes, shops, roads, and significant improvements to infrastructures completed to attract visitors to the metropole. An insight into the effects of mass tourism on the Algarve, centred on Carvoeiro, was written by Patrick Swift, detailing the community before the arrival of mass tourism. Swift was an artist and long-time resident of Carvoeiro who founded Porches Pottery. Carvoeiro became a separate/independent parish in 1985 and raised to the status of town on 19 April 2001. Geography Algar Seco, a few hundred meters along the coast east of the main square and beach, is a popular nature site where ocean wave erosion has carved out grottoes, islets and water-spouts. It is also renowned in the vicinity for prime marine life spotting. In 2011, a blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) was sighted off the coastline by local fishermen, but more commonly, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) are seen in pods of up to 12. Architecture To the west of the town is the site of an old ruined fort, ordered built in 1670 as part of the coastal defenses of the Algarve. Only a gate survives. At the same site is the Shrine of Our Lady of the Incarnation, a chapel overlooking the sea, whose construction is said to have antedated the fort. =Civic= Lighthouse of Alfanzina (Carvoeiro). * Lighthouse of Alfanzina (), comprising a main rectangular central block, connected by hall and lateral wings (used as residences/living quarters) and central circular tower with spiral staircase, with azulejo tile covering the interior. The design is comparable to the old lighthouse of Ponta dos Capelinhos and Ribeirinha (on the island of Faial in the Azores) or the Lighthouse of Cabo Sardão. =Military= * Fort of Our Lady of the Incarnation (), little remains of the fortress, but the eastern wall, where the hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Encarnação and the older buildings of the Fiscal Guard. The fort was constructed in 1670 under the direction of Governor of Algarve, D. Nuno de Mendonça, Count of Val dos Reis, but began to serve as a fiscal outpost after 1870, before becoming a cultural attraction in the middle of the 20th century.

It refers to one or more persons performing a sex act in a public place, or in a private place which can be viewed from a public place. Such a private place may be a back yard, a barn, balcony or a bedroom with the curtains open. Public sex also includes sexual acts in semi-public places where the general public is free to enter, such as shopping malls. Public sex acts can be performed in a car (colloquially called \\"parking\\"), on a beach, in a forest, theatre, bus, aeroplane, street, toilet cubicle, or cemetery, besides other locations. According to a large study in 2008, having sex in a public place is a common fantasy and a significant number of couples or individuals have done so.Who’s Been Sleeping in Your Head? The Secret World of Sexual Fantasy (2008) by Brett Kahr, The fantasy is at times depicted in art or film. Incidence In September 2003, the BBC reported on a \\"dogging\\" craze fueled by Internet publicity. Dogging is a British English slang term for engaging in public sex, usually in a car park or country park, while others watch. Dogging has aspects of exhibitionism and voyeurism. There is some evidence on the Internet that \\"dogging\\" has begun to spread to other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Outdoor public sex purportedly takes place often in parks and beaches in Vancouver and San Francisco. According to the New York magazine, public sex occurs frequently in New York City, and is a fantasy common to many people. Perception A topless couple kisses in public, Nudes-A-Poppin', USA, 2013 Social views related to public sex and sexuality vary greatly between cultures and different times. There are many and varied laws which apply to sex in public, which use a variety of terms such as indecent exposure, public lewdness, gross indecency, and others. In some jurisdictions, an offense is committed only if the participants are seen by others, so that a sex act may occur in a closed toilet cubicle without an offense being committed. In the United Kingdom, there has been a rise in public sex venues, possibly due to a more relaxed approach to the enforcement of laws relating to public sex since the early 1990s. Legality In the United Kingdom, the legal status of public sexual acts was considered as part of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Section 71 of the Act makes it an offence to engage in sexual activity in a public lavatory. In the United Kingdom public sex comes under laws related to voyeurism, exhibitionism or public displays of sexual behaviour, but public sex law enforcement remains ambiguous. Prosecution is possible for a number of offences under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, exposure under section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, or under the common law offence of outraging public decency. The policy of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is that arrests are a last resort and a more gradual approach should be taken in such circumstances.

He currently serves as a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Weigel was the Founding President of the James Madison Foundation. He is the author of the best- selling biography of Pope John Paul II, Witness to Hope and Tranquillitas Ordinis: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace. Career and personal life Weigel was born and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended St. Mary's Seminary and University. In 1975 he received a Master of Arts degree from the University of St. Michael's College with a thesis entitled Karl Rahner's Theology of the Incarnation in Light of his Philosophy of Transcendental Anthropology. He has received 18 honorary doctorate degrees, as well as the papal cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice and the Gloria Artis Gold Medal from the Polish Ministry of Culture. Weigel lived in the Compton area, serving as Assistant Professor of Theology and Assistant Dean of Studies at the St. Thomas the Apostle Seminary School of Theology in Kenmore, Washington, and Scholar-in-Residence at the World Without War Council of Greater Seattle, before returning to Washington, DC, as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Weigel served as the founding president of the James Madison Foundation (not to be confused with the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation) from 1986 to 1989.Weigel, George.

He currently serves as Distinguished Senior Fellow and Chair of Catholic Studies at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, DC. Each summer, Weigel and several other Catholic intellectuals from the United States, Poland, and across Europe conduct the Tertio Millennio Seminar on the Free Society in Kraków, in which they and an assortment of students from the United States, Poland, and several other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe discuss Christianity within the context of liberal democracy and capitalism, with the papal encyclical Centesimus annus being the focal point.

Weigel writes and serves on the board for the Institute for Religion and Public Life, which publishes First Things, an ecumenical publication that focuses on encouraging a religiously informed public philosophy for the ordering of society. Views The main body of Weigel's writings engage the issues of religion and culture. Weigel advocates a US foreign policy guided not by utopian notions about how nations should behave, but by moral reasoning.George Weigel, American Interests, American Purpose: Moral Reasoning and U.S. Foreign Policy (Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1989).America and the World.

In some cases, he adds, moral reasoning may require that the United States support authoritarian regimes to fend off the greater evils of moral decay and threats to the security of the United States. For Weigel, America's shortcomings do not excuse her from pursuing the greater moral good. Weigel achieved much fame for writing Witness to Hope, a biography of the late Pope John Paul II, which was also made into a documentary film.Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II, HarperCollins, 1999. . In 2004 Weigel wrote an article in Commentary magazine entitled \\"The Cathedral and the Cube\\" in which he used the contrast between the modernist Grande Arche de la Défense, and the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, both located in Paris, France, to illustrate what he called a loss of \\"civilizational morale\\" in Western Europe, which he tied to the secular tyrannies of the 20th century, along with, more recently, plummeting birthrates and Europe's refusal to recognize the Christian roots of its culture. The article helped to popularize the word Christophobia,The Cathedral and the Cube: Reflections on European Morale. To understand the continent's political incapacity, it helps to look beyond politics. By George Weigel. Commentary, June 1st, 2004. a term coined by the Jewish legal scholar Joseph Weiler, in 2003. Weiler, Joseph H. Un'Europa cristiana. Un saggio esplorativo. Biblioteca Univ. Rizzoli, 2003 Weigel questions whether Europe can give an account of itself while denying the very moral tradition through which its culture arose: \\"Christians who share this conviction (that it is the will of God that Christians be tolerant of those who have a different view of God's will) – can give an account of their defense of the other's freedom even if the other, skeptical and relativist, finds it hard to give an account of the freedom of the Christian.\\" This is a theme sounded clearly by Marcello Pera and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (from 2005 to 2013 Pope Benedict XVI), in their book Without Roots: the West, Relativism, Christianity, Islam, for which Weigel authored the foreword. In 2005, he expanded the article into a book, The Cube and the Cathedral: Europe, America, and Politics Without God. On January 27, 2017, in response to rumours that Weigel would be appointed ambassador to the Holy See, Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick wrote to Pope Francis stating that Weigel was \\"very much a leader of the ultra-conservative wing of the Catholic Church in the United States and has been publicly critical of Your Holiness in the past.\\" He added, \\"Many of us American bishops would have great concerns about his being named to such a position in which he would have an official voice, in opposition to your teaching.\\" McCarrick indicated he would be happy to discuss the topic further with the Pope, but there are no indications in their correspondence whether he ever did so. Following the controversial September 2006 lecture of Pope Benedict XVI at Regensburg, Weigel defended the Pope's call for interreligious dialogue based on reason. In January 2009, Weigel expressed concern on the lifting of the excommunications of the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X, essentially because the group has been critical of some aspects of the Second Vatican Council, especially its teaching on religious liberty, which Weigel strongly defends.Voice of Catholic Radio.

Investing in a pure play company can be considered as investing in a particular commodity or product of a company. Pure play firms either specialize in a specific niche, or have little to no vertical integration. For example, a coffee shop may call itself a \\"pure play\\" restaurant, and a factory that only produces goods (not designing or selling to consumers) may refer to itself as a pure play manufactory. E-commerce companies are often referred to as pure play retailers, as they sell only through the Internet. Pure play method In finance, the \\"pure play method\\" is an approach used to estimate the cost of equity capital of private companies, which involves examining the beta coefficient of other public and single focused companies. Here, when estimating a private company A's equity beta coefficient, the equity beta coefficient of a public company B is needed; the latter can be calculated by regressing the return on B's stock on the return on the relevant stock index. The following calculation is then applied to return the beta coefficient of company A. :Unlevered Beta of B = Equity Beta of B / (1 + DEB × (1 − Tax RateB)) :Equity Beta A = Unlevered Beta of B × (1 + DEA × (1 − Tax RateA)) ::where DEA and DEB are the debt to equity ratios of company A and B respectively.

This term was discouraged by the military.  Background  General Norman Schwarzkopf was looking for a plan to incapacitate 50% of the Iraqi army before any ground invasion could begin. Planning was performed including high intensity air strikes with General Dynamics F-111, A-6 Intruder, F-15E Strike Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, AV-8 Harrier, A-10 Thunderbolt II, and F-16 Falcon crews. This culminated in December 1990, with Operation Night Camel in which air crews of the F-111 evaluated the ability of aircraft to use guided munitions with the LANTIRN and Pave Tack target designation systems from medium altitude. This is a deviation from standard military air engagement. Due to the prevalence of surface-to-air missiles, most aviators would prefer to engage a target from either a very high altitude, or a very low altitude, and certainly with low observability aircraft. However, the Iraqi defenses proved very inadequate. The winning combination for the eventual campaign was either a pair or quartet of F-111F aircraft loaded with four GBU-12 500-lb, laser-guided bombs.

Billed as \\"The How-To-Do Magazine,\\" Mechanix Illustrated (MI) aimed to guide readers through various projects from home improvements and advice on repairs to \\"build-your-own (sports car, telescope, helicopter, etc).\\" It was headquartered in New York City. History and profile From its debut in 1928, it went through a number of permutations over the years, being called at various points in its life, Modern Mechanics and Inventions, Modern Mechanix and Inventions, Modern Mechanix, Mechanix Illustrated, Home Mechanix, and, in its final incarnation, Today's Homeowner. Although it featured many how-to articles, the most eagerly awaited and read features were Tom McCahill's monthly automobile tests which ran from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. McCahill's feisty opinions were delivered in a prose laced with similes that are still quoted today among car enthusiasts: \\"As anyone brighter than a rusty spike must know...\\"; flooring the accelerator pedal on a certain car is \\"...like stepping on a wet sponge\\"; the clock/tachometer combination on another car is \\"...about as useful as feathers on a moose.\\" McCahill died in 1974, and three years later CBS bought Fawcett Publications, the company which published MI, and continued publishing the magazine, renaming it Home Mechanix starting in January 1985. In August, 1996, it was again renamed as Today's Homeowner, and ceased publication with the March/April issue in 2001, being merged into sister publication This Old House. In the 1980s, the magazine featured more and more home repair, remodel and woodworking projects while featuring fewer articles on general technology and automotive projects. A long-running feature of Mechanix Illustrated was \\"Mimi,\\" a shapely young woman dressed in skimpy overalls with blue and white vertical stripes; and, in the early sixties, a matching railroad engineer's cap (later discontinued). She was in a picture holding, standing beside, sitting on, lying on or just in the picture with a new product each month. Each \\"Mimi\\" held the job for a year. Their names were never given except for the announcement of a new \\"Mimi\\" in the January issue. One Mimi did, however, hold the job for a few years in the sixties.

Middle Village, NY: Jonathan David Publishers, 1972. p. 41. It is considered by Sol Liptzin and others to be the most important early Yiddish- language periodical (although by no means the first: the short-lived Die Kuranten in Amsterdam pre-dated it by centuries).  History  Founded by Alexander Zederbaum as a supplement to his Hebrew language weekly Hamelitz, during its last three years Kol Mevasser functioned independently.Liptzin (1972), p. 41-42. Unlike any earlier Yiddish publication, it circulated over a wide territory, with readers throughout Eastern Europe, but was based on the Southeastern (\\"Ukrainish\\") Yiddish dialect, indigenous to the region of its production (Odessa). Coverage included events both in the Jewish and gentile world, and extended to science, education, history, geography, and literature. It ran biographies of famous rabbis, reviewed Yiddish writers such as Israel Aksenfeld, Shlomo Ettinger, and A. B. Gotlober, and launched the careers of a generation of Yiddish writers. It published the first Yiddish-language fiction of Mendele Mocher Sforim, a tale called \\"Dos kleine mentshele\\" (\\"The Little Man\\"), with the first installment appearing in November 1863. Yitzhok Yoel Linetzky got his start in Kol Mevasser, and it was the first to publish Yiddish poetry by Abraham Goldfaden, who, like Mendele, had already published in Hebrew. The decade-long run and relatively professional editorial standards of Kol Mevasser helped to standardize Yiddish spelling, enrich its vocabulary, establish patterns of written usage, and generally increase the prestige of the language.Liptzin (1972), p. 42.

He is also a former Member of Parliament and mutineer, having led a mutiny of Trinidad and Tobago Regiment in 1970. Biography Shah was born the son of a sugarcane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966. As a lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970. In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency in April 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists. In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied. In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain. After 10 days, the mutineers surrendered. The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling. After being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government-recognised organisation, TICFA (Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association). Shah, George Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front (ULF) in 1975 as a labour confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition. Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party. Shah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of that organisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the Trinidad and Tobago Mirror newspaper for 17 years and went on to serve as an op-ed columnist in the Trinidad and Tobago Express newspaper. He is also known as the man who founded the prestigious annual Clico Trinidad & Tobago International Marathon, an event that spawned road-running throughout the Caribbean. He remained chairman of the organising committee until he stepped down in 2005. He served, too, as secretary of the local National Amateur Athletics Association and still holds a strong interest in sports in general and athletics in particular.

It is named after the 17th century English composer Henry Purcell and has 370 seats. The Purcell Room has hosted a wide range of chamber music, jazz, mime and poetry recitals. In the context of the Southbank Centre it is the smallest of a set of three venues, the other two being the Royal Festival Hall, a large symphony hall, and the QEH, which is used for orchestral, chamber and contemporary amplified music. The Purcell Room was built at the same time as the QEH, with which it shared a common foyer building and architectural features as an example of Brutalist architecture. The focus of the building is its interior space and it makes few concessions to external decoration. From outside, even its position within Southbank Centre is not easy to discern. The QEH and Purcell Room were designed, with The Hayward, as additions to the Southbank Centre arts complex by Hubert Bennett, head of the architects department of the Greater London Council, with Jack Whittle, F.G West and Geoffrey Horsefall. The venue was temporarily closed in September 2015, for major renovations, and re-opened in 2018.  Architecture  Purcell Room auditorium, foyer and high level bridge to The Hayward The Purcell Room stands between the QEH auditorium and The Hayward, aligned parallel to Waterloo Bridge, with the stage backing on to the side of the QEH auditorium (the north-west end). The auditorium is cantilevered out over the centre access road and its rear façade faces the entrance to The Hayward. The auditorium is reported to be fitted with a Helmholtz resonator to allow its acoustic properties to be modified. The access link from the foyer building (shared with the QEH) is through a massive sculpted concrete casing, visible from outside the entrance to The Hayward, near the overhead bridge. The artists' foyer is between the Purcell Room and QEH auditoriums at ground level. The treatment of the ventilation services is an early example of the external treatment of such equipment. This idea later reached a peak in the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and Lloyd's building in London in the 1970s and 80s respectively. The roof of the building, which is supported independently of the auditorium, holds the plant room for both the QEH and the Purcell Room. The plant room's three massive vents are housed high above the walkway near the entrance to the Hayward and also towards the Waterloo Bridge side of the north corner of the roof. Large concrete ducts lead from the plant room: vertically to the foyer building below via the mysterious concrete tower, and horizontally to the QEH auditorium.

Houghton was born in Kotagiri, Madras, India. His work was varied and was highly regarded during the mid-19th century. He traveled to America and Russia, creating illustrations for The Graphic and for numerous books, including The Arabian Nights and Don Quixote. His work was strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He played a leading role in the renaissance of wood-engraved illustration during the golden decade of English book illustration (c. 1860–75), when a new school of artists overcame the limitations of the medium. Deeply influenced by the idealism of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he imbued both his paintings and drawings with a haunting blend of poetic realism. He was the fourth son of Captain John Michael Houghton (1797–1874), who served in the East India Company's Marine as a draughtsman. Laurence Housman produced a selection from his work which was dedication to the artist's daughter Mrs E.C. Davis. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trúbner & Co., 1896).

Built in 1925, it and its namesake at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk are the only remaining wooden roller coasters on the West Coast designed by noted roller coaster designers Frank Prior and Frederick Church, and the only one whose construction they supervised. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Description The Giant Dipper is located at the northeast corner of Belmont Park, a waterfront amusement park at the junction of Mission Boulevard and West Mission Bay Drive. The coaster occupies an irregular area about in size, and is accessed via a terminal structure on its west side. It has a track length of , and its highest hills, located roughly at opposite ends of the area, reach in height. A sign with the name \\"Belmont\\" is affixed to the wooden trestle structure at its northeast edge. History The coaster was built in 1925 as part of a major real estate development led by John D. and Adolph Spreckels to attract visitors and residents to the Mission Beach area. The Mission Beach Amusement Center was built at a cost of $2.5 million and opened in 1925, with this roller coaster as one of its main attractions. It was designed by Church and Prior, coaster designers based in Venice, California, who also oversaw its construction. The Spreckelses bequeathed the attraction to the city, which in 1954 was leased to Jack Ray. He renamed the park Belmont Park, after another park in Montreal. The roller coaster was severely damaged by fire in 1955, and Ray subsequently declared bankruptcy. Threatened with demolition by the city in 1978, local citizens banded together to rescue it and a few surviving attractions of the defunct park. It underwent a full restoration in 1989–90. Events In 1997, the Giant Dipper held a coaster–riding marathon sponsored by a local radio station, Star 100.7. The marathon consisted of eleven consecutive days riding the coaster for more than 12 hours per day. The radio station arranged a second marathon in 1998, which was eventually won by contestants who split a check for $50,000 in cash prize after riding the coaster for 70 days.

Dick. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future dystopia constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance in the midst of a drug addiction epidemic. The film was shot digitally and then animated using interpolated rotoscope, an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. The film features performances by Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder. Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney are among the executive producers. A Scanner Darkly had a limited release on July 7, 2006, and then a wider release later that month. The film was screened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival, and was a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. Plot The United States has lost the war on drugs. Substance D, a powerful drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate up the supply chain. Arctor has a vision of being in his house with a wife and two children in Anaheim, California; today he has two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend time taking D and having complex, possibly paranoiac examinations of their experiences. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and voice; he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other. Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D, and buys from Donna, who Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of D from so that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier. They have a tense, at times caring romantic relationship, but she rebuffs his physical advances. At work, Hank orders \\"Fred\\" to increase surveillance on Arctor himself and his associates. Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts spend time. Arctor is inexpertly negotiating a double life, and his prolonged use of D is damaging his brain. Barris is informing on Arctor to Hank, arguing that Arctor is a terrorist, and angling to be hired as a cop himself. However, Barris unknowingly conveys this information in the presence of Arctor himself, whose identity at the time is hidden behind his scramble suit. Hank reveals to \\"Fred\\" that he has long known that he is Arctor. Arctor seems legitimately surprised, and repeats his own name in a disoriented, unfamiliar tone. Hank informs him that the real purpose of the surveillance was to catch Barris, and that the police were deliberately increasing Barris's paranoia until he attempted to cover his tracks. Hank reprimands Arctor for becoming addicted to Substance D, and warns him that he will be disciplined. Hank explains how seriously brain damaged Arctor has become from D, and Hank \\"phones\\" Donna, asking her to come pick up Arctor and take him to New-Path, a corporation that runs a series of rehabilitation clinics. Hank immediately leaves, and in private removes his scramble suit, revealing Donna. At the New-Path clinic, Arctor and other D addicts show serious cognitive deficiencies. \\"Donna\\", now known as Audrey, meets with Mike, a fellow police officer. They discuss how New-Path is secretly responsible for the manufacture and distribution of Substance D. Audrey expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately recruited Arctor — without his knowledge — to become addicted to D; his health sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict, and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's D farms. Audrey and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough to grasp the situation. New-Path sends Arctor to a labor camp at an isolated farm, where he mindlessly repeats what others tells him. Tending to corn crops, Arctor discovers hidden rows of the blue flowers that produce D. He secretly hides one flower in his boot, to bring to his friends at his next holiday from the farm.

Dick novel Ubik but stopped early on because he was unable to obtain the rights and he \\"couldn't quite crack it\\". He began thinking about A Scanner Darkly, another dark novel while talking to producer Tommy Pallotta during the making of Waking Life. Linklater liked A Scanner Darkly more than Ubik and felt that he could make a film out of it. According to Linklater, the challenge was to capture \\"the humor and exuberance of the book but not let go of the sad and tragic\\". Linklater was not interested in turning the book into a big-budget action thriller as had been done in the past because he felt that A Scanner Darkly was \\"about these guys and what they're all doing in their alternative world and what's going through their minds is really what keeps the story moving\\". He wanted to keep the budget under $10 million so that he could have more creative control, remain faithful to the book, and make it an animated film. After completing School of Rock, Linklater told Pallotta that he wanted to make A Scanner Darkly next. It was important to him that Dick's estate approve his film. Pallotta wrote a personal appeal and pitched a faithful adaptation of the novel to Russ Galen, the Philip K. Dick estate's literary agent who shared it with the late author's two daughters (Laura Leslie and Isa Hackett) who own and operate their father's trust. Dick's daughters were not too keen on \\"a cartoon version\\" of A Scanner Darkly. After high-profile adaptations, Minority Report and Paycheck, they took a more proactive role in evaluating every film proposal, including unusual projects like Linklater's. They read Linklater's screenplay and then met with him to discuss their respective visions of A Scanner Darkly. They felt that it was one of their father's most personal stories and liked that Linklater was not going to treat the drug aspects lightly, that he wanted to set it in the near future and make it right away. =Casting= For the dual roles of Arctor and Fred, Linklater thought of Keanu Reeves, but figured that the actor would have been reluctant to a make another science fiction film after making The Matrix trilogy. Robert Downey Jr. was attracted to the film when he heard Reeves was going to star and Linklater to direct. He thought that the script was the strangest one he had ever read. Linklater wrote the role of Freck with Rory Cochrane in mind. The actor was interested but did not want to recreate his role in Dazed and Confused. Both Woody Harrelson and Winona Ryder agreed to appear in the film based on the script. Reeves and Ryder agreed to work for the Screen Actors Guild scale rate plus any back-end profits. As with Linklater's earlier Waking Life, controversial conspiracy theorist and broadcaster Alex Jones has a small cameo as himself. =Principal photography= Linklater assembled the cast for two weeks of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes before he got on the elevator to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page. Principal photography began on 17 May 2004 and lasted six weeks. Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants had left a month prior to filming and left the place in such a state that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so that it looked like a run-down home. The filmmakers had looked at 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in Anaheim, California and then composited them into the Austin footage in post- production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern. However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they would show up to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot. Extensive on-set footage of the filming of A Scanner Darkly was featured in a UK documentary about Richard Linklater directed by Irshad Ashraf and broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004. =Animation= After principal photography was finished, the film was transferred to QuickTime for an 18-month animation process: second order magnified contrast separation. A Scanner Darkly was filmed digitally using the Panasonic AG-DVX100 and then animated with Rotoshop, a proprietary graphics editing program created by Bob Sabiston. Rotoshop uses an animation technique called interpolated rotoscope, which was previously used in Linklater's film Waking Life. Linklater discussed the ideas and inspiration behind his use of rotoscoping in Ashraf's documentary, linking it to his personal experiences of lucid dreaming. Rotoscoping in traditional cel animation originally involved tracing over film frame-by-frame. This is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of filmmaker Ralph Bakshi. Rotoshop animation makes use of vector keyframes and interpolates the in- between frames automatically. The animation phase was a trying process for Linklater who said, \\"I know how to make a movie, but I don't really know how to handle the animation.\\" He had gone the animation route because he felt that there was very little animation targeted for adults. =Post-production problems= Originally, the film was supposed to be released in September 2005. Most of the animators were hired locally with only a few of them having movie-making experience. Six weeks into the animation process, only a few animated sequences were close to being completed while Linklater was off making Bad News Bears. Sabiston had divided the animators into five teams and split the work amongst them. However, there was poor communication between the teams, and the uniform animation style that Linklater wanted was not being implemented. After almost two months some animators were still learning the software, and Linklater became frustrated with the lack of progress. Animation and training for the 30 new artists had begun 28 October 2004. In late November, Mark Gill, head of Warner Independent Pictures, asked for a status report. There were no finished sequences, as the majority of animators were still learning to implement the film's highly detailed style. Under pressure, some animators worked 18-hour days for two weeks in order to produce a trailer, which seemed to appease Gill and Linklater. Sabiston and his team were falling behind on the studio's 6-month animation schedule and asked that the schedule be extended to a year and that the 2 million dollar animation budget be enlarged accordingly. This created tension, and in January 2005, while Sabiston and his four-person core team were strategizing at a local cafe, Pallotta changed the locks and seized their workstations, replacing them with two local artists, Jason Archer and Paul Beck. Sabiston's four team leaders Patrick Thornton, Randy Cole, Katy O'Connor, and Jennifer Drummond subsequently received the credit \\"additional animation\\" in the film, despite having worked six months designing the general look of the animation and the scramble suit, hiring and training animators, and 3D compositing. The studio increased the budget from $6.7 to $8.7 million and gave Linklater six months to finish the film. Pallotta took charge and instituted a more traditional Disney-esque production ethic that included a style manual, strict deadlines, and breaking the film up into smaller segments. The animation process lasted 15 months. Linklater said, in regard to the post-production problems, \\"There's a lot of misinformation out there... Changes took place during the early stages of us really getting going on this had everything to do with management and not art. It was a budgetary concern, essentially.\\" A test screening in December 2005 went reasonably well. A revised release date was set for 31 March 2006, but Gill felt that there would not be enough time to mount a proper promotional campaign and the date was changed to 7 July, putting the film up against Pixar's Cars and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. =Music= The score (more than an hour's worth is in the film) was provided by Austin, Texas-based composer Graham Reynolds. Linklater approached Reynolds in 2003 after a club performance and suggested Reynolds create the score for A Scanner Darkly. Linklater and Reynolds had worked previously on Live from Shiva's Dance Floor, a 20-minute short featuring Timothy \\"Speed\\" Levitch. The composition and recording process took over one and a half years (the unusual time allotment was due to the film's time-consuming animation process) and was done in Reynolds' east Austin home, in his bedroom. It is not a synthesized score; all the instruments except electric guitar and bass were acoustic, though many were transformed through effects. The film also includes clips of four Radiohead songs—\\"Fog\\", \\"Skttrbrain (Four Tet Mix)\\", \\"The Amazing Sounds of Orgy\\", \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" (although it appears uncredited—and one Thom Yorke solo song, \\"Black Swan\\". An early test screening featured an all- Radiohead soundtrack. =Soundtrack= The album is available from Lakeshore Records and includes the score by Graham Reynolds featuring the Golden Arm Trio. Additionally, the CD includes exclusive remixes of Graham's music by DJ Spooky and Jack Dangers (Meat Beat Manifesto). After finishing the film, Reynolds set to work on remixing the surround sound music into stereo. He then selected 44 minutes out of the film score in order to craft a listening CD while attempting to retain some feel of the arc of the film. Some of the shorter cues were assembled into longer CD tracks. The soundtrack to A Scanner Darkly was released on 27 June 2006. Reception  = Box office = A Scanner Darkly opened in 17 theaters and grossed $391,672 for a per-theater average of $23,039. The film saw some expansion in later weeks, but ultimately was about $1 million short of earning back its $8.7 million production budget. It grossed $5.5 million in North America and $2.1 million elsewhere. =Critical response = A Scanner Darkly was met with generally positive reviews. 68% of 186 reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The critics' consensus on the website reads, \\"A faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's novel, A Scanner Darkly takes the viewer on a visual and mind-blowing journey into the author's conception of a drug-addled and politically unstable world.\\" Its weighted score on Metacritic is 73 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has a kind of hypnotic visual appeal\\". Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times found the film \\"engrossing\\" and wrote that \\"the brilliance of [the film] is how it suggests, without bombast or fanfare, the ways in which the real world has come to resemble the dark world of comic books\\". In his review for The Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, \\"What's extraordinary about Linklater's animation, computer-rotoscoped in the fashion of his 2001 Waking Life, is just how tangible the Dickian labyrinth becomes\\", and praised Robert Downey Jr.'s performance: \\"Midway through 2006, this supporting turn is the performance to beat in what seems the year's American movie to beat\\". Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, \\"Mr. Linklater emerges once again as the Austin auteur par excellence\\". Empire magazine's Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, \\"its intelligence makes it near-essential viewing\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Thompson wrote, \\"Linklater's rotoscoping process underscores this grave new world with pop- arty creepiness. Its dramatically muting effect, which shaves the highs off the more histrionic performances yet doesn't undercut the more subtle elements ... squeezes everything into a unified nightmare\\". Amy Biancolli from the Houston Chronicle heralded the movie as \\"[t]he first film to capture the author's transience and his art.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C−\\" rating, and Owen Gleiberman was unimpressed, writing that the film is \\"more fun to think about than [it] is to experience\\", and found the film's storyline \\"goes nowhere\\". In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, \\"The movie is often startling and engrossing, but the question of what the heck is going on, and why, is never entirely absent from your mind\\". Jack Mathews, in his review for The New York Daily News, called it \\"a murky, dialogue-heavy tale of intrigue\\". Roger Moore from the Orlando Sentinel states: \\"Linklater's willingness to experiment ... is laudable. But I'm not sure he's reinventing animation here, or even adequately serving that older-than-children animation audience.\\" Tom Long from the Detroit News praised one aspect of the film, saying \\"[h]ere's a guy willing to take risks, willing to tackle challenging material, willing to assume his audience has a brain.\\" At the same time, Long notes that \\"[u]nfortunately, his audience's collective brain is going to be hurting mightily for the first hour of this film\\". Michael Booth from the Denver Post states that \\"[t]he artiness gets in the way of thrilling plot twists; we're still trying to sort out images when we should be sorting out facts.\\" Chris Vognar from the Dallas Morning News stated that \\"[m]uch like someone who doesn't realize how high he is, A Scanner Darkly talks too much and doesn't say enough\\". =Home media = The DVD was released in North America on 19 December 2006 and in the UK on 22 January 2007; Blu ray versions were released on 10 April 2007 and 10 May 2010.

He first appeared as an enemy for the Human Torch. Publication history The Wizard's first appearance was in Strange Tales #102 and was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Bentley Wittman grew up possessing near-superhuman levels of genius and was a child prodigy and chess champion. As an adult, he became an inventor of great renown, selling his futuristic inventions to the wealthy and becoming quite rich. He became known as the Wizard by legally assuming this stage name and using his advanced scientific inventions to perform feats of \\"magic\\" as a stage magician and escape artist. Intellectually bored, however, he decided to become a professional criminal and defeat Johnny Storm, who had just appeared to the world as the Human Torch. Pretending to be a victim by pretending his attempt to use a new drill had gone wrong and he was trapped, he really had enough air for weeks, he was rescued by the Torch and invited him to his high-tech, futuristic mansion on Long Island. There he captured the Torch with ease by pretending to take a three-dimensional photo, but really squirting a liquid onto the Torch. The Torch was then locked in an asbestos cell at gunpoint. The Wizard impersonated the Torch, launching a crime spree to destroy the Torch's reputation. However, the Torch escaped and with help from the Invisible Girl, got photos showing the Wizard had impersonated him and the Wizard was sent to prison.Strange Tales #102 The Wizard had a rematch with the Human Torch before long, escaping from prison using a chemical which melted through stone. He got to his house and used a force field to prevent the police from entering, but allowed the Torch to enter, threatening to blast the police if they tried to get in. The Torch melted a shell the Wizard fired, then created a flaming barrier to protect himself from nerve gas. However the Wizard succeeded in using the Invisible Girl as a hostage, as she had foolishly entered and the Wizard was alerted by an alarm. He trapped both her and the Torch in a chamber with a bomb that would activate if the temperature increased by one degree. However the Torch was able to destroy the device, escape, and capture the Wizard.Strange Tales #105 With Paste-Pot Pete, he battled the Torch again, again impersonating him,Strange Tales Vol. 1 #110 and the Wizard captured the Torch and the Invisible Girl after escaping by disguising himself and using an anti-gravity device. However the two escaped when the Torch used his flame to alert Mister Fantastic and the Thing to their location.Strange Tales #118 The conclusion of one encounter with the Torch sent him flying uncontrollably upward by one of his anti-gravity discs, unable to descend safely. He was rescued by two other adversaries of the Torch: the Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete (soon after renamed the Trapster). After he suggested they team up, a suggestion by the Trapster inspired him to form a team that would be a criminal counterpart to the Fantastic Four, with himself, his two rescuers, and Medusa, who was then suffering from amnesia; becoming the Frightful Four.Fantastic Four #36 The Frightful Four proved to be one of the most formidable menaces that the Fantastic Four had yet encountered. The Frightful Four raided the Fantastic Four's Baxter Building headquarters, and affixed the Wizard's anti-gravity discs to the four - minus Johnny, but with Alicia Masters, who managed to alert the Torch with the Invisible Girl's flare gun. Johnny soon appeared and forced the Wizard to use his anti-grav ship to free his team members before they floated into airless space. Then, together they beat the Frightful Four until the Wizard and the Sandman exploded the Wizard's ship as a distraction, and escaped. Later, kidnapping the Invisible Girl, they lured the Fantastic Four to a Pacific atoll where they rigged an experimental \\"Q-bomb\\" to detonate. The Fantastic Four narrowly escaped.Fantastic Four #38 Weeks later, the Frightful Four made their third attempt. Capturing the Thing, the Wizard used his \\"id machine\\" to simulate the Thing's natural tendencies toward violence and brainwash him into obeying the Wizard's commands. The Fantastic Four finally managed to subdue the Frightful Four, then all but Medusa were turned over to the authorities.Fantastic Four #41-43 In his continued quest to crush the Fantastic Four, the Wizard has tried many iterations of the Frightful Four and has very rarely operated outside the Frightful Four. The Wizard engineered the Sandman's escape from prison, and provided him with a design for a new costume.Fantastic Four #57 With the Trapster and Sandman, he battled Medusa.Marvel Super-Heroes Vol. 1 #15 He formed a partnership with Mysterio, and they battled the Torch and Spider-Man, but were foiled by Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man Annual #4 He battled the Fantastic Four alone,Fantastic Four #78 and later battled them once again with the Frightful Four.Fantastic Four #94 With the Trapster and Sandman, he invaded the Fantastic Four headquarters, where they encountered Annihilus.Marvel Team-Up #2 The Wizard replaced Medusa with Thundra in the Frightful Four, and they battled the Fantastic Four and Medusa.Fantastic Four #129-130 However, Thundra also ended up betraying him and allying herself with the Fantastic Four as Medusa did.Fantastic Four #133 With the Trapster and Sandman, the Wizard battled the Fantastic Four again.Fantastic Four #148 The Wizard, Trapster, and Sandman eventually captured the Fantastic Four. The Frightful Four held auditions for a fourth member of the Frightful Four. Texas Twister showed off his powers and declined membership when they wouldn't pay him. Captain Ultra showed off his powers, but fainted when one of the Frightful Four members lit a cigarette. Osprey auditioned where he wanted them to give him superpowers. Wizard placed one of his anti-gravity disks on Osprey's back which caused him to take off. Wizard stated to the captive Fantastic Four that the anti-gravity disk would set Osprey down somewhere in the southern parts of Bronx. Wizard then spoke on the intercom stating that anyone who doesn't have powers doesn't need to audition....or else. The Frightful Four eventually recruited the Brute (Reed Richards of the original Counter-Earth) into the Frightful Four where they fought the Fantastic Four and Tigra.Fantastic Four #176-178 With the Frightful Four, the Wizard later captured Spider-Man and Namor.Spectacular Spider-Man #42; Fantastic Four #218 The Wizard later teamed up with the Plantman, helping him to escape prison and providing him a vehicle and equipment,Avengers #231-232 but then ran into a conflict with the Avengers.Avengers #235 With the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master, the Wizard attempted to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia Masters (Lyja in disguise).Fantastic Four #300 The Wizard also captured the Thing and Franklin Richards in an attempt to use them against the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #301 When the Sandman appeared to give up his life of crime, the Wizard formed a new Frightful Four with Hydro-Man, Klaw, and Titania. They invaded Fantastic Four headquarters, but sided with the real Fantastic Four against the Fantastic Four clones created by Aron the Watcher.Fantastic Four #326-333 The Wizard later engineered a mass breakout from the Vault.Avengers Spotlight #26 He was later broken out of prison by Loki to join the inner circle of villains organizing the Acts of Vengeance against the Avengers.Spectacular Spider-Man #158; Amazing Spider-Man #327; Avengers #312 He freed the Brothers Grimm from prison, and sent them against Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man #159 With the Mandarin, he then battled the Avengers.Avengers #313 However, he then inadvertently led the Avengers to the criminals' base.Avengers West Coast #55 The Wizard eventually escaped Ryker's Island Prison.Amazing Spider-Man Annual #24 With the Trapster, he was also defeated by the reformed Sandman.Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #10 Often avoiding the limelight that he once embraced, the Wizard hoped to hide from authorities using his former name Bentley Wittman. He was found by the Thunderbolts, however, who convinced the Wizard to provide anti-gravity discs in order for them to battle Graviton, and later, to attach to the Magneto Protocol Satellites. Later still, when the Sandman had appeared to reform his criminal ways, the Wizard took it upon himself to subject his former ally to his id machine, re-integrating the Sandman's mind and restoring him to villainy. Finally, when the Fantastic Four's popularity reached an all-time low, the Wizard decided it was time to re-form the Frightful Four once more. No longer motivated by petty jealousy, the Wizard believed the Fantastic Four to be the source of all his troubles, his fall from grace. He rescued the Trapster from the Negative Zone, boosted the powers of Hydro-Man, and called upon his ex-wife, Salamandra, to round out the Frightful Four.Fantastic Four #514 He also manipulated Cole, his and Salamandra's daughter, to develop a relationship with the Human Torch in order to teleport to her and bypass the Fantastic Four's defenses. During the resulting battle, the Wizard turned on the Trapster, revealing that he intended Cole to be the next member of the Frightful Four. When the Frightful Four defeated the heroes, the Wizard flaunted his success on television and left them humiliated.Fantastic Four #515 However, when the Wizard admitted that he only wanted to include Cole once he saw her exhibit superhuman powers, she turned on him. She sought out the Fantastic Four to lead them back to her father and to try to find a cure for her powers. The Wizard and Cole confronted each other, and Cole used one of the Trapster's traps to ensnare her father, then used her powers over gravity to bring the Wizard's lair down around him.Fantastic Four #516 Wizard plays a small role in the \\"Secret War\\" crossover event allied with Lucia von Bardas and other B-List supervillains. He has since returned, alive and well, in Fantastic Four #546, with a Frightful Five (himself, Titania, Trapster, Hydro-Man, and Klaw). The Wizard is among the characters recruited in The Hood's syndicate of villains.New Avengers #33 He is then seen in a blue uniform reminiscent of his original outfit. Wizard helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange. During the Secret Invasion storyline, Wizard is one among many of supervillains who rejoined The Hood's crime syndicate and attacked a Skrull force.Secret Invasion #6 During the Dark Reign storyline, Wizard joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 Wizard later appeared as a member of the Intelligencia.Fall of the Hulks: AlphaFall of the Hulks: Gamma Along with a new Frightful Four, the Wizard attacks the Baxter Building to capture Reed Richards. While the Red Hulk, who came to stop the villains, is distracted by the Thing and an open portal to the Negative Zone, Reed is captured.Hulk Vol. 2 #19 Lyra and She-Hulk went around hunting for the remaining members of Intelligencia. Wizard was the first to be apprehended by Lyra and She-Hulk, brought to Bruce Banner, and imprisoned.She- Hulks #2 Wizard managed to escape from Bruce Banner's detention cell and attacked Lyra during her prom. His surprise attack had Lyra on the defensive until She-Hulk arrived and defeated Wizard with his own weapons.She-Hulks #4 He is committed to the P.A.V.L.O.V. Metahuman Psychiatric Facility, following the events of World War Hulks. Reed Richards visits the Wizard there, and informs him that Whitman's clone is in the care of Richards' family.Fantastic Four #579 Later after the death of the Human Torch and the reformation of the Fantastic Four as the Future Foundation, rogue agents of A.I.M break the Wizard out of the P.A.V.L.O.V. facility.FF #1 When the Sinister Six attacked the Intelligencia, Wizard tried to reason with Sandman due to their old friendship, but this ended when Doctor Octopus used the Zero Cannon that the Intelligencia were using to send Wizard into the upper atmosphere.Amazing Spider-Man #676 MODOK Superior was able to revive Wizard and the other Intelligencia members where they began to formulate their plans after their predicted shatter of the superhero community.Deadpool Vol. 2 #55 Wizard's mind began to shows signs of dementia, due to punishment inflicted by Black Bolt,FF Vol 2 6 so he decided to create a new Frightful Four with Klaw, Karl Malus, and Carnage. He attempted to control Kletus Kassidy's mind, but due to his lobotmization, it was impossible. Wizard instead transferred Kassidy's blood into Malus and made him into Superior Carnage.Superior Carnage Vol 1 #3 Wizard's goal was to take over NYC City Hall and impress his son, but Superior Spider-Man was able to stop him. Despite losing the battle, Wizard was able to reconnect with his son and regain his mental facilities.Superior Carnage Vol 1 #5 The Wizard subsequently joined the plans of the behind-the-scenes villain known as 'the Quiet Man' to destroy the Fantastic Four, but after his clone rejected him in favour of his friends, followed by him witnessing the scale of the Quiet Man's plans, the Wizard decided to aid the FF against the villain so that he could ensure that his 'son' would grow up in peace.Fantastic Four #642-645 Wizard then appears talking to MODOK Superior when he hears that Doctor Doom has gone straight, only to confront him. During the battle, he manages to outsmart him with his upgraded tech until Doctor Doom in his version of the Iron Man armor becomes distracted by a vision, giving him the chance to defeat him.

He has since been taken in by the Fantastic Four and only refers to himself as 23 feeling he \\"hasn't earned his name\\" as the original Wizard did.Fantastic Four #570 At first, he was a highly introverted child, who over time becomes far more outgoing, also becoming more openly proclaiming of wanting to grow up to become a supervillain. He has since joined the Future Foundation.Fantastic Four #580 While working with them, he has indicated he's at least somewhat evil openly worshiping either Satan or Mephisto. He has since said to Wizard that he has earned the name \\"Bentley\\".FF #3 However, when faced with the chance of working with his father to trap the rest of the Future Foundation and analyze Franklin's powers, Bentley turned against his 'father' because he decided that he wanted to do the right thing, with Wizard accepting his decision as he regards it as an example of how he might have been if he grew up with a more loving family. Powers and abilities Wittman has no true superpowers, but is a scientific genius with Ph.Ds in several sciences, particularly in the fields of applied physics and sub-atomic particles. In addition to being a scientist and engineer, Wittman is also a talented stage magician, escape artist, and master of disguise. =Equipment= He has constructed a number of devices which he employs in his criminal activities: * His anti-gravity discs can lift several hundred pounds each, and can be remotely controlled via relays in his armor. These give him the ability to fly, which is, contrary to popular belief, accomplished without wings. He was able to create a basic one using prison workshop materials. * His gauntlets (alternatively referred to as Power Gloves or Wonder Gloves) can unleash potent electrical blasts or use directed gravitational fields to increase his strength. The strength he can gain from his Wonder Gloves is unknown. When he constructed one for Imus Champion in an appropriate size, the villain was able to hurt both Thor and Hyperion in battle. * His body armor provides him with protection from assault, and devices in his helmet allow him to control the minds of others. Other characters named Wizard There are other characters who have also called themselves Wizard: All Winners Comics #17, which was published in 1945, 17 years before the first appearance of the Fantastic Four villain of the same name, depicts a legend about the eldest member of the Carreaux family, who jilted the daughter of a magic practitioner in favor of marrying a different girl. When the jilted girl committed suicide, her brother killed that Carreaux man, creating a curse which held that if an elder Carreaux were to marry, a dead wizard and his witch partner would appear on their wedding night and kill that Carreaux. By 1946, the Carreaux family butler Frank Lavalle took advantage of that legend when he heard that Philip Carreaux was going to marry a woman named Marguerite, with whom Frank was also in love. While he would pose as the Wizard, an unnamed female accomplice would pose as the Witch. When his brother Dale returned home from military service, Philip met William Nalsted and Fred Davis where he told them about the curse involving the Wizard and the Witch. William Nalsted and Fred Davis changed into their Captain America and Bucky outfit where they explored the bayou finding any evidence of the Wizard and the Witch. Captain America and Bucky encountered the Wizard who disappeared from Captain America's grasp. Upon finding Philip dead with a knife in his back, Captain America and Bucky encountered the Wizard in another canoe, though he had to let him go to save Bucky from an approaching alligator. When Captain America and Bucky catch up to the Witch and subdue her, she was shot dead as Dale freed Marguerite. Upon examining the Wizard's footprints, Captain America discovered that it matched Frank Lavalle's shoes as Captain America apprehends him. After Frank Lavalle confessed to his motives and the murders, Captain America handed Frank over to the authorities.All Winners Comics #17. Marvel Comics.

He could grow to enormous size, and his breath caused storms and turned men to stone. He wore a hornless bull-hide and a bird mask, and flew in a machine called the roth rámach, the \\"oared wheel\\". He had an ox-driven chariot in which night was as bright as day, a star-speckled black shield with a silver rim, and a stone which could turn into a poisonous eel when thrown in water. Stories about Mug Ruith are set in various periods of Irish history. Some say he lived during the reign of 3rd century High King Cormac mac Airt, while others put him in Jerusalem during the time of Christ. In Lebor Gabála Érenn he is said to have died in the reign of Conmael, nearly two thousand years before Cormac's time. Perhaps due to this array of times and settings, poets attributed the druid with extraordinary longevity (he lived through the reign of nineteen kings according to one story). His powers and long lifespan have led some to conclude he was a euhemerised sun or storm god. The various medieval legends about his adventures in the Holy Land at the dawn of Christendom paint him as an interesting and mysterious character. He is said to have been a student of Simon Magus, who taught him his magic skills and helped him build the flying machine roth rámach. Roth rámach is described in various texts as being a rowan chariot driven by two oxen with poles of electrum, sides of glass and equally bright by day and by night. It also blinded those who looked at it, deafens whoever hears it, and kills whoever it strikes. The Myths of the Gods: Structures in Irish Mythology by Alan Ward, 1981. This description leads scholar Alan Ward to draw parallels with solar imagery and the figure Dian Cécht. In at least two other poems Mug Ruith is identified as the executioner who beheaded John the Baptist, bringing a curse to the Irish people. He cuts an equally impressive figure in The Siege of Knocklong, set in Cormac mac Airt's time. Here he defeats Cormac's druids in an elaborate magical battle in exchange for land from King Fiachu Muillethan of southern Munster, from whom Cormac had been trying to levy taxes. Mug Ruith's daughter was Tlachtga, a powerful druidess, who gave her name to a hill in County Meath and a festival celebrated there. Tlachtga, who was raped by Simon Magus while her father was learning magic, gave birth to three sons Dorb, Cuma, and Muach. The territory Mug Ruith received for his descendants was Fir Maige Féne, later known as Fermoy. The medieval tribe of Fir Maige Féne claimed descent from him, although they were ruled by the unrelated O'Keefes of Eóganacht Glendamnach.

The lion is the national animal of the UK and indicates the BBC's British identity. *Thunderbolt — The lion grasps a thunderbolt in its outstretched paw, this to represent broadcasting itself (transmission). *Eagles — In heraldic language the two eagles which grasp the shield are \\"supporters\\". Eagles were chosen to depict the inherent speed of broadcasting. Both eagles have bugles suspended from their collars, representing \\"proclamation\\", i.e. the public service element of broadcasting. *Motto — The coat of arms features the BBC motto, \\"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\\" *Shield **Globe — the globe in the shield of the coat of arms represents the scope and breadth of the BBC's operations **Estoiles — Around the globe are seven estoiles, heraldic symbols for divine goodness and nobility. Their place in the shield increase the representation of the scope and breadth of the corporation. They also symbolise the seven planets in the Solar System other than the Earth. (The arms were granted prior to the discovery of Pluto in 1930, which was classified as a planet from that time until 2006.) The background of the shield, the mantling (drapery depicted tied to the helmet above the shield) and the collars of the eagles are blue (azure in heraldry). The style of the coat of arms has changed considerably over time; from the style of the motto, the formality of the lion and eagles, the alignment of the shield (it was tilted in early versions, and is now perfectly straight) and the addition of a compartment (the design placed under the shield, a grassy mound in the BBC coat of arms). Motto The idealistic BBC motto is most likely based on biblical verses from the Book of Micah and the Book of Isaiah: \\"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. In 1934 the motto was changed to \\"Quaecunque\\", meaning \\"Whatsoever\\". This was inspired by St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:8: This inspired the dedication that appears in the entrance hall of Broadcasting House: In 1948 the motto reverted to the original. Usage Prior to 1986, the logo was used on a few sources, mainly BBC documentation and stationery, such as the BBC Handbook, or for some uses around some of the studios. In those occurrences, the coat of arms would not be used directly, but used subtly on other furniture, such as the bollards outside New Broadcasting House, Manchester. Following the redesign in 1986, the coat of arms was used much more frequently alongside the main logo. Some examples include: *In the BBC's \\"virtual\\" news set, used between 1993 and 1999, much of what was seen was computer generated using Silicon Graphics systems. The titles opened to the BBC News logo overlaid on the spinning globe. The shot widened to include the whole coat of arms and finally the whole set (of which only the newsreaders and parts of the desk were real). The coat of arms, studio lights, floor and the majority of the desk were all computer generated.Hayden Walker, BBC Corporate Logo , Retrieved 20 November 2010 *The generic BBC News titles prior to 1993 used a transmitter as its icon, similar to that used on the coat of arms. *The coat of arms featured on flags from BBC studios, and on signage for the studios themselves.Ieuan Rees Architectural work Gallery – Features image of BBC Cymru Wales studio signage from prior to BBC blocks. *The BBC outtakes programme Auntie's Bloomers featured a set of large shelves with tape records, dusty corners and industrial lift shafts, meant to represent the BBC Archives.

On July 5, 2016, SAP and Appeon entered into an agreement whereby Appeon would be responsible for developing, selling, and supporting PowerBuilder. Over the years, PowerBuilder has been updated with new standards. In 2010, a major upgrade of PowerBuilder was released to provide support for the Microsoft .NET Framework. In 2014, support was added for OData, dockable windows, and 64-bit native applications. In 2017, support was added for iOS and Android app development. PowerBuilder 2019 provides new targets to enable developers to rapidly create RESTful Web APIs and non-visual .NET assemblies, in a test-driven manner, using the C# language and the .NET Core framework. And PowerScript client app development was revamped with new UI technologies and cloud architecture. Features PowerBuilder has a native data-handling object called a DataWindow, which can be used to create, edit, and display data from the database. This object gives the programmer a number of tools for specifying and controlling user interface appearance and behavior, and also provides simplified access to database content and JSON or XML from Web services. To some extent, the DataWindow frees the programmer from considering the differences between Database Management Systems from different vendors. DataWindow can display data using multiple presentation styles and can connect to various data sources. Usage PowerBuilder is used primarily for building business CRUD applications. Although new software products are rarely built with PowerBuilder, many client-server ERP products and line-of-business applications built in the late 1980s to early 2000s with PowerBuilder still provide core database functions for large enterprises in government, higher education,, manufacturing, insurance, banking, energy, and telecommunications. Job openings for PowerBuilder developers are readily available but often revolve around maintaining existing applications. History In December 2013 SAP announced the new version going directly to number 15 and released a beta version. Key features included support for the .NET Framework v4.5, SQL Server 2012, Oracle 12, Windows 8, OData and Dockable Windows. SAP later released this as version 12.6. On May 31, 2019 PowerBuilder 2019 was launched by Appeon. This release supports C# development. It provides a new C# IDE, .NET data access objects, C# migration solution, Web API client, and UI themes. On April 3, 2020 PowerBuilder 2019 R2 was launched by Appeon. This release include a first-ever PowerScript-to-C# code converter, which can automatically migrate 80-95% of PowerBuilder business logic and DataWindows to C#. Interoperability between PowerScript and .NET programming languages is also now supported. Many existing features have also been enhanced. Features PowerBuilder is an object-oriented programming language. Nearly all of the visual and non-visual objects support inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The programmer may utilize a common code framework such as PowerBuilder Foundation Classes, also known as PFC, to inherit objects from and leverage pre-existing code.http://www.ecocion.com/about- us/publications/it-development/sybase-powerbuilder/powerbuilder-foundation- class-help The DataWindow is the key component (and selling point) of PowerBuilder. The DataWindow offers a visual SQL painter which supports outer joins, unions and subquery operations. It can convert SQL to visual representation and back, so the developer can use native SQL if desired. DataWindow updates are automatic — it produces the proper SQL at runtime based on the DBMS to which the user is currently connected. This feature makes it easier for developers who are not experienced with SQL. The DataWindow also has the built-in ability to both retrieve data and update data via stored procedures or REST Web APIs as well as import/export JSON data. The RESTClient object introduced in PowerBuilder 2017 facilitates bridging the DataWindow with REST Web APIs and requiring minimal coding. =RDBMS interfaces= PowerBuilder offers native interfaces to all major databases, as well as ODBC and OLE-DB, in the Enterprise version. There are many connectivity options that allow performance monitoring and tuning, such as: # Integrated security # Tracing of all SQL # Isolation level # Password expiration dialog # Blocking factor # Number of SQL statements to cache # Use connection pool # Thread safety # Trace ODBC API calls Due to the information about the database schema (such as primary key information) that are stored in PowerBuilder's data dictionary, the code required to implement data display and browsing is greatly simplified, because the dictionary information allows generation of the appropriate SQL behind the scenes. PowerBuilder supports the following ways of interacting with a database: DataWindow: this is the simplest approach, relying on automatically generated SQL. ;\\"Embedded SQL\\": Embedded SQL supports SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and cursors. This option is used when the developer desires more control than is available with the DataWindow option. Example: UPDATE my_employee SET STATUS = 'A'; IF sqlca.sqlcode<>0 THEN ... ;\\"Dynamic SQL\\": This is a form of parameterized SQL, where the user builds a string that may optionally have bind variables. Dynamic SQL may be used to create cursors as well. =Integration with third-party software= PowerBuilder supports ActiveX and OCX controls, both visible and non-visible. It also can use OLE Automation as a client. However, PowerBuilder supports only late binding, not early binding. Therefore, when using OLE Automation, a dropdown of possible actions is not provided. PowerBuilder can also act as a DDE client or server, providing a further mechanism to interoperate with other applications. PowerBuilder can make Windows and third-party API calls, and, in general, works well with third-party libraries in DLL files, however it does not directly support callback functions. =Compilation and debugging= PowerBuilder offers a \\"/pbdebug\\" (or variants: \\"-pbdebug\\", \\"-pbd\\", \\"/debug\\", \\"-debug\\", \\"-deb\\") runtime switch, which creates a log file. This can help track down a bug \\"in the field\\", as the user simply emails this log file to the developer. It has another feature which can log all SQL statements to a file. It also has built-in performance profiling, an integrated debugger, context-sensitive help, and an active newsgroup to provide support. PowerBuilder applications are typically compiled to p-code, which is then interpreted by the PowerBuilder run time. Although it can be compiled to machine code (called c-code), a typical business application does not run a lot faster. However, applications which do an unusually large number of CPU- intensive computations are likely to benefit up to 4,000x faster from compiling to machine code. The main reason why compiling to machine code was not used is an enormous number of errors in PowerBuilder especially in machine code generation. Criticism Extensibility of the language was rather limited for older versions of PowerBuilder. The technologies provided to overcome this (ex. PowerBuilder Native Interface, or PBNI) is rather tricky. To develop a solution that includes external C++ code may not only require a competent C++ developer, but also a PowerBuilder expert to guide the developer through the myriad subtleties of the language and the PowerBuilder Virtual Machine. Inheritance and object-oriented features are limited to some object types (Windows, Userobjects and Menus). In particular, it is not possible to inherit from a DataWindow. A PowerBuilder user cannot open a descendant and a parent at the same time in the painter, though they can see all ancestors' code while working on the descendant. To address these criticisms, Appeon has set a new roadmap for PowerBuilder, which it publishes openly on the Appeon Website. The (classic) PowerScript language itself, which is still available for compatibility reasons, is known as \\"a language built around the DataWindow\\" amongst developers with PowerBuilder being the \\"IDE built around the DataWindow\\". C# development centered around a new .NET DataWindow with automated migration of existing DataWindows was introduced in PowerBuilder 2019. Community Since Appeon took over PowerBuilder, it has launched a new official community website for PowerBuilder developers. This community website offers technical articles, webinars, and Q&A;, which are authored by community users. Appeon also hosts an annual user conference called Appeon Elevate, and recordings of the conference sessions are available from the conference website. There are a number of local user groups around the world that cooperate with Appeon to deliver abridged versions of the conference in seminar format and local language. There are also a variety of grass roots community groups and resources for PowerBuilder developers to share and convene. PowerBuilderTV is series of webinars by PowerBuilder users and vendors that tend to focus on third party add-ons. PowerBuilder Central is a community initiative to create a single source for third party add-ons and services.

Here the dependent variable for each observation takes values which are either 0 or 1. The probability of observing a 0 or 1 in any one case is treated as depending on one or more explanatory variables. For the \\"linear probability model\\", this relationship is a particularly simple one, and allows the model to be fitted by linear regression. The model assumes that, for a binary outcome (Bernoulli trial), Y, and its associated vector of explanatory variables, X, : \\\\Pr(Y=1  X=x) = x'\\\\beta . For this model, : E[YX] = \\\\Pr(Y=1X) =x'\\\\beta, and hence the vector of parameters β can be estimated using least squares. This method of fitting would be inefficient, and can be improved by adopting an iterative scheme based on weighted least squares, in which the model from the previous iteration is used to supply estimates of the conditional variances, \\\\operatorname{Var}(YX=x), which would vary between observations. This approach can be related to fitting the model by maximum likelihood. A drawback of this model is that, unless restrictions are placed on \\\\beta , the estimated coefficients can imply probabilities outside the unit interval [0,1] .

The Hoxton Square space in the East End of London was closed at the end of 2012 and the São Paulo gallery in 2015. History White Cube is a gallery owned and run by the art dealer Jay Jopling (an Old Etonian and son of a Conservative MP) who, until September 2008, was married to artist Sam Taylor- Wood. It was first opened in a small, square room in May 1993 in Duke Street, St James's, a traditional art dealing street in the West End of London. In that location there was a gallery rule that an artist could only be exhibited once. The gallery achieved its reputation by being the first to give one person shows to many of the Young British Artists (YBAs), including Tracey Emin. The now defunct White Cube in Hoxton Square, which would close in 2012 In April 2000 it moved to 48 Hoxton Square, a 1920s building that had previously been occupied by the small publishing company Gerald Duckworth & Co. In 2002 an extra two stories (750 m²) were added by hoisting a prefabricated unit on top of the existing structure. A White Cube installation being set up in Hoxton Square in front of the gallery. The Hoxton/Shoreditch area has been popular with the Young British Artists (YBAs) since the 1990s, at which time it was a run-down area of light industry. More recently it has undergone extensive redevelopment with clubs, restaurants and media businesses. Hoxton Square is a prime site with a central area of grass and trees, which the vicinity is mostly lacking. White Cube previews were open to the public and crowds used to fill the square on such occasions. Its publicly accessible interior had a small reception area, which lead onto a 250-m² exhibition area downstairs, two storeys in height. Another smaller exhibition space upstairs often showed a different artist. Offices and a conference room are on the upper floors. On some occasions exhibitions have been installed on the grass of the square, one example being Hirst's large sculpture (22 ft, 6.7 m) Charity, based on the old Spastic Society's model, which shows a girl in a leg brace holding a charity collecting box. White Cube Hoxton Square closed at the end of 2012. White Cube, St James's, London. White Cube also offers artists' editions. In September 2006 it opened a second site at 25–26 Mason's Yard, off Duke Street, St. James's, home of the original White Cube gallery, on a plot previously occupied by an electricity sub-station. The gallery, designed by MRJ Rundell & Associates, is the first free-standing building to be built in the St James's area for more than 30 years. In October 2011 White Cube Bermondsey was opened on Bermondsey Street. The building was formerly a 1970s warehouse and was converted into 58,000 sq ft of interior space making it, at launch, Europe's biggest commercial gallery. White Cube Hong Kong opened in March 2012 at 50 Connaught Road, in the heart of Hong Kong's Central district. It was the first White Cube gallery located outside the UK. Many artists have exhibited there including Gilbert & George, Anselm Kiefer, Damien Hirst and Cerith Wyn Evans. The gallery presents in an internal exhibition space of 550 m2 (6000 sq ft), which is set over two floors and has a ceiling height of over 4.5 metres. The space was designed by London-based architects Maybank and Matthews. White Cube São Paulo opened in December 2012 in a converted warehouse in the centre of the city, on a three-year lease. The gallery launched after a one-off project in the space by Antony Gormley, organised in conjunction with the British artist’s major exhibition at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil São Paulo in the summer of 2012.

Early life France was born in Cameron, Missouri, the son of Hanna Fletcher (James) and Joseph Henry France. He attended the common schools in the area and the Canandaigua Academy in Canandaigua, New York. In 1895, he graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he was a brother of Theta Delta Chi. He also attended the University of Leipzig in Leipzig, Germany and finally, in 1897, graduated from the medical department of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. France began to teach natural science at the Jacob Tome Institute of Port Deposit, Maryland in 1897, but resigned later to enter the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Baltimore, Maryland. He commenced the practice of medicine in Baltimore after graduation in 1903. Career France was elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1906, serving until 1908. He left the Senate in 1908 to engage in the field of finance. He served as the secretary to the medical and surgical faculty of Maryland from 1916–1917. After a short time out of politics, France re-entered the political arena in 1916 and was elected to the United States Senate. During the 65th Congress, he served in the Senate as the chairman of the Committee on Public Health and National Quarantine. France attempted to introduce an amendment to the Sedition Act of 1918 that would have ensured limited free speech protections, but the amendment was defeated, and France would remark that the legislation was criminal, repressive, and characteristic of the Dark Ages.Revolutionary sparks: freedom of expression in modern America, Margaret A.

It is the oldest type of small arms as well as the most mechanically simplistic form of metal barrel firearms. Unlike matchlock firearms it requires direct manual external ignition through a touch hole without any form of firing mechanism. It may also be considered a forerunner of the handgun. The hand cannon was widely used in China from the 13th century onward and later throughout Eurasia in the 14th century. In 15th century Europe, the hand cannon evolved to become the matchlock arquebus, which became the first firearm to have a trigger.  History  Heilongjiang hand cannon, 1287-1288 =China= The earliest artistic depiction of what might be a hand cannon – a rock sculpture found among the Dazu Rock Carvings – is dated to 1128, much earlier than any recorded or precisely dated archaeological samples, so it is possible that the concept of a cannon-like firearm has existed since the 12th century. This has been challenged by others such as Liu Xu, Cheng Dong, and Benjamin Avichai Katz Sinvany. According to Liu, the weight of the cannon would have been too much for one person to hold, especially with just one arm, and points out that fire lances were being used a decade later at De'an. Cheng Dong believes that the figure depicted is actually a wind spirit letting air out of a bag rather than a cannon emitting a blast. Stephen Haw also considered the possibility that the item in question was a bag of air but concludes that it is a cannon because it was grouped with other weapon wielding sculptures. Sinvany believes in the wind bag interpretation and that the cannonball indentation was added later on.https://brill.com/view/journals/jcmh/9/1/article-p99_4.xml?language=en The first cannons were likely an evolution of the fire lance. In 1259 a type of \\"fire-emitting lance\\" (tuhuoqiang 突火槍) made an appearance. According to the History of Song: \\"It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (子窠). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is like a bomb that can be heard for five hundred or more paces.\\" The pellet wad mentioned is possibly the first true bullet in recorded history depending on how bullet is defined, as it did occlude the barrel, unlike previous co-viatives (non-occluding shrapnel) used in the fire lance. Fire lances transformed from the \\"bamboo- (or wood- or paper-) barreled firearm to the metal-barreled firearm\\" to better withstand the explosive pressure of gunpowder. From there it branched off into several different gunpowder weapons known as \\"eruptors\\" in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with different functions such as the \\"filling-the-sky erupting tube\\" which spewed out poisonous gas and porcelain shards, the \\"orifice- penetrating flying sand magic mist tube\\" (鑽穴飛砂神霧筒) which spewed forth sand and poisonous chemicals into orifices, and the more conventional \\"phalanx-charging fire gourd\\" which shot out lead pellets. Hand cannons first saw widespread usage in China sometime during the 13th century and spread from there to the rest of the world. In 1287 Yuan Jurchen troops deployed hand cannons in putting down a rebellion by the Mongol prince Nayan. The History of Yuan reports that the cannons of Li Ting's soldiers \\"caused great damage,\\" but also created \\"such confusion that the enemy soldiers attacked and killed each other.\\" The hand cannons were used again in the beginning of 1288. Li Ting's \\"gun-soldiers\\" or chongzu () were able to carry the hand cannons \\"on their backs\\". The passage on the 1288 battle is also the first to coin the name chong () with the metal radical jin () for metal-barrel firearms. Chong was used instead of the earlier and more ambiguous term huo tong (fire tube; ), which may refer to the tubes of fire lances, proto-cannons, or signal flares. The oldest extant hand cannon bearing a date of production is the Xanadu Gun, which contains an era date corresponding to 1298. The Heilongjiang hand cannon is dated a decade earlier to 1288, corresponding to the military conflict involving Li Ting, but the dating method is based on contextual evidence; the gun bears no inscription or era date. Other specimens also likely predate the Xanadu and Heilongjiang guns and have been traced back to the late Western Xia period (1214-1227), but these too lack inscriptions and era dates (see Wuwei bronze cannon). =Spread= The earliest reliable evidence of hand cannons in Europe appeared in 1326 and evidence of their production can be dated as early as 1327. The first recorded use of gunpowder weapons in Europe was in 1331 when two mounted German knights attacked Cividale del Friuli with gunpowder weapons of some sort. By 1338 hand cannons were in widespread use in France. During the 14th century the Arabs seem to have used the hand cannon to some degree. Cannons are attested to in India starting from 1366. The Joseon kingdom in Korea acquired knowledge of gunpowder from China by 1372 and started producing cannons by 1377. In Southeast Asia Đại Việt soldiers were using hand cannons at the very latest by 1390 when they employed them in killing the king of Champa, Che Bong Nga. Java was confirmed to use hand cannon in 1413 during Zheng He voyage.Mayers (1876). \\"Chinese explorations of the Indian Ocean during the fifteenth century\\". The China Review. IV: p. 178. In 1511 siege of Malacca, the Malays were using cannons, matchlock guns, and \\"firing tubes\\". Japan was already aware of gunpowder warfare due to the Mongol invasions during the 13th century, but did not acquire a cannon until a monk took one back to Japan from China in 1510, and firearms were not produced until 1543, when the Portuguese introduced matchlocks which were known as tanegashima to the Japanese. The art of firing the hand cannon called Ōzutsu (大筒) has remained as a Ko-budō martial arts form.https://www.bilibili.com/video/av68405147/ Improvements in hand cannon and gunpowder technology – corned powder, shot ammunition, and development of the flash pan – led to the invention of the arquebus in late 15th-century Europe. =Middle East= The earliest surviving documentary evidence for the use of the hand cannon in the Islamic world are from several Arabic manuscripts dated to the 14th century. (Part 4 and Part 5) The historian Ahmad Y. al-Hassan (2008) argues that several 14th-century Arabic manuscripts, one of which was written by Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Ansari al-Dimashqi (1256–1327), report the use of hand cannons by Mamluk-Egyptian forces against the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. However, Hassan's claim contradicts other historians who claim hand cannons did not appear in the Middle East until the 14th century. Iqtidar Alam Khan (1996) argues that it was the Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and believes cannons only reached Mamluk Egypt in the 1370s. According to Joseph Needham (1986), the term midfa, dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal- barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365. Needham also concludes that in its original form the term midfa refers to the tube or cylinder of naphta projector (flamethrower), then after the invention of gunpowder it meant the tube of fire lances, eventually it applied to the cylinder of hand-gun and cannon. Similarly, Tonio Andrade (2016) dates the textual appearance of cannon in Middle-Eastern sources to the 1360s. Gabor Ágoston and David Ayalon (2005) believe the Mamluks had certainly used siege cannon by the 1360s, but earlier uses of cannon in the Islamic World are vague with a possible appearance in the Emirate of Granada by the 1320s, however evidence is inconclusive. Khan claims that it was invading Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry as an example of how gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East. Similarly, the refusal of their Qizilbash forces to use firearms contributed to the Safavid rout at Chaldiran in 1514. The earliest Turkish hand cannons were called \\"Şakaloz\\", which comes from the Hungarian hand cannon \\"Szakállas puska\\". Design and features The hand cannon consists of a barrel, a handle, and sometimes a socket to insert a wooden stock. Extant samples show that some hand cannons also featured a metal extension as a handle. The hand cannon could be held in two hands, but another person is often shown aiding in the ignition process using smoldering wood, coal, red-hot iron rods, or slow-burning matches. The hand cannon could be placed on a rest and held by one hand, while the gunner applied the means of ignition himself. Projectiles used in hand cannons were known to include rocks, pebbles, and arrows. Eventually stone projectiles in the shape of balls became the preferred form of ammunition, and then they were replaced by iron balls from the late 14th to 15th centuries. Later hand cannons have been shown to include a flash pan attached to the barrel and a touch hole drilled through the side wall instead of the top of the barrel. The flash pan had a leather cover and, later on, a hinged metal lid, to keep the priming powder dry until the moment of firing and to prevent premature firing. These features were carried over to subsequent firearms.

It was estimated casualties ranged from 80,000 to 300,000,Akçam, Taner (2006) A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility p. 42, Metropolitan Books, New York resulting in 50,000 orphaned children.. The massacres are named after Sultan Abdul Hamid II, who, in his efforts to maintain the imperial domain of the collapsing Ottoman Empire, reasserted Pan-Islamism as a state ideology. Although the massacres were aimed mainly at the Armenians, they turned into indiscriminate anti-Christian pogroms in some cases, such as the Diyarbekir massacre, where, at least according to one contemporary source, up to 25,000 Assyrians were also killed.. The massacres began in the Ottoman interior in 1894, before becoming more widespread in the following years. Between 1894 and 1896 was when the majority of the murders took place. The massacres began tapering off in 1897, following international condemnation of Abdul Hamid. The harshest measures were directed against the long persecuted Armenian community as calls for civil reform and better treatment from the government went ignored. The Ottomans made no allowances for the victims' age or gender, and massacred all with brutal force. This occurred at a time when the telegraph could spread news around the world, and the massacres received extensive coverage in the media of Western Europe and North America. Background The origins of the hostility toward Armenians lay in the increasingly precarious position in which the Ottoman Empire found itself in the last quarter of the 19th century. The end of Ottoman dominion over the Balkans was ushered in by an era of European nationalism and an insistence on self-determination by many territories long held under Ottoman rule. The Armenians of the empire, who were long considered second-class citizens, had begun in the mid-1860s and early 1870s to ask for civil reforms and better treatment from government. They pressed for an end to the usurpation of land, \\"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by Kurds and Circassians, improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial.\\"Akçam. A Shameful Act, p. 36. These requests went unheeded by the central government. When a nascent form of nationalism spread among the Armenians of Anatolia, including demands for equal rights and a push for autonomy, the Ottoman leadership believed that the empire's Islamic character and even its very existence were threatened. =The Armenian Question= The combination of Russian military success in the recent Russo-Turkish War, the clear weakening of the Ottoman Empire in various spheres including financial (from 1873, the Ottoman Empire suffered greatly from the Panic of 1873), territorial (mentioned above), and the hope among some Armenians that one day all of the Armenian territory might be ruled by Russia, led to a new restiveness among Armenians living inside the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians sent a delegation led by Mkrtich Khrimian to the 1878 Congress of Berlin to lobby the European powers to include proper safeguards for their kinsmen in the eventual peace agreement. The sultan, however, was not prepared to relinquish any power. Abdul Hamid believed that the woes of the Ottoman Empire stemmed from \\"the endless persecutions and hostilities of the Christian world.\\"Akçam. A Shameful Act, p. 43. He perceived the Ottoman Armenians to be an extension of foreign hostility, a means by which Europe could \\"get at our most vital places and tear out our very guts.\\"Akçam. A Shameful Act, p. 44. Turkish historian and Abdul Hamid biographer Osman Nuri observed, \\"The mere mention of the word 'reform' irritated him [Abdul Hamid], inciting his criminal instincts.\\"Dadrian, Vahakn N. (1995). The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus. Oxford: Berghahn Books, p. 163. . Upon hearing of the Armenian delegation's visit to Berlin in 1878, he bitterly remarked, \\"Such great impudence...Such great treachery toward religion and state...May they be cursed upon by God.\\"Quoted in Stephan Astourian, \\"On the Genealogy of the Armenian-Turkish Conflict, Sultan Abdülhamid, and the Armenian Massacres,\\" Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies 21 (2012), p. 185. While he admitted that some of their complaints were well-founded, he likened the Armenians to \\"hired female mourners [pleureuses] who simulate a pain they do not feel; they are an effeminate and cowardly people who hide behind the clothes of the great powers and raise an outcry for the smallest of causes.\\"Quoted in Astourian, \\"On the Genealogy of the Armenian-Turkish Conflict,\\" p. 195. =The Hamidiye= An Armenian woman and her children who were refugees of the massacres and sought help from missionaries by walking great distances. The provisions for reform in the Armenian provinces embodied in Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin (1878) were ultimately not enforced and were followed instead by further repression. On January 2, 1881, collective notes sent by the European powers reminding the sultan of the promises of reform failed to prod him into action. The eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire were historically insecure;See Azat S. Hambaryan (1981), \\"Հողային հարաբերությունները: Հարկերն ու պարհակները\\" [Land relations: Taxes and services] in Հայ Ժողովրդի Պատմություն [History of the Armenian People], ed. Tsatur Aghayan et al.

Ronald Grigor Suny, Fatma Müge Göçek, and Norman Naimark. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 58-61, 63-67. In 1890–91, at a time when the empire was either too weak and disorganized or reluctant to halt them, Sultan Abdul Hamid gave semi-official status to the Kurdish bandits. Made up mainly of Kurdish tribes, but also of Turks, Yöruk, Arabs, Turkmens and Circassians, and armed by the state, they came to be called the Hamidiye Alaylari (\\"Hamidian Regiments\\").Klein, Janet (2011). The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone. Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 21-34. The Hamidiye and Kurdish brigands were given free rein to attack Armenians, confiscating stores of grain, foodstuffs, and driving off livestock, confident of escaping punishment as they were subjects of military courts only.McDowall, David (2004). A Modern History of the Kurds, 3rd rev. and updated ed. London: I.B. Tauris, pp. 60-62. In the face of such abuses and violence, the Armenians established revolutionary organizations, namely the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak; founded in Switzerland in 1887) and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (the ARF or Dashnaktsutiun, founded in 1890 in Tiflis).Nalbandian, Louise (1963). The Armenian Revolutionary Movement: The Development of Armenian Political Parties through the Nineteenth Century. Berkeley: University of California Press. Clashes ensued and unrest occurred in 1892 at Merzifon and in 1893 at Tokat. =Disturbances in Sasun= In 1894, the sultan began to target the Armenian people in a precursor to the Hamidian massacres. This persecution strengthened nationalistic sentiment among Armenians. The first notable battle in the Armenian resistance took place in Sasun. Hunchak activists, such as Mihran Damadian, Hampartsoum Boyadjian, and Hrayr, encouraged resistance against double taxation and Ottoman persecution. The ARF armed the people of the region. The Armenians confronted the Ottoman army and Kurdish irregulars at Sasun, finally succumbing to superior numbers and to Turkish assurances of amnesty (which was never granted). In response to the resistance at Sasun, the governor of Mush responded by inciting the local Muslims against the Armenians. Historian Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross writes that massacres of this kind were often achieved by gathering Muslims in a local mosque and claiming that the Armenians had the aim of \\"striking at Islam.\\"Lord Kinross (1977). The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire. New York: Morrow, p. 559. Sultan Abdul Hamid sent the Ottoman army into the area and also armed groups of Kurdish irregulars. The violence spread and affected most of the Armenian towns in the Ottoman Empire.Hovannisian, Richard G (1997). \\"The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire, 1876–1914\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century. Ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 223. .  Massacres  Sketch by an eye-witness of the massacre of Armenians during the Hamidian massacres The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia) forced Hamid to sign a new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the Hamidiye in October 1895 which, like the Berlin treaty, was never implemented. On October 1, 1895, two thousand Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation of the reforms, but Ottoman police units converged on the rally and violently broke it up. Upon receiving the reform package, the sultan is said to have remarked, \\"This business will end in blood.\\" Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian-populated vilayets of Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzurum, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Sivas, Trebizond and Van. Thousands were killed at the hands of their Muslim neighbors and government soldiers, and many more died during the cold winter of 1895–96. William Sachtleben, an American journalist who happened to be in Erzurum after the massacre there in 1895, recounted the grisly scene he came across in a lengthy letter to The Times: The French vice consul of Diyarbakır, Gustave Meyrier, recounted to Ambassador Paul Cambon stories of Armenian women and children being assaulted and killed and described the attackers \\"as cowardly as they were cruel. They refused to attack where people defended themselves and instead concentrated on defenseless districts.\\"Quoted in Claire Mouradian (2006), \\"Gustave Meyrier and the Turmoil in Diarbekir, 1894-1896,\\" in Armenian Tigranakert/Diarbekir and Edessa/Urfa, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 6. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, p. 219. The worst atrocity took place in Urfa, where Ottoman troops burned the Armenian cathedral, in which 3,000 Armenians had taken refuge, and shot at anyone who tried to escape.Kieser, Hans-Lucas. \\"Ottoman Urfa and its Missionary Witnesses\\" in Armenian Tigranakert/Diarbekir and Edessa/Urfa, p. 406. Abdul Hamid's private first secretary wrote in his memoirs about Abdul Hamid that he \\"decided to pursue a policy of severity and terror against the Armenians, and in order to succeed in this respect he elected the method of dealing them an economic blow... he ordered that they absolutely avoid negotiating or discussing anything with the Armenians and that they inflict upon them a decisive strike to settle scores.\\"Dadrian. History of the Armenian Genocide, p. 161. The killings continued until 1897. In that last year, Sultan Hamid declared the Armenian Question closed. Many Armenian revolutionaries had either been killed or escaped to Russia. The Ottoman government closed Armenian societies and restricted Armenian political movements. Some non-Armenian groups were also attacked during the massacres. The French diplomatic correspondence shows that the Hamidiye carried out massacres not only of Armenians but also of Assyrians living in Diyarbakir, Hasankeyf, Sivas and other parts of Anatolia.De Courtois, Forgotten Genocide, pp. 137, 144, 145.Travis, Hannibal. \\"Native Christians Massacred: The Ottoman Genocide of the Assyrians During World War I .\\" Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal 3 (2006): pp. 327-371. Death toll Armenian victims of the massacres being buried in a mass grave at Erzerum cemetery. It is impossible to ascertain how many Armenians were killed, although the figures cited by historians have ranged from 80,000 to 300,000. Therefore, third-party figures are deemed most reliable. The German pastor Johannes Lepsius meticulously collected data on the destruction and in his calculations, counted the deaths of 88,243 Armenians, the destitution of 546,000, the destruction of 2,493 villages, the residents of 456 of which were forcibly converted to Islam,On this issue in general, see Selim Deringil (April 2009), \\"'The Armenian Question Is Finally Closed': Mass Conversions of Armenians in Anatolia during the Hamidian Massacres of 1895–1897,\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 51, pp. 344-71. and the desecration of 649 churches and monasteries, of which 328 were converted into mosques.Hovannisian. \\"The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire,\\" p. 224. He also estimated the additional deaths of 100,000 Armenians due to famine and disease totalling a number of approximately 200,000. On the other hand, the ambassador of Britain estimated 100,000 were killed up until early December 1895.Dadrian. The History of the Armenian Genocide, p. 155. However, the period of massacres spread well into 1896. German foreign ministry operative and Turkologist Ernst Jäckh claimed that 200,000 Armenians were killed and 50,000 were expelled and a million pillaged and plundered. Jäckh, Ernst. Der Aufsteugende Halbmond, 6th ed. (Berlin, 1916), p. 139. A similar figure is cited by the French diplomatic historian Pierre Renouvin who claimed that 250,000 Armenians died based on authenticated documents while serving his duty. P. Renouvin, E. Preclin, G. Hardy, L'Epoque contemporaine. La paix armee et la Grande Guerre. 2nd ed. Paris, 1947, p. 176. Besides Armenians, some 25,000 Assyrians and up to 100,000 Greeks lost their lives as well. International reaction Sultan Abdul Hamid II News of the Armenian massacres in the empire were widely reported in Europe and the United States and drew strong responses from foreign governments, humanitarian organizations, and the press alike.Gary J. Bass, Freedom's Battle: The Origins of Humanitarian Intervention. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008; Balakian, The Burning Tigris. British print and illustrated newspapers regularly covered the massacres, with the popular weekly Punch publishing dozens of cartoons depicting the carnage.Schumacher, Leslie Rogne (2020), \\"Outrage and Imperialism, Confusion and Indifference: Punch and the Armenian Massacres of 1894-1896,\\" in Comic Empires: Imperialism in Cartoons, Caricature, and Satirical Art, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2020, p. 306 Further, historian Leslie Rogne Schumacher notes that the massacres \\"reflected and impacted the changing world of European international relations\\" in the years before the First World War, weakening Britain's relationship with the Ottoman Empire and bolstering British ties to Russia.Schumacher, \\"Outrage and Imperialism, Confusion and Indifference,\\" p. 326 The French ambassador described Turkey as \\"literally in flames,\\" with \\"massacres everywhere\\" and all Christians being murdered \\"without distinction.\\" Cambon, Paul (1940).

One headline in a September 1895 article by The New York Times ran \\"Armenian Holocaust,\\" while the Catholic World declared, \\"Not all the perfume of Arabia can wash the hand of Turkey clean enough to be suffered any longer to hold the reins of power over one inch of Christian territory.\\" The rest of the American press called for action to help the Armenians and to remove, \\"if not by political action then by resort to the knife... the fever spot of the Turkish Empire.\\" King Leopold II of Belgium told British Prime Minister Salisbury that he was prepared to send his Congolese Force Publique to \\"invade and occupy\\" Armenia. The massacres were an important item on the agenda of the United States President Grover Cleveland, and in his presidential platform for 1896, Republican candidate William McKinley listed the saving of the Armenians as one of his top priorities in foreign policy.For a study on the American response to the massacres, see Ralph Elliot Cook (1957), \\"The United States and the Armenian Question, 1894-1924,\\" Unpublished Ph.D Dissertation, Tufts University. Americans in the Ottoman Empire, such as George Washburn, then-president of the Constantinople-based Robert College, pressured their government to take concrete action. In December 1900, the USS Kentucky called at the port of Smyrna, where its captain, \\"Red Bill\\" Kirkland, delivered the following warning, somewhat softened by his translator, to its governor: \\"If these massacres continue I'll be swuzzled if I won't someday forget my order… and find some pretext to hammer a few Turkish towns… I'd keel-haul every blithering mother's son of a Turk that wears hair.\\"Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, p. 294. Americans on the mainland, such as Julia Ward Howe, David Josiah Brewer, and John D. Rockefeller, donated and raised large amounts of money and organized relief aid that was channeled to the Armenians via the newly established American Red Cross. Other humanitarian groups and the Red Cross helped by sending aid to the remaining survivors who were dying of disease and hunger.Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, pp. 294–96. Child victims of a massacre awaiting burial in an Armenian cemetery in Erzurum, 1895 At the height of the massacres, in 1896, Abdul Hamid tried to limit the flow of information coming out of Turkey (Harper's Weekly was banned by Ottoman censors for its extensive coverage of the massacres) and counteract the negative press by enlisting the help of sympathetic Western activists and journalists. The Zionist leader Theodor Herzl responded ecstatically to Abdul Hamid's personal request to harness \\"Jewish power\\" in order to undermine the widespread sympathy felt for Armenians in Europe. Through his contacts, favorable impressions of the empire were published in a number of European newspapers and magazines, while Herzl himself attempted unsuccessfully to mediate between the Sultan and Armenian party activists in France, Britain, Austria and elsewhere. Herzl acknowledged that the arrangement with the Abdul Hamid was temporary and his services were in exchange for bringing about a more favorable Ottoman attitude toward Zionism. \\"Under no circumstances,\\" he wrote, \\"are the Armenians to learn that we want to use them in order to erect a Jewish state.\\"Anderson, Margaret Lavinia (March 2007). \\"'Down in Turkey, Far Away,': Human Rights, the Armenian Massacres, and Orientalism in Wilhelmine Germany,\\" Journal of Modern History 79, pp. 87-90, quotation on p. 88. Cf. also Marwan R. Buheiry, \\"Theodor Herzl and the Armenian Question,\\" Journal of Palestine Studies 7 (Autumn, 1977): pp. 75-97. Herzl's currying the Sultan's favor did not go without protest. Bernard Lazare published an open letter critical of Herzl and resigned from the Zionist Committee in 1899. The one fellow leader Herzl sought to enlist, Max Nordau, replied with a one-word telegram 'No'. Takeover of the Ottoman Bank Despite the great public sympathy that was felt for the Armenians in Europe, none of the European powers took concrete action to alleviate their plight. Frustrated with their indifference and failure to take action, Armenians from the ARF seized the European-managed Ottoman Bank on August 26, 1896 in order to bring the massacres to their full attention.Hovannisian. \\"The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire,\\" pp. 224–26. Though their demands were rejected and new massacres broke out in Constantinople, the act was lauded by the European and American press, which vilified Hamid and painted him as the \\"great assassin\\" and \\"bloody Sultan.\\"Balakian. The Burning Tigris, pp. 35, 115. The Great Powers vowed to take action and enforce new reforms, although these never came to fruition due to conflicting political and economic interests.Rodogno, Davide. Against Massacre: Humanitarian Interventions in the Ottoman Empire, 1815-1914. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012, pp. 185-211. Inaccurate reportage by the Ottoman government Haji Agha, a Muslim, reportedly stood guard at an Aintab hospital to protect it from an anti- Armenian pogrom in 1895. After George Hepworth, a preeminent journalist of the late 19th century, traveled through Ottoman Armenia in 1897, he wrote Through Armenia on Horseback, which discusses the causes and effects of the recent massacres. In one chapter Hepworth describes the disparity between the reality of the Massacre in Bitlis and the official reports that were sent to the Porte. After retelling the Ottoman version of events, which places the blame solely on the Armenians of Bitlis, Hepworth writes: Official Ottoman sources downplayed or misrepresented the death toll numbers. The attempt of deliberately misrepresenting the numbers were noted by British Ambassador Phillip Currie in a letter to Prime Minister Lord Salisbury: Historiography Some scholars, such as the Soviet historians Mkrtich G. Nersisyan, Ruben Sahakyan, and John Kirakosyan, and Yehuda Bauer subscribe to the view that the mass killings of 1894–1896 were the first phase of the Armenian Genocide. Most scholars, however, limit this definition strictly to the years 1915–1923.For a brief discussion on continuity, see Richard G.

A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1892, he was selected for England in three Test matches in 1893. Mold was one of the most effective bowlers in England during the 1890s but his career was overshadowed by controversy over his bowling action. Although he took 1,673 wickets in first- class matches, many commentators viewed his achievements as tainted. Mold began his professional cricket career playing for Banbury and Northamptonshire in the mid-1880s, but by 1889 had qualified to play for Lancashire at county level. Immediately successful, he quickly established a good bowling partnership with Johnny Briggs and became one of the leading bowlers in the country. However, he only achieved selection for England in one series in 1893. Many critics thought he threw rather than bowled the ball, and he was among several bowlers at the time about whom there were similar suspicions. Controversy erupted in 1900 when Mold was no-balled for throwing by Jim Phillips, an umpire who had targeted several prominent bowlers with dubious bowling actions. After Mold avoided several games in which Phillips was umpire, the affair came to a head in 1901. On the opening morning of a match, Phillips repeatedly no-balled Mold. Several of Mold's teammates and most Lancashire supporters continued to believe that Mold bowled legally, but his reputation was ruined and, after three more appearances in 1901, he retired at the end of the season. After his departure from the game, throwing ceased to be a concern in English cricket for 50 years. Early life and career Mold was born on 27 May 1863 in the village of Middleton Cheney in Northamptonshire. His family had links with the thatching trade, but Mold pursued a career in professional cricket.Ambrose, p. 29. He began to play for the village team, making good progress as a bowler; in 1882, Middleton Cheney were unbeaten and Mold had the best bowling average in the team. In 1885 and 1886, he was employed as a professional at Banbury Cricket Club. In his second year, a successful match against the Free Foresters, an amateur team, impressed two Lancashire cricketers who played against him. Subsequently, in 1887, Mold was employed by Manchester Cricket Club, and played a few non- competitive cricket matches for Lancashire. In the same season, Northamptonshire, which at the time had not been awarded first-class status, asked Mold to play for them. Playing as a professional, At the time, a scorecard denoted a player as a professional by giving their name without a title. Amateurs always had \\"Mr.\\" before their name. In this case, the player is recorded as just \\"Mold\\". Mold was immediately successful, taking ten wickets in a match against a team from Surrey and seven wickets for 22 runs (seven for 22) in an innings against Staffordshire. He continued to represent Northamptonshire in the following season but hoped to play for Lancashire. At the time, cricketers who wished to play competitive first-class matches for a county in which they were not born had to live there for two years to qualify. By 1889, Mold was qualified for Lancashire and was expected by critics to make an impact.Wynne-Thomas, p. 49. At the time, Lancashire had no fast bowler in their team, making Mold potentially an important player.Wynne-Thomas, p. 51. He made his first-class debut for the county in a three-day match against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) starting on 9 May 1889, taking one wicket in a drawn game. Throughout the rest of the season, Mold impressed critics. After a slow start in unhelpful conditions and unsuitable playing surfaces for his type of bowling, he took a total of 33 wickets in four consecutive games and established a reputation as the fastest bowler in England. His best performance statistically was seven for 35 against Yorkshire County Cricket Club, in a match during which he took 13 wickets, but he was successful in other high-profile matches. In all games against county opposition, Mold took 80 wickets at an average of 11.69; in all first-class matches he took 102 wickets at an average of 11.81. This placed him third in the national bowling averages. Although less successful in 1890, he took 118 wickets in first-class games at 14.72, which was 11th in the averages. His best figures, nine for 41, once more came against Yorkshire, and he helped Lancashire to second place in the first official County Championship. Mold came close to playing for England when he was included in the squad to play in the third Test match against Australia, but the match was abandoned owing to rain and no play took place.Wynne-Thomas, p. 55. Leading bowler Mold established himself as one of the leading bowlers in England during 1891. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"The season of 1891 brought him a great increase of reputation, and all through the summer he was uniformly successful.\\" In all first-class matches, he took 138 wickets at 12.49 to finish second in the national bowling averages.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 55–56. As a result of his good performances in the season, he was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Lancashire finished as runners-up once again in the County Championship. In 1892, Mold's aggregate of wickets fell to 120 at an average of 13.63, but he returned the best bowling figures of his career when he took nine for 29 against Kent. He was chosen in a representative match for the first time, playing for the North against the South. During the 1893 season, Mold took 166 wickets at 16.96; at the end of the season, The Times described him as a great bowler and noted that he and Johnny Briggs were Lancashire's only two effective bowlers. Between them, the pair took 225 wickets; the other bowlers in combination took 46.Wynne-Thomas, p. 58. Once more representing the North during 1893, this time in a match against the touring Australian team, Mold also made his debut in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match, playing for the professional \\"Players\\" and taking nine wickets in the game. His performances brought about his international debut; he played for England in all three Test matches against Australia, the only such appearances of his career. In the first game, he took three for 44 in Australia's only innings, his best figures of the series, and took four wickets in the other two matches to finish with seven wickets at an average of 33.42. It is likely that doubts about the legality of his bowling action prevented him from playing further Test matches, or touring Australia with a representative side. However, other factors may have played a part in his subsequent omission, including the emergence of Tom Richardson as a successful fast bowler, and the opinion that Mold's bowling was flattered by the difficult, uneven pitches on which Lancashire played their home games. Mold's annual total of wickets continued to increase in the following seasons. In 1894, he again represented the North and the Players, taking 207 wickets in total at an average of 12.30. But as Lancashire increased the number of games they played, Mold and Briggs had an increased bowling workload and once more had little assistance from other bowlers. Between them, they took 324 wickets while the next most successful bowler took 13.Wynne-Thomas, p. 59. The following year, Mold reached his highest seasonal tally with 213 wickets at 15.96, and made his final appearance for the Players. The Times commented on the effectiveness of Mold: \\"Mold preserves all his pace and break in bowling, and his success on the hard wickets was phenomenal.\\" Although Mold appeared for the North against the Australians, who toured again in 1896, he did not play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time.Wynne-Thomas, p. 67. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three weeks of the season owing to injury.Wynne-Thomas, p. 68. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010. Throwing controversy alt=Photograph of a man in a suit =Background= For many years in England, there had been controversy over bowling actions; several bowlers were believed to throw rather than bowl the ball, which was contrary to the Laws of Cricket.Brodribb, p. 155. Lancashire had a particularly poor reputation among other county teams for using bowlers who threw: by the early 1880s, up to four of Lancashire's main bowlers were judged to be unfair, including John Crossland who bowled very quickly. By the mid-1880s, several teams refused to play Lancashire on account of their bowling attack.Brodribb, p. 156. Mainly through the actions of Lord Harris, many of the suspect bowlers were forced out of cricket, and bowling actions became more legitimate. However, some players continued to bowl with questionable actions, including members of the Lancashire team. The issue intensified in 1896 when two of the Australian touring team, Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin, seemed to throw the ball regularly; Sydney Pardon, the editor of Wisden, wrote: \\"The mortifying fact was that the illegal bowling was due entirely to our own weakness in not having the laws of the game carried out. The Australians only did against us what we had over and over again done against them.\\" Following the 1896 tour, the English authorities realised action had to be taken. Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed each year between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no- balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.Birley, p. 176. =Mold called for throwing= During the 1900 season, Fry was once more no-balled at the beginning of June, this time by William West. The concerted action against throwing reached a peak when Phillips umpired the match between Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in Nottingham on 26 June. Early on the first morning of the three-day match, Mold came on to bowl when Nottinghamshire had scored 34. In Mold's first over, Phillips twice no-balled him for throwing. Lancashire's captain, Archie MacLaren, withdrew Mold from the bowling attack at the end of the over and he did not bowl again in the match. However, MacLaren later defended Mold in the press. The match reports in both The Times and Wisden commented that Mold had been lucky never to be no-balled before in his career; he was the most high-profile bowler to be called in the Phillips- led crackdown on bowling actions.Brodribb, p. 157. Mold played another nine times in 1900 without being called for throwing, but he did not play in any of the Lancashire matches umpired by Phillips. Later in the season, Phillips called the Somerset bowler Ted Tyler. By the end of the season, Mold had taken 97 wickets at 14.01. alt=A cricket ready to receive the ball That December, at their annual meeting at Lord's, the captains of the first-class counties discussed the problem of throwing.Birley, p. 177. MacLaren asked those present at the meeting to give their opinion of Mold's bowling. According to MacLaren, they \\"replied to a man that they considered that Mold was not always fair\\". Reports in the press stated that they voted by a majority of eleven to one that Mold's action was unfair, and that along with other bowlers whose actions were suspected, he should not bowl in the coming season.Ambrose, p. 30. The captains further recommended that bowlers with illegal actions should be banned, suspended or warned depending on the severity of their transgression. The meeting proved controversial, and disputes arose over how many captains had supported the decision. MacLaren claimed that he was the only captain to support Mold. Despite the verdict of the meeting, Lancashire's committee remained of the opinion that Mold bowled legally; the Lancashire president A. N. Hornby and several of Mold's teammates also publicly backed the bowler. Opinions among other players and in the press varied as to the fairness of Mold's bowling, but sympathy was expressed for the damage to Mold's career and reputation, while Pelham Warner suggested that it was unfair to ban Mold completely. Some critics believed that the captains should not have passed judgement at all. The MCC, responsible for the laws of cricket and the organisation of the English game, were asked to adjudicate by several county committees. Reluctant to let the decision stand, the MCC overruled the captains, preferring to leave the matter to individual umpires. However, the umpires were instructed to pay close attention to suspect bowlers during the coming season. alt=A man dressed in cricket whites Although he may have been expected to retire following the controversy and in view of his age, Mold continued to play for Lancashire, who were short of quality bowlers, at the start of the 1901 season. At least one umpire was asked by the MCC to report specifically on Mold's bowling, but decided it was fair, and no umpire initially called him for throwing. He missed two Lancashire matches in which Phillips was an umpire, wishing to avoid a confrontation, but Lancashire were criticised by the public for omitting Mold from these matches. Consequently, he played in the game against Somerset umpired by Phillips, which started on 11 July at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Under the captaincy of MacLaren, Mold opened the attack and bowled with Phillips at square leg. In Mold's second over of the game, Phillips no-balled him for throwing. Acting at the request of the Lancashire committee, MacLaren then switched Mold to bowl from the opposite end so that Phillips would be at the bowler's end. Even so, Phillips continued to no-ball him, and after 10 overs, Mold had been called 16 times by Phillips. MacLaren removed Mold from the attack, although he returned to bowl later without further action from either umpire. For the remainder of the match, Mold bowled from Phillips' end without censure; Phillips believed he had made his point. The other umpire took no action at any point in the match. The crowd at the game protested noisily against Phillips, for a time shouting \\"no-ball\\" as every ball was bowled, and making comments about him. According to Wisden, Phillips' actions caused \\"a great sensation ... The incident naturally gave rise to much excitement, and for the next few days nothing else was talked about in the cricket world.\\" At the conclusion of the match, Mitchell and Kenyon, a film-making company based in Blackburn, filmed the players leaving the field and took footage of Mold bowling in the nets to Hornby.Ambrose, p. 31. on the BFI Films channel Phillips received criticism for his actions and Mold had some support in the press. Mold's Times obituary noted: \\"Mold did not lack defenders, but those who argued that he was, and always had been, a perfectly fair bowler, had a very bad case. The weight of expert evidence was overwhelmingly against them.\\" =Aftermath= In December 1901, the MCC approved the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet to discuss the fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned for at least a season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack in the interests of the spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: \\"Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it seemed impossible to get rid.\\" After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952. =Final years and death= Mold c. 1900 Mold played another three matches in 1901 without being no-balled for throwing, but his reputation was ruined and he retired at the end of the season, although Lancashire had offered him a new contract. In this final season, he took 59 wickets at 19.35. In his career as a whole, he took 1,673 first-class wickets at an average of 15.54. In 2012, he is 57th on the list of leading first-class wicket-takers; among those whose careers were contemporaneous with or preceded Mold's, he is placed 19th. Subsequently, Mold returned to play for Northamptonshire in 1903, and played league cricket in his native county, although he struggled with increasing weight in his later years. In his retirement, he became the landlord of a public house in Middleton Cheney, the village in which he was born.Ambrose, p. 32. He took up shooting as a hobby and looked after his ailing mother. After a long illness, he died on 29 April 1921 in Middleton Cheney. The memorial on his gravestone states: \\"This stone was erected by his old cricketing friends as a token of their affection, admiration and respect\\". It was paid for by a subscription opened by the Lancashire Committee. Bowling technique Mold delivering the ball c. 1897 A fast bowler who operated from a very short run- up, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through seam movement or cutting his fingers over it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that he was among the fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was \\"beautiful\\" and possessed \\"fine grace\\". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: \\"On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [pitch] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen.\\" The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest. Opinion was divided over the legality of Mold's bowling action. After no-balling Mold for the second time, Phillips wrote that he had long suspected Mold of throwing. Even though he believed Mold was trying to bowl with a straight arm in the Somerset match, Phillips considered many more deliveries to be throws than merely those he called. In his own defence, Mold queried why Phillips never acted on his prior suspicions, and suggested that the umpire did not make it clear which part of Mold's bowling action was unfair. The Manchester Guardian, reporting on the Somerset match in 1901, noted that many umpires had apparently viewed Mold's action as fair earlier in the season, even after the instruction from the MCC to pay careful attention to him. It stated that \\"the general opinion was that if one ball was to be called a throw then every ball he sent down was of the same order.\\" However, some critics noted that when bowling an occasional faster ball, Mold's action changed slightly; this was the delivery to which Phillips objected. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that the lack of action by umpires other than Phillips in 1901, and throughout Mold's career, meant that the \\"charge against Mold, then, can hardly be said to have been 'proven. Mold continued to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, it would have been a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.Ambrose, pp. 30–31. Mold was popular with other cricketers. The Times said: \\"Apart from the burning question of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played.\\" However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no- balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: \\"If he is fair he is the best bowler in England, but I think he is a worse thrower than ever Crossland [the Lancashire bowler of the 1880s with a suspect bowling action] was.\\" Mold's Times obituary stated: \\"He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology\\".

Heineman first attended the University of Michigan (1930-1933), and later attended Northwestern's school of law. He first gained attention in the railroad industry in 1954, when he orchestrated a successful proxy battle for control of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. He became president of the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW) in 1956, leading the railroad through a series of difficult cost-cutting measures that returned the railroad to solvency. One of the measures he instituted was to sell shares in the railroad to the railroad's own employees, prompting the \\"Employee Owned\\" inscription in the railroad's logo. This process was consummated in 1972, at which time Larry Provo succeeded Heineman as president of the company. Heineman remained in charge of the holding company Northwest Industries (owner of Fruit of the Loom, Acme Boots, and Velsicol Chemical Corporation) until 1985. Heineman is noted in the history of Chicago, Illinois, for replacing all the steam locomotives which brought passenger trains into North Western Station with diesel locomotives, in one day in 1956, in response to a complaint by Mayor Richard J. Daley about smoke and fumes emanating from the station. Heineman also replaced the North Western's entire passenger rolling stock used for commuter services with double deck \\"commuter streamliners\\". Heineman served in various governmental roles in World War Two and was active in politics, working as a speechwriter for Adlai Stevenson in 1952, Chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights during the administration of Lyndon Johnson and Chairman of the Illinois Board of Higher Education. Heineman turned down several offers from President Johnson to serve in high-ranking positions including Budget Director and UN Ambassador, but remained an informal advisor.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/business/ben-heineman-railroad- executive-and-johnson-adviser-dies-at-98.html?pagewanted=all References * Chicago and North Western Historical Society, Chicago & North Western - A Capsule History.

There are three types of protection within the section: the right to life, liberty and security of the person. Denials of these rights are constitutional only if the denials do not breach what is referred to as fundamental justice. This Charter provision provides both substantive and procedural rights.Suresh v Canada It has broad application beyond merely protecting due process in administrative proceedings and in the adjudicative context, and has in certain circumstances touched upon major national policy issues such as entitlement to social assistanceGosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General) and public health care.Chaoulli v Quebec (AG) As such, it has proven to be a controversial provision in the Charter. Text Under the heading of \\"Legal Rights\\", the section states: Application The wording of section 7 says that it applies to \\"everyone\\". This includes all people within Canada, including non-citizens.Singh v Canada and Suresh v. Canada It does not, however, apply to corporations.Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (AG) Section 7 rights can also be violated by the conduct of a party other than a Canadian government body. The government need only be a participant or complicit in the conduct threatening the right, where the violation must be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the government actions.United States v Burns Section 7 has not been interpreted to convey positive rights nor has it been interpreted to impose any positive obligations upon the government. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has not ruled out these alternatives.Gosselin v Quebec (AG) Life First, there is the right to life, which stands generally as the basic right to be alive. Life has been thoroughly discussed by the Supreme Court in the 1993 case Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG). In that case, the Court denied that the section 7 right to bodily control could trump the right to life and thereby justify assisted suicide. As the Court wrote, it was a common societal belief that \\"human life is sacred or inviolable\\", and therefore security of the person itself could not include a right to suicide; suicide would destroy life and thus be inherently harmful. However, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin has unanimously reversed this decision in Carter v Canada (AG). The Criminal Code provision imposing a blanket ban on assisted suicide was struck down for overbreadth, as it also impacted those with the capacity to provide legitimate consent. Bill C-14 was passed in June 2016 in response to this decision. Liberty Secondly, there is the right to liberty, which protects an individual's freedom to act without physical restraint (i.e., imprisonment would be inconsistent with liberty unless it is consistent with fundamental justice). However, the right has been extended to include the power to make important personal choices. The court described it as \\"[touching] the core of what it means to be an autonomous human being blessed with dignity and independence in matters that can be characterized as fundamentally or inherently personal\\". (R v Clay, 2003) That is, the concept extends beyond physical restraint by the government as it goes to the core of the human experience. The right to choice is probably an individual right only, as opposed to also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are between you and the government and not between you and a member of your family. In the 1995 Supreme Court decision B (R) v Children’s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment for their child on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. This argument drew from American case law, but the Supreme Court pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the family situation, the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions had a right to strike as part of the members' liberty. The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system. Various liberties not covered by the section 7 right to liberty include religious liberty and liberty of speech, because these are more specifically guaranteed under section 2, the liberty to vote, as this is more specifically guaranteed by section 3, and the liberty to move within, leave and enter Canada, as this is more specifically guaranteed by section 6.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 980. Security of the person Henry Morgentaler, right, successfully challenged abortion law as a breach of security of person in R v Morgentaler (1988). Third, there is the right to security of the person, which consists of rights to privacy of the body and its healthHogg, 981. and of the right protecting the \\"psychological integrity\\" of an individual. That is, the right protects against significant government-inflicted harm (stress) to the mental state of the individual. (Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000) This right has generated significant case law, as abortion in Canada was legalized in R v Morgentaler (1988) after the Supreme Court found the Therapeutic Abortion Committees breached women's security of person by threatening their health. Some judges also felt control of the body was a right within security of the person, breached by the abortion law. However, in R v Levkovic, 2013 SCC 25, the Supreme Court found that \\"security of the person\\" could not be used to justify a mother's failure to report a stillbirth. In Operation Dismantle v The Queen (1985), cruise missile testing was unsuccessfully challenged as violating security of the person for risking nuclear war. In Chaoulli v Quebec (AG) (2005), the majority of Supreme Court justices declared Quebec's ban on private health care to breach security of the person, since delays in medical treatment can result in serious physical pain, or even death. Some people feel economic rights ought to be read into security of the person, as well as section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a liveable environment.Lugtig, Sarah and Debra Parkes, \\"Where do we go from here?\\" Herizons, Spring 2002, Vol. 15 Issue 4, page 14. There has also been discussion within the Supreme Court and among academics as to whether security of the person guarantees some economic rights. While some people feel economic rights ought to be included, jurisprudence in this area appears not to support this view. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that, \\"The ability to generate business revenue by one's chosen means is not a right that is protected under s. 7 of the Charter.\\"Siemens v Manitoba (AG), 2003 SCC 3, at para 47. In 2004, Blair JA, writing for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Mussani v College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario noted that \\"the weight of authority is that there is no constitutional right to practise a profession unfettered by the applicable rules which and standards which regulate that profession\\", before going on to conclude that the revocation of Mr. Mussani's licence to practice medicine did not deprive him of life, liberty or the security of his person.Mussani v College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (2004), 74 OR (3d) 1 at para 42. The courts have also held that \\"salary or compensation (in whatever form they may take), are in my view a purely economic right, and are not protected by section 7\\".Clitheroe v Hydro One Inc (2009), 96 OR (3d) 203 at para 77 (SC), aff'd 2010 ONCA 458, leave to appeal ref'd [2010] SCCA No 316. Theoretically, security of the person would be breached if the government limits a person's ability to make an income, by denying welfare, taking away property essential to one's profession, or denying licenses. However, section 7 is primarily concerned with legal rights, so this reading of economic rights is questionable. Many economic issues could also be political questions.Hogg, 983. Principles of fundamental justice All three rights may be compromised in the cases where the infringing law is in \\"accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\\". That is, there are core values within the justice system that must prevail over these rights for the greater good of society. These include natural justice and since the 1985 Supreme Court decision Re BC Motor Vehicle Act they also include substantive guarantees, including rights guaranteed by the other legal rights in the Charter (i.e., rights against unreasonable search and seizure, guaranteed under section 8, and against cruel and unusual punishments, under section 12, are part of fundamental justice under section 7 as well). Other \\"Principles\\" are determined by the court and form the basis of the Canadian legal system. > it must be a legal principle about which there is sufficient societal > consensus that it is fundamental to the way in which the legal system should > fairly operate, and it must be identified with sufficient precision to yield > a manageable standard against which to measure deprivations of life, > liberty, or security of the person. (R v Malmo-Levine, 2003) The following are some of the well established Principles of Fundamental Justice. =Arbitrariness= It is a principle of fundamental justice that laws should not be arbitrary. (R v Malmo-Levine) That is, the state may not limit an individual's rights where \\"it bears no relation to, or is inconsistent with, the objective that lies behind [it]\\". (Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG)) =Vagueness= The \\"Principles of Fundamental Justice\\" require laws to have a clear and understandable interpretation so as to properly define the rule or offence. A law is unconstitutionally vague if it does not have clarity enough to create \\"legal debate\\". There must be clarity of purpose, subject matter, nature, prior judicial interpretation, societal values, and related provisions. This does not prevent the use of broadly defined terms so long as societal objectives can be gleaned from it. (Ontario v Canadian Pacific Ltd, 1995) In R v Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, for example, a statute which made it illegal to \\"unduly\\" prevent or lessen competition was upheld. Although the wording was undeniably open-ended and uncertain, the concept of undue interference with competition was deemed sufficient to enable legal debate on the subject. =Overbreadth= The \\"Principles of Fundamental Justice\\" require that means used to achieve a societal purpose or objective must be reasonably necessary. \\"Overbreadth analysis looks at the means chosen by the state in relation to its purpose. If the State, in pursuing a legitimate objective, uses means which are broader than is necessary to accomplish that objective, the principles of fundamental justice will be violated because the individual's rights will have been limited for no reason.\\" (R v Heywood at para 49) =Gross disproportionality= Gross disproportionality describes state actions or legislative responses to a problem that are so extreme as to be disproportionate to any legitimate government interest (R v Malmo-Levine at para 143) =Requirement of mens rea= The principles of fundamental justice require that criminal offences that have sentences involving prison must have a mens rea element. (Re BC Motor Vehicle Act, R v Vaillancourt) For more serious crimes such as murder that impose a stigma as part of the conviction, the mental element must be proven on a \\"subjective\\" level. (R v Martineau) Where an individual is criminally charged under an exceptionally complex or difficult to understand statute (such as the Income Tax Act), a mistaken interpretation of the law may serve to negate the requisite mens rea. =Shocks the conscience= In Canada v Schmidt (1987), the Supreme Court found that government decisions to extradite people are bound by section 7. Moreover, it is possible that a potential punishment in the receiving country \\"shocks the conscience\\" to the extent that the Canadian government would breach fundamental justice if they extradited people there, and thus put them at risk of something shocking. In determining what would shock the conscience, the Court said some elements of fundamental justice in Canada, such as the presumption of innocence, could be seen as \\"finicky\\" and thus irrelevant to extradition. In contrast, the possibility of torture would be shocking. =Right to make full answer and defence= Anyone accused of a criminal charge has the right to know the case against them and put forward a defence. In addition to being a principle of fundamental justice, this right is also protected by the right to a fair trial under section 11(d) of the Charter. \\"Full answer and defence\\" encompasses a number of things, including the right to counsel (also see section 10), the right to examine witnesses, and most importantly, the right to full disclosure by the Crown (see R v Stinchcombe, 1991). =Right to silence= In R v Hebert the court held that the right to silence was a principle of fundamental justice. Statements of the accused may not be achieved through police trickery and silence may not be used to make any inference of guilt. =Moral culpability for youths= In R v DB, 2008 SCC 25, the Court held that \\"young people are entitled to a presumption of diminished moral culpability\\"R v DB at para 70 and so the Youth Criminal Justice Act may not create a presumption of an adult sentence upon youths. =Court-appointed Counsel= In R v Rowbotham, 1988 CanLII 147 (ON CA), the Ontario Court of Appeal found that section 7 requires the appointment of counsel for an accused facing a serious criminal charge who is not capable of representing himself and not financially able to retain counsel. =Moral involuntariness= In R v Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, the Court held that as a principle of fundamental justice, a person may not be found guilty of a criminal offence where the person faces \\"perilous circumstances\\" and is \\"deprived of a realistic choice whether to break the law.\\" The Court affirmed moral involuntariness as a principle of fundamental justice in R v Ryan, 2013 SCC 3. =Rejected principles= Throughout the development of fundamental justice, petitioners have suggested many principles that the Courts have rejected for not being sufficiently fundamental to justice. In R v Malmo- Levine, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that an element of \\"harm\\" was a required component of all criminal offences, which in the circumstances of the case would have removed marijuana offences from the Canadian Criminal Code. In R v DeSousa, the Court had rejected the claim that there must be symmetry between all actus reus and mens rea elements. In Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v Canada (AG), the Court rejected the claim that laws affecting children must be in their best interests. Comparison with other human rights instruments The United States Bill of Rights also contains rights to life and liberty under the Fifth Amendment and the United States Constitution guarantees those rights again under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Canada before the Charter, the Canadian Bill of Rights contained rights to life, liberty and security of the person, but all these other laws limit those rights through due process rather than fundamental justice. Fundamental justice is read more substantively.Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed., pages 732–733. Another key difference is that the Fifth and Fourteenth US Amendments add the right to property, and the Canadian Bill adds the right to \\"enjoyment of property.\\" The fact that section 7 excludes a right contained in its sister laws is taken as significant, and thus rights to property are not even read into the rights to liberty and security of the person.Hogg, 983-984. There have been calls for section 7 to protect property. In 1981 the Progressive Conservative Party suggested that section 7 be extended to protect the \\"enjoyment of property.\\" Some provincial governments, including that of Prince Edward Island, as well as the New Democratic Party, opposed the change. The NDP thought that if property rights were enshrined in the Charter, other economic rights should be added. In September 1982, after the Charter had been enacted, the government of British Columbia approved of an unsuccessful amendment to section 7 that would protect property rights.David Johansen, \\"PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION,\\" Library of Parliament (Canada), Law and Government Division, October 1991.

The word is a portmanteau, coming from probability + unit.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed. s.v. probit (article dated June 2007): The purpose of the model is to estimate the probability that an observation with particular characteristics will fall into a specific one of the categories; moreover, classifying observations based on their predicted probabilities is a type of binary classification model. A probit model is a popular specification for a binary response model. As such it treats the same set of problems as does logistic regression using similar techniques. When viewed in the generalized linear model framework, the probit model employs a probit link function. It is most often estimated using the maximum likelihood procedure, such an estimation being called a probit regression. Conceptual framework Suppose a response variable Y is binary, that is it can have only two possible outcomes which we will denote as 1 and 0. For example, Y may represent presence/absence of a certain condition, success/failure of some device, answer yes/no on a survey, etc. We also have a vector of regressors X, which are assumed to influence the outcome Y. Specifically, we assume that the model takes the form : \\\\Pr(Y=1 \\\\mid X) = \\\\Phi(X^T\\\\beta), where Pr denotes probability, and Φ is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. The parameters β are typically estimated by maximum likelihood. It is possible to motivate the probit model as a latent variable model. Suppose there exists an auxiliary random variable : Y^\\\\ast = X^T\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon, where ε ~ N(0, 1). Then Y can be viewed as an indicator for whether this latent variable is positive: : Y = \\\\left.\\\\begin{cases} 1 & Y^* > 0  0 &\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left.\\\\begin{cases} 1 & X^T\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon > 0  0 &\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} The use of the standard normal distribution causes no loss of generality compared with the use of a normal distribution with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation, because adding a fixed amount to the mean can be compensated by subtracting the same amount from the intercept, and multiplying the standard deviation by a fixed amount can be compensated by multiplying the weights by the same amount. To see that the two models are equivalent, note that : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\Pr(Y = 1 \\\\mid X)  = {} & \\\\Pr(Y^\\\\ast > 0)  = {} & \\\\Pr(X^T\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon > 0)  = {} & \\\\Pr(\\\\varepsilon > -X^T\\\\beta)  = {} & \\\\Pr(\\\\varepsilon < X^T\\\\beta) & \\\\text{by symmetry of the normal distribution} = {} & \\\\Phi(X^T\\\\beta) \\\\end{align} Model estimation =Maximum likelihood estimation= Suppose data set \\\\\\\\{y_i,x_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n contains n independent statistical units corresponding to the model above. For the single observation, conditional on the vector of inputs of that observation, we have: :Pr(y_i=1x_i)= \\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta) :Pr(y_i=0x_i)= 1-\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta) where x_i is a vector of K \\\\times 1 inputs, and \\\\beta is a K \\\\times 1 vector of coefficients. The likelihood of a single observation (y_i, x_i) is then :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\beta; y_i, x_i) = \\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta)^{y_i} [1-\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta)]^{(1-y_i)} In fact, if y_i=1, then \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\beta; y_i, x_i) = \\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta), and if y_i=0, then \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\beta; y_i, x_i) = 1-\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta). Since the observations are independent and identically distributed, then the likelihood of the entire sample, or the _joint likelihood_ , will be equal to the product of the likelihoods of the single observations: :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\beta; Y, X) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\left( \\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta)^{y_i} [1-\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta)]^{(1-y_i)} \\\\right) The joint log-likelihood function is thus : \\\\ln\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\beta; Y, X) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\bigg( y_i\\\\ln\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta) + (1-y_i)\\\\ln\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(1-\\\\Phi(x_i'\\\\beta)\\\\big) \\\\bigg) The estimator \\\\hat\\\\beta which maximizes this function will be consistent, asymptotically normal and efficient provided that E[XX'] exists and is not singular. It can be shown that this log-likelihood function is globally concave in β, and therefore standard numerical algorithms for optimization will converge rapidly to the unique maximum. Asymptotic distribution for \\\\hat\\\\beta is given by : \\\\sqrt{n}(\\\\hat\\\\beta - \\\\beta)\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{d}\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(0,\\\\,\\\\Omega^{-1}), where : \\\\Omega = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\bigg[ \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^2(X'\\\\beta)}{\\\\Phi(X'\\\\beta)(1-\\\\Phi(X'\\\\beta))}XX' \\\\bigg], \\\\qquad \\\\hat\\\\Omega = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^2(x'_i\\\\hat\\\\beta)}{\\\\Phi(x'_i\\\\hat\\\\beta)(1-\\\\Phi(x'_i\\\\hat\\\\beta))}x_ix'_i, and \\\\varphi=\\\\Phi' is the Probability Density Function (PDF) of standard normal distribution. Semi-parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood methods for probit-type and other related models are also available. =Berkson's minimum chi-square method= This method can be applied only when there are many observations of response variable y_i having the same value of the vector of regressors x_i (such situation may be referred to as \\"many observations per cell\\"). More specifically, the model can be formulated as follows. Suppose among n observations \\\\\\\\{y_i,x_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n there are only T distinct values of the regressors, which can be denoted as \\\\\\\\{x_{(1)},\\\\ldots,x_{(T)}\\\\\\\\}. Let n_t be the number of observations with x_i=x_{(t)}, and r_t the number of such observations with y_i=1. We assume that there are indeed \\"many\\" observations per each \\"cell\\": for each t, \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} n_t/n = c_t > 0 . Denote : \\\\hat{p}_t = r_t/n_t : \\\\hat\\\\sigma_t^2 = \\\\frac{1}{n_t} \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}_t(1-\\\\hat{p}_t)}{\\\\varphi^2\\\\big(\\\\Phi^{-1}(\\\\hat{p}_t)\\\\big)} Then Berkson's minimum chi-square estimator is a generalized least squares estimator in a regression of \\\\Phi^{-1}(\\\\hat{p}_t) on x_{(t)} with weights \\\\hat\\\\sigma_t^{-2}: : \\\\hat\\\\beta = \\\\Bigg( \\\\sum_{t=1}^T \\\\hat\\\\sigma_t^{-2}x_{(t)}x'_{(t)} \\\\Bigg)^{-1} \\\\sum_{t=1}^T \\\\hat\\\\sigma_t^{-2}x_{(t)}\\\\Phi^{-1}(\\\\hat{p}_t) It can be shown that this estimator is consistent (as n→∞ and T fixed), asymptotically normal and efficient. Its advantage is the presence of a closed-form formula for the estimator. However, it is only meaningful to carry out this analysis when individual observations are not available, only their aggregated counts r_t, n_t, and x_{(t)} (for example in the analysis of voting behavior). =Gibbs sampling= Gibbs sampling of a probit model is possible because regression models typically use normal prior distributions over the weights, and this distribution is conjugate with the normal distribution of the errors (and hence of the latent variables Y*). The model can be described as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta & \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{b}_0, \\\\mathbf{B}_0) \\\\[3pt] y_i^\\\\ast\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta & \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{x}'_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta, 1) \\\\[3pt] y_i & = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } y_i^\\\\ast > 0  0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} From this, we can determine the full conditional densities needed: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{B} &= (\\\\mathbf{B}_0^{-1} + \\\\mathbf{X}'\\\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\\\[3pt] \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{y}^\\\\ast &\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{B}(\\\\mathbf{B}_0^{-1}\\\\mathbf{b}_0 + \\\\mathbf{X}'\\\\mathbf{y}^\\\\ast), \\\\mathbf{B}) \\\\[3pt] y_i^\\\\ast\\\\mid y_i=0,\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta &\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{x}'_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta, 1)[y_i^\\\\ast < 0] \\\\[3pt] y_i^\\\\ast\\\\mid y_i=1,\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta &\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{x}'_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta, 1)[y_i^\\\\ast \\\\ge 0] \\\\end{align} The result for β is given in the article on Bayesian linear regression, although specified with different notation. The only trickiness is in the last two equations. The notation [y_i^\\\\ast < 0] is the Iverson bracket, sometimes written \\\\mathcal{I}(y_i^\\\\ast < 0) or similar. It indicates that the distribution must be truncated within the given range, and rescaled appropriately. In this particular case, a truncated normal distribution arises. Sampling from this distribution depends on how much is truncated. If a large fraction of the original mass remains, sampling can be easily done with rejection sampling—simply sample a number from the non-truncated distribution, and reject it if it falls outside the restriction imposed by the truncation. If sampling from only a small fraction of the original mass, however (e.g. if sampling from one of the tails of the normal distribution—for example if \\\\mathbf{x}'_i\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta is around 3 or more, and a negative sample is desired), then this will be inefficient and it becomes necessary to fall back on other sampling algorithms. General sampling from the truncated normal can be achieved using approximations to the normal CDF and the probit function, and R has a function \`rtnorm()\` for generating truncated-normal samples. Model evaluation The suitability of an estimated binary model can be evaluated by counting the number of true observations equaling 1, and the number equaling zero, for which the model assigns a correct predicted classification by treating any estimated probability above 1/2 (or, below 1/2), as an assignment of a prediction of 1 (or, of 0). See for details. Performance under misspecification Consider the latent variable model formulation of the probit model. When the variance of \\\\varepsilon conditional on x is not constant but dependent on x, then the heteroscedasticity issue arises. For example, suppose y^*= \\\\beta_0+B_1 x_1+\\\\varepsilon and \\\\varepsilon\\\\mid x \\\\sim N (0,x^2_1) where x_1 is a continuous positive explanatory variable. Under heteroskedasticity, the probit estimator for \\\\beta is usually inconsistent, and most of the tests about the coefficients are invalid. More importantly, the estimator for P (y=1\\\\mid x) becomes inconsistent, too. To deal with this problem, the original model needs to be transformed to be homoskedastic. For instance, in the same example, 1[\\\\beta_0+\\\\beta_1 x_1+\\\\varepsilon>0] can be rewritten as 1[\\\\beta_0/x_1+\\\\beta_1+\\\\varepsilon/x_1>0], where \\\\varepsilon/x_1\\\\mid x\\\\sim N(0,1). Therefore, P(y=1\\\\mid x) = \\\\Phi (\\\\beta_1 + \\\\beta_0/x_1) and running probit on (1, 1/x_1) generates a consistent estimator for the conditional probability P(y=1\\\\mid x). When the assumption that \\\\varepsilon is normally distributed fails to hold, then a functional form misspecification issue arises: if the model is still estimated as a probit model, the estimators of the coefficients \\\\beta are inconsistent. For instance, if \\\\varepsilon follows a logistic distribution in the true model, but the model is estimated by probit, the estimates will be generally smaller than the true value. However, the inconsistency of the coefficient estimates is practically irrelevant because the estimates for the partial effects, \\\\partial P(y=1\\\\mid x)/\\\\partial x_{i'}, will be close to the estimates given by the true logit model.Greene, W. H. (2003), Econometric Analysis , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ. To avoid the issue of distribution misspecification, one may adopt a general distribution assumption for the error term, such that many different types of distribution can be included in the model. The cost is heavier computation and lower accuracy for the increase of the number of parameter.For more details, refer to: Cappé, O., Moulines, E. and Ryden, T. (2005): “Inference in Hidden Markov Models”, Springer-Verlag New York, Chapter 2. In most of the cases in practice where the distribution form is misspecified, the estimators for the coefficients are inconsistent, but estimators for the conditional probability and the partial effects are still very good. One can also take semi-parametric or non-parametric approaches, e.g., via local-likelihood or nonparametric quasi-likelihood methods, which avoid assumptions on a parametric form for the index function and is robust to the choice of the link function (e.g., probit or logit).  History  The probit model is usually credited to Chester Bliss, who coined the term \\"probit\\" in 1934, and to John Gaddum (1933), who systematized earlier work. However, the basic model dates to the Weber–Fechner law by Gustav Fechner, published in , and was repeatedly rediscovered until the 1930s; see and . A fast method for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the probit model was proposed by Ronald Fisher as an appendix to Bliss' work in 1935.

He was also the great-grandson of American patriot Richard Henry Lee, and grandfather of Governor of Maryland Blair Lee III. Lee was named after his maternal grandfather, Francis Preston Blair. Lee was born in Silver Spring, Maryland and attended the common schools in the area. He was the son of Samuel Phillips Lee and his wife, the former Elizabeth Blair. He graduated from Princeton University in 1880 and from the law department of Columbian (now George Washington) University in 1882. He was admitted to the bar of the District of Columbia and of Montgomery County, Maryland in 1883 and commenced practice in Maryland. Lee was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Fifty-fifth Congress in 1896. He was, however, elected to the Maryland State Senate, and served from 1905 to 1913. In 1911, Lee ran for the position of Governor of Maryland, but lost the Democratic nomination to Arthur Pue Gorman, Jr. (who lost to Republican candidate Phillips Lee Goldsborough). In 1915, he again ran for Governor and was defeated in the Democratic Primary by eventual winner Emerson Harrington. Following his defeat in the gubernatorial election, Lee was elected to the United States Senate in a special election on November 4, 1913, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of senator Isidor Rayner. Because the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had recently gone into effect, Lee became the second U.S. Senator directly elected by the people of a state under the Constitution's provisions (although other states had previously elected senators indirectly through popular elections, which were then ratified by the state legislature). He presented his credentials to serve as senator on December 5, 1913, but he did not qualify until January 28, 1914 because the incumbent in his seat, Republican William P. Jackson, claimed that \\"since he had been appointed under the original constitutional provision, he was entitled to hold his seat until the regularly scheduled adjournment date of the Maryland state assembly.\\"The Election Case of William P. Jackson v. Blair Lee of Maryland (1914) The Senate considered Jackson's challenge but eventually rejected it and seated Lee. While senator, Lee was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department, and a member of the Committee on Coast Defenses (Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses). He was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election in 1916, losing the Democratic nomination to David John Lewis (who went on to lose to Joseph I. France). Lee resumed the practice of law after he left the Senate. He died in Norwood, Maryland and is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Parmar moved to Canada in 1970. He became involved in activities of the banned terrorist organisation Babbar Khalsa and became its leader in Canada in 1979. His sect was called Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and was based in Vancouver, British Columbia, whereas Sukhdev Singh Babbar was the Chief of Babbar Khalsa in India. Parmar later became a naturalized Canadian citizen. In 1981 he was involved in the killing of 2 Punjab police officers and was arrested in 1983 in Germany. He was released after a year in prison in Germany and he went to Canada. The Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the bombing of Air India Flight 182 concluded that Talwinder Singh Parmar, although never convicted, was the leader of the conspiracy to bomb Air India flights in 1985. He was killed in a gun fight with Punjab Police on 15 October 1992; details of this incident are disputed. Early life Parmar was born in Panshta (Panchhat), Kapurthala, Punjab, India on 26 February 1944 . Parmar immigrated to Canada in 1970, and became a naturalized citizen of Canada. Militancy Parmar became involved in activities of the banned terrorist organisation Babbar Khalsa founded in 1978 and became its leader in Canada in 1979. =Murder of Punjab Police officers= On 19 November 1981 the Punjab Police was looking for Tarsem Singh Kalasinghian and his accomplices, when on the morning of 19 November 1981 an encounter took place at Daheru village in Ludhiana district in which Police Inspector Pritam Singh Bajwa and Constable Surat Singh of Jalandhar were gunned down. All of the militants hiding in a house of Amarjit Singh Nihang managed to escape. Among those named in the FIR were Wadhawa Singh (present chief of Babbar Khalsa now based in Pakistan), Talwinder Singh Parmar, Amarjit Singh Nihang, Amarjit Singh (Head Constable), Sewa Singh (Head Constable) and Gurnam Singh (Head Constable). This is believed to be the first act which gained Babar Khalsa and its chief Talwinder Singh Parmar notoriety. In 1982, India issued a warrant for Parmar's arrest for six charges of murder, stemming from the killing of police officers. In 1983, he was arrested in Germany on charges of murdering two police officers in Punjab in 1981. Parmar was released after a year in jail and he then returned to Canada. India requested for his extradition from Canada. The request was turned down, and Canada declined to extradite Parmar to India.Bell, Stewart. \\"Cold Terror\\", 2005 =Babbar Khalsa activities from Canada= During his residence in Canada, Parmar continued to lead BKI activities. He was involved in terror financing, recruitment and radicalization of sikh youths, procurement of small arms and explosives, and the development and coordination of terrorist attacks. Historically, to get the financial and material support needed for terrorist activities BKI has used in-person meetings, public rallies and fundraising events. Parmer organized and featured at Sikh rallies and fundraisers across Canada. Parmar was instrumental in channeling financial support to BKI from overseas Sikh communities. =Conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi= On 8 April 1985 he was wiretapped while he phoned a German man from his Canadian residence, and discussed whether it was feasible to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi. However, the recordings of the conversation were later erased by Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).Montreal Gazette, \\"Spy Agency erased talk of possible hit\\", 28 February Air India Flight 182 On 23 June 1985 BKI militants bombed Air India Flight 182 going from Montreal, Canada to New Delhi, India, over the Atlantic Ocean.

Parmar and Inderjit Singh Reyat were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on explosive charges, linking the two to the Air India Flight 182 bombing and 1985 Narita International Airport bombing. Parmar was acquitted of all charges. Inderjit Singh Reyat admitted to building the bomb, was convicted in the Air India bombing. Reyat a member of the ISYF, was found guilty of manslaughter for making the bombs and had to spend more than 20 years in prison at Canada, and is the only individual convicted in these attacks as of 9 Feb 2009.

He was killed in a gun fight with the Punjab police in 1992. Alleged confession to Punjab Police in 1992 In July 2007, the investigative magazine Tehelka reported that Parmar may have confessed to the Punjab police during interrogations preceding his death. He is accused of supplying the dynamite to Lakhbir Singh Rode, a nephew of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was claimed to have been the mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Tehelka reported that Parmar had been interrogated in India between 9 and 14 October 1992, by senior police officers, where he claimed that the Air India 182 blasts were instigated by Lakhbir Singh Rode. Retired Punjab Police DSP Harmail Singh Chandi, the key official behind Parmar's arrest at Jammu in September 1992 and his subsequent interrogation before he was killed, eventually came forward with audiotapes and statements from Parmar's confessions. Despite being ordered to destroy these records, he had apparently preserved them in secret. The confession involved Parmar's version of the plot, designed to draw attention away from his primary involvement: :\\"Around May 1985, a functionary of the International Sikh Youth Federation came to me and introduced himself as Lakhbir Singh and asked me for help in conducting some violent activities to express the resentment of the Sikhs. I told him to come after a few days so that I could arrange for dynamite and battery etc. He told me that he would first like to see a trial of the blast...After about four days, Lakhbir Singh and another youth, Inderjit Singh Reyat, both came to me. We went into the jungle (of British Columbia). There we joined a dynamite stick with a battery and triggered off a blast. Lakhbir and Inderjit, even at that time, had in their minds a plan to blast an aeroplane. I was not too keen on this plan but agreed to arrange for the dynamite sticks. Inderjit wanted to use for this purpose a transistor fitted with a battery.... That very day, they took dynamite sticks from me and left. :Then Lakhbir Singh, Inderjit Singh and their accomplice, Manjit Singh, made a plan to plant bombs in an Air India (AI) plane leaving from Toronto via London for Delhi and another flight that was to leave Tokyo for Bangkok. Lakhbir Singh got the seat booking done from Vancouver to Tokyo and then onwards to Bangkok, while Manjit Singh got it done from Vancouver to Toronto and then from Toronto to Delhi. Inderjit prepared the bags for the flights, which were loaded with dynamite bombs fitted with a battery and transistor. They decided that the suitcases will be booked but they themselves will not travel by the same flights although they will take the boarding passes. After preparing these bombs, the plan was ready for execution by June 21 or 22, 1985. However, the bomb to be kept in the flight from Tokyo to Delhi via Bangkok exploded at the Narita airport on the conveyor belt. The second suitcase that was loaded on the Toronto-Delhi ai flight exploded in the air.\\" - from alleged confession by Talwinder Singh Parmar After this interrogation, Parmar was killed in an exchange of fire between police and six militants in the early morning of October 15, 1992, near village Kang Arian in Phillaur sub-division. However, Tehelka claimed without any evidence that Parmar had been killed while in custody. Tehelka claimed there were discrepancies between the First Information Report (FIR) regarding the incident, and the post-mortem report. According to the FIR, Parmar was killed by AK-47 fire by SSP Satish K Sharma, firing from a rooftop, at 5:30 AM. The PMR shows that the line of fire of the three bullets are different, which is not possible if one person is firing from a fixed position. Also, the PMR says that the time of death was between 12am and 2am. The tapes and statements are claimed to have been handed over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the John Major Commission of Inquiry that is reinvestigating the Kanishka blast. This was made possible through the efforts of the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO), a Chandigarh-based NGO that conducted interviews of Parmar's associates and prepared a comprehensive report over seven years. However, information and subsequent investigation from Canadian authorities firmly established Parmar was in fact the architect of the Air India Flight 182 and Air India Flight 301 terrorist plot. Tehelka reports that \\"the PHRO's Principal Investigator Sarbjit Singh and lawyer Rajvinder Singh Bains flew to Canada along with Harmail in June and produced their findings before the Commission's counsels\\". Official inquiry spokesman Michael Tansey told The Globe and Mail: \\"We're aware of this article in Tehelka, and we will explore this and any other allegations when the hearings resume in the fall.\\" Meanwhile, Lakhbir Singh Rode, who is the head of the banned International Sikh Youth Federation, is now alleged to be living in Lahore.

Route 18-N's south end was at pre-1927 Route 10, now Route 5. In the 1927 renumbering, Route 18-N was kept, along with parts of pre-1927 Route 4, pre-1927 Route 5 and pre-1927 Route 8; a parallel road that is now County Route 501 was assigned the number Route 1. However, Route 1 was moved east to take over most of Route 18-N in 1929, and the southernmost part of 18N became Route S1A. Since the 1953 renumbering, that part of Route 1 has been only U.S. Route 9W and S1A has been Route 67.  Route description  Alpine State Highway Route 18-N was to begin at a current day intersection with County Route 505 (Port Imperial Boulevard) in Hoboken. Route 18-N progressed northward along County Route 505 until the intersection with New Jersey Route 5 in the community of Edgewater. The highway went northwestward along the alignment of Route 5 to where it met New Jersey Route 63 and turned northward along Route 63 through the Ridgefields and Palisades Park to Fort Lee, where it would meet current-day U.S. Route 9W. Route 18-N continued along the current-day abandoned alignment of U.S. Route 9W, where the highway passed along the cliffs of the Palisades until crossing the state line into New York near Alpine.  History  State Highway Route 18-N was first designated in the 1923 Annual Report on Public Roads as running from the city of Hoboken northward through several communities in Bergen and Hudson County to the New York state line at Alpine. The highway was an addition to the original system designed by the New Jersey Commissioner of Public Roads in 1916, which started with thirteen state highway highways. The portion from Hoboken to Fort Lee was never officially taken over by the New Jersey State Highway Department, as when the 1927 state highway renumbering occurred, the alignment of Route 18-N south of Fort Lee had already wiped,Route No. 18 - NORTH Alpine to New York State Line, to be under construction. This road, when built, will connect with the famous Hendrick Hudson Drive. but the designation was retained from the Fort Lee to the state line in Alpine. Route 18-N was one of four -N suffixes retained in the 1927 renumbering,State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. however, Route 18-N was the first to be eliminated, when the new New Jersey Route 1 was realigned onto Route 18-N in a minor change in 1929.ROUTE NO. 1. Alpine to Bayonne. Beginning at the New York state line on state highway route heretofore designated as Route No. 18--north in Alpine and terminating in Bayonne, by way of Alpine, Tenafly, Fort Lee and Ridgefield, in Bergen county, North Bergen, Jersey City and Bayonne, in Hudson county.

It existed from 1949 to 1998. It gained prominence during the government of Col. Jacobo Arbenz. It was one of the main forces of opposition to the various regimes that followed Arbenz's overthrow and became a constituent of the URNG guerrilla coalition during the later phase of the country's Civil War.  First Congress  The party, then under the name Communist Party of Guatemala (Partido Comunista de Guatemala) held its constituent first congress on September 28, 1949. It was founded by the Guatemalan Democratic Vanguard, which had functioned as a fraction within the ruling Revolutionary Action Party for two years. José Manuel Fortuny had been the leader of VDG, and now became general secretary of PCG. At the time of the congress of the party, its membership stood at 43. An earlier Communist Party of Guatemala had been founded in 1922, but was suppressed in 1932. In June 1950 PCG started publishing a weekly newspaper, Octubre, which was distributed amongst workers, peasants and intellectuals throughout the country. In the summer of 1950 a section of the party, led by trade union leader Víctor Manuel Gutiérrez, broke away and formed a separate party, the Guatemalan Revolutionary Workers Party (PROG). PROG made its first public appearance on July 1. The split had been provoked by differences of opinions concerning the social composition of the Central Committee of the party.  Second Congress  On February 2, 1952 PROG was dissolved and its members returned to PCG. The 2nd congress of PCG, held the same year, elected Gutiérrez as a Central Committee member. The congress also decided to adopt the name PGT, a move which was intended to facilitate legalization of the party. A 1945 legislation banned \\"international organizations\\" from working in Guatemala, a legislation used to maintain the illegality of any communist organization. By changing the name to PGT the party wanted to state that it was an independent and national party. At the same time, communists came to use the similar names abroad. One prominent example is the Swiss Party of Labour. However, Although communism had not been officially legalized until the inauguration of reformist President Col. Jacobo Arbenz, the party had participated in political activities more or less openly; some avowed communists were employed in high- level positions in the civil service and educational bureaucracy. The PGT program tended to emphasize participation in the trade unions and direct action rather than electoral politics, though at one point there were four PGT members in the 58-seat parliament in the period of 1953-1954. The four PGT MPs were José Alberto Cardoza, Victor Manuel Gutiérrez, Carlos Manuel Pellecer and Antonio Ardón. The PGT was generally supportive of the reform efforts launched by Juan José Arévalo and Col. Arbenz after the overthrow of right-wing military dictator Gen. Jorge Ubico in 1944. Because of this, the governments and press in Western countries (especially the United States) attempted to gather support for an economic or military intervention to halt the 'Communist threat'. A CIA intelligence estimate in 1952 reported that the PGT had a membership of about five hundred and an undetermined number of sympathizers. Later estimates raised the membership total to 3,000, including a group of five hundred described as 'hard-core'. The PGT publication Octubre had a circulation of about 3,000 in 1952. American intelligence briefings and post reports conceded that the PGT did not have sufficient popular backing or resources to foment a coup or revolution. On August 2, 1953 Octubre was substituted by Tribuna Popular as the party organ. The land reform initiatives implemented by the Arbenz government attracted more foreign attention to Guatemala's political scene. About 100,000 landless peasants were to benefit from the expropriation of unused arable land from landed interests (such as the U.S.-based United Fruit Company). The plan was never fully executed, as the Arbenz government fell in a U.S.-sponsored coup d'état on 29 June 1954; the government offered no significant resistance. The first decree issued by the new military régime banned the PGT. Following the ban a section of the party, including Fortuny, went into exile in Mexico where they continued to operate politically. Inside Guatemala, PGT was largely marginalized.  Third Congress  In the underground, PGT was radicalized. The 3rd party congress proclaimed the importance of \\"all forms of struggle\\", meaning that armed struggle was justified against the regime. This marked a shift of policy, as the party until then had worked under the banner of \\"democratic restoration\\". In April 1961 the party had adopted a document titled \\"General Tactics, development and forms of struggle of the Guatemalan revolution\\", which mentioned armed struggle as one of different kind of struggle to be utilized. The party rallied survivors of the failed November 13, 1960 military insurrection and student radicals into forming a guerilla movement, the Rebel Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes, FAR) in 1962. FAR initiated attacks against the government military, the beginning of a four decade long civil war. Meanwhile, the relation of the party towards the armed struggle was not uncomplicated. In theory the armed forces of FAR stood under the political control of PGT. In practice, that was not always the case. FAR developed its own political leadership and started criticizing the PGT leadership for indifference towards the armed struggle. Within the party Ricardo Ramírez led the radical section. PGT suffered a setback in early March 1966, as raids were conducted against the party leadership. Thirty-three left-wing leaders 'disappeared', including Víctor Manuel Gutiérrez and Leonardo Castillo Flores. CIA documents, declassified in 1998, confirmed that they had been executed by the state forces.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB11/docs/02-01.htm In the mid 1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 1300.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122. The 1966 presidential elections highlighted differences within the party. After much discussions the party decided to support the candidature of Julio César Méndez, claiming that he represented progressive and democratic sectors. At the same time the party maintained its support to the ongoing armed struggle. After Méndez had been elected he continued the anti-communist path of his predecessors, leading to accusations within PGT that the party leadership had adopted an incorrect line ahead of the elections. Some analysts claim that the killings of leaders of the older and more moderate generation within PGT, like Gutiérrez and Castillo, effectively closed the openings towards a peaceful settlement of the emerging civil war and emboldened the younger generation to take the more radical path. In 1968 FAR broke its bond with PGT, reconstituting itself as the Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, FAR II). FAR was able to win over a large section of the youths and students from PGT, resulting in a severe setback for the party amongst those sections. Whereas the main difference between the PGT leadership and the young radicals of FAR concern the line towards the armed struggle, there were also other issues of diverging views. A crucial issue was to consider the poverty of the majority of Guatemalans only as an issue of class, or whether the indigenous populations were subjected to racist oppression. PGT maintained an orthodox marxist understanding, that the poverty of the indigenous peoples were an issue of class and that the solution to their problems was to be handled within the framework of class struggle. The emerging guevarist leftist groups, however, developed an understanding that the indigenous peoples suffered from forms of oppression that could not only be explained as issues of class. These differences would remain during years to come, and has resurfaced even after the consolidation of URNG as a unified political party.  Fourth Congress  PGT held its fourth congress on December 20–22, 1969. The congress, held in complete clandestinity, adopted the policy of 'Revolutionary People's War'. At this time its base of operations was concentrated to Guatemala City and the southern coast of the country. The party carried out some armed attacks. The party had a brief rapprochement with FAR, that broke down due to political differences. The party suffered heavily from government repression. On September 26, 1972 state forces captured Bernardo Alvarado, PGT general secretary, Mario Silva Jonama, Central Committee Secretary of PGT, Carlos René Valle y Valle, Carlos Alvarado Jerez, Hugo Barrios Klee and Miguel Angel Hernández, PGT Central Committee members, Fantina Rodríguez, party member, and the domestic worker Natividad Franco Santos, in a raid in Guatemala City. The following day the president Carlos Arana ordered their execution and that the bodies of the executed be dumped into the sea. On December 21, 1974 the body of the party general secretary, Huberto Alvarado Arellano, was found. He had been subjected to torture and killed. In total, during the period of 1972–1983, two PGT general secretaries and nineteen Central Committee members were 'disappeared' and killed. In spite of the harsh repression, PGT was able to consolidate its political strength. By the midst of the 1970s, it had reactivated its Northern, Central, Western and Eastern Regional Committees. After Alvarado's death, Ricardo Rosales (whose nom de guerre in PGT was Carlos González) was appointed interim general secretary. He was given the task to organize a 5th party congress. Moreover, the party reactivated the dormant Military Commission of the Central Committee. The party gained political presence in the trade union movement through the Federación Autónoma Sindical de Guatemala (FASGUA) and JPT was one of the forces working with the Association of University Students (AEU).  Fragmentation  However, PGT failed to maintain its unity for long. On May 29, 1978 a massacre occurred in Panzós. Following the massacre massive protests erupted in Guatemala City. These happenings contributed to another wave of radicalization amongst the left-wing in Guatemala, which would divide PGT. On June 11 the Military Commission ('Comil') of PGT carried out a bomb attack in retaliation of the Panzós massacre against the Mobile Police in the northern region, in which 25 policemen were killed. However, the Political Commission of the Central Committee of the party denied PGT involvement in the attack. The line of the party leadership was that actions like that were bound to produce a government response of increasing state repression. Now some sections of PGT claimed that the party had an ambiguous relation to the ongoing armed struggle. The dissidents rallied around a Núcleo de Dirección y Conducción de la lucha interna, in which Central Committee and Comil members participated. Soon the party was split in two. The dissident faction broke away forming the National Directing Nucleus of PGT (Nucleo de Dirección Nacional del PGT). PGT-NDN was more militant and initiated coordination with FAR and EGP. The remaining group which was led by Ricardo Rosales, which was sometimes referred to as PGT- Central Committee, maintained its role as the official Guatemalan party in the world communist movement. PGT-NDN won over the South-East Regional Committee, a part of the Southern Regional Committee and a part of the Alamos Zonal Committee (Chimaltenango). Its leader was José Alberto Cardoza (nom de guerre: Mario Sánchez), who had been a PGT Central Committee member up to the split. PGT-CC maintained its hold over the Central, Northern, Western Regional Committees and a section of the Southern Regional Committee. Soon another section of the party, constituted by a group who had recently joined PGT after leaving FAR and members of Comil from the Central Region and the Alamos Zonal Committee, broke away from PGT to form the Guatemalan Party of Labour - Communist Party (PGT-PC). When the PGT-NDN and the leftist guerrillas (FAR, EGP, ORPA) joined forces and formed the URNG as a political and military coordination, PGT-CC stayed out of it. At an expanded meeting of members of the Central Committee, Political Commission and representatives from the Regional Committees and the military structures January 5–7 another mutiny against Rosales' leadership took place. The dissidents formed a parallel party called Guatemalan Party of Labour - January 6 (PGT-6 de Enero). In 1987 the URNG substituted PGT-NDN for PGT-CC in its leadership. By this time PGT-NDN had been severely marginalized. Since the 1983 capture of Carlos Quinteros ('Miguel'), who had been a leading figure in both PGT-NDN and PGT-PC, these groups were almost wiped out as Quinteros provided the state forces with vast information on their leaders and members. Thus, following the entry of PGT-CC into URNG, the party worked closely with the other revolutionary movements within the framework of URNG during the final phases of the civil war. Also relations between PGT-CC and PGT-NDN improved, and the two parties were able to hold a joint celebration of the 38th anniversary of the foundation of the party.  Peace Accord and merger into URNG  On 29 December 1996 a peace agreement was signed between the government of Álvaro Arzú and the URNG. When URNG transformed from a coalition of different groups to a unified political party in 1998, the four constituents merged into it. EGP and FAR were the first to dissolve their organizations, then PGT-CC and ORPA. The Provisional Leading Junta of URNG included Ricardo Rosales from PGT as its secretary. In October 2005 a group, claiming to represent former members of PGT, PGT-NDN, EGP, FAR and JPT, founded a party with the name PGT.http://www.cedema.org/uploads/Venceremos1-2a%20Epoca.doc References Category:1949 establishments in Guatemala Category:1998 disestablishments in Guatemala Category:Communist parties in Guatemala Category:Defunct political parties in Guatemala Category:Guatemalan Civil War Category:Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity Category:Guatemalan Revolution Category:Guerrilla movements in Latin America Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Guatemala Category:Political parties established in 1949 ","title":"Guatemalan Party of Labour"},{"id":"1611295","title":"Hugh J.

The episode focuses on Selma Bouvier adopting a Chinese orphan after experiencing menopause. Lucy Liu guest stars. The original closing credits feature the show's director David Silverman giving viewers a quick lesson on how he draws Bart Simpson.The Simpsons Season 16 - \\"Goo Goo Gai Pan\\" The episode was banned in the People's Republic of China. Plot Selma gives Mr. Burns his driving test to replace his long-expired license. During the test, she experiences a hot flash and is taken to the hospital. Dr. Hibbert explains that she has entered menopause by using a video featuring Robert Wagner, which means she can no longer become pregnant or have children. Selma is upset and fears growing old alone, so Patty suggests that she adopt a child. She almost manages to adopt one of Cletus's many babies through a misunderstanding, but that fails when Brandine wants the baby back. Lisa advises Selma to adopt a child from China. Because the Chinese government only allows married couples to adopt, Selma puts on her application that she's married to Homer Simpson. Selma sponsors a trip to China for the Simpsons. When Selma informs Homer that he must pretend to be her husband, he is shocked and reluctant, but later decides to do it for Marge. When they arrive in China, Selma claims Bart and Lisa are her children, while Marge is their nanny, ″Ms. October.″ The Chinese adoption agent, Madam Wu, tells them they will get a baby in a few days, as she wants to detail the \\"marriage relationship\\" between Homer and Selma, much to both Homer and Selma's dismay. The family then spends time touring through several landmarks in China, including visiting the mummified body of Mao Zedong, whom Homer likens to a \\"little angel who killed 50 million people.\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-35398932 Selma eventually gets a daughter, whom she names Ling. However, following the adoption, the ruse is quickly revealed when Wu catches Homer and Marge talking about the false marriage and kissing through a painting. As they are about to leave, Wu arrives and takes Ling away, stating that Homer and Selma are not married. As the Simpsons try to console her, Lisa plots with them to get the baby back. At the nursery, they dress and spray-paint Homer to look like a cross-legged golden Buddha statue. According to the customs of feng shui, the Buddha statue must be taken indoors, so Chinese guards drag him into the nursery. When the guards leave, Homer goes inside the nursery and grabs Ling. The Simpsons, Selma and Ling pass through Tiananmen Square, a place where, according to the marker shown in the episode, \\"nothing happened\\" in 1989. Wu, in a Type 59 Tank, confronts them and demands the baby back in a way similar to the tanks confronting the Tank Man. After an impassioned speech from Selma and Homer, Wu agrees to allow Selma to adopt Ling as a single parent—her leniency stemming from the fact that when she herself was just a baby, her father choked to death on a Ping-Pong ball the day before the Heimlich maneuver was invented, and her mother had ultimately raised her as a single parent. Wu also stops Homer from smuggling a panda cub in his luggage. Selma and her new daughter, Ling, and the Simpsons depart China by junk except for Bart, who is replaced by a Chinese child spy masquerading as him to deceive Homer. The episode ends with three dragons flying in the sky and singing while playing an erhu. During the credits, David Silverman shows the viewers how to draw Bart.

From 1833 to 1835, he painted a scene from Napoleon's expedition to Egypt on one of the ceilings at the Louvre. Between 1840 and 1860, he operated a popular painting workshop for women, directed by his sister Marie Amélie and one of his students, Catherine Caroline Thévenin (1813–1892), who later became his wife. After 1843, he concentrated almost entirely on teaching, with an occasional portrait. After 1855, he essentially gave up painting. After 1831, he taught design at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He also taught at the École polytechnique from 1847 to 1861. In 1851, he was appointed a Professor at the École des Beaux-arts, a position he held until 1863, when he retired, slowly giving up his private students and becoming more reclusive.

The term was introduced by Scott McCloud in his 2000 book Reinventing Comics, in which he suggested that webcomic creators could make a web page as large as needed to contain a comic page of any conceivable size. This infinite canvas would create an endless amount of storytelling benefits and would allow creators much more freedom in how they present their artwork. Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's idea of the infinite canvas, as five years after Reinventing Comics, the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet. Webcomics were primarily presented in the form of comic strips, which fit easily on a screen. Various webcomic creators have experimented with the infinite canvas, however, and extending comics to beyond what is possible in print has gained some popularity over the years. Description alt=Nine empty panels are shown in a 3-by-3 grid. Arrows demonstrate the traditional reading order, pointing from the first panel of the first row to the third panel of the first row, down to the first panel of the second row and so on. In comic books, the panels of each page are laid out in such as a way to fit perfectly on the page, forcing cartoonists into a relatively small set of possible panel lay-outs per page. In his 2000 book Reinventing Comics, cartoonist Scott McCloud proposed a solution for this situation in the form of the web page. Instead of using the monitor on which a webcomic is read as a \\"page\\", McCloud suggested using it as a \\"window\\" upon an infinite canvas. A webcomic could be made to be infinitely large, and the cartoonist could give a reader the ability to zoom in and out on it at will. McCloud claimed webcomics could be laid out in any shape: vertically like a tower, horizontally like a skyline, diagonally like a descending staircase, or even three dimensionally like a revolving cube. According to David Balan of Sequart Organization, webcomics with pages of limited size that use hyperlinks to move forward in the story consistently take the reader out of the experience, as there exists no visual link between any two pages. This issue is solved with a long, scrollable canvas, where the webcomic is presented as one long image. Such a webcomic may drag on, however, due to a lack of rhythm or punctuated story beats. Balan praised McCloud's 2003 webcomic The Right Number for its zooming interface, which would have the same benefits as other infinite canvas formats, but still allows for a certain rhythm to exist. Other artists known for making persistent use of the infinite canvas in the early 2000s include Cayetano Garza, demian5, Patrick Farley, Tristan A. Farnon and David Gaddis. Observations and responses In 2005, Sarah Boxer of The New York Times stated that the infinite canvas was hard to find in use, as many webcomics were sticking to a printable format. A few, however, like Nicholas Gurewitch's The Perry Bible Fellowship and Drew Weing's Pup, did make use of the format (Pup won a Web Cartoonists' Choice Award in the \\"infinite canvas\\" category in 2005). Boxer pointed out that most popular webcomics either fit on a webpage easily - such as Adrian Ramos's Count Your Sheep - or attempted to use various aspects of the digital medium, such as Flash animation and music. That same year, Joe Zabel also noted that the primary purpose for the infinite canvas would be to create lengthy and deep works on the Web, while comic strips like PvP and Penny Arcade showed to have much more success in this environment. Because of the time that would go into any page of an infinite canvas comic, Zabel deemed it unlikely for such webcomics to gain a large popularity. Journalist Eric Burns, meanwhile, claimed that McCloud was mainly discussing the potential of webcomics, rather than what they are actually like. In an interview in 2008, Scott McCloud said that in Reinventing Comics he was \\"shooting for the moon, in hopes that we could create these radical departures from traditional comics,\\" noting that \\"most online comics are still pretty conservative in format and style\\" but also that \\"there have been some impressive strides in that direction.\\" McCloud specified that he was still keeping an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that \\"the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that.\\" In an interview in 2014, McCloud said that \\"without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, a lot of people just turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an economic model that works.\\" Regardless of the format's popularity, a large amount of cartoonists have created infinite canvas webcomics over the years; in the book Storytelling in the Media Convergence Age, cartoonist Daniel Goodbrew states that \\"the infinite canvas has remained a popular choice among webcomic creators.\\" The infinite canvas has shown more success in Europe and Australia than in North America. The infinite canvas has obtained a large popularity among South Korean webtoons: McCloud noted in 2014 that \\"most digital comics are scrollers in Korea.\\" Usage and augmentation alt=Blank panels of various sizes are linked by a line, guiding a reader's eyes right, down, left, diagonally up, and down again. In 2005, Daniel Merlin Goodbrey created the \\"Tarquin Engine\\", a piece of Web software that uses Adobe Flash to depict an infinite canvas that a reader can freely scroll through and zoom in on. It greatly simplified the production of infinite canvas webcomics. The tool is not widely used. In 2009, Microsoft Live Labs released an infinite canvas web application, which reached a wider audience. In 2013, Yvyes Bigerel and Mark Waid of Marvel Comics launched an initiative to create and publish digital comics under the title Marvel ReEvolution. While creating these webcomics, Bigerel and Waid were inspired by the manner in which time is experienced within comics, as the passage of time in a comic book is ultimately controlled by its reader. Rather than to allow readers to skim through the images on a whim or to increase the space between panels as McCloud suggested, the duo stacked the panels up \\"like a PowerPoint slideshow,\\" forcing the reader to look at one panel at a time. According to Comic Book Resources, this design directly affects how a comic is created and read, as surprises can be better controlled and a letterer could directly control the reading order of text balloons. Rachel Edidin of Wired said of Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted and Iron Man: Fatal Frontier that \\"these are comics that truly feel native to the digital format.\\" In 2016, Oculus Story Studio released Quill, a piece of software that allows people to create a three-dimensional world on an \\"infinite canvas\\", meant to be experienced through virtual reality.

Biography Arman's father, Antonio Fernandez, an antiques dealer from Nice, was also an amateur artist, photographer, and cellist. From his father, Arman learned oil painting and photography. After receiving his bachelor's degree in philosophy and mathematics in 1946, Arman began studying at the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Nice. He also started judo at a police school in Nice where he met Yves Klein and Claude Pascal. The trio bonded closely on a subsequent hitch-hiking tour around Europe. Completing his studies in 1949, Arman enrolled as a student at the École du Louvre in Paris, where he concentrated on the study of archaeology and oriental art. In 1951, he became a teacher at the Bushido Kai Judo Club in Madrid. During this time he also served in the French military, completing his tour of duty as a medical orderly during the Indo-China War. Early career Early on, it was apparent that Arman's concept of the accumulation of vast quantities of the same objects was to remain a significant component of his art. He had originally focused more attention on his abstract paintings, considering them to be of more consequence than his early accumulations of stamps. Only when he witnessed viewer reaction to his first accumulation in 1959 did he fully recognize the power of such art. In 1962, he began welding together accumulations of the same kinds of metal objects, such as axes (as pictured below). Avalanch (1990), Tel Aviv University campus. Music Power No. 2, bronze (1986), Israel Conservatory of Music, Tel Aviv. Inspiration and name change Inspired by an exhibition for the German Dadaist Kurt Schwitters in 1954, Arman began working on \\"Cachets,\\" his first major artistic undertaking. At his third solo exhibition held in Paris's Galerie Iris Clert in 1958, Arman showed some of his first 2D accumulations he called \\"cachets.\\" These stamps on paper and fabric proved a success and provided an important change of course for the young artist's career. At the time, he was signing with his first name as an homage to Van Gogh, who also signed his works with his first name, \\"Vincent.\\" And, thus, in 1957, Arman chose to change his name from Armand to Arman. On January 31, 1973, upon becoming a citizen of the United States, he took the American civil name, Armand Pierre Arman.Arman chronology Nevertheless, he continued to use \\"Arman\\" as his public persona. Evolution of work From 1959 to 1962, Arman developed his most recognizable style, beginning with his two most renowned concepts: \\"Accumulation\\" and \\"Poubelle\\" (French for \\"trash bin\\"). Accumulations were collections of common and identical objects which he arranged in polyester castings or within Plexiglas cases. His first welded accumulations were created in 1962. The \\"Poubelles\\" were collections of strewn refuse. In 1960, he filled the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris with garbage, creating \\"Le Plein\\" (\\"Full Up\\") as a counterpoint of the exhibition called \\"Le Vide\\" at the same gallery two years earlier by his friend Yves Klein. These works began to garner the attention of the European art community. In October 1960, Arman, Yves Klein, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Martial Raysse, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé, and art critic and philosopher Pierre Restany founded the Nouveau réalisme group. Joined later by Cesar, Mimmo Rotella, Niki de Saint Phalle, and Christo, the group of young artists defined themselves as bearing in common their \\"new perspective approaches of reality.\\" They were reassessing the concept of art and the artist for a 20th-century consumer society by reasserting the humanistic ideals in the face of industrial expansion. In 1961, Arman made his debut in the United States, the country which was to become his second home. During this period, he explored creation via destruction. The \\"Coupes\\" and the \\"Colères\\" featured sliced, burned, or smashed objects arranged on canvas, often using objects with a strong \\"identity\\" such as musical instruments (mainly violins and saxophones) or bronze statues. Arman and Warhol Arman can be seen in Andy Warhol's film Dinner at Daley's, a documentation of a dinner performance by the Fluxus artist Daniel Spoerri that Warhol filmed on March 5, 1964. Throughout the portrait-screen-test film, Arman sits in profile, looking down, appearing to be entranced in his reading, seemingly unaware of Warhol's camera, only making small gestures, rubbing his eyes, and licking the corner of his mouth. He remained silent, eyes gazing over the pages of what seemed to be a newspaper, in this four-minute, 16mm black-and- white reel. Warhol owned two of Arman's Poubelles and another accumulation called Amphetamines, which were sold at Sotheby's auction of the Andy Warhol Collection in May 1988. Eros, Inside Eros, bronze of 1986, in the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Move to New York City Fascinated with the scene in New York, Arman took up part-time residency there from his home in Nice in 1961, after his first exhibition at the Cordier Warren Gallery. In the city, he met Marcel Duchamp at a dinner given by the artist and collector William Copley. First living at the Chelsea Hotel and later in Church street while keeping a studio in Bowery, then in TriBeCa, Arman began work on large public sculptures. There were varied expansions of the accumulations. Their content included tools, watches, clocks, furniture, automobile parts, jewelry, and, of course, musical instruments in various stages of dismemberment. Musical instruments, specifically the stringsExample of a violin sculpture by Arman in the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, New York and bronze, through his collaboration with a foundry in Normandy, France, became a major avenue in Arman's work. Of Arman's accumulations, one of the largest is Long Term Parking,Detail of Long Term Parking which is on permanent display at the Château de Montcel in Jouy-en-Josas, France. Completed in 1982, this 60 feet (18-meter) high sculpture consists of sixty mostly French cars set in 40,000 pounds (18,000 kg) of concrete. Just as ambitious was the 1995 work Hope for Peace,Image of Hope for Peace which was specially commissioned by the Lebanese government to commemorate 50 years of the Lebanese military's service. Standing in once war-torn Beirut, the 32-meter (105-ft.) monument consists of 83 tanks and military vehicles. Personal life In 1953, Arman married electronic music composer Eliane Radigue and had two daughters, Marion (1951) and Anne (1953) and one son, Yves Arman (1954–1989). In 1971, he married Corice Canton, with whom he had one daughter, Yasmine (1982) and one son, Philippe (1987). In 1989, he had his sixth and last child, Yves Cesar Arman, son of Carrole Cesar. After Arman's death in New York in 2005, part of his ashes were buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris in 2008.

Mrs. Landingham appears in the first two seasons of the show as the executive secretary of President of the United States Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen). Character biography Mrs. Landingham appears in the first episode of The West Wing. She is the personal secretary to President Josiah Bartlet, and to a large extent controls access by the other characters to the President. She is the only White House staffer whom the President nearly always addresses formally; he typically calls her \\"Mrs. Landingham\\", although he addresses other, more senior members of his staff, and Mrs. Landingham's eventual replacement, by their first names. In the show, she describes herself as a surrogate big sister to Bartlet. In the 21st episode of the second season of the show \\"18th and Potomac\\", Mrs. Landingham is killed by a drunk driver while driving to the White House to show the President (at his request) a new car she just bought. Her death affects President Bartlet deeply, driving the plot of the second-season finale \\"Two Cathedrals\\", in which Bartlet must decide whether to seek re-election in the midst of a scandal over failing to publicly disclose the fact that he has multiple sclerosis. In flashbacks during this episode it is revealed that she first met Bartlet when he was a teenager in his native New Hampshire, where his father served as headmaster of a private school. Mrs. Landingham (played by Kirsten Nelson in the flashback episodes) was at that time Bartlet's father's new secretary. In another flashback in the episode \\"Bartlet for America\\", Mrs. Landingham is shown working as Jed Bartlet's secretary during his tenure as Governor and it is possible she worked for him when he was in the United States House of Representatives. Landingham was married to United States Air Force Major Henry Landingham, who served in the Korean War, though she is a widow by the time she begins work at the White House. It is revealed in \\"In Excelsis Deo\\" that her twin sons (Andrew and Simon) were killed in the Vietnam War on Christmas Eve, 1970. The twins' lottery number had come up while in medical school and despite their parents' strong opposition, they decided not to get a deferment, wanting instead to \\"go where people needed doctors\\".

The film featured the Top 10 Billboard hit \\"Bossa Nova Baby\\" and reached No. 1 on the national weekly box office charts a week after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The film would be Presley's last release before the arrival of Beatlemania. It was the top-grossing movie musical of 1963. Plot Elvis Presley with Ursula Andress and Elsa Cárdenas in a promotional picture of the film. Mike Windgren works on a boat in Acapulco, Mexico. When Janie Harkins, the bratty daughter of the boat owner, gets him fired, Mike must find new work. A Mexican boy named Raoul helps him get a job as a lifeguard and singer at a local hotel. Clashes abound when Mike runs into a rival lifeguard, who is the champion diver of Mexico. He is angry at Mike for taking some of his hours, and for stealing his woman. Mike is recovering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a fear of heights, following a tragic high-wire accident during his career as a circus performer. However, after Mike sees the lifeguard perform a number of dangerous dives, including flips and head-first dives into a section of the pool surrounded by a ring of fire, he decides to get even with him and eventually sets himself up to perform a death-defying dive off the 136-foot cliffs of La Quebrada in front of hundreds of people. Mike dives off the cliff, and successfully lands in the water, earning the lifeguard's respect. As the crowd and the lifeguard applaud, Mike performs one more song and leaves with Margarita and Raoul.

Controversy  Exterior filming in Acapulco took place in January 1963. A stunt double was used for Presley, whose own shots were later completed in March at the Paramount studios in Los Angeles. Presley was unable to travel to Mexico as he had been declared \\"persona non grata\\" by local authorities following two violent riots at the trendy 'Las Americas' cinema in Mexico City, during the openings of his previous films King Creole (El barrio contra mi) in 1959, and G.I. Blues (Cafe Europa) in 1961. In fact, the ban had actually started in 1957, when Excelsior, Mexico's foremost newspaper published an article by gossip columnist Federico de Leon that falsely stated Presley had been interviewed while visiting Tijuana, a place Presley never visited, before or after, where he had allegedly said that \\"he would not care to go sing in Mexico, as he found it a distasteful country and that he would in fact prefer to kiss three African Americans than a single Mexican woman.\\" This led to a split in attitudes towards Presley among Mexican youth which became physically violent on several occasions. The King Creole riots saw 100 people jailed, but by the time of Fun in Acapulco's release, Presley's records had been banned from airplay, in 1957, his records publicly burnt in the El Zocalo town square that same year, and as stated above, his ban from stores enforced, since 1959. Decades later, it came to light that the false Presley quotes were the work of Ernesto Peralta Uruchurtu, a powerful politician and the Regent of Mexico City. Uruchurtu allegedly sent a blank cheque to Presley's Los Angeles offices in early 1957 in return for Presley's appearance at the 15th birthday bash of the daughter of a powerful media mogul on whose behalf he was acting. The invitation was not agreed upon, and the check was returned, despite the fact that the mogul had already began to boast publicly that Presley would appear at his daughter's birthday party. The story in \\"Excelsior\\" was then planted both as a form of revenge, and as a way of explaining why he did not come to Mexico to sing. These incidents were documented by Parménides García Saldaña in his book \\"Rey Criollo\\", and in Eric Zoloy's book Elvis Refried: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture. SoundtrackReception Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote in a positive review that \\"this attractive travel poster for the famed Mexican resort is far and away [Presley's] best musical feature to date. It's a pleasant, idyllic movie that never takes itself seriously and moves briskly under Richard Thorpe's direction ... And Mr. Presley has never seemed so relaxed and personable.\\" A middling review in Variety said, \\"Presley fans won't be disappointed—he sings ten serviceable songs and wiggles a bit to boot. However, the ground covered by the plot doesn't help to increase his star stature and, for those who are not devotees, the main attraction may only turn out to be the Technicolorful scenery of Acapulco.\\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Presley buffs should eat it up ... Director Richard Thorpe has kept the film's pace swift, which helps to cover up a lack of character development and a routine plot.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \\"There is a distinct falling away here from the charm, humour and liveliness of some recent Elvis Presley films, notably Follow That Dream ...

A stiletto heel, or just stiletto, is a shoe with a long, thin, high heel. It is named after the stiletto dagger. Stiletto heels may vary in length from 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) to 25 cm (10 inches) or more if a platform sole is used, and are sometimes defined as having a diameter at the ground of less than 1 cm (slightly less than half an inch). Stiletto-style heels or shorter are called kitten heels. History 1952 newspaper ad for stiletto heels High-heeled shoes were worn by men and women courtiers until the French Revolution. When high heels came back in style in the late 1800s, they were worn only by women. The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. Italian shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo paved the way for stilettos by inventing the steel arch. Some historians also credit him with inventing the stiletto heel, while others credit French fashion designer Charles Jourdan. French designers such as Roger Vivier and André Perugia popularized the stiletto design in the 1950s, which quickly spread across Europe and the United States. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \\"stiletto\\", not just the heel, via synecdoche (pars pro toto). Although they faded from the scene after the Beatle era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by Manolo Blahnik, who dubbed his \\"new\\" heel the \\"Needle\\". Similar heels were stocked at the big Biba store in London, by Russell & Bromley and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed- toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass- produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with punks and with other fashion \\"tribes\\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered power suits. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans. Image Stilettos, like all similar high- heeled shoes, give the optical illusion of a longer, slimmer leg, a smaller foot, and overall greater height. They alter the wearer's posture and gait, flexing the calf muscles and making the bust and buttocks more prominent. Stiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the femme fatale. They are often considered to be a seductive item of clothing, and are even fetishized as an erotic object by some. Disadvantages All high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot, sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively; such shoes are a common cause of venous complaints such as pain, fatigue, and heavy-feeling legs, and have been found to provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs. Despite their impracticality and fluctuating demand, they persist as a fashion option. Stiletto heels concentrate a large amount of force into a small area. The great pressure under such a heel, which is greater than that under the feet of an elephant, can cause damage to carpets and floors. The stiletto heel, unless equipped with a \\"heel stopper\\" to enlarge the floor contact area, can be impractical for outdoor wear on soft ground (such as grass, sand or mud), or in environments where floor damage is unacceptable.

It consists of four departments, namely bowling, football, athletics and wrestling. However, the club is best known for its football department. It is the oldest football club in Sweden. The club was founded in 1887 which makes it the oldest active sports club in the country. History Swedish championship final. A chart showing the progress of Örgryte IS through the swedish football league system. The different shades of gray represent league divisions. The club was founded on 4 December 1887 by Willhem Friberg and participated in the first football match in Sweden on 22 May 1892. Today, a memorial on Heden in central Gothenburg reminiscent of this match. Another memorial has been erected inside the amusement park Liseberg. Örgryte IS came to dominate the childhood of Swedish football. In 1904 Örgyte IS met a friendly match between the English Corinthian FC, thanks for the hospitality donated a silver cup – Corinthian Bowl that next year became the prize in a contest between Sweden's best teams. In 1908 Örgyte IS officially opened its facility Walhalla stadium. Hugo Levin, football player and the secretary of Örgyte IS, was one of many involved in the building of Walhalla and had several positions in Gothenburg football. Walhalla was inaugurated by a match between Örgryte and German champions Viktoria Berlin. Between 1910–1924 Örgryte IS played in the Swedish series, a series that lacked national status despite participation by leading teams. Öis won the series in 1910, 1912 and 1924 the team won the 1924 Western series, and then the final against AIK. Player Sven Rydell who became Sweden's first major football star and became known for his fast play and creative dribbling, but above all for his ability to score. Carl-Erik Holmberg was a contributor to its success, with its total of 193 goals in the Swedish League for Örgryte IS. 1926 the team celebrated a major success when beating Aston Villa 5–2, which was unusual. In the first decades of the 20th Century, Örgryte IS also played bandy. The club became Gothenburg district champions in this sport in 1917.Eric Sköld (ed.): Boken om bandy, Uppsala: Bygd och Folk Förlag (1948), p. 319 (in Swedish) In the late 1930s the fortunes began to decline for the team. They finished 10th out of 12 teams in both 1938 and 1939, and avoided relegation. In 1940 Örgyte IS relegated from allsvenskan to Division II Västra. During the 1940s and 1950s the team played in Division 2 but would enjoy greater success in the 1950s. Örgryte attracted record crowds despite the low status in the second division. The team recruited Gunnar Gren and in 1956 he becomes the player-coach for the offensive teams that attract large crowds to ÖIS matches. In 1958 the team is becoming more competitive. A young player in the team of this era was Agne Simonsson who later will go on to play in the Swedish National Football Team. Örgryte IS has won 12 national championship titles and one national cup title. After having economical problems Örgryte Fotboll AB went into bankruptcy in February 2011. The upshot of the bankruptcy was that Örgryte was relegated to the third Swedish division, Division 1 Södra. Their home arena is Gamla Ullevi. The club is affiliated to the Göteborgs Fotbollförbund. In 2007 the youth part of the football section started to accept girls as well as boys after the men's section having been active for 120 years. Örgryte IS played for a long time in red shirts and blue shorts, but in 2018 they went back to using their older claret shirts. https://fotboll.ois.se/sallskapets- matchtroja-2020 Supporters The name of the official supporter club is ÖIS Supporterklubb Balders Hage.

The route begins at Highway 17B in Echo Bay and travels eastward to Ophir, where it turns south to Bruce Mines, ending at Highway 17\\\\. The north–south portion of the route was designated in 1956 as Highway 561\\\\. In 1962, Highway 638 was designated from Echo Bay to Highway 561, as well as a segment of the latter route from Ophir to Dunns Valley. The highway took on its current routing in 1989, assuming the route of Highway 561 south from Ophir to Bruce Mines; the section of Highway 638 from Ophir to Dunns Valley was renumbered as Highway 670\\\\.  Route description  Highway 638 in Rydal Bank Highway 638 is in length, extending from Highway 17B in Echo Bay eastward through the communities of Sylvan Valley, Leeburn and Ophir, where it turns southward and runs south through Rydal Bank, Bruce Station, and finally to its southeastern terminus, also at Highway 17, in the town of Bruce Mines.  History  The first section of today's Highway 638 was designated as Highway 561\\\\. The route, assigned in 1956 alongside many of the secondary highways in the province, travelled north from Bruce Mines to Ophir, where it turned east to Dunns Valley then north to Skookum Lake. On March 29, 1962, Highway 638 was assumed, travelling from Echo Bay to Highway 561\\\\. In addition, the portion of Highway 561 between Ophir and Dunns Valley was renumbered as part of the new route; the section north of the Wanamaker Creek bridge in Dunns Valley was decommissioned. This routing remained consistent until mid- to late 1989, when Highway 561 was renumbered as part of Highway 638\\\\. The route between Ophir and Dunns Valley was renumbered Highway 670 at the same time. = Highway 17B = From 2007 to 2009, the highway extended for an additional 15.6 kilometres westerly from Echo Bay, to another junction with Highway 17 in Sault Ste. Marie. The extended route from Echo Bay to Sault Ste. Marie was formerly an alignment of Highway 17, the route of the Trans-Canada Highway through the region, and was redesignated as part of Highway 638 when Highway 17 was rerouted along a four-lane expressway alignment which opened on October 31, 2007. However, the Garden River First Nation, citing a 1909 agreement with the province whereby ownership of the highway reverts to the band after realignment, refused to accept the highway being badged as anything other than Highway 17B. The provincial Ministry of Transportation, has decommissioned most B-suffixed highways in Ontario, but the band posted unofficial \\"Highway 17B\\" signs at the eastern and western limits of the reserve. The municipal councils of Sault Ste. Marie and Macdonald, Meredith and Aberdeen Additional, which border Garden River on either side and are also located on the route of the disputed roadway, both passed municipal resolutions in 2007 supporting Garden River's position and calling on the province to designate the road as Highway 17B. As of February 2009, the segment is officially designated as 17B, and the route of Highway 638 once again ends at its original pre-2007 terminus in Echo Bay. However, exit signs along the Highway 17 bypass route do not identify the road with a 17B shield, but only as Bar River Road.  Future  The safety of the current at-grade intersection at Highway 17 has been called into question by local residents.

Unlike shoes, boot styles have often appeared as street wear before they inspire fashion designers.Quinn, p. 130 Boots are usually seen as a sign of empowerment for the wearer, especially when worn by women.Quinn, p. 152–169 This may be a reason for the connection to BDSM, where boots usually are seen as a statement of dominance. So called boot worship became a common subcultural practice among sadomasochists and related fetishists in the early 20th century.Quinn, p. 73 High heeled boots help to elongate the calf, creating a longer legged appearance which is generally considered to be more sexually attractive. The length of the boot shafts also adds to this impression. Boots have been displayed in magazines such as Leg Show, and there are also magazines and websites aimed directly at this fetish. Boot fetishism may be accompanied by a fetish for the material from which it is made, such as leather, rubber, or latex. Boot fetishism is often targeted at fashion boots and riding boots but there are also boots expressly made for fetish purposes, such as ballet boots and some forms of thigh-high boots. There is also a very prominent subsection of mostly gay men who fetishize men's boots, with \\"boot worship\\" being a common practice in this group, to the point where there is a yearly contest to see who is the best bootblack.http://www.imrl.com/bootblack/index.php The types of boots favored by men differ from those worn by women, with men typically preferring more sturdy, rugged boots, such as combat boots, jump boots, motorcycle boots, or riding boots. These boots feature prominently in outfits worn by leather enthusiasts in competitions such as International Mr. Leather.  Causes  Hsu and Bailey (2019) argue that there is little evidence of \\"sexual conditioning\\" explanations for boot fetishism, since only a small minority of men who have seen attractive women in boots develop boot fetishes. They also say that \\"boot fetishes would not occur in a world without boots, and in a world where men and women switched boots, different patterns of fetishes would likely develop\\". They argue that random developmental processes which are still poorly understood make some men more prone to developing paraphilias and fetishes.

A bowling ball is a hard spherical ball used to knock down bowling pins in the sport of bowling. Balls used in ten-pin bowling typically have holes for two fingers and the thumb. Balls used in five-pin bowling, candlepin bowling, duckpin bowling, and kegel have no holes, and are small enough to be held in the palm of the hand. Ten-pin ballsSpecifications= The USBC and World Bowling promulgate bowling ball specifications. USBC specifications include physical requirements for weight (≤), diameter (—), surface hardness, surface roughness, hole drilling limitations (example: a single balance hole including the thumb hole for \\"two-handed\\" bowlers), balance, plug limitations, and exterior markings (structural and commercial), as well as requirements for dynamic performance characteristics such as radius of gyration (RG; 2.46—2.80), RG differential (≤0.06), and coefficient of friction (≤0.32). The USBC banned weight holes (balance holes) in competition, effective August 1, 2020, to prevent their changing ball dynamics. =Coverstock technology= : See the section titled, Effect of coverstock, core and layout on ball motion A rough timeline of ten-pin bowling ball coverstock technology. Bowling balls were made of lignum vitae (hardwood) until the 1905 introduction of rubber balls. Polyester (\\"plastic\\") balls were introduced in 1959 and, despite developing less hook-generating lane friction than rubber balls, by the 1970s plastic dominated over rubber balls which then became obsolete with the early-1980s development of polyurethane (\\"urethane\\") balls. Urethane balls developed more friction with the newly-developed polyurethane lane finishes of the day, sparking the evolution of coverstock technology to pursue ever- stronger hooks with correspondingly higher entry angles. The early 1990s brought development of reactive resin (\\"reactive\\") balls by introducing additives in urethane surface materials to create microscopic oil-absorbing pores that increase the \\"tackiness\\" that enhances traction. In the \\"particle- enhanced\\" balls developed in the late 1990s, microscopic particles embedded in reactive coverstocks reach through oil lane coatings to provide even greater traction. Ball manufacturers developed closely guarded proprietary blends including ground-up material such as glass, ceramic or rubber, to enhance friction. Within the reactive category are solid reactive coverstocks (having the greatest amount of microscopic pores), pearl reactive coverstocks (including mica additives that enhance reaction on dry lane surfaces), hybrid reactive coverstocks (combining the mid-lane reaction of solid coverstocks and the back-end reaction of pearl coverstocks), and particle coverstocks (including microscopic silica particles, favored for use on heavy oil volumes). Hook potential has increased so much that dry lane conditions or certain spare shots sometimes cause bowlers to use plastic or urethane balls, to purposely avoid the larger hook provided by reactive technology. =Layout and grip= : See the section titled, Effect of coverstock, core and layout on ball motion A ball's drilling layout refers to how and where holes are drilled, in relation to the ball's locator pin and mass bias (MB) marker. Layout is determined with reference to each bowler's positive axis point (PAP; the pocket end of the ball's initial axis of rotation). \\"Pin down\\" layouts place the pin between the finger holes and the thumb hole, while \\"pin up\\" layouts place the pin further from thumb hole than the finger holes (see photos). (Web page archiving attempts failed.) Bowling ball motion is influenced by how far the pin and the mass bias (MB) are from the PAP, the distances determining track flare. Track flare—the sequence of oil rings showing migration of the ball's axis on successive revolutions through the oil pattern—is popularly thought to influence entry angle, but Freeman & Hatfield (2018) discount its contribution to ball motion. Holes may be drilled for a conventional grip (fingers inserted to the second knuckle as with \\"house balls\\"), a fingertip grip (fingers inserted only to the first knuckle, enabling greater rev-generating torque), or less standard grips such as the Sarge Easter grip (ring finger inserted to the second knuckle but middle finger inserted only to the first knuckle). Many bowlers using the so-called \\"two-handed delivery\\" (which is still a one-handed release) do not insert their thumbs, thus allowing their fingers to impart even more torque than the fingertip grip. Finger inserts and thumb slugs are custom-fit urethane tubes inserted into the drilled holes, generally for balls with a fingertip grip. Finger inserts enhance the torque provided by the fingers after the thumb exits the ball. =Ball motion= The skid, hook and roll phases of ball motion. Ball motion is commonly broken down into sequential skid, hook, and roll phases. As the ball travels down the lane in the skid and hook phases, frictional contact with the lane causes the ball's forward (translational) speed to continually decrease, but to continually increase its rev rate (rotational speed). Especially as the ball encounters greater friction in the last ≈20 feet (approximate) of the lane, the ball's axis rotation (side rotation) causes the ball to hook away from its original direction. Concurrently, lane friction continually decreases the angle of axis rotation until it exactly matches the direction of the ball's forward motion, and rev rate (rotational speed) increases until it exactly matches the ball's forward speed: full traction is achieved and the ball enters the roll phase in which forward speed continues to decrease. Release ratio denotes the ratio of the ball's forward (translational) speed to its rev rate (rotational speed) at time of release. This ratio continually decreases throughout the ball's travel until it reaches exactly 1.0 when full traction is achieved upon entering the roll phase. A too-high release ratio (a speed-dominant release) causes the ball to reach the pins while still in the hook phase (resulting in a shallow angle of entry that permits ball deflection and resultant leaves of the 10-pin), and a too-low release ratio (a rev-dominant release) causes the ball to enter the roll phase before reaching the pins (sacrificing power to friction that would ideally be delivered to the pins to enhance pin scatter). Ball speed and rev rate are said to be matched if the ball enters the roll phase immediately before impacting the pins, maximizing power imparted to the pins yet helping to provide an entry angle that minimizes ball deflection.• (date is approximate) • (date is approximate) Effect of delivery characteristics on ball motion Various characteristics of ball delivery affect a ball's motion throughout its skid, hook and roll phases. The particular way in which energy is imparted to a ball—with varying proportions of that energy divided among ball speed, axis control and rev rate—determines the ball's motion. The following discussion considers delivery characteristics separately, with the understanding that ball motion is determined by a complex interaction of a variety of factors. Greater ball speeds give the ball less time to hook, thus reducing observed hook though imparting more kinetic energy to the pins; conversely, slower speeds allow more time for greater hook though reducing kinetic energy. Greater rev rates cause the ball to experience more frictional lane contact per revolution and thus (assuming non-zero axis rotation) greater and earlier hook (less \\"length\\"— which is the distance from the foul line to the breakpoint at which hooking is maximum); conversely, smaller rev rates cause less frictional engagement and allow the ball to hook less and later (more \\"length\\"). Analysis of the influence of axis rotation (sometimes called side rotation) is more complex: There is a degree of axis rotation—generally 25° to 35° and varying with ball speed and rev rate—that may be considered optimal in that hook is maximized; however, this optimum axis rotation also causes minimal length. Specifically, Freeman & Hatfield (2018) report optimal axis rotation to be arcsin(ωr/v) where ω is rev rate (radians/sec), r is ball radius (m), and v is ball speed (m/s). Below and above optimal axis rotation, more length and less hook are encountered, with greater-than-optimal axis rotation causing a sharper hook. Greater degrees of initial (at-the-foul-line) axis tilt cause the ball to rotate on smaller-circumference \\"tracks\\" (rings on the ball at which it contacts the lane on each revolution), thus reducing the amount of frictional contact to provide greater length and less hook; conversely, smaller degrees of axis tilt involve larger-circumference tracks with more frictional contact per revolution, thus providing less length and more hook. Loft—the distance past the foul line at which the ball first contacts the lane—determines the effective length of the lane as experienced by the ball: greater loft distances effectively shorten the lane and provide greater length, while smaller loft distances engage the lane earlier and cause an earlier hook. Effect of coverstock, core and layout on ball motion Bowling ball motion is affected by ball design, as discussed by, for example, Freeman & Hatfield (2018). See also the USBC ball motion study by Stremmel, Ridenour & Stervenz (published circa 2008). Various characteristics of ball core structure and coverstock composition affect a ball's motion throughout its skid, hook and roll phases. Such motion is largely governed by the lane's frictional interaction with the ball, which exhibits both chemical friction characteristics and physical friction characteristics. Also, the ball's internal structure—especially the density, shape and orientation of its core (also called \\"weight block\\")—substantially affect ball motion. A \\"dull\\" (rough) ball surface, having spikes and pores, provides greater friction in the oil-covered front end of the lane but reduced frictional contact in the dry back end of the lane, and thus enables an earlier hook. In contrast, a \\"gloss\\" (smooth) ball surface tends to glide atop oil on the front end but establishes greater frictional contact in the dry back end, thus promoting a sharper hook downlane. Accordingly, because different lane conditions and bowler styles favor different hook profiles, there is no single \\"best\\" surface. A 2005-2008 USBC Ball Motion Study found that the ball design factors that most contributed to ball motion were the microscopic \\"spikes\\" and pores on the ball's surface (considered part of chemical frictional characteristics), the respective coefficients of friction between ball and lane in the oiled and dry parts of the lane, and the ball's oil absorption rate, followed in dominance by certain characteristics of the ball's core (mainly radius of gyration, and total differential). Freeman and Hatfield (2018) explain that in most circumstances it is chemical friction—controlled by the manufacturer's proprietary coverstock formulation governing its \\"stickiness\\"—that primarily determines ball motion. Further, surface finish—modifiable by sandpaper, polish and the like—is also a material factor. Though manufacturer literature often specifies track flare—exhibited by successive tracks of oil in a \\"bowtie\\" pattern and caused by RG differential—the USBC ball motion study showed flare's influence to be small, assuming that a minimal threshold of flare exists to present a \\"dry\\" surface for successive ball revolutions. Similarly, though manufacturer literature often describes specific core shapes, differently-shaped cores can make exactly the same contribution to ball motion if they have the same overall RG characteristics. \\"Weak\\" layouts (\\"pin down\\": pin between finger and thumb holes) hook sooner but have milder backend reaction, while \\"strong\\" layouts (\\"pin up\\": pin further from thumb hole than finger holes) enable greater skid lengths and more angular backend reaction. Manufacturers commonly cite specifications relating to a bowling ball's core, include radius of gyration (RG), differential of RG (commonly abbreviated differential), and intermediate differential (also called mass bias). Analytically, the United States Bowling Congress defines RG as \\"the distance from the axis of rotation at which the total mass of a body might be concentrated without changing its moment of inertia\\". In practice, a higher RG indicates that a ball's mass is distributed more toward its cover—making it \\"cover heavy\\"—which tends to make the ball enter the roll phase later (further down the lane). Conversely, a lower RG indicates the ball's mass is distributed more towards its center—making it \\"center heavy\\"—which tends to make it enter the roll phase sooner. Differential of RG is the difference between maximum and minimum RGs measured with respect to different axes. Differential indicates the ball's track flare potential, and contributes to how sharply a ball can hook. A higher differential indicates greater track flare potential—more angular motion from the break point to the pocket—and a lower differential indicates lower flare potential and a smoother arc to the hook. The lesser-used intermediate differential rating (sometimes termed mass bias rating) quantifies the degree to which a bowling ball core is symmetrical or asymmetrical. Analytically, ID is defined by the USBC as the \\"difference in radius of gyration between the Y (high RG) and Z (intermediate RG) axes\\". In practice, a higher ID indicates greater asymmetry, which causes more area to be created at the break point to cause the ball to respond more quickly to friction than symmetrical balls. Informally, a low-differential ball has been likened to one whose core is a spherical object (whose height and width are the same); a high-differential ball has been likened to a tall drinking glass (whose height and width are different); and a high-mass-bias ball has been likened to a tall drinking mug with a handle on the side (which has different widths in different directions). Higher-friction surfaces (lower grit numbers) cause balls to hook earlier, and lower-friction surfaces (higher grit numbers) cause balls to skid longer before reacting (hooking). Reactive cover stocks finishes include matte (aggressive reaction), shiny (longer skid distance than matte finish), pearl (greatest skid distance among reactive cover stocks), and hybrid (combination of skid distance and back end reaction). Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion Bowling ball motion is affected by lanes' inherent characteristics (composition, topography), oil viscosity, environmental factors (temperature, humidity), and previous ball traffic. topography. Project Gutenberg release date: June 16, 2018. The phenomenon of lane transition occurs when balls remove oil from the lane as they pass, and deposit some of that oil on originally dry parts of the lane. The process of oil removal, commonly called breakdown, forms dry paths that subsequently cause balls to experience increased friction and to hook sooner. Conversely, the process of oil deposition, commonly called carry down, occurs when balls form oil tracks in formerly dry areas, tracks that subsequently cause balls to experience less friction and delayed hook. Balls tend to \\"roll out\\" (hook sooner but hook less) in response to breakdown, and, conversely, tend to skid longer (and hook later) in response to carry down—both resulting in light hits. Breakdown is influenced by the oil absorption characteristics and rev rates of the balls that were previously rolled, and carry down is mitigated by modern balls having substantial track flare. Lane materials with softer surfaces such as wood engage the ball with more friction and thus provide more hook potential, while harder surfaces like synthetic compositions provide less friction and thus provide less hook potential. The lanes' physical topography—hills and valleys that diverge from an ideal planar surface—can substantially and unpredictably affect ball motion, even if the lane is within permissible tolerances. Higher-viscosity lane oils (those with thicker consistency) engage balls with more friction and thus cause slower speeds and shorter length but provide more hook potential and reduced lane transition; conversely, lane oils of lower viscosity (thinner consistency) are more slippery and thus support greater speeds and length but offer less hook potential and allow faster lane transition. Various factors influence an oil's native viscosity, including temperature (with higher temperatures causing the oil to be thinner) and humidity (variations of which can cause crowning and cupping of the lane surface). Also, high humidity increases friction that reduces skid distance so the ball tends to hook sooner. =Manufacturers= The USBC maintains a list, said to be updated weekly, of about 100 bowling ball manufacturers and their approved bowling balls.

This goes beyond the traditional father–mother model, and the third party's involvement is limited to the reproductive process and does not extend into the raising of the child. Third-party reproduction is used by couples unable to reproduce where they would otherwise be unable to do so, by same-sex couples, and by men and women without a partner. Where donor gametes are provided by a donor, the donor will be a biological parent of the resulting child, but in third party reproduction, he or she will not be the caring parent.  Categories One can distinguish several categories, some of which may be combined: * Sperm donation. A donor provides sperm in order to father a child for a third-party female. * Egg donation. A donor provides ova to a woman or couple in order for the egg to be fertilized and implanted in the recipient woman. ** Spindle transfer. A third party's mitochondrial DNA is transferred to the future mother's ovum. This is used to prevent mitochondrial disease. * Embryo donation ** with embryos which were originally created for a genetic mother's assisted pregnancy. Once the genetic mother has completed her own treatment, she may donate unused embryos for use by a third party. ** or where embryos are specifically created for donation using donor eggs and donor sperm. * Embryo adoption. Embryos created during a donor's assisted pregnancy are adopted to be implanted in a third party recipient. * Surrogacy. An embryo is gestated in a third party's uterus (traditional surrogacy) or a woman is inseminated in order to gestate a child for a third party (straight surrogacy). =Pregnancy= Pregnancy is typically initiated by artificial insemination in the case of sperm donation and by embryo transfer after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in the case of egg donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy. Thus a child can have a genetic and social (non-genetic, non- biological) father, and a genetic, gestational, and social (non-biological) mother, and any combinations thereof. Theoretically a child thus could have 5 parents. =Donor treatment= A donor treatment is where gametes, i.e. sperm, ova or embryos are provided, or 'donated' by a third party for the purpose of third-party reproduction. Combinations Surrogacy includes, in its wider sense, all situations where a surrogate carries a pregnancy for another person. Recently, there has been a tendency to separate the gestational carrier situation from the \\"true\\" surrogate restricting the term for a woman who provides a combination of ovum donation and gestational carrier services. In a 'conventional surrogacy', a surrogate agrees to be inseminated with the sperm of the male partner of the 'commissioning' couple, or with the sperm of one of the male partners in a same-sex relationship, or with sperm provided by a sperm donor. The surrogate is inseminated, conceives, and hands over the baby at the completion of the pregnancy. In conventional surrogacy, the egg which is fertilized is therefore that of the surrogate. A famous case involving paternity rights and surrogacy is the Baby M case. In a 'gestational surrogacy', a surrogate agrees to the implantation in her of an embryo which may be created either by using an egg provided by another woman who may be part of a 'commissioning' couple, or she may be a single woman. Alternatively, an egg provided by a donor may be used to create the embryo. The embryo implanted in the surrogate may be fertilised using sperm from the male partner of the 'commissioning couple', or by using sperm provided by a sperm donor. Embryo donation is where extra embryos from a successful IVF of a couple are given to other couples or women for transfer with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. Embryos for embryo donation may also be created specifically for embryo transfer using donor eggs and sperm, or in some cases donor eggs and donor sperm. It may thus be seen as a combination of sperm donation and egg donation, since what is donated is a combination of these. Such embryos may also be donated to a 'commissioning' woman or a 'commissioning' couple and gestated by a surrogate where, for example, the 'commissioning' woman or the woman of the 'commissioning' couple is infertile and is unable to bring a pregnancy to full term on medical grounds, or is unwilling for social, medical or other reasons, to do so.

Its local government area is the City of Moonee Valley. At the , Aberfeldie had a population of 3,897. Aberfeldie is bounded in the west by Afton Street, in the north by Buckley Street, in the east by Waverley Street and the edge of Aberfeldie Park, and in the south by the Maribyrnong River. History Scotsman James Robertson named his property Aberfeldie, located on the corner of Aberfeldie Street and Park Crescent, after the town Aberfeldy in Scotland. When the property was sold in 1888 it became the name of the suburb. The Polish Catholic church on the corner of Alma Street and Aberfeldie Street was consecrated in 1973 by Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, who later became Pope John Paul II. Today The area has tended to attract families, with its abundance of parks, sporting facilities and the Maribyrnong River. There is a range of detached housing from inter-war California bungalows to post-war dwellings. Sport Community groups have been active in the suburb since the start of the 20th century. Aberfeldie Bowls Club was established on 16 March 1910. In 1928 the Aberfeldie Progress Association joined with 6 other progress associations to form the Northern Districts Progress Cricket Association. In 1944 the Aberfeldie Community Centre was established promoting football, cricket, tennis, lawn bowls, gymnastics, swimming and basketball, as well as other social and cultural events. This led to the formation of the Aberfeldie Sports Club (formed in 1974; incorporated in 1987) a family oriented club that began as a community-based sporting organisation in 1948 and today is the home of local grass-roots Australian Rules Football and cricket. It first entered a football team in the 1951 season. Aberfeldie Football Club is now part of the Essendon District Football League and the Aberfeldie Cricket Club is under the jurisdiction of the Victorian Turf Cricket Association and the North West Cricket Association. Even with three senior football teams and four senior cricket teams, it must be acknowledged that the club’s biggest future strength lies with the many junior football players where the club fields 15 junior teams that comprise well over 350 children each year. The club’s large junior base continually helps solidify them as one of the area's strongest local clubs. The club enjoys a large supporter and sponsorship base which is controlled by the Aberfeldie Sports Club. The Sports Club oversees the sub- committees running Senior and Junior Football as well as Senior and Junior Cricket and whose main roles are in respect of fundraising for the Club. Educational facilities Aberfeldie has one government primary school (Aberfeldie PS) and two Catholic primary schools (Our Lady of Nativity PS and Resurrection School), and one Catholic secondary school (Ave Maria College). Transport The suburb is serviced by the following bus routes operating around the area: *465 Essendon – Keilor Park via Buckley Street, Milleara SC, Keilor East (every day). Operated by Ryan Brothers Bus Service, along Buckley Street. *467 Moonee Ponds – Aberfeldie via (every day). Operated by Ryan Brothers Bus Service, on the corner of Tilba Street and Brunel Street. *468 Highpoint SC – Essendon via Waverley Street (Monday to Saturday).

History In 912 he was kidnapped in the Adriatic by a Serb prince of Zachlumia by the name of Mihailo Višević while returning with the Doge's son from an official visit to Constantinople. Bulgaria was at war with Byzantium, the sovereign of Venice, so the coastal prince, who was a Bulgarian ally, dispatched him to Emperor Simeon I of Bulgaria, hoping he would push off Petar Gojniković's domination in the area. He was elected by the popular assembly. It seems that he was not related to the Participazio family that had already given many doges to the city. (There was a prior Orso II Participazio who vied for dogeship in about 887 but appears to have been entirely unrelated.) As soon as elected, he sent his son Pietro to Constantinople in order to re- establish the relationships with the Byzantine emperor, which his predecessors had neglected. Pietro was named protospatharios, which was corrupted to Baduario and, eventually, to Badoer (pronounced “Badoèr”), which became a prominent name among successive generations of Venetian nobility. The Adriatic was still plagued by Dalmatian, Saracen, and Narentine pirates, but the Doge took no action. Under his leadership, Venice acquired a mint. In 932, he withdrew to the monastery of Saint Felice in Ammiana, where he led a monastic life until his death. He was buried there. His portrait is placed in the church of the Madonna of the Garden.

General Assembly (UNGA) responsible for helping to facilitate international trade and investment. Established by the UNGA in 1966, UNCITRAL's official mandate is \\"to promote the progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law\\" through conventions, model laws, and other instruments that address key areas of commerce, from dispute resolution to the procurement and sale of goods. UNCITRAL carries out its work at annual sessions held alternately in New York City and Vienna, where it is headquartered.  History  When world trade began to expand dramatically in the 1960s, national governments began to realize the need for a global set of standards and rules to harmonize national and regional regulations, which until then governed international trade.  Membership  UNCITRAL's original membership comprised 29 states, and was expanded to 36 in 1973, and again to 60 in 2004. Member states of UNCITRAL are representing different legal traditions and levels of economic development, as well as different geographic regions. States includes 12 African states, 15 Asian states, 18 European states, 6 Latin American and Caribbean states, and 1 oceanian state. The Commission member States are elected by the General Assembly. Membership is structured so as to be representative of the world's various geographic regions and its principal economic and legal systems. Members of the commission are elected for terms of six years, the terms of half the members expiring every three years. As at 3 July 2017, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law will be composed of the following member States: = Africa = * (2016) * (2022) * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) * (2017) * (2022) * (2062) * (2019) =Asia= * (2022) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) * (2019) * (2022) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) =Europe= * (2019) * (2022) * (2022) * (2019) * (2022) * (2019) * (2013) * (2013) * (2013) * (2019) * (2016) * (2019) * (2012) * (2016) * (2013) * (2016) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) =North America= * (2019) * (2025) * (2019) * (2019) * (2022) =Oceania= * (2022) =South America= * (2016) * (2022) * (2022) * (2022) * (2022) * (2025) * (2022) The methods of work are organized at three levels. The first level is UNCITRAL itself (The Commission), which holds an annual plenary session. The second level is the intergovernmental working groups which is developing the topics on UNCITRAL's work program. Texts designed to simplify trade transactions and reduce associated costs are developed by working groups comprising all member States of UNCITRAL, which meet once or twice per year. Non-member States and interested international and regional organizations are also invited and can actively contribute to the work since decisions are taken by consensus, not by vote. Draft texts completed by these working groups are submitted to UNCITRAL for finalization and adoption at its annual session. The International Trade Law Division of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs provides substantive secretariat services to UNCITRAL, such as conducting research and preparing studies and drafts. This is the third level, which assists the other two in the preparation and conduct of their work.  Activities  UNCITRAL is * Coordinating the work of active organizations and encouraging cooperation among them. * Promoting wider participation in existing international conventions and wider acceptance of existing model and uniform laws. * Preparing or promoting the adoption of new international conventions, model laws and uniform laws and promoting the codification and wider acceptance of international trade terms, provisions, customs and practice, in collaboration, where appropriate, with the organizations operating in this field. * Promoting ways and means of ensuring a uniform interpretation and application of international conventions and uniform laws in the field of the law of international trade. * Collecting and disseminating information on national legislation and modern legal developments, including case law, in the field of the law of international trade. * Establishing and maintaining a close collaboration with the UN Conference on Trade and development. * Maintaining liaison with other UN organs and specialized agencies concerned with international trade.  Conventions  A convention is an agreement among participating states establishing obligations binding upon those States that ratify or accede to it. A convention is designed to unify law by establishing binding legal obligations. To become a party to a convention, States are required formally to deposit a binding instrument of ratification or accession with the depository. The entry into force of a convention is usually dependent upon the deposit of a minimum number of instruments of ratification. UNCITRAL conventions: *the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention) (1958) *the Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods (1974) *the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea (1978) *the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) *the United Nations Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes (1988) *the United Nations Convention on the Liability of Operators of Transport Terminals in International Trade (1991) *the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit (1995) *the United Nations Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade (2001) *the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (2005) *the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (2008) *the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (2015) *the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation (the Singapore Convention on Mediation) (2018)  Model laws  Model laws are legislative text that is recommended to States for enactment as part of their national laws. Model laws are generally finalized and adapted by UNCITRAL, at its annual session, while conventions requires the convening of a diplomatic conference. *UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985) (text) *UNCITRAL Model Law on International Credit Transfers (1992) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services (1994) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (2001) *UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation (2002) (text) *Model Legislative Provisions on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects (2003) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Secured Transactions (2016) *UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (2017) *UNCITRAL Model Law on the Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency-Related Judgments (2018) *UNCITRAL Model Legislative Provisions on Public-Private Partnerships (2020) UNCITRAL also drafted the: *UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) (text)—revised rules will be effective August 15, 2010; pre-released, July 12, 2010 *UNCITRAL Conciliation Rules (1980) *UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1982) *UNCITRAL Notes on Organizing Arbitral Proceedings (1996)  CLOUT (Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts)  The Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts system is a collection of court decisions and arbitral awards interpreting UNCITRAL texts. CLOUT includes case abstracts in the six United Nations languages on the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) (Vienna, 1980) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985). Legislative Guides A legislative guide aims to provide a detailed analysis of the legal issues in a specific area of the law, proposing efficient approaches for their resolution in the national or local context. Legislative guides do not contain articles or provisions, but rather recommendations. Legislative Guides are developed by the UNCITRAL Working Groups and subsequently finalized by the UNCITRAL Commission in its annual session. UNCITRAL has adopted the following legislative guides: *UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects (2000) *UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law (2004) *UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions (2007) *UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions: Supplement on Security Rights in Intellectual Property (2010)For an analysis of the travaux preparatoire which lead to this legislative guide see Andrea Tosato, The UNCITRAL Annex on security rights in IP: a work in progress (2009) Journal of intellectual property law and Practice 743  See also  * United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee (Legal) * United Nations Office of Legal Affairs  References  External links  * UNCITRAL Official website * What's new at UNCITRAL?

It had its premiere Off-Broadway in 1993 at Primary Stages,All in the Timing primarystages.org, accessed February 6, 2014 and was revived at Primary Stages in 2013.Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review. 'All in the Timing,' by David Ives, at 59E59 Theaters\\" The New York Times, February 12, 2013 It was first published by Dramatists Play Service in 1994, with a collection of six plays; however, the updated collection contains fourteen. The short plays are almost all comedies (or comedy-dramas), focusing mainly on language and wordplay, existentialist perspectives on life and meaning, as well as the complications involved in romantic relationships. High-school and college students frequently perform the plays, often due to their brevity and undemanding staging requirements. The Original Six PlaysAll in the Timing dramatists.com, accessed February 8, 2014 *Sure Thing: A man and a woman meet for the first time in a cafe, where they have an awkward meeting continually reset each time they say the wrong thing, until, finally, they romantically connect. *Words, Words, Words: Three chimpanzees, named after famous authors and expected to write Hamlet, for the most part waste time engaging in pointless banter, while occasionally inspired to make grandiose literary allusions. *The Universal Language: A man welcomes a naïve woman into his fraudulent language-learning course, in which he only speaks the invented language Unamunda; however, he confesses to the deception as he begins to fall in love with her. *Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread: A musical parody of minimalist composer Philip Glass. *The Philadelphia: At a restaurant, a man is informed by a friend that his frustratingly unlucky day is the result of his ensnarement in an anomalous pocket of reality, called a \\"Philadelphia,\\" in which he will only be fulfilled by asking for the opposites of what he wants. By the end, the man begins to feel content at last, only for his friend to be pulled also into the Philadelphia, while the waitress groans of her own entanglement in a \\"Cleveland.\\" *Variations on the Death of Trotsky: In comic fashion, revolutionary Leon Trotsky dies over and over again from a mountain-climber's axe-wound received many hours prior. Ultimately, Trotsky talks directly to his assassin who, while posing as a gardener, actually helped make some flowers in the garden grow. This sparks Trotsky to make his final philosophical statements on human life before he dies a final time. Other plays *Long Ago and Far Away: A married yuppie couple, about to move out of their apartment, argues about the nature of reality and becomes caught up in a bizarre scenario concluding in time travel and suicide; this is one of the few purely dramatic pieces in All in the Timing. *Foreplay, or The Art of the Fugue: Three miniature golf games taking place simultaneously, showing one man on three separate first dates. *Seven Menus: Seven dinners at the same restaurant, showing the evolution of one circle of friends. *Mere Mortals: Three blue-collar construction workers discuss how they are really the Lindbergh baby, the son of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, and the reincarnation of Marie Antoinette. *English Made Simple: A young man and woman meet at a party and their immediate romantic attraction is presented via loudspeaker by a comically unromantic grammar lesson, while they struggle to free themselves from the banal constrictions of party talk. *A Singular Kinda Guy: A monologue about a man who believes he is actually a typewriter. *Speed-the-Play: A parody of the works of American playwright David Mamet; his major works are each lampooned. *Ancient History: A couple discusses tradition and relationships before and after they hold a party; one of the few dramatic works in All in the Timing. Critical response The reviewer of the 2013 revival wrote: \\"...two decades later, these carefully constructed sketches, which highlight Ives' fascination with language, are still to be savored. Even when they occasionally miss their mark or wear out their welcome, the skits put most of the recent writing of Saturday Night Live to shame.... you don't have to be a great intellectual to fully appreciate any of the show's pieces. Certainly not the delicious opener, 'Sure Thing,' in which two strangers (Elrod and Rooth) replay their first meeting in a café with dozens of small changes until a romantic connection is forged...\\"Lipton, Brian Scott. \\"Review.

Historically the breed has been known for at least 400 years, but its origins are probably as old as the Hittite civilization. These horses are noted for their endurance and ease to adapt in difficult environments. History The Kabarda has been bred since the 16th century by mountain tribesmen in the northern Caucasus, and is the product of centuries of selective breeding for the ability to survive in harsh conditions. The Kabarda breed was formed from a combination of steppe horses, the Karabakh, the Arabian and the Turkoman. The breed are usually kept in herds, and are moved between mountain pastures in the summer and foothills areas in the winter.\\"Kabarda\\" . Oklahoma State University. Referenced January 13, 2008. A theory exists that Kabardian and Cleveland Bay breeds may have common origins. At the beginning of the 20th century, Count Stroganov began a program of crossing Kabardas with Arabians, and the results were considered satisfactory. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the numbers of Kabarda were hugely reduced, and during the 1920s efforts were made to re-establish the breed. Between 1935 and 1953, the purebred population averaged 446 stallions and 3272 mares. During early half of the twentieth century, a new breed, called the Anglo-Kabarda was formed by crossing Kabardas with Thoroughbreds, and in 1966 the new breed was recognized. By the late 1980s the number of purebred Kabarda breeding mares had dropped to between 400 and 450, concentrated mainly at the Malokarachaevski and Malkinski studs and other breeding farms in the Kabardino-Balkaria region, including the Krasny Partizan collective farm in the Stavropol territory. Sir William Allan \\"A Circassian chief preparing his stallion\\" (1843) Breed Characteristics The Kabarda stands high, with a coat that is bay, black, or gray.Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies. Bongianni, Maurizio. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 1988, pg. 61. They are a solid, cleanly built horse with a clean head, a well-muscled neck, medium-high withers, a deep chest, long, sloping shoulders, a short, solid back, and a muscular, slightly sloping croup. Their legs are correctly set, with clean, well-developed joints and hard hooves. The Kabardas' blood has a heightened oxidizing capacity, useful for work high in the mountains. The breed also is an easy keeper, that is, it has a tendency to accumulate fat quickly, which helps when the horses are exposed to extreme conditions on a regular basis, but can be a hardship for owners when the horses are kept stabled. =Sub-Types= There are three main subtypes of the Kabarda breed: *Basic type – This is the predominant type, a typical mountain riding horse that is rangy but well-muscled. *Oriental type – This type shows a more Arabian influence, with smaller heads, very clean legs, thinner skins, and hotter temperaments. *Massive type – This type is bigger, with a more robust bone structure similar to a typical carriage horse. Uses The Kabarda horse has been bred for stony and mountainous terrain. The breed is usually fast and has good endurance. They are often used as a sport horse outside of Russia, and for the creation and improvement of other breeds, such as the Anglo- Kabarda, the Tersky, and native stock in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Although they are mainly used as a saddle horse, they have work well in harness and as a pack horse. The mountain tribesmen of the Caucasus make hay on steep slopes by hitching Kabardas to horse-drawn mowers.

They hailed from Leeds, England and were seldom out of the Independent charts between 1980 and 1984 when the band split. The band were Shonna Rzonca – vocals, Dave Ryan – guitar, Harry Harrison – bass, Nev Nevison – drums. In 2002 the singer Rzonca reformed the band with new members. History The band formed in 1976 and initially consisted of Phil \\"Shonna\\" Rzonca on vocals, Dave Ryan on guitar, Daves cousin Robert Welch on bass guitar, and Phils brother Adam Rzonca on drums.Glasper, Ian (2004) \\"Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984\\", Cherry Red Books, The name Abrasive Wheels was inspired by Rzonca's engineering apprenticeship, where signs stating \\"Danger! Abrasive Wheels!\\" were regularly seen. They made their first public appearance at a friend's party in 1977, which was followed by a Rock Against Racism gig at Leeds Polytechnic. They were given a support slot opening for the UK Subs in Bradford, after which Adam and Rob left the band, they made contact with Leeds-born drummer Martin Taylor who began to play drums with the band and went on to record a demo tape at September Sound studios in Huddersfield. Martin left the band after several appearances on the Slaughter and the Dogs tour support to pursue his own musical projects. At this time they employed the services of a mutual friend on Bass, eventually both were replaced by Mark Holmes and Dave Hawkridge. With this line-up the band recorded their first demo, and toured with Slaughter & the Dogs. After losing money trying to get a record released by a London label Dave and Rzonca financed their own EP, releasing it on their Abrasive Records label. Hawkridge and Holmes then left, to be replaced by \\"Harry\\" Harrison on bass and \\"Nev\\" Nevison on drums, both previously of The Urban Zones, this is considered by Rzonca to be the band's first \\"proper\\" line-up. The EP was picked up by Red Rhino distribution and soon sold out of its 3000 pressing, reaching number 35 on the UK Indie Chart. The band then signed to Riot City Records and issued the Vicious Circle EP, which was followed by a re-release of their debut EP, both again indie hits.Strong, Martin C. (1999) \\"The Great Alternative & Indie Discography\\", Canongate, Their debut album, When the Punks Go Marching In, was released later in 1982. They then signed to Clay Records, and released a cover version of Elvis Presley's \\"Jailhouse Rock\\". Their second album,> Black Leather Girl was released in March 1984, displaying a much slicker and glossier sound with vocal harmonies, but after a further single, the band split later that year after a lengthy international tour. Rzonca worked as a taxi driver before opening pizza parlours in Leeds, and working on the local market. Rzonca formed a new version of the band in 2002, with Dave, Harry and Nev, and Steve Popplewell on second guitar. Dave, Harry and Nev left after several gigs. A new album was written and recorded during this brief time but has never been released. Rzonca and Popplewell continued, recruiting Eden, Chris, and Skruff. A new album, SKuM, was released in 2009. Recent line up changes: Skruff left the band in 2010 and was replaced by Mickey Waddington. Following their European tour, Eden left the band in 2011. Jordan Woodhead joined on guitar in 2013 followed by Mat Black in 2014 also on guitar duties along with Lloyd Rees-Carr on drums where they then went into a process of writing & recording new songs for a new album and started to gig locally to get back onto the scene. A slot at the Rebellion Festival followed in August 2014 in front of a packed house. Jordan & Lloyd left due to conflicts within the band at the end of 2014.

Berthoud in a 19th-century photograph Captain Edward Louis Berthoud was a military officer, statesman and engineer in the western United States during the late 19th century. He is primarily known as the chief engineer and secretary of the Colorado Central Railroad during its expansion throughout Colorado in the 1870s. The town of Berthoud, Colorado, as well as Berthoud Pass in the Rocky Mountains west of Denver, are named for him. Biography Berthoud was born Edouard Louis Berthoud (pronounced \\"bare-too\\") in Geneva, Switzerland on March 29, 1828. He came to the United States in 1830 with his parents and spent his childhood along the Mohawk River and in Oneida County in Upstate New York. In the United States, the family Americanized the pronunciation of their name to \\"ber-thud\\". Berthoud graduated with a degree in engineering from Union College in 1849. In the early 1850s he worked as a surveyor on the Panama Canal. In 1855, he was living in Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory where he became interested in the effort to build the first transcontinental railroad. In 1860, during the Colorado Gold Rush, Berthoud and his wife Helen settled in the western part of the territory in the new town of Golden. Helen was a daughter of a founding Golden family, the Ferrells, and an original street of the town was named in her honor. In 1861, the town became part of the Colorado Territory. Berthoud spent much of his career surveying roads and railways throughout the region, and became an active citizen in Golden. In 1861, in an effort to establish a more direct route from Denver to Salt Lake City, he surveyed the first road to Middle Park and discovered and surveyed the pass that now bears his name (current route of U.S. Highway 40). He also named Vasquez Peak. In 1862, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, he volunteered for the Union Army and received a commission in the 2nd Colorado Volunteer Infantry. That same year he received commendations for his design of fortifications to save Jefferson City, Missouri, during a rebel attack. He returned to Golden in 1866 and proceeded to run for the Colorado Legislature. He also served as the librarian of the Colorado Territorial Library in Golden from 1867–1868. As a member of the legislature, he helped authorize the foundation of the Colorado School of Mines and served as the college's first registrar, and on its Board of Trustees. Berthoud surveyed the lines of the Colorado Central Railroad, the first railroad to penetrate the Colorado mountains, and he became the longtime proprietor of the Overland Hotel in downtown Golden. Berthoud served as the Colorado State Historian and was Mayor of Golden from 1890–1891. Berthoud died in Golden in 1910 as a result of injuries sustained in a fall at the Overland, joining his wife who preceded him in the 1880s. The Colorado School of Mines dedicated Berthoud Hall in his honor in 1940.

It was first published in December 1892 and is regarded as one of Ibsen's most significant and revealing works. Performance The play was published by Gyldendal AS in Copenhagen in 1892 and its first performance was on 19 January 1893 at the Lessing Theatre in Berlin, with Emanuel Reicher as Solness. It opened at the Trafalgar Theatre in London the following month, with Herbert H. Waring in the name part and Elizabeth Robins as Hilda. The English translation was by the theatre critic William Archer and poet Edmund Gosse. Productions in Oslo and Copenhagen were coordinated to open on 8 March 1893. In the following year, the work was staged by Théâtre de l'Œuvre, the international company based in Paris. The first U.S. performance was at the Carnegie Lyceum in New York on 16 January 1900, with William Pascoe and Florence Kahn. Characters * Halvard Solness, master builder * Aline Solness, his wife * Doctor Herdal, physician * Knut Brovik, formerly an architect, now in Solness's employment * Ragnar Brovik, Knut Brovik's son, a draftsman * Kaia Fosli, a book-keeper * Hilda Wangel, a character introduced earlier, in Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea  Plot summary  Halvard Solness is a middle-aged master builder of a small town in Norway who has become a successful architect of some distinction and local reputation. One day while having a visit from his friend Doctor Herdal, Solness is visited by Hilda Wangel, a young woman of 23, whom Doctor Herdal recognizes from a recent trip that he had taken. The doctor leaves, Solness is alone with Hilda, and she reminds him that they are not strangers - they have previously met in her home town 10 years ago when she was 13 years old. When Solness does not respond immediately, she reminds him that at one point during their encounter he had made advances to her, had offered her a romantic interlude, and promised her \\"a kingdom\\", all of which she believed. He denies this. She gradually convinces him, however, that she can assist him with his household duties, and so he takes her into his home. Solness is also the manager of an architectural office in which he employs Knut Brovik, his son Ragnar Brovik, and Kaia Fosli. Kaia and Ragnar are romantically linked, and Ragnar has ambitions to become promoted in his architectural vocation, which Solness is reluctant to grant or support. Solness also has a complicated relationship with his wife Aline, and the two are revealed to have lost children some years ago as a result of a fire. During this time, Solness builds a closer tie with Hilda while she is in his home, and she supports his architectural vocation and new projects. During the construction of his most recent project which includes a towering steeple, Hilda learns that Solness suffers from acrophobia, a morbid fear of extreme heights, but nonetheless she encourages him to climb the steeple to the top at the public opening of the newly completed building. Solness, inspired by her words, achieves the top of the tower, when he suddenly loses his footing and crashes to his death on the ground before the spectators who have arrived for the opening of the new building. Among the spectators standing aghast at the sight, only Hilda comes forward as if in silent triumph. She waves her shawl and cries out with wild intensity. “My—my Master Builder!”  Plot interpretation  The search for a meaning, or interpretation has engaged and often bewildered audiences and critics all over the world. It is seen as an exploration of the author’s autobiographical history, or of issues dealing with youth versus maturity, or of issues of psychology, and other possible interpretations.Ibsen, Henrik. Meyer, Michael Leverson. editor. Ibsen Plays: 1: Ghosts; The Wild Duck; The Master Builder. Dramatists Play Service Inc. (1980) . page 241 Halvard Solness, the master builder, has become the most successful builder in his home town by a fortunate series of coincidences for him which were the chance misfortunes of his competitors. He had previously conceived these fortunate coincidences in his mind, powerfully wished for them to come to pass, but never actually did anything about them. By the time his wife's ancestral home was destroyed by a fire in a clothes cupboard, he had already imagined how he could cause such an accident and then profit from it by dividing the land on which the house stood into plots and covering it with homes for sale. Between this fortuitous occurrence and some chance misfortunes of his competitors, Solness comes to believe that he only has to wish for something to happen in order for it to come about.Master Builder, Act 2: \\"desiring...craving ...willing a thing...so persistently that it has to happen\\" He rationalises this as a particular gift from God, bestowed so that, through his unnatural success, he can carry out God's ordained work of church building.Act 3: \\"He...gave me leave to lord it just as [I] pleased...so that I might build all the more glorious churches for him\\". Realism fused with symbolism This play contains realistic and symbolic elements fused together. It represents a movement from his earlier realistic plays, such as A Doll's House, into a more symbolic style. It begins with realistic characters being presented, and then as the story progresses, it shifts into the inner world of the mind of the leading character.Hornby, Richard. Drama, Metadrama and Perception. Associated University Press (1986) p. 165 The setting and plot of The Master Builder can be taken as one of realism: the destructive outcome of a middle-aged, professional man's infatuation with a younger, teasing woman or, as critic Desmond MacCarthy describes this concept of the work: the tragedy of an \\"elderly architect who falls off his scaffold while trying to show off before a young lady\\".Quoted in If, however, one takes Solness's belief in his powers at their face value, the play also can be a lyrical and poetic fairy tale, in the manner of Peer Gynt travelling the Earth in his magical adventures while the faithful Solveig waits for his return. On stage, both interpretations are possible, but it is difficult to give equal weight to both meanings in the same production. Autobiographical elements At the time Ibsen was working on The Master Builder, he was taking a holiday in the mountain resort of Gossensass and spending much time with Emilie Bardach, an 18-year-old Viennese student with whom he found a temporary, \\"high, painful happiness\\" in a brief affair. The real-life prototype of Hilda made no secret of her delight at stealing husbands. \\"She did not get a hold of me\\", Ibsen was later to claim, \\"but I got hold of her — for my play\\".Archer (1893) Theatre director Harold Clurman notes that many interpreters of Ibsen's text have associated his frequent references in the play to Hilda as a \\"bird of prey\\" with Bardach's predatory behaviour. After leaving Gossensass, Ibsen carried on a correspondence with Bardach, but he continued to see Helene Raff, an acquaintance of Bardach whom he had also met that summer. It was Raff who told Ibsen the story of the architect of St. Michael's Church, Munich, who had cast himself from the tower as soon as it was finished. Ibsen took this tale, a common legend at many German churches, as evidence of a pervasive human belief that a man could not achieve success without paying a price. From Ibsen's inscription in the copy of the play he sent to Raff (he sent no copy to Bardach), she too can be regarded as an inspiration for the unequal affair between Hilda and Solness. Templeton, Joan (1997). Ibsen's women. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. p. 248. An equally obvious influence is Ibsen's relationship with Hildur Andersen, whom he met as the 10-year-old child of friends and who, when she had reached the age of 27, became his constant companion. He wrote of Hildur as \\"his bird of the woods\\", the phrase he initially uses to describe his character Hilda, but the character refuses this, accepting only that she is a \\"bird of prey\\", as was Bardach. The character of Hilda is a blend of all three women, but Hildur Andersen was the most significant.Templeton (1997: 262) The autobiographical elements Ibsen includes go further than his relationships with Bardach, Raff and Andersen: In the character of Solness, Ibsen is drawing parallels with his own situation as the \\"master playwright\\" and the consequences in his own life. That Ibsen was offering a parable was noted in a review of the first London staging, when the joint translator, Edmund Gosse, was asked to explain the meaning of the work. \\"An allegory of Dr Ibsen's literary career\\", he replied. Reception Following the controversy attached to Ghosts, with its sensitive topic of inherited syphilis, the play's reception in London was not favourable. The more charitable reviews took Solness at his own assessment, as a madman, and decided the other two protagonists were mad as well. Some transferred the conclusion to Ibsen, his translators and his director. Even The Pall Mall Gazette, a champion of Ibsen's work, offered sympathy to the \\"daring\\" actors whose mediocre talents were unable to relieve the tedium of this lapse on the part of the \\"northern genius\\". The Daily Graphic, however, found the performances of Waring and Robins the \\"redeeming feature\\" of the production. At the end of the run at the Trafalgar Theatre, the two principals engaged a new supporting cast and secured a transfer to the nearby Vaudeville Theatre but, again, reviews were hostile.  Criticism  The Master Builder was the first work Ibsen wrote upon his return to Norway from Europe in July 1891. It is usually grouped with Ibsen's other works written during this late period of Ibsen's life such as Little Eyolf, John Gabriel Borkman, When We Dead Awaken, and Hedda Gabler. Early reactions to the play by Ibsen's critics were mixed, possibly due its heightened ambiguities. Hilda, for example, seems to alternate roles between an inspiring force, urging Solness to temper his rampant ambition and so find real happiness, and a temptress, pushing Solness to commitments he cannot possibly fulfill. English critic William Archer (the play's original translator) suggests that the play is not as completely symbolic as some have maintained, interpreting it instead as \\"a history of a sickly conscience, worked out in terms of pure psychology\\". He notes that, in this regard, the play is similar to earlier works that deal mainly with a retrospective look at a character's psyche. Translations The authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 10-volume version of the Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen. The Kannada translation is titled Baalura Gudikaara written by B Suresh. It was performed by Vijayanagara Bimba in 2018(Temple Builder of Baaluru). Adaptation The play was performed in 1960 starring E. G. Marshall on the American television anthology series The Play of the Week. The 2008 Malayalam- language Indian film Aakasha Gopuram is an adaptation of the play. Directed by K.P. Kumaran, the film starred Mohanlal as Albert Samson, the master builder, and Nithya Menen as his wife. Development of the film began in late-1980s but Kumaran wanted the role of the master builder to be done by Mohanlal, and he had to wait for nearly two decades for Mohanlal to get the matured look of Halvard Solness. The film started filming in early-2008 and was released in August. The 2013 film A Master Builder (working title: Fear of Falling) was directed by Jonathan Demme. It stars Wallace Shawn who previously had translated and adapted it for the stage in collaboration with Andre Gregory. This stage adaptation was the basis for the film. The German director Michael Klette adapted this story for his movie Solness (2015).

He has been threatened and attacked on several occasions for his work, including being held hostage in his home in 2003 and being kidnapped and beaten in 2008. Zamora has received numerous international prizes and distinctions. He was awarded the Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University in 1994, he received an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists in 1994, he was named one of 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the 20th century by the International Press Institute in 2000, and in 2003 the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded him its International Journalism Award. Education and Early Career Zamora began working as a reporter in La Hora (\\"The Hour\\"), a newspaper owned by his family, when he was 17. He earned degrees in industrial engineering and business administration, and in 1986, founded ANC, a documentary and news production company in 1985. Siglo Veintiuno In 1990, Zamora founded his first newspaper, Siglo Veintiuno. The paper advocated judicial and tax reforms, and reported on dangerous subjects including narcotics smuggling, human rights issues, guerrilla groups, and corruption in the government of President Jorge Serrano. As a result, Zamora and the staff received death threats and were subject to physical attacks. Three years later, Guatemala saw a constitutional crisis, in which Serrano suspended the constitution and dissolved Congress. He also instituted press censorship, surrounding the Siglo Veintiuno offices with national police forces. During this period, Zamora satirized the censorship by renaming his paper Siglo Catorce (\\"14th Century\\") and running stories covered in solid blocks of ink; he also faxed uncensored versions of the stories to newspapers in neighboring countries. The International Press Institute credits this clandestine reporting with contributing to Serrano's condemnation by the international community and his eventual flight from the country. In May 1996, Zamora left the paper following disagreements with its board of directors. El Periódico Zamora's new newspaper, El Periódico, launched on November 6, 1996, funded by the donations of 125 citizens who supported his stand on press freedom. One year later, it was bought by the owners of Prensa Libre, Guatemala's best-selling newspaper. In 2001, the Periódico offices were attacked by a group of fifty protesters after reporting on alleged corruption in the staff of Communications Minister Luis Rabbé. The crowd attempted to force the building's doors and set it on fire, and Zamora was burned in effigy. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, police took more than forty minutes to respond and made no arrests. The newspaper conducted a lengthy investigation into links between the government of President Alfonso Portillo and organized crime, the results of which were published in November 2002. The government then sent auditors to the Periódico offices for 40 days, withdrawing them only after a complaint by the World Association of Newspapers (WAN).  Attacks on Zamora  Zamora has been attacked several times in connection with his reporting. In 1995, his car was driven off the road by two people who threatened to kill him for publishing allegations in Siglo Veintiuno that the military of Guatemala had links to organized crime. In May 1996, attackers drove past his parked car, throwing two grenades at it; Zamora was unhurt because neither he nor other passengers were in the car. In June 2003, Zamora and his family were held hostage in their home for hours by a group of eleven men and one woman. The attackers beat Zamora's children and forced him to strip and kneel at gunpoint. According to Zamora, one of the gang stated: \\"If you value your children stop bothering the people above. I don't know who you've annoyed high up the ladder, but we have orders that someone up high despises you. Whatever you do, do not report this.\\" The US government condemned the attack and called for an investigation. WAN also issued a statement on Zamora's behalf following the attack, calling on President Portillo to bring the attackers to justice and protect the safety of his nation's journalists. Portillo then unexpectedly visited Zamora to offer assistance, including allowing him access to a photographic database of government and armed forces members. In late January 2004, Zamora published the names and photographs of the men and woman he alleged to be his attackers in El Periódico; they included a senior member of Portillo's staff, an employee of the Attorney General, and a counter-intelligence specialist. Two years later, former member of the military Eduviges Funes was later sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment for his role in the attack. Another former soldier, Belter Álvarez, was acquitted. On August 20, 2008, Zamora was kidnapped and beaten after a dinner with friends in Guatemala City, and was left unconscious and nearly naked in Chimaltenango, away.  Awards  In 1995, Zamora and the Siglo Veintiuno staff won International Press Freedom Awards from the Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognize courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. In the same year, he won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University \\"for promoting press freedom and inter-American understanding\\". In 2000, he was named one of 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the 20th century by the International Press Institute. The citation stated that \\"Zamora and Siglo Veintiuno were in the forefront of a civilian resistance that forced President Jorge Serrano Elias to relinquish his post after he attempted to seize dictatorial power in 1993.\\" The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded him its International Journalism Award in 2003. In Guatemala, he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the Professional College of Engineers in 2014 and as an Illustrious Graduate of the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala in 2015. He was also awarded the Myrna Mack Prize for the defense of human rights by the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission in 2015.

He introduced the first Labour broadcast, in 1951, in which he talked with Sir Hartley Shawcross. Mayhew also became known as one of the fiercest opponents of unilateral nuclear disarmament in the Labour Party. He also served as Shadow War Secretary from 1960 to 1961 and as a spokesman on foreign affairs from 1961 to 1964. When Labour took office in 1964 Mayhew was appointed as Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy. However, in 1966, after the Wilson government decided to shift British airpower from carrier-based planes to land-based planes and cancel the CVA-01 aircraft carrier programme, Mayhew resigned along with the First Sea Lord, Sir David Luce. In 1973 Mayhew offered £5,000 to anyone who could produce evidence that Nasser had stated that he sought to \\"drive the Jews into the sea\\". Mayhew repeated the offer later in the House of Commons (Hansard, 18 October 1973) and broadened it to include any genocidal statement by an Arab leader (The Guardian, 9 September 1974), while reserving for himself the right to be the arbiter of the authenticity of any purported statements as well as their meaning. Mayhew received several letters from claimants, each one producing one quotation or another from an Arab leader, all of which Mayhew deemed to be fabricated. One claimant, Warren Bergson, took Mayhew to court. The case came before the High Court in February 1976. Bergson was unable to offer evidence of Nasser's alleged statement and acknowledged that, after thorough research, he had been unable to find any statement by a responsible Arab leader that could be described as genocidal. =Move to Liberal Party= Mayhew had been feeling increasingly uneasy with Labour policies under Harold Wilson and in 1974 he moved to the Liberals, being the first Member of Parliament to cross the floor to the Liberals in several decades. In the general election in October 1974 Mayhew contested Bath instead of Woolwich East in order not to split his former constituency party. He was defeated in Bath, which he also unsuccessfully contested in 1979. On 6 July 1981 Mayhew became a life peer with the title Baron Mayhew, of Wimbledon in Greater London, and became the Liberals' spokesman on defence in the House of Lords. Other activities Mayhew was also active as an advocate for the mentally ill and served as Chairman of MIND (National Association for Mental Health) from 1992 to 1997. He wrote several books, including Publish It Not: The Middle East Cover-Up (co-written with Michael Adams, 1975) and his autobiography, Time To Explain (1987). Panorama experiment In 1955 Mayhew took part in an experiment that was intended to form a Panorama special for BBC TV, but was never broadcast. Under the guidance of his friend Humphry Osmond, Mayhew ingested 400 mg of mescaline hydrochloride and allowed himself to be filmed for the duration of the trip. Samples of the audio were used in the psychedelic dance tracks \\"Mayhew Speaks Out\\" and \\"Christopher Mayhew Says\\" by the band the Shamen. Part of the footage was included in the BBC documentary LSD – The Beyond Within (1986). Personal life In 1949, he married Cicely Ludlam, whom he met when she was one of few women in the diplomatic service, and they had two sons and two daughters.

Evans was born in Warwick, England, migrating to Australia in October 1802. Early career In 1803, Evans was appointed acting Surveyor General of New South Wales whilst Charles Grimes was on leave in England. In 1804, Evans explored the Warragamba River and upstream to the present site of the Warragamba Dam. Later removed from the position by Governor Philip Gidley King he was posted to the position of Assistant Surveyor by Lieutenant-Governor William Paterson. Evans surveyed the shores of Jervis Bay and inland to Appin leading the way to the settlement of the Illawarra region. Probably because of his success it was Governor Lachlan Macquarie who instructed him to find a passage to the west. Exploration of the inlandConfirmatory Blue Mountains expedition, 1813= On 13 November 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie sent Evans across the Blue Mountains into the Wiradjuri nation of central-western New South Wales to confirm the findings of the exploration party of Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth. He was the first European to record meeting with the Wiradjuri people of the region. Evans generally followed the route of Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth, reaching the end of their route on 26 November 1813 at a point and had Evans named Mount Blaxland. Evan's party then moved on and visited the Fish River area and further west near the junction of the now named Fish and Campbell Rivers and described two plains in his view, the O'Connell Plains and the Macquarie Plains. It was on 9 December that he reached the site of present-day Bathurst. After the explorations that took seven weekshttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article628863 Governor Macquarie awarded Evans £100 and 1000 acres of land near Richmond in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). Evans departed for Van Diemen's Land in 1814 but was back in NSW by 1815 to continue inland explorations. =First Lachlan River expedition, 1815= In May 1815, Evans set off from Bathurst at the direction of governor Macquarie, on an expedition to explore the Lachlan River. He became the first colonial explorer to enter the Lachlan Valley, in the Central West region of New South Wales. Evans was Deputy Surveyor-General and named the area the Oxley Plains after his superior, the Surveyor-General, John Oxley. A cairn on the North Logan Road, 13 kilometres from Cowra was unveiled in 1978 on private property to mark the site where Evans, accompanied by his exploring party comprising George Kane (alias Thos. Appledore), James Butler, Patrick Byrne and John Tighe, sighted the Lachlan River and named the surrounding district, Oxley's Plains in 1815.http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/landscape/exploration/display/20943-george- evans-expedition. Accessed 20 April 2018 He was also the first European to visit the Abercrombie and Belubula River Valleys, and the first through the areas that now include the towns of Boorowa and Cowra. On 1 June 1815 George William Evans and his group marked a tree at the junction of the Lachlan river and a creek which he named Byrnes Creek (after Patrick Byrnes, a convict member of his party). This junction is located in present-day Eugowra. This point was the furthest west any Europeans had travelled into the country. On 1 June 1815 Evans was running short of provisions so returned to Bathurst, where he arrived on 12 June 1815. This journey opened the way for later explorations, mainly by John Oxley. Evans took part in some of Oxley's expeditions. =Second Lachlan River expedition, 1817= Evans returned to Tasmania in 1817 but was again to return to New South Wales to journey with his superior John Oxley on travels into the Lachlan River areas. =Macquarie River expedition ending Port Macquarie, 1818= Evans set out on a second expedition to explore the Macquarie River, as assistant to Surveyor-General Oxley, departing from Bathurst in May 1818. This exploring expedition would follow the Macquarie River until it reached the Macquarie Marshes, and would finally end up on the east coast at Port Macquarie. In this expedition, Evans became the first white man to encounter the Castlereagh River. In early July 1818, the party was at Mt Harris, 48 km (30 miles) N-NW of present-day Warren, having returned from the Macquarie Marshes seemingly unable to follow the further course of the Macquarie. Oxley had to change his plans since he couldn't follow the Macquarie any further so he sent Evans on to scout ahead, with a small party, to attempt a north-easterly route across the plains and report back. Effectively, Evans would traverse a large loop, heading northeasterly then south westerly, westerly and back to his starting point. Beginning on 8 July 1818 in the north-easterly direction, he first crossed the Castlereagh River around Combara, between Gulargambone and Coonamble.Christison, Ray, Thematic History of Gilgandra Shire, \\"3.6 Historical Exploration of NSW\\" published 2009, p.26 The party then continued on a shallow north-easterly direction until reaching the foothills of the Warrumbungle mountains. From here, Evans started to head back to Oxley's encampment at Mt Harris by turning southwesterly, travelling across land he described as 'an open plain, over which was rather better travelling than we had latterly experienced'. This route brought his party back to the Castlereagh River at a more southerly point than his first crossing, in an area between the future villages of Armatree and Curban (15 miles apart). As he approached the Castlereagh River he described the country as 'low and wet' with their journey being 'dreadfully bad and marshy'. Once Evans' scouting party had returned, (17 July) the whole expedition departed on 19 July 1818 in the same north-easterly direction George Evans had taken. On 27 July they reached the Castlereagh, but it was now flooded since Evans' first crossing two weeks earlier. Only on 2 August did Evans again cross the Castlereagh near Combara, once there was a sufficient drop in the river level.http://www.higround.com.au/docs/GilgandraShire.pdf; This time on reaching the Warrumbungles south-east of their crossing, the party continued easterly through the Goorianawa Gap, on past the Liverpool Plains, and eventually reached the coast near Port Macquarie. John Oxley named the river that year in honour of the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, who had held the position since 1812. Later life and death Accusations were made about irregular payments made to Evans whilst in the Surveyor-General's position and he was despatched by ship to England to explain the matter to Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. He sailed for England on 14 November 1826. It appears Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur found it difficult to positively prove the accusations with a general loose attitude to payments within that office. Arthur even supported Evans' request for a retirement pension. Evans returned to New South Wales about six years later and was shown as a stationer / bookseller in Bridge Street, Sydney. The last ten years of his life was spent at Hobart Town, where he died on 16 October 1852. Evans' and his wife Lucy Parris' headstone is at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Evandale, moved from St John's Church, Newtown, Hobart, Tasmania Other activities Evans was known as an artist of some note, some of his aquatints and watercolours are held at the Dixson Library of New South Wales. He was also a teacher at King's School, an independent Anglican boarding school for boys in North Parramatta in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. Founded in 1831, it is Australia's oldest independent school. Memorials to Evans (1) A standing bronze portrait on a large rusticated sandstone plinth of Evans is located in Kings Parade (Park) at Bathurst in the Central Tablelands region of inland New South Wales. The memorial was built in 1913 by the citizens of Bathurst to commemorate the 100 years since his exploration of the Bathurst region. (2) Near Evans' first crossing of the Castlereagh River in July 1818, south of the township of Coonamble, a memorial has been erected commemorating this event. the plaque, set against a standing local stone, reads: \\"The Castlereagh River was discovered 2 km south of this point on 11 · 7 · 1818 / By Surveyor Evans, Second in Command of Oxley\`s Exploring Expedition.\\"http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/landscape/exploration/display/94285-discovery- of-castlereagh-river/photo/1 File:Faulconbridge_marker.JPG File:G_W_EVANS_marker_top.JPGMarker located in Corridor of Oaks, Faulconbridge File:Jgb-Footsteps in Time - 20050503.jpgEmu Plains 'Footsteps in time' marker File:Jgb-Plaque Closeup - 20050503.jpgDetail of the plaque on the Emu Plains marker See also * List of Blue Mountains articles * Bathurst, New South Wales * European exploration of Australia ReferencesExternal links Category:1780 births Category:1852 deaths Category:People from Tasmania Category:Explorers of Australia Category:People from Warwick Category:People from the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) Category:19th- century Australian public servants Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:Australian landscape painters Category:Australian booksellers Category:History of the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) ","title":"George Evans (explorer)"},{"id":"1611479","text":"Johan Borgen (1902-1979) Johan Collett Müller Borgen (28 April 1902 - 16 October 1979) was a Norwegian author, journalist and critic. His best-known work is the novel Lillelord for which he was awarded the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature in 1955. Biography He was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Poul Holst Borgen (1867–1941) and Andrea Elfrida Bommen (1868–1958). He was raised in the borough of Frogner as the youngest of four sons in the family of a successful attorney. He attended private schools; first at Frøenene Platous Forskole, then at Frogner Skole. He graduated artium in 1920. In 1923, Borgen received a part-time position as a journalist at Dagbladet. He started his column which featured a series of ironic and satirical articles writing under the pseudonym \\"Mumle Gåsegg\\". He was employed by Dagbladet from 1923–41 and by Morgenbladet from 1928–30. During the 1930s, he also translated books from different languages within a variety of genres. During the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he wrote a series of ironic, derogatory articles about the Nazi regime. Eventually he was arrested and sent to Grini concentration camp. He later escaped and continued to write against the occupation power. His illegal work was quickly rediscovered and he had to escape across the border with Sweden. After the liberation of Norway in 1945, he was a short-time editor of culture in the newspaper Friheten. During the period 1947–59, he worked as a stage instructor in Oslo and instructed over forty performances. Borgen was editor of the literary magazine Vinduet 1954–1959. In 1925, he debuted as a fictional author with the collection of novel Mot mørket. With the novel collection Hvetebrødsdager (1948), Borgen received his great artistic breakthrough, and he followed up with Noveller om kjærlighet (1952) and Natt og dag (1954). His semi-autobiographical novel Lillelord (1955) is his most famous book. Lillelord is the first book in the trilogy that also includes De mørke kilder and Vi har ham nå published in 1956 and 1957. Personal life From 1934 until his death in 1979, he was married to novelist Annemarta Evjenth Borgen (1913-1988). The couple were the parents of three children including author Brett Borgen (1934–2014).

Darklands is set in the Holy Roman Empire during the 15th century. While the geographic setting of the game is historically accurate, the game features many supernatural elements. Gameplay This type of gameplay is an early example of open world in role-playing video games. The player is free to complete quests that will give them a positive reputation, or to pursue a negative reputation by performing evil deeds. In Darklands the player's reputation is limited geographically, allowing the player to be simultaneously hated in one region and exalted in another. The setting for Darklands is medieval Europe as the inhabitants thought the world was at the time. All the cities that one's party may visit in the game are real places that existed in the Holy Roman Empire of the 15th century. Most are in modern- day Germany, but some are within the modern borders of other countries including Denmark, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. The city names given in the game are old German names of the cities, some of which are now exonyms; the new local names are given in parentheses. There are no other species available in character creation—all players are human and are differentiated by occupation. Any party member is capable of performing what are known as class-based feats in many other role-playing games, but skillful players usually improve the party member's skills only in the appropriate area. Thus, the equivalent of a cleric in this game would be someone who specializes in religious studies as well as healing skills. Because the character specializes in the above, however, does not preclude him or her from learning artifice skills, such as lock picking. Age is a factor, as characters will begin to lose physical prowess as they age. However, the older the player is when the character is generated, the more skills and better equipment he or she starts with. While the majority of the game uses text-based menus—enhanced with hand-painted illustrations describing the player party's available actions, the party's movement between cities and during battle uses a graphical user interface. The real-time combat is dependent not only on the characters' skills, but also the type and quality of weapons used against the enemy and its armor. For example, using swords against plate armored foes would be less effective than using hammers or maces. Plot The game is set in a historical fantasy version of medieval Europe, where monsters and magic actually exist. The plot is not linear and there is no set path for a player to follow. However, there is a main quest to follow in order to finish the game, which involves hunting witches and heretics. Darklands ends once the final battle is completed against the demon lord Baphomet, preventing the apocalypse. Baphomet can be found in a castle in an obscure part of the game map which can only be found after finding and defeating the evil occupants of various other fortresses around the game, in which the party can find information which will point it to the final location. According to the official clue book for the game, the final battle location, as well as the location of some other quests in the game, is randomized at the start of each new game. Development Darklands took almost three years to make and cost three million dollars, which was a very large sum for video game development at the time. According to the manual, \\"Darklands would have been impossible without the faith and vision of the management of MicroProse Software. We originally underestimated the time, complexity and cost of the project by a large factor. When development costs rose past the stratosphere, there was a great temptation to either give up or just 'publish whatever we've got', regardless of quality.\\" An Amiga version of Darklands was considered but the game was judged as too large to be played from a floppy disk and the potential market of hard disk equipped Amigas was not large enough. Release Darklands was released by MicroProse with a number of bugs, ranging from minor to major. These included many instances of what would now be called crash-to-desktop errors. Additionally, the \\"character colors bug\\" results in on-screen characters colors being replaced with random (often bright) colorings. Most of the bugs in the game were correctable by subsequently released patches. Before ubiquitous Internet connectivity, such patches were typically only available through BBS downloads by modem owners and informal person-to-person copying, and thus many people were only able to play the originally-released version. This gave Darklands a reputation as a buggy game. At least one third-party commercial character editor was advertised for Darklands. Darklands was supposed to be a first entry in a series of games with related settings, but no follow-up was ever made; sales were not high enough to justify a sequel, and the game engine was not reusable. It was later re-released by GOG.com as a downloadable title. Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1992 offered contrasting opinions. Scorpia liked the historical setting and use of religion but criticized Darklands repetitive encounters and—more seriously—many bugs and missing features, such as the inability to save within dungeons which, she reported, was a problem given the game's instability. She concluded that \\"the game ultimately brings little or no satisfaction when 'finished'.\\" Johnny L. Wilson acknowledged the bugs and repetitive nature but emphasized that \\"I still like the game\\", citing the importance of skills and an \\"open-ended feel and an element of free-will that I haven't previously experienced in a CRPG\\". In 1993, Scorpia called Darklands \\"perfect example of a fine idea ... gone wrong\\" with a \\"horrible ending\\", and \\"not a recommended game\\". Despite the bugs, the game was well received by other critics. It got 4 out of 5 stars in Dragon, which stated that Darklands \\"is a great adventure and is certainly one of the best multicharacter FRPGs we've had the delight to play. With well- drawn graphics, multiple quests, good character generation, and flexibility in play, the game's detail is phenomenal.\\" Alfred Giovetti writing for Compute! praised Darklands for the \\"multitude of choices you get, which surpass the complexity and historical accuracy seen in any other contemporary computer game\\" and that its \\"attention to detail is exemplary\\". The review concluded \\"MicroProse should be congratulated for a truly heroic effort in creating a game for sword, sorcery and history buffs.\\" Darklands was nominated for PC Games prize for the best role-playing game of 1992, but lost to Wizardry VII. The game also won the 1992 \\"PC Special Achievement Award\\" from Game Players magazine. Retrospectively, GameSpot featured Darklands on their lists of \\"The Greatest Games of All Time\\". Todd Howard cited the game as an influence on Bethesda Softworks' series The Elder Scrolls.

It is held on the Hanover Fairground in Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany. Typically, there are about 6,500 exhibitors and 250,000 visitors. The Hannover Messe started in 1947 in an undamaged factory building in Laatzen, south of Hanover, by an arrangement of the British military government in order to boost the economic advancement of post-war Germany. The first fair was colloquially known as Fischbrötchenmesse (Fischbrötchen fair) due to the exemptions in food rationing for the fair at this time. It proved hugely successful and was thence repeated on a yearly basis, contributing largely to the success of the Hanover fairground in replacing the then-East German city of Leipzig as the new major fair city for West Germany. The product portfolio includes building automation and technology, coating materials, air compressors, gas compressors, environmental technology, factory equipment, compressed air technology, micro-actuator systems, motors, scheduling software, refrigeration technology, robotics and additive manufacturing systems. In the 1980s, the growing information and telecommunication industry demanded the organizer Deutsche Messe AG to split the fair. CeBIT was a successful spin-off of the Hannover Messe.

Christian Krohg (13 August 1852 – 16 October 1925) was a Norwegian naturalist painter, illustrator, author and journalist. Krohg was inspired by the realism art movement and often chose motives from everyday life. He was the director and served as the first professor at the Norwegian Academy of Arts from 1909 to 1925. Biography Christian Krohg was born at Vestre Aker (now Oslo), Norway. He was one of five children born to Georg Anton Krohg (1817–1873) and Sophie Amalia Holst (1822–1861). He was a grandson of Christian Krohg (1777–1828) who had served as a government minister. His father was a civil servant, journalist and author. His mother died when he was only 8 years old, and his father's sister took over responsibility for the household and the upbringing of the children. From 1861, he attended Hartvig Nissen School. His father had asked him to pursue a legal career. Krohg studied law at the University of Oslo (then Christiania) graduating cand.jur. in 1873, the same year in which his father died. During 1869–70, he had also studied at the art school of Johan Fredrik Eckersberg at Lille Grensen in Christiania. He was additionally educated in Germany, first at the Baden School of Art in Karlsruhe under Hans Gude in 1874. He also trained under Karl Gussow from 1875. He followed with study at the Königliche Akademie in Berlin from 1875 to 1878. He was awarded the Schäffer's legacy (1876–77) and received a government travel allowance during 1877–78 and in 1881. In 1879, on the encouragement of artist Frits Thaulow, he visited the Skagen artists colony. He returned to Skagen in 1882–84 and 1888. Through his periodic future residence at Skagen, he would influence other artists including Anna and Michael Ancher and provided early support to Edvard Munch. Krohg worked in Paris from 1881 to 1882. Inspired by the ideas of the realists he chose motives primarily from everyday life – often its darker or socially inferior sides. Prostitution is the subject of his painting Albertine i politilægens venteværelse, and Krohg also wrote a novel about the depicted scene. The novel, Albertine, caused a scandal when first published, and it was confiscated by the police. Krohg's style made him a leading figure in the transition from romanticism to naturalism. Krohg was the founding and editor- in-chief of the Kristiania Bohemian journal, Impressionisten from 1886 until 1890. He then became a journalist for the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang from 1890 to 1910. Christian Krohg was also associated with Politiken 1893–1894. He taught at Académie Colarossi in Paris from 1902 until 1909. Later he became a professor-director at the Norwegian Academy of Arts (Statens Kunstakademi) from 1909 until 1925. There are notable collections of art by Christian Krohg in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and at Skagens Museum in Denmark. Awards and honors Christian Krohg received numerous national and international awards during his career. In 1889, he was made a Knight in the French Legion of Honour and entered in the Belgian Order of Leopold in 1894. He served as Norwegian Commissioner at the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers at Antwerp in 1894 and held membership in the Societe Nouvelle de Peintres et de Sculpteurs from 1900. Krohg was made a Knight 1st Class in the Order of St. Olav in 1900 and received the Command Cross in 1910. Personal life He was married to artist Oda Krohg (1860–1935). In 1885, their daughter Nana (1885–1974) was born and in 1889 their son muralist Per Lasson Krohg (1889–1965). In 1897, his wife took their son Per and moved to Paris with dramatist Gunnar Heiberg. They were later reconciled. In 1914, Christian Krohg established residence near Frogner Park where he died in 1925. Oda Krohg died in 1935. Both were buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund in Oslo. A bronze statue of Krohg by sculptors Per Hurum and Asbjørg Borgfelt was erected at the crossing of Lille Grensen-Karl Johans gate in Oslo in 1960.

Its origins lay in the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. After the accession of the state to the Indian Union in October 1947, the State Forces came under the command of the Indian Army. They remained in the original form until 1956 when Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly effectively ratified the state's accession to India. Then the State Forces became the Jammu and Kashmir Regiment of the Indian Army. In 1963, the designation was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Rifles. After the conversion, the Ladakh Scouts came under the aegis of the Regiment, where it remained until raised as a separate Regiment in 2002. History The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles has a unique regimental history. Its antecedents go back to the Dogra Corps raised by Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu in 1821. General Zorawar Singh led daredevil campaigns in northern areas like Ladakh, Baltistan, Gilgit, Hunza and Yagistan, consolidating smaller principalities and making the northern areas a part of the expanding dominions of Gulab Singh. He also mounted an invasion of Tibet in 1841. After the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir as independent princely state under the British Paramountcy in 1846, these troops became the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces. Action at Lukigura River on 24 June 1916. The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir maintained a larger number of State Forces than any other ruler of an Indian State under the British Raj. These forces were organized into the Jammu and Kashmir Brigades. They comprised a bodyguard cavalry regiment, two mountain batteries, seven infantry battalions, one training battalions and a transport unit consisting of both pack and mechanized transport. Several of these units served with distinction on the North-West Frontier of India and overseas during the Great War. The state forces fought as Imperial Service Troops in both the First and Second World Wars (under their own native officers). They distinguished themselves in East Africa, Palestine and Burma. =Kashmir War of 1947= The regiment's grimmest hour came during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. It was their heroic stand that gained time for the entry of the Indian Army and thus saved the Kashmir Valley. It may not be out of place to mention that the Indian people largely owe the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the heroic defensive stand made by the outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly motivated, J&K; State Force. They paid a steep price in blood and sacrificed over 76 officers, 31 JCOs and 1085 Other Ranks. For their gallant stand they earned three Maha Vir Chakra, 20 Vir Chakras and 52 Mentioned in Despatches. Later the Jammu and Kashmir State Force was absorbed en bloc into the Indian Army as a separate regiment. =Sino-Indian War of 1962= Two battalions of Jammu and Kashmir Rifles constituted the main fighting force of India in Aksai Chin during the Sino- Indian War of 1962. Supplemented by a battalion of the regular Indian Army, they fought \\"very well\\" according to scholar Steven Hoffman. China attacked them with a massive force of an entire division. =UN Peacekeeping Operations= A Jammu and Kashmir Rifles battalion was part of the UN force in Cambodia during 1990–93. Recruitment Much of the Army's Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry and Jammu and Kashmir Rifles Regiments are made of recruits from the districts of Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur, and Reasi, while other districts like Poonch, Rajouri, Doda and Kishtwar also contribute . Soldiers from Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Haryana also contribute to the ranks. Units The Jammu & Kashmir Rifles contingent passes through Rajpath during the 66th Republic Day Parade 2015 in New Delhi In 1947, the force had 9 infantry battalions and a cavalry regiment. It was subsequently raised to 21 battalions.

Saint Swithun Dedication of a church, probably representing Æthelwold, f. 118v The Benedictional of St. Æthelwold (London, British Library, Add MS 49598) is a 10th-century illuminated benedictional, the most important surviving work of the Anglo-Saxon Winchester School of illumination. It contains the various pontifical blessings used during Mass on the differing days of the ecclesiastical year along with a form for blessing the candles used during the Feast of the Purification. The manuscript was written by the monk Godeman at the request of Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester. The manuscript is decorated on an extremely lavish scale, and is generally accepted as the masterpiece of late Anglo-Saxon illumination, and of the Winchester style. There are 28 full-page miniatures, 19 other framed pages, and two full-page historiated initials, one framed. The programme is incomplete, and there were probably intended to be a further 15 full-page miniatures and more framed pages. As with most manuscripts, the illuminations, apart from the gold and silver, were painted in watercolour. A wide range of colours, many overpainted to achieve a different effect, and much gold and silver are used. The style of the miniatures is characterized by brilliant colour and exuberant acanthus ornament.Wilson, 160–173 Influences from Carolingian illumination can be seen in the book's elegant Caroline script and its paintings which draw upon the schools of Ada and Reims; Ada in the \\"statuesque poses, the crumpled veils, and the diagonal folds of draperies\\", Reims in the eddying clouds. A strong sense of Englishness shines through, however, in the \\"exhilirating dance of colour and line\\" and the agile brushwork which frees the figures to \\"glide effortlessly over the frames\\".Dodwell, p. 107 History The manuscript was made sometime between 963 and 984, probably during the 970s. Folios 4r and 5v contain a Latin inscription which describes how the manuscript came to be made. > A bishop, the great Æthelwold, whom the Lord had made patron of Winchester, > ordered a certain monk subject to him to write the present book . . . He > commanded also to be made in this book many frames well adorned and filled > with various figures decorated with many beautiful colours and with gold. > This book the Boanerges aforesaid caused to be indited for himself . . . Let > all who look upon this book pray always that after the term of the flesh I > may abide in heaven Û Godeman the scribe, as a suppliant, earnestly asks > this Æthelwold I was Bishop of Winchester from 29 November 963 until his death on 1 August 984, so the manuscript was produced between those dates. The benediction for the Feast of St. Swithun mentions miracles performed by Swithun, which lead H. A. Wilson to conclude that the benediction could not have been composed before the translation of Swithun's relics on 15 July 971. St. Ætheldreda is given a prominence in the manuscript that would indicate that the manuscript was not made until after 970 when Æthelwold had refounded the abbey of Ely, which had been founded by Ætheldreda. R. Deshman has argued that the drawings added to the Leofric Missal (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 579) in about 979 were influenced by the illuminations of the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold, meaning that it was probably produced before 979. The scribe, Godeman, was a monk at the Old Minster at Winchester and may have belonged to the group of monks from Abingdon that Æthelwold placed in Winchester Cathedral to replace the Canons that had been there previously. In 973 Æthelwold placed Godeman in the new foundation at Thorney, either as Æthelwold's representative with Æthelwold being the nominal abbot, or as abbot in his own right. After Æthelwold's death Godeman continued as Abbot of Thorney. The Red Book of Thorney states that Godeman was Æthelwold's personal chaplain. It is assumed that the Benedictional remained at Winchester after Æthelwold's death. However, the binding was reinforced with a 15th-century list of relics at Hyde Abbey, which may mean the manuscript was at Hyde Abbey during some part of the Middle Ages. In the 17th century it was in the possession of Henry Compton, who was Master of the Hospital of St. Cross, Winchester, and who later became Bishop of Oxford (1674) and then Bishop of London (1675). Bishop Compton died in 1713 and the manuscript passed to his nephew, Gen. Hatton Compton, Lieutenant of the Tower. General Compton gave the manuscript to William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire and it was purchased by the British Library from the Duke's descendants. Text The Latin text contains the blessings read by a bishop during mass. Each day in the liturgical year and each saint's feast day had a different blessing. The manuscript contains blessings for the feast of three Saints, St. Vedast, St. Ætheldreda, and St. Swithun which are local feasts and would not have been found in a benedictional from another area. The text seems to be a conflation of a \\"Gregorian\\" benedictional which was derived from the supplement by St. Benedict of Aniane to the so-called Hadrianum, a sacramentary from Rome that had been in papal use, and an 8th-century Gallican text. The manuscript also contains several blessings which were composed at Winchester. The \\"hybrid\\" text found in the Æthelwold Benedictional is also found in the Ramsey Benedictional (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS lat. 987), which also may have been written by Godeman. It is not certain which of the manuscripts was the original, although A. J. Prescott has argued that the Ramsey Benedictional was written by Godeman, using instructions given to him by Æthelwold, to be sent elsewhere; and that Æthelwold was so pleased with the result that he had another copy made for himself. Dumville has argued that the hybrid text actually predates both the Ramsey and Æthelwold benedictionals. The hybrid text, however, was to be very influential in England and France in the 10th and 11th centuries.

She had been subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. Claims According to Willey, during an early afternoon meeting on November 29, 1993 in the private study of the Oval Office, Clinton had embraced her tightly, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast, and forced her hand on his genitals. Clinton denied assaulting Willey. According to Monica Lewinsky's testimony, Clinton stated that the allegation was absurd because Willey is a small-breasted woman, and he would never pursue such a woman. According to Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony, she felt Willey pursued a romance with Clinton from the start of her White House affiliation. Willey had speculated with Tripp as to how she might be able to set up an assignation between herself and the president. She routinely attended events at which Clinton would be present and wore a black dress she believed he liked. According to Tripp's testimony, Willey wondered if she and Clinton could arrange to meet in a home to which she had access, on the Chesapeake Bay. Investigation The Final Report of the U.S. Office of the Independent Counsel report noted that \\"Willey and President Clinton are the only direct witnesses to their meeting, and their accounts differ substantially on the crucial facts of what occurred.\\" It also stated that she gave false information to the FBI about her sexual relationship with a former boyfriend and acknowledged having lied about it when the agents confronted her with contradictory evidence. The probative value of this last aspect of Willey’s testimony is highly uncertain beyond the unfavorable light it casts on her general credibility. Her claims regarding Clinton do not involve her former boyfriend. There were also some differences in Paula Jones’ and her grand jury testimony, but in both, she stated she had been harassed. Following Willey's acknowledgment of these lies about her boyfriend, \\"the Independent Counsel agreed not to prosecute Willey for any offense arising out of the investigation, including false statements in her Jones deposition, so long as she cooperated fully and truthfully with the investigation.\\" According to Independent Counsel Robert Ray's report, \\"Willey's Paula Jones deposition testimony differed from her grand jury testimony on material aspects of the alleged incident.\\"http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/clinton/icreport/appbwiley030602icrpt.pdf (p.7 pdf) Ultimately, the Independent Counsel declined prosecution, and noted the absence of strong supporting evidence. According to a book critical of Clinton by Candice E. Jackson, Tripp told Larry King in February 1999 that Willey is \\"an honest person\\" who was \\"telling the truth\\" about having been sexually assaulted by Clinton. However, Tripp's grand jury testimony differs from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances. She stated that Willey appeared excited about the alleged assault. Specifically, Tripp testified that Willey reported Clinton’s sexual advances, which Clinton completely denied making. Tripp also noted that Willey stated that the force of the advances took her breath away, which is consistent with Willey’s claim that she was not even given the opportunity to consent. However, Tripp further noted that Willey seemed pleased in some respects with what had happened. The Independent Counsel believed that Willey told a boyfriend that she was pregnant and she had a miscarriage when she did not. On the evening of March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by President Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial, and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Federal prosecutors are immune to such “misconduct” actions under longstanding Supreme Court precedent. In March 2000, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that President Clinton had \\"committed a criminal violation\\" of the Privacy Act of 1974 by releasing letters from Willey to the President that were written even after the alleged incident. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court of Appeals later criticized that aspect of Lamberth’s ruling as “sweeping” and “superfluous,” but denied the White House motion before them. Willey filed suit against the White House over the issue. Target On November 6, 2007, her book Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton was published by WND Books, an imprint of World Ahead Media and WorldNetDaily. In her book, Willey claimed that on Labor Day weekend 2007, her house was burglarized, with the only thing stolen being a manuscript of her book. Willey stated that she believes individuals with ties to the Clintons were responsible for the break- in. She also filed a police report. Willey draws similarities in her book between the circumstances of her husband's death on November 29, 1993 and of the death of Vincent Foster, although she does not claim to know that any wrongdoing took place.  \\"A Scandal a Day\\" website  In July 2015, Willey launched \\"A Scandal A Day,\\" an anti-Clinton website; the website was set up by an Arizona-based private detective company Maverick Investigations, owned by Tom Watson. Willey was, in 2016, interviewed by Larry King about the alleged incident. Appearance with Trump In October 2016, Willey joined Donald Trump for a press conference before the second presidential debate to air grievances against Hillary and Bill Clinton. The conference also included Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, and Kathy Shelton. She was paid $2,500 for the appearance by a Political Action Committee headed by Roger Stone. Personal life At the time of the alleged assault by President Clinton, Willey was married to Edward Eugene Willey, Jr., a lawyer. He committed suicide on November 29, 1993. Willey was remarried in November 1999 to Bill Schwicker, whom she divorced in 2006. Currently, she works and resides in Powhatan County, Virginia.

Acoustically, it refers to one complete vibration, the base unit of Hertz being one cycle per second.Randel, Don, \\"Cycle\\", The Harvard Dictionary of Music, Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1986, p. 218. Theoretically, an interval cycle is a collection of pitch classes created by a sequence of identical intervals. Individual pieces that aggregate into larger works are considered cycles, for example, the movements of a suite, symphony, sonata, or string quartet.G. M. Tucker and Roger Parker, \\"Cyclic Form\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001). This definition can apply to everything from settings of the Mass or a song cycle to an opera cycle. Cycle also applies to the complete performance of an individual composer's work in one genre.\\"cycle.\\" In The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e7623 (accessed December 25, 2011). Harmonic cycles—repeated sequences of a harmonic progression—are at the root of many musical genres, such as the twelve-bar blues. In compositions of this genre, the chord progression may be repeated indefinitely, with melodic and lyrical variation forming the musical interest. The form theme and variations is essentially of this type, but generally on a larger scale. Composition using a tone row is another example of a cycle of pitch material, although it may be more difficult to hear because the variations are more diverse. Rhythmic cycles Indian classical music= In Indian classical music, a specific rhythmic structure known as a tala is repeated through the length of the raga, and used as a basis for improvisation of the drum parts. =Music of Indonesia= In the gamelan music of Indonesia, there are nested gong cycles which determine the rhythmic framework of the piece. This sort of cycling is called colotomy. In the same way as specific harmonic cycles determine the genre of many Western pieces (like the blues), gamelan pieces are classified according to their colotomic structures. Some other styles of music, such as gagaku or pi phat, have been analyzed colotomically. =Sub-Saharan African music traditions= Rhythm in Sub- Saharan Africa is typically generated by multiple cross-rhythmic cycles, in relation to a primary cycle of four main beats.Ladzekpo, C.K. (1996). Web. \\"Main Beat Schemes,\\" Foundation Course in African Music. Web. http://home.comcast.net/~dzinyaladzekpo/PrinciplesFr.html This basic musical period has a bipartite structure; it is made up of two rhythmically opposed cells, consisting of two beats each.Peñalosa, David, The Clave Matrix; Afro- Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc., 2010, p. 65 . Kubik points out that the four-beat cycle is a shorter period than what is normally heard in European music. This accounts for the stereotype of African music as \\"repetitive.\\" The cycles have a beginning and an end, with the two joining.Kubik, Gerhard Theory of African Music (Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology) v. 2. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. 41. The lead instrument, or soloist, may temporarily contradict the primary cycle with cross beats and larger phrases, but awareness of the cycle is ever present.Kubik 2010, p. 41. In many sub-Saharan and Disapora musics, a key pattern, typically played on a bell, establishes the basic cycle or period. Mixed cycles Different types of musical cycles can overlap. One example is isorhythm, the medieval practice of using melodic and rhythmic cycles in one or two voices. There is a certain sequence of pitch material (known as the color) and a separate sequence of rhythmic values (known as the talea), which is of different length. If the lengths of the two cycles are relatively prime, a complex melody will emerge. Most compositions using this technique end when the two cycles coincide. A similar process is used in serial music, although the number of different overlapping cycles can be quite large, and encode a wide variety of musical parameters, such as dynamics, articulation, timbre, register, and so forth. Opera cycles *Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle consists of four individual operas. *Giacomo Puccini's Il tabarro, Suor Angelica, and Gianni Schicchi form a set of three one-act operas, intended to be performed together and collectively titled Il trittico. *Germaine Tailleferre's Du style galant au style méchant is made up of four chamber operas which parody a different operatic form or style *Robert Ashley's Perfect Lives, Atalanta, and Now Eleanor's Idea form a trilogy. *R. Murray Schafer's Patria is composed of twelve separate works, which he classifies as \\"music theater\\". *Karlheinz Stockhausen's Licht consists of seven individual operas named after the days of the week.

The club are currently members of and play at North Street. History The club was formed in 1959 following the merger of Alfreton Miners Welfare and Alfreton United,The Club Alfreton Town F.C. taking the name of a previous club that had played in the Midland League in the 1920s. A ground on North Street was provided by the council and the new club spent two seasons in the Central Alliance before switching to the Midland League in 1961. Although they finished bottom of the league in their first season, they were league champions in 1969–70 and reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, taking Third Division Barrow to three replays before losing 2–0 at Deepdale. After finishing as runners-up in 1971–72 they won the league again in 1973–74, a season in which they reached the FA Cup first round for a second time, losing to Blyth Spartans in a replay. Between 1972 and 1974 the club also won three League Cups in succession, resulting in them being awarded the trophy permanently by the league. A third league title was won in 1976–77, and the club finished as runners-up again in 1980–81 and 1981–82. In 1982 the Midland League merged with the Yorkshire League to form the Northern Counties East League, with Alfreton placed in the Premier Division. In 1986–87 they won the Premier Division, earning promotion to the new Division One of the Northern Premier League.

Career She is one of the best female jumpers of all time. She received a lot of media attention in 2004, when she was denied the opportunity to jump K-185 in Vikersund, in spite of her good results. The struggle was over whether the quality of female ski jumpers was high enough to allow women to jump in these venues. Torbjørn Yggeseth, the chairman of the ski jump committee of the International Ski Federation, was Sagen's main opponent. The debate soon developed into a struggle over women's rights in the world of sports. Competing since 2003, Sagen won the women's ski jumping event at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 2004 and 2005, the last two years the event was held. She also has forty additional victories as of 2009. On 20 February 2009 Sagen won the bronze medal in the first ever World Championship ski jumping competition for women. After a plebiscite and the decision by the city council in Oslo, Sagen received the honour of being the de facto first ski jumper in the new Holmenkollen.

However, coyotas also come in a variety of flavors, including guava, caramel, chocolate, strawberry, jamoncillo (milk candy), peach, and pineapple.  Origins  Spaniards introduced wheat, sugar, and goat's milk to Mexico around 500 years ago. They originated mainly in Villa de Seris, a city in Hermosillo, Sonora Mexico in 1954. They can now be found all over the world. In the US, they can be found in most Mexican supermarkets. The meaning of the name \\"coyota\\" is a mestiza (of Spanish and native heritage) dark skinned and full of grace.  Ingredients  * all purpose flour * water * salt * shortening * piloncillo (Mexican brown sugar made of molasses)  Preparation  First, all the ingredients (see above) are mixed together. Next, Shortening and water are added to the mixture to thicken the consistency a bit. The dough is then made into small balls which are then filled to the consumers preference. They are then baked in the oven at 375 degrees F for about 15 minutes. Coyotas tend to be accompanied with milk, coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. Sometimes even topped with whip cream.

They have released six albums, many singles and EPs and many tracks on compilations. Their combination of big-band jazz era sounds with electronica and vintage style animations has been influential on the current range of electro swing artists and DJs.Interview Nicholas Raggenau Paris Djs, 16 August 2012. The band is named after American film actress Tuesday Weld. Coates once had a dream involving Weld and 1930s vocalist Al Bowlly, and cites it as inspiration for the band's particular style. At present, the band is signed to Crammed (Europe, Australasia, South America) and Six Degrees Records (North America). They have previously released recordings with Antique Beat, Kindercore Records, Dreamy Records, Bambini Records, PIAS Recordings and Motorway Records. A German alt-country band by the name of Tuesday Weld that released a CD \\"Starscene 98\\" on Glitterhouse Records is not related. \\"The Clerkenwell Kid\\" is often cited as the band's producer / re-mixer but is an alter ego for Coates himself. The 2009 album, \\"The Clerkenwell Kid: Live at the End of the World\\" is an imaginary live recording of a concert on the 'eve of the apocalypse'. The Clerkenwell Kid is also the main character in a London based mythology Coates has developed around his love of the city's history and stories. Their live shows are usually accompanied by visuals in the form of bespoke films and animations. The band's album \\"The Last Werewolf\\"is a soundtrack to the novel of the same name (2012) by childhood friend Glen Duncan, reprising their joint work on Duncan's novel \\"I, Lucifer\\" (2004). In 2010 – 2011, Coates also co-wrote and produced an album \\"Horseplay\\" as \\"Lazarus and the Plane Crash\\" – a collaboration with Joe Coles of UK cult garage rockers The Guillotines which was released on Antique Beat in 2012. Every year since 2003 the band have released a Christmas ep of songs and spoken word elements. According to the band's website, for the last few years Coates has been working on scores for indie features, Russian music related projects and various arts events but is recording a set of albums for release in 2019. Film scoring The band have worked with many animators and filmmakers, particularly the Russian animator Alex Budovsky and the American animator George Fort on several international award-winning films. Their \\"Bathtime in Clerkenwell\\" cut (from the \\"I, Lucifer\\" album) appears as the soundtrack for Budovsky's innovative multi- award-winning short film of the same title. Coates has written music for various independent features including Paul Cotter's Bomber and the US indies \\"Meeting Spencer\\" (2009), \\"The Suspect\\" (2013) and Meet Me in Montenegro (2014) as well as the French movie Encore heureux (2016) Directed by Benoit Graffin . He has also written for several documentaries and short films including US cult series 'The Midnight Archive', 'The Man Who Married Kittens' a biopic of anthropomorphic taxidermist Walter Potter, several 'Everyman' programs for BBC 2 and most recently for a series of documentaries made by Amnesty International about the Syrian conflict The band have had many existing tracks used in films, television shows and commercials. Their song \\"I Love the Rain\\" was used in a commercial for Chevy in 2011. The 2013 Apple iPad commercial featured the piano instrumental \\"The Lupine Waltz' from The Last Werewolf album. The song \\"Last Words\\" (from the album \\"The London Book of the Dead\\") is cut throughout and plays over the final scenes of Sony pictures' 2008 film Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist by indie cult director Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas). Other music Coates has re-mixed several artists including Duke Ellington, Count Basie, David Byrne and The Puppini Sisters in their burlesque style re-make of \\"Crazy in Love\\" by Beyoncé Knowles.

In 2010/2011, he was commissioned to write and produce the original songs for the Rockstar Games title L.A.Noire. The recordings feature the German singer Claudia Brücken of the band Propaganda. X-Ray Audio In 2014, Coates launched The X-Ray Audio Project an initiative to provide a resource of information about 'Roentgenizdat' Soviet bootleg recordings of forbidden music made on used X-Rays in the 1940s and 1950s.Bone music: the Soviet bootleg records pressed on x-rays. Peter Paphides, The Guardian, 29 January 2015. Retrieved 24 December 2015.

Coates delivered a talk on the project at Tedx in Krakow in June 2015. The project has become a major touring exhibition showing in London, Birmingham, Belfast, Trieste, Moscow, St Petersburg and Tel Aviv. It is due to show in Tokyo in April 2019.

Early Life and Karate-do Nagamine was born in Tomari, in Naha, Okinawa. He was a small and sickly child, and he contracted a gastroenteric disorder in 1926, his second year of high school. He began a self-imposed diet and took up karate under the watchful eye of his next-door neighbour, Chojin Kuba. Nagamine soon became a picture of good health, crediting his recovery to \\"hard work both at school and training of Karate\\". His health improved to such an extent that he became a leader of the school's karate club, and his friends dubbed him Chippaii Matsu, a nickname meaning \\"tenacious pine tree\\". Career in the Army After graduation in March 1928, he began to study martial arts full-time, moving to Shuri and training under Taro Shimabuku (島袋善良)and Ankichi Arakaki. Later that year, he was conscripted into the Japanese army in the 47th Infantry Division, and fought in China before receiving an honourable discharge in 1931. Leaving the army, Nagamine sought an area in which his martial arts abilities would be useful, eventually settling on the police force. Career in the Police force During his time as a police officer, Nagamine received further instruction in karate from Chotoku Kyan and Motobu Choki, and achieved the title of Renshi in 1940. By 1951, Nagamine was a Police Superintendent, of Motobu, and was training his own officers in karate. Nagamine retired as a policeman in 1952, and in 1953 he returned to Naha City and set up his own dojo, which he named \\"Matsubayashi-Ryu Kodokan Karate and Ancient Martial Arts Studies\\". From the dojo he taught Matsubayashi-ryu, a karate school he had founded in 1947, and named in honour of Sokon Matsumura and Kosaku Matsumora. He continued to teach the discipline until his death in 1997. He was succeeded in 1997 by his son, Takayoshi Nagamine, who returned to Okinawa after many years teaching in the USA, and who was the head (sōke) of Matsubayashi-ryu until his own death in 2012. Author Nagamine wrote two books in Japanese, The Essence of Okinawan Karate-Do and Tales of Okinawa's Great Masters. The Essence of Okinawan Karate-Do, which has been reprinted many times, was first published in the English language in 1976. This was translated into the English language by Nagamine's student Katsuhiko Shinzato. Tales of Okinawa's Great Masters received its first English translation in 2000; [Bubishi].

The film parallels the true story of a Chicago reporter who proved that a man jailed for murder was wrongly convicted 11 years before. James Stewart stars as the persistent journalist and Richard Conte plays the imprisoned Frank Wiecek. Wiecek is based on Joseph Majczek, who was wrongly convicted of the murder of a Chicago policeman in 1932, one of the worst years of organized crime during Prohibition. Plot James Stewart in Call Northside 777 (1948) In Chicago in 1932, during Prohibition, a policeman is murdered inside a speakeasy. Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a $5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer. This leads the city editor of the Chicago Times, Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb), to assign reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration. Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false. In actuality, innocence was determined not as claimed in the film but when it was found out that the prosecution had suppressed the fact that the main witness had initially declared that she could not identify the two men involved in the police shooting.\\"J.

Fox had obtained the necessary legal clearances from the persons involved in the story and had dispatched Otto Lang, producer, and Leonard Hoffman, writer, to Chicago to gather material for the film. Eventually, Quentin Reynolds and Jay Dratler joined Hoffman in writing the script. Casting the film proved complex. According to Mar. 7 report in The New York Times, Twentieth Century-Fox had named Henry Fonda to play the newspaper reporter in Call Northside 777, which would precede Chicken Every Sunday and Loan Star Preacher on Fonda's schedule. However, after a month, another report pointed out that Fox had named Fonda for a leading role in the screen adaptation of Elizabeth Janeway's novel, Daisy Kenyon, which necessitated Fonda's replacement in Call Northside 777. Two months later, another report said that Twentieth Century-Fox was \\"negotiating for the services of James Stewart for the leading role in Call Northside 777.\\" Lloyd Nolan was originally named to play the role of Brian Kelly, but Lee J. Cobb replaced him in the end. Leopoldine Konstantine was originally scheduled to play the wrongly convicted man's mother, but in the end the role went to Kasia Orzazewski. This was the first Hollywood feature film to be shot on location in Chicago. Views of the Merchandise Mart as well as Holy Trinity Polish Mission can be seen throughout the film. ReceptionCritical response= The film received mostly positive reviews when it was first released, and again when it was released on DVD in 2004. In 2004, the Onion AV Club Review argued that the film may not be a true film noir, but is good nonetheless: \\"Outstanding location shooting and Stewart's driven performance turn a sober film into a vibrant, exciting one, even though the hero and the jailbird he champions are really too noble for noir.\\"Murray, Noel .

Background and career Jinkins was born in Richmond, Virginia, and lived there during his childhood. His experiences growing up in Richmond would serve as an inspiration for the fictional town of Bluffington, Virginia, in the series Doug. Jinkins was also an actor on the old Nickelodeon series Pinwheel and Hocus Focus, and a graphic designer on By the Way and Video Comics. After his first tenure with Nickelodeon, he went to work for Children's Television Workshop, becoming the graphics director for their show Square One Television. in 1986 Jinkins was the original character designer of mischief boy, who become menace of his major programming Dennis the Menace (1986-1988).

Jinkins had developed Doug Funnie through doodles during the early days of his career. Doug and his dog Porkchop first appeared in Jinkins' book Doug Got a New Pair of Shoes, which led to his creating an animated pilot titled Doug Can't Dance. He sold the Doug pilot to Nickelodeon.

This movement coincided with the Great Jubilee, the celebration of the year 2000 in the Catholic Church. The campaign has been generally hailed as very successful. As planned the Jubilee 2000 Coalition dissolved at the end of the millennium year but left a legacy of organisations around the world. Concept The concept derived from the biblical idea of the year of Jubilee, the 50th year. In the Jubilee Year as quoted in Leviticus, those enslaved because of debts are freed, lands lost because of debt are returned, and community torn by inequality is restored. It aimed to wipe out $90bn of debt owed by the world's poorest nations, reducing the total to about $37bn. The idea was first articulated by Martin Dent, a retired lecturer in politics at the University of Keele, who with his friend, retired diplomat William Peters, linked the biblical Jubilee to a modern debt relief programme and founded the Jubilee 2000 campaign in the early 1990s. Early activism The activities were initially directed through church channels, and youth groups, in particular, became heavily involved. Campaigns were launched via a secretariat in the United Kingdom, franchising the \\"trademark\\" to any who directed campaign in the spirit of Jubilee 2000. The Church of England supported the movement; then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey addressed a rally in Trafalgar Square with Dent and Peters, and also made Jubilee 2000 the subject of his New Year’s Day address on BBC 1. Several of the UK ministers in charge of the relevant government departments after Labour came to power in 1997 were Scots. These included Gordon Brown and Alastair Darling in the Treasury, and Robin Cook as Foreign Secretary, all of whom would support the initiative. Jubilee 2000 Scottish Coalition attracted widespread support from Trade Unions, charities and different church denominations working together, and held events across Scotland. A feature of the campaign was that local groups were active in letter-writing, advocacy and education on international debt issues across the whole of the UK.Carter I. (2018) A Taste of Heaven: First Steps for Jubilee 2000. Exeter, Onwards and Upwards, (p160). Perhaps the best known part of the movement was the global campaign created to engage the music and entertainment industries called Drop The Debt. Among the supporters were Bono of rock band U2, Quincy Jones, Willie Colón, Muhammad Ali, Bob Geldof, Youssou N'dour, Thom Yorke, N.T. Wright and others. Jubilee 2000 staged demonstrations at the 1998 G8 meeting in Birmingham, England. At the Birmingham meeting, which, among other things, focused on achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of environmental protection and good governance, between 50,000 and 70,000 demonstrators participated in a peaceful protest in an effort to put debt relief on the agenda of Western governments. The protestors made headlines around the world for their activities aimed at increasing awareness, such as forming a human chain around Birmingham City Centre, passing out petitions, and holding workshops. Impact on debt policy The protests caught the attention of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who met with the directors of Jubilee 2000 to discuss the issue of heavy debt in poor countries. Subsequently, the Prime Minister publicly expressed his personal support for, and dedication to, debt forgiveness. While the UK's move to cancel significant third world debt was also influenced by the millennium development goals, Gordon Brown's decision to support debt cancellation at a Jubilee 2000 rally at St Paul's Cathedral underlies the significance of the movement in influencing UK policy.http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3532/1/From_transnational_protest_to_domestic_political_opportunities(LSERO).pdf Later a promise from the United States during the G-7 (G-8 financial ministers, excluding Russia) meeting in Cologne, Germany in 1999 to cancel 100 per cent of the debt that qualifying countries owed the US was attributed in part to the influence of the campaign. Jubilee later lobbied the United States Congress to make good on this promise. Congress responded to the growing pressure to address debt relief issues in 2000 by committing $769 million to bilateral and multilateral debt relief.E. Carrasco, C.McClellan, & J. Ro (2007), \\"Foreign Debt: Forgiveness and Repudiation\\" University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development E-Book Post 2000 From early 2001, Jubilee 2000 split into an array of organisations around the world; Jubilee South (encompassing many former Jubilee campaigns in Africa, Asia and Latin America); Jubilee Debt Campaign, Jubilee Scotland and Jubilee Research (hosted by the New Economics Foundation) in the UK; Jubilee USA Network; Jubilé 2000/CAD Mali in Mali; and many other national organisations. These co- ordinate their actions through a loose global confederation. Jubilee USA, located in Washington DC, is the US's campaigning successor to Jubilee 2000. Erlassjahr.de is the German branch. There are very many other organisations around the world which also carry forward the debt campaign. Former Jubilee 2000 UK staff founded the short-lived Drop The Debt to work in the run-up to the 2001 G8 Summit in Genoa, maintaining Jubilee 2000's combination of lobbying, celebrity work and mass activism. Jubilee Research at the New Economics Foundation, located in London, took over from Jubilee 2000 in 2001 and now provides in-depth analysis and data on third world debt. Jubilee Debt Campaign is the UK's campaigning successor to Jubilee 2000, comprising much of the UK's original Jubilee 2000 membership, while Jubilee Scotland campaigns north of the border. The campaign calls for cancellation of debts owed by the world's poorest countries. Debt was one of the targets of 2005's Make Poverty History Campaign. Appraisals Although it did not meet all of its stated goalsCarter I. (2018) A Taste of Heaven: First Steps for Jubilee 2000. Exeter, Onwards and Upwards, (p. 160).—which were hugely ambitious—the campaign did receive very positive assessments for its grassroots involvement, vision, and measurable impacts on policy and poverty. Jonathan Glennie called it \\"one of the most important global movements for justice of our time.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty- matters/2011/apr/20/debt-owed-to-jubilee-debt-campaign The then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote \\"Many events in the past few years have shown how powerful and influential NGOs can be ...

Immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an attempt to change the immune system's response. Meta-analyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin are effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in asthma. The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped. It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects. The evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy against rhinitis and asthma, but it is less strong. In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections. Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma. Side effects during sublingual immunotherapy treatment are usually local and mild and can often be eliminated by adjusting the dosage. Anaphylaxis during sublingual immunotherapy treatment has occurred on rare occasions. Potential side effects related to subcutaneous immunotherapy treatment for asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis include mild or moderate skin or respiratory reactions. Severe side effects such as anaphylaxis during subcutaneous immunotherapy treatment is relatively uncommon. Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergen immunotherapy is the only medicine known to tackle not only the symptoms but also the causes of respiratory allergies. A detailed diagnosis is necessary to identify the allergens involved. TypesSubcutaneous = Alutard SQ injection kit Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), also known as allergy shots, is the historical route of administration and consists of injections of allergen extract, which must be performed by a medical professional. Subcutaneous immunotherapy protocols generally involve weekly injections during a build-up phase, followed by monthly a maintenance phase that consists of injections for a period of 3–5 years. The build-up phase involves the patient being administered injections which contain increasing amounts of allergens about one to two times per week. The length of the build-up phase is dependent upon how often injections are administered, but normally ranges from three to six months. After the effective dose is reached, the maintenance phase is implemented, which varies depending upon an individual’s response to the build-up phase.“Allergy Shots (Immunotherapy)  AAAAI.” The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 2019, When accounting for a person’s age, type of allergen, and severity of allergy, there is a high probability that subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy may provide greater clinical and immunological responses than sublingual allergen immunotherapy. Compared to sublingual allergen immunotherapy, there are no significant differences observed in quality of life. It is possible, but rare (1/2.5 million), that people undergoing subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy may experience a fatal anaphylactic event. Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy adverse events vary significantly depending on different allergenic extracts and the application of different allergen immunotherapy schedules. Allergen immunotherapy schedules include the \\"cluster\\" approach, which involves administering several doses sequentially in a single day; a \\"conventional\\" approach, which involves incrementally increasing the dose over approximately 15 weeks; and the \\"rush\\" approach, which involves administering incremental doses at intervals of 15–60 minutes over 1–3 days). It is challenging to perform an adequate risk assessment on the use of subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy compared to other forms of allergen immunotherapy administration due to the variability of immunotherapy schedules and further research is required. =Sublingual= Sublingual immunotherapy involves putting drops or a tablet of allergen extracts under the tongue, which are then absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Sublingual immunotherapy has been demonstrated to be effective against rhinoconjuctivitis and asthma symptoms. This effectiveness, however, varies depending on the type of allergen. The strongest evidence for the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy comes from studies that used grass allergens or mite allergens to alleviate allergic rhinitis symptoms; the evidence shows modest improvement. Sublingual immunotherapy is used to treat allergic rhinitis, often from seasonal allergies, and is typically given in several doses over a 12 week period. It works best when given 12 weeks before the start of the pollen season. The first dose is given by a physician to monitor for any rare reactions or anaphylaxis. Subsequent doses can be taken at home which makes this a convenient alternative to subcutaneous immunotherapy. While a number of side effects have been associated with sublingual immunotherapy, serious adverse effects are very rare (about 1.4/100000 doses), and there has not been a reported fatality. There have been a small number of reports of anaphylaxis. The majority of side effects are ‘local’ and usually resolve within a few days. They include swelling of the mouth, tongue or lip, throat irritation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, and uvular edema. It is not yet clear if there are any risk factors that might increase a person's susceptibility to these adverse effects. Sublingual immunotherapy appears to be better tolerated than subcutaneous immunotherapy and causes fewer side effects. The safety of sublingual immunotherapy has not been studied extensively in people with chronic immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders. =Oral= Oral immunotherapy (OIT) involves feeding an allergic individual increasing amounts of a food allergen in order to raise the threshold which triggers a reaction. =Transdermal= Transdermal immunotherapy (TDIT) involves skin-induced suppression via epicutaneous (EC) application of an antigen in order to raise the threshold which triggers a reaction. Mechanism of action In desensitization immunotherapy the aim is to induce or restore tolerance to the allergen by reducing its tendency to induce IgE production. People are desensitized through the administration of escalating doses of allergen that gradually decreases the IgE-dominated response. The objective of immunotherapy is to direct the immune response away from humoral immunity and toward cellular immunity, thereby encouraging the body to produce fewer IgE antibodies and more CD4+ T regulatory cells that secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, which skews the response away from IgE production.Janeway's Immunobiology, 8th Edition, Chapter 14 Oral immunotherapy also creates an increase in allergen- specific IgG4 antibodies and a decrease in allergen-specific IgE antibodies, as well as diminished mast cells and basophils, two cell types that are large contributors to allergic reaction. Protocol Reactivity is tested using oral food challenges or with skin prick tests. Phases 1 & 2 of sublingual immunotherapy are conducted in a supervised clinical setting. However, phase 3 can be done at home. History In the late 19th century and early 20th century, allergic conditions were increasingly attracting both medical attention (as an emerging public health problem) and scientific interest (aided by progress in biochemical techniques and the development of molecular and pathogenic theories). However, the many and varied treatment approaches were very unscientific. The British physicians Noon and Freeman were the first researchers to test pollen allergen immunotherapy in humans. Noon and Freeman, researchers at the Department of Therapeutic Inoculation at St. Mary’s Hospital in London, published their findings in The Lancet in 1911. Building on the observations of his predecessors Bostock, Blackley and Dunbar, Noon noted that people with hay fever “sometimes become cured” and that this was possibly because they “have had the good fortune to develop an active immunity against the toxin.” He hypothesized that by injecting people with hay fever with small amounts of a pollen “toxin”, a state of immunity could be achieved.Bostock J. \\"Case of a periodical affection of the eyes and chest. Med Chir Trans. 1819;10:161. Allergen immunotherapy was part of mainstream medical practice for hay fever treatment in the 1930s. Society and culture Sublingual immunotherapy drops are currently commercialized and used in most European and South American countries, and in Australia and Asian countries. In most European countries, national regulations allow marketing of allergen products as \\"named patient preparations\\" (NPPs). In the United States, drop formulations have not yet received FDA approval, though off-label prescription is becoming common. In 2014, the FDA approved a once-daily sublingual tablet containing allergen extracts for the treatment of \\"hay fever\\" (allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis). = Recognition by international agencies = The use of subcutaneous immunotherapy for treatment of environmental-based allergies and asthma is well supported by the majority of national and international allergy groups such as the World Allergy Organization, Canadian Society of Allergy and Immunology, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The use of sublingual immunotherapy is supported by few allergy agencies in order to allow for more investigation to occur on its practical use. Oral immunotherapy is generally not recommended, however the EAACI recommends that this treatment only be administered at specialized centres with expert professionals. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is both approved and regulated by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicinal Agency (EMEA). The FDA currently allows individual allergists to create the formula for each dosage, whereas the EMEA requires treatment extracts to be prepared at manufacturing sites. The FDA has approved sublingual therapy through the use of tablets, but has not approved specific formulation. The EMEA has also approved sublingual therapy through both tablets and solution, and this administration now accounts for 45% of immunotherapy treatments. =Cost= The cost for allergen immunotherapy varies by country and administration route. There is no clear and holistic transparency across therapy forms. ResearchOral immunotherapy= , oral immunotherapy's balance of risk to benefit for food allergies was not well studied. , OIT was under investigation as a treatment for a variety of common food allergies including peanuts, milk, and eggs. Studies involving OIT have shown desensitization towards the allergen. However, there are still questions about longevity of tolerance after the study has ended. However, almost every study has excluded people with severe allergen-induced anaphylaxis. One approach being studied is in altering the protein structure of the allergen to decrease immune response but still induce tolerance. Extensive heating of some foods can change the conformation of epitopes recognized by IgE antibodies. In fact, studies show that regular consumption of heated food allergens can speed up allergy resolution. In one study, subjects allergic to milk were 16x more likely to develop complete milk tolerance compared to complete milk avoidance. Another approach regarding changes in protein is to change specific amino acids in the protein to decrease recognition of the allergen by allergen-specific antibodies. Another approach to improving oral immunotherapy is to change the immune environment to prevent TH2 cells from responding to the allergens during treatment. For example, drugs that inhibit IgE-mediated signaling pathways can be used in addition to OIT to reduce immune response. In 1 trial, the monoclonal antibody omalizumab was combined with high-dose milk oral immunotherapy and saw positive results. Several other trials are also currently being done combining omalizumab with OIT for a variety of food allergens. FAHF-2, a Chinese herbal mixture, has shown positive effects on the immune system and has been shown to protect mice from peanut-induced anaphylaxis. FAHF-2 was also well tolerated in a phase I study. While it is possible that omalizumab, FAHF-2 or other immunomodulatory agents alone might be able to treat dangerous allergies, combining these with OIT may be more effective and synergistic, warranting further investigation. In addition, nanoparticles is a field of development that can be used for OIT. With the potential to modulate antigen release, it may one day be possible to take a pill containing nanoparticles that will modulate dosing, requiring fewer office visits. Studies have also been done to determine the efficacy of OIT for multiple allergens simultaneously. One study concluded that multi-OIT would be possible and relatively, though larger studies would be necessary.

Bearing strong resemblance to their literary counterparts, Marvel vampires mostly are undead subspecies of humans which sustain their immortality and paranormal power by drinking the blood of the living. Unlike most other depictions of the creature, these vampires have their roots in both the supernatural as well as biology. Victims are converted to vampirism via enzymes carried in the vampire's saliva which causes reanimation once introduced into the bloodstream during feedings. Fictional history The first generation of vampires appeared in the legendary city of Atlantis roughly fifteen thousand years prior to modern times. A circle of Atlantean sorcerers uncovered a book known as the Darkhold - an indestructible grimoire of shadowy magics written by the Elder God Chthon. In the midst of a war, these sorcerers utilized a resurrection ritual described in the text to raise their fallen enemies in hopes of creating a legion of unkillable soldiers. However, due to the dark influence of Chthon, these undead were too powerful for their would-be masters. In an act of rebellion, the vampires slew all of the sorcerers with the exception of one - the priest Varnae, the first vampire who used the spell to save himself from death. With Atlantis sinking below the sea, Varnae and his kin fled the continent and spread out into the world. As the eldest and most magically-endowed of his kind, Varnae reigned as the unchallenged lord of vampires for many millennia until finally ceding the title to Vlad III Dracula, a 15th Century Voivode of Wallachia and a notorious warlord known by the pseudonym of Vlad the Impaler. Carrying the title well into the 21st Century, it was not until Doctor Strange - the Sorcerer Supreme of Earth - discovered a ritual within the Darkhold itself that could essentially reverse the magics of the original resurrection spell and exile all vampires into Chthon's realm. Although the ritual appeared to work, with a large portion of the undead population being purged, something went wrong in the invocation itself. While the vampire race was rendered nearly extinct, some - including Dracula himself - survived and continues to propagate their brood. Characteristics The vampires of the Marvel Universe share many of the same attributes of their literary counterparts. Their most common characteristics include superhuman strength and speed as well as superior senses and accelerated healing which can be further quickened by drinking fresh blood. Vampires who are centuries old are noted for being both physically stronger as well as more intellectually refined than younger vampires. While this doesn't make then invincible to a seasoned supernatural hunter such as Blade, it does give them an advantage over their lesser kin. = Transformation = The transformation from a living creature to a vampire begins moments after a victim dies from being fed upon. The vampiric enzyme introduced into their system triggers a metabolic change within their necrotic cells which produces a greenish preservative substance known as ichor. Provided the corpse remains undisturbed and with the heart and brain preserved, the ichor will begin to autonomously flow throughout the cardiovascular system; replacing the blood that was taken as it gradually reconstructs and reanimates the body over the course of several days. Even if a victim survives being fed upon, the presence of the enzyme in their blood will result in temporary anemia as well as a heightened susceptibility to psychic influence by their attacker. It's also not unheard of for a victim to become erotically fixated on their attacker. Although uncommon, it is theoretically possible for a survivor to begin the transformation if they die before the enzyme leaves their system naturally. Additionally, it is possible for practiced vampires to drain a victim dry and not turn them by carefully sucking out the enzyme. = Prowess = All newborn vampires experience a dramatic increase in the power of both their bodies and their senses upon their resurrection. They can hear a heartbeat across a yard as well as see in complete darkness and follow a person's scent for miles. Their skin is sensitive to body heat. Their strength and speed are likewise amplified; able to lift a single car with ease as well as cross a room almost instantaneously and even leap between buildings. This enabled them to catch and subdue any victim with minimal effort as well as making them highly lethal fighters. Only Count Dracula and his predecessor Varnae being known to lift more at 14 and 17 tons respectively due to their advanced age and special stance as ruler of Earth's vampire race. = Willpower = The overall extent of a vampire's abilities depended upon the strength of the vampire's will. Exceptional Vampires with powerful wills, such as Dracula or Varnae, were capable of summoning and controlling thunderstorms, even though the mystical concentration required to do so left them extremely weak for a certain period of time. The Vampire's willpower could also determine the extent to which he or she could master their craving for blood and retain the same personality they had in life. However, most people that became Vampires quickly found themselves unable to resist the all consuming craving for blood. They quickly degenerated into cruel and animalistic hunters of ordinary human beings, even if these new Vampires had been kind and sensitive people in their mortal lives. =Summoning and shapeshifting= Vampires could summon and control certain creatures such as bats, wolves, and rats. Vampires could also transform themselves into bats, and in the case of some Vampires, wolves, while retaining their human intelligence in these forms. Some Vampires could even become human-sized bats. Vampires could also transform themselves into mist at will, while still retaining their normal consciousnesses in that form. =Hypnosis= A vampire could make most human beings into his or her temporary slave if he or she could catch their gaze for a sufficient amount of time, usually only a matter of seconds. The exact length of time needed to mesmerize the victim depended on the strength of will of the vampire and that of his or her victim. =Regeneration and immortality= Vampires were rendered immune to the ravages of disease and of aging. However, if deprived of blood for a lengthy period of time, a vampire would begin to show distinct signs of aging, such as his or her hair turning gray. Upon ingesting fresh blood, the vampire would revert to the age in which he or she had been at the time of death. In most cases, vampires were able to heal themselves from minor injuries within a very brief period of time. Some vampires, such as Count Dracula, could heal from severe burns or broken bones within the span of a few hours, whereas most other vampires might require several days to heal exactly the same injury. Vampires were not able to regenerate missing organs or severed portions of their anatomy, with the exception of hair and skin. Apart from periodic inconveniences, injuries like these would not critically impair a vampire's effectiveness. Because the ichor was similar in function to blood, poisons and other toxic substances that were circulated in its bloodstream would adversely affect a vampire, although no dosage was large enough to cause death. Weaknesses and limitationsWeaknesses= Vampires had many limitations imposed upon their supernatural abilities, and even upon their very existence. =Destruction= The only substances which could cause a Vampire pain were silver and, to a lesser extent, unless it penetrated the Vampire's heart, wood. The surest way to kill a Vampire was to drive a wooden stake or a silver blade through his or her heart. The stake or blade prevented the heart from supplying ichor to the rest of the body. If the stake or blade was removed, however, even if the Vampire's body had crumbled to dust, the Vampire's mystical vitality would restore his or her body to the condition it had before the Vampire was slain, and return him or her to Vampiric \\"life.\\" Beheading a Vampire would also kill him or her as well as extensive damage to the majority of his or her body. However, there were only three methods of making sure of destroying a Vampire permanently. One was to expose the Vampire to direct sunlight and then to scatter the ashes. Another was to pierce the Vampire's heart with wood or silver, sever his or her head, burn the head and body in separate places and scatter the two resulting piles of ashes in separate locations. The third was mystically, most notably by using the incantation known as the Montesi Formula (after the monk who first realized its significance). Montesi created the incantation by studying fragmentary copies of the Darkhold. It was lost amid many other documents copied by various anonymous monks over the centuries. Research by various Vampire hunters over the past few decades revealed its significance, and it was sought by both those hunters and by Dracula, who wished to destroy all copies of it. The incantation apparently cancelled the mystic curse that allowed any Vampire within earshot to exist, causing it to crumple to dust. The danger is that, as the Montesi Formula was created from black magic theory from the Darkhold, those untrained in the mystic arts who use it lose their souls. At one point, a cult who worshiped the elder Demon Gods apparently fixated on Dracula as a recipient of their power. Dracula gave them the fragments of the Darkhold he had discovered; the cultists (who were low level mystics) repeatedly recast the original spells that created the first Vampires. This increased Dracula's powers considerably, and he lost his vulnerability to sunlight and others. Dracula was able to take full control of their minds (as well as anyone around the world that Dracula had ever hypnotized in the past, at will). Doctor Strange (who at the time was in a great battle with Dracula) was aware of the Montesi Formula. He tracked down the Darkhold, and, using the original source material to study the spells that created Vampires, Doctor Strange created a massive version of the Montesi Formula (backed by his power as Sorcerer Supreme) to wipe out all Vampires in the Marvel Universe. As shown in the Runaways series, staking a Vampire is not always completely effective. Nico Minoru shoots the Staff of One completely through the Vampire Topher without permanent damage. However, Topher was defeated when he drank Karolina Dean's blood, which contains pure solar energy (Karolina is a Majesdanian, an alien race that lives within a star). Living Vampires Living Vampires or Pseudo- vampires are vampires that were not created with the magic of the Darkhold, but originated through alternate means like science, mutations, or magic other than that of the Darkhold. They usually possess many vampiric qualities, including appearance and many similar superhuman abilities, but rarely possess their vulnerabilities. Examples of these pseudo-vampires include: Blade, Michael Morbius, Hunger. Vampire sects In 2010, Marvel introduced the idea of Vampire sects as part of a general \\"revamping\\" of the Vampires in the Marvel Universe as seen in \\"Curse of the Mutants\\". Sects are diverse as human religions and Vampires from different sects might have different characteristics or abilities. The sects shown so far in the one-shot issue Death of Dracula are: * Anchorite Sect - Rural outcasts who prefer to hide from humanity and live in peace.Death of Dracula one-shot issue * Aqueos Sect - A race of vampire-converted Atlanteans similar in appearance to the Gill-man from the film Creature from the Black Lagoon. They were thought to have been extinct until human developments in the ocean brought them out of hiding. * Claw Sect - Middle Eastern-type warriors. They are rivals of the Krieger. * Charniputra Sect - A race of gargoyle-like vampire subspecies that are mostly seen flying in the Himalayas. Charniputra also have a tough hide that is hard to damage without the weaknesses. * Huskie Sect - A race of vampires that are revived as mindless, animalistic creatures. They only follow their base instinct and feed on small animals. The Huskie Sect will not rest until they have completed a task from their human life.Blade the Vampire Hunter (vol. 5) #6 * Jumlin Sect - A race of vampires that are associated with Native American lore and are allegedly the first vampires on Earth.Tomb of Dracula (vol. 4) #1 * Krieger Sect - Western-type warriors. They are one of the strongest sects. * Moksha Sect - A group of vampire prophets who gain their powers by feeding as little as possible. * Mystikos Sect - A group of business vampires with skills at technology. * Nosferatu Sect - Similar to Count Orlok, their need for powerful blood sometimes drives them to attack other Vampires. * Pureblood Sect - A group consisting of vampires that were born as Vampires. * Siren Sect - All-beautiful female vampires with powers of seduction. * Tryk Sect - A powerful, parasitic subspecies of vampires that prefer the blood of other Vampires.Blade the Vampire Hunter (vol. 5) #1 A few sects did not appear in the issue. These include: * Adze Sect - A race of African vampires who are able to survive the usually instantaneous methods of vampire destruction for 10 minutes. * Ancient Sect - A race of Italian vampires with superior superhuman speed and healing factor compared to that of other Vampires. * Mortuus Invitus - A sect of vampires who oppose other vampires. They assisted Noah van Helsing's Vampire Hunters against Dracula.Tomb of Dracula (vol. 4) #2 * The Forgiven - Founded by Raizo Kodo, this legion is composed by vampires who try to maintain their humanity and coexist with humans, drinking blood from animals instead of human blood. Members of this group include former X-Man Jubilee. * Yuki Onna - A race of Japanese vampires (named after the mythological creature of the same name) with the power to turn into ice storms rather than fog as most Vampires can Known vampires The following vampires are listed in alphabetical order: * Adze \\\\- Guyana, assaulted village of Benjamin Alomii; slaughtered half of them; and turned the remainder of the village into vampires; destroyed by Ben Alomii * Count Von Stadt \\\\- a mutant turned into a vampire who could shoot laser beams from his eyes.

Their powers and abilities seem to be the same as the mainstream Marvel Universe, including sensitivity to religion, silver, and immense sunlight.Ultimate Avengers 3 #1-6 The vampires are led by Anthony (a.k.a. Vampire-X), a vampire hunter that had been bitten and turned, and had stolen Iron Man's outdated suit in an effort to walk around in sunlight. He was also a mentor to Blade, Stick and Stone in the past. Since then, Blade has been moving his way through bosses throughout clans over the last 20 years. Vampire-X outmatched and turned the Nerd Hulk (a clone of Bruce Banner), and had the Nerd Hulk, in turn, bite Stick and the new Daredevil. Captain America is later bitten and infected in an attack in the sewers, and is led into battle by the Nerd Hulk as the new boss after having killed Anthony with one punch. Later that night, hundreds of vampires are overrunning Nick Fury's Black Ops team guarding S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Triskelion in New York, turning a few Reserve Ultimates (like Giant-Men member Dave Scotty) and even killing Perun. However, Captain America's Super Soldier Serum blood later fights back the infection, after which he returns to normal, and uses Perun's Hammer to teleport the Triskelion to Iran. As hundreds of vampires end up dying, Blade then purges his sword into Stick's chest (now wearing Anthony's Iron Man suit) for the kill, while Captain America takes Perun's Hammer and slays the Nerd Hulk. In other mediaTelevision= * The Vampires appear in the Spider-Man animated series. They're seen in the episode \\"The Vampire Queen\\". * The Vampires appear in Blade: The Series, a continuation of film series. * The Vampires are featured in Marvel Anime: Blade. This series focuses on a vampire organization called the Existence which is formed and led by Deacon Frost. Its membership is made up of vampires who have been genetically altered to have powerful beast-like forms and humans who believe that by joining the organization would leave them unharmed by the vampires. The Existence was shown to have some clashes with the vampires that work for the Vampire High Council. In the post-credits of \\"The Other Side of Darkness\\", Blade was shown fighting the vampires that are followers of the Darkhold. * The Vampires appear in the Avengers Assemble animated series. They're seen in the episodes \\"Blood Feud\\", \\"In Deep\\", \\"Exodus\\" and \\"Why I Hate Halloween\\". * The Vampires appear in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series. They're seen in the episodes \\"Blade\\" and \\"The Howling Commandos\\". The episode \\"Return to the Spider-Verse\\" Pt. 1 features a reality dominated by Vampires and ruled by the Lizard King. Those who were turned into Vampires were returned to normal with the help of the Siege Perilous fragment. * The Vampires appear in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.. In the episode \\"Days of Future Smash: Dracula\\", the Vampires are shown with Dracula when the Leader proposes a plan for vampires to feed night and day through the Gamma Furnace blocking out the sun at the time when the Hulk followed the Leader to 1890 during the Victorian era. When the Hulk is hit by a gamma version of the vampire strain, it results in a vampire-dominated present which is ruled by the Vampire Lord Hulk who has done away with Dracula and the Leader and shows no vulnerability to the vampire weaknesses. After the Hulk uses the Sun that he unblocked to burn away the strain and then destroys the Gamma Furnace while defeating Dracula, the vampire-dominated present is undone. =Film= * The Vampires are the primary antagonists in the entire Blade film series. In all three films, Blade goes up against a certain sect of the vampire community, slowly learning more and more about them while also having to deal with his own emerging vampire instincts which he is both warned and taunted about. Vampirism in the films and its spin-off television series are treated as mundane creatures, humans mutated through a virus-like infection rather than a curse. As such, they lack many of the more mystical powers and weaknesses of their comic-counterparts, such as shapeshifting, crosses, invitations, and true immortality (vampires in the film merely age at a slower rate than humans do). ** In Blade, the main antagonist is Deacon Frost (portrayed by Stephen Dorff), the vampire who murdered and later converted Vanessa Brooks (the mother of Blade). His group mostly consists of young 20-something looking vampires, such as the cocky Quinn (portrayed by Donal Logue) and Frost's lover Mercury (portrayed by Arly Jover), who rally against the older and wiser vampires, such as the vampire elder Gitano Dragonetti (portrayed by Udo Kier), who are looking for peace among the living. Frost's group kill the older vampires and attempt to revive La Magra, an ancient being who will supposedly grant immunity and imprison humanity for the benefit of all vampires. Frost and his entire sect are killed by Blade. ** In Blade II, Pureblood vampires are shown to be exposed to a pandemic known as the \\"Reaper virus\\", a mutation who are immune to all weaknesses (except ultraviolet light), kill humans, and turn any vampires fed on into the monstrous creatures that are more sinister than vampires. Vampire Lord Eli Damaskinos (portrayed by Thomas Kretschmann) recruits Blade to go after the Reapers' leader Jared Nomak (portrayed by Luke Goss), the only Reaper capable of sustaining his new existence, all other infected burning out within a few hours. Eli recruits Blade to join the \\"Bloodpack\\", a group of vampires who were created to hunt Blade led by Nyssa Damaskinos (portrayed by Leonor Varela), Eli's daughter and one of the few vampires who actually respects Blade and is somewhat sympathetic, and sadistic enforcer Dieter Reinhardt (portrayed by Ron Perlman). After the Bloodpack is killed dealing with Reapers, Damaskinos reveals creating the Reaper virus in order to create a new race of vampires and that Nomak was simply a failed experiment, earning Nyssa's contempt towards Damaskinos confirming Nomak is his \\"son\\". While Blade kills Reinhardt, Damaskinos is cornered by Nyssa and Nomak and is killed. After Nomak infects Nyssa with the Reaper virus, Blade and Nomak have a ferocious battle, ending with Nomak committing suicide and Nyssa's dying wish of seeing the sunrise before she succumbs to the virus. ** In Blade: Trinity, a group of vampire explorers resurrect Dracula otherwise known as Drake (portrayed by Dominic Purcell). Drake leads a group to create a cure for vampire weaknesses, while Blade and his new team create a vampire virus that can spread worldwide. Drake battles Blade one on one, where both seem to be evenly matched. Drake, impressed by this, offers a parting gift for Blade which, depending on the edition of the movie, means Drake either takes Blade's place when the cops arrive or he gives Blade more power, leaving it ambiguous if he has given into his vampire instincts. =Video games= * The Vampires appear in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. While Blade, Dracula, and Morbius are the known vampires in the game, the vampire soldiers consist of Criminal Thralls, Criminal Vampires, Demonic Criminals, Demonic Mafiosos, Demonic Malefactors, Mafioso Ductus, Mafioso Thralls, Mafioso Vampires, Malefactor Ductus, Malefactor Thralls, and Malefactor Vampires.

Themed to the American Frontier of the 19th century, Frontierlands are home to cowboys and pioneers, saloons, red rock buttes and gold rushes. To build an accurate depiction of an old-West town, Walt Disney sent a camera crew to Frontier Town, in North Hudson, NY, to film a movie that was used as the inspiration for Frontierland, as revealed in the book, \\"Frontier Town Then And Now.\\" DisneylandHistory= Frontierland first appeared in Disneyland as one of five original themed lands. Conceived by Walt Disney, the land did not initially contain many attractions, but centered on open expanses of wilderness which could be traversed by guests via stagecoach, pack mules, Conestoga wagon, and walking trails. The Mine Train Thru Nature's Wonderland opened in 1960, consisting of a sedate train ride around various western landscape dioramas. The Mine Train closed in 1977 to make way for a new attraction; the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened in 1979. Disneyland's Frontierland gateway is constructed of ponderosa pine logs. The land's long shoreline along the Rivers of America is considered a prime viewing location for the nighttime Fantasmic! show. The docks to both the Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia, (a replica of American explorer Robert Gray's 18th century ship that circumnavigated the globe) are located here, and Tom Sawyer Island in the river's center is also considered a property of Frontierland On the roof of the Westward Ho Trading Co., there are elk or deer antlers. Elk antlers were commonly placed on general stores in the old west so cowboys coming into town immediately knew where to get supplies. Also in Frontierland is a building that has a large sign that says \\"Laod Bhang Co. Fireworks Factory\\". Plus, at the storefront marked \\"Crockett and Russel Hat Co.\\", there is a window honoring Fess Parker, who played Davy Crockett in Walt Disney's Davy Crockett.

Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1973. The northwestern end of the park was supposed to receive a massive, pavilion-style \\"E ticket\\" attraction, which was never built. The area sat empty until Big Thunder Mountain Railroad premiered in 1980. Few changes would be made until 1991, when Splash Mountain was built on the vacant land between Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and the Walt Disney World Railroad station and parade access road, necessitating the relocation of the railroad's station. Splash Mountain and a new two-story railroad station opened in October 2, 1992. Frontierland borders Adventureland on the south, Liberty Square on the east, and the Rivers of America on the north. On June 25 2020, Disney announced that they will be reworking Splash Mountain to a new ride, based on the 2009 animated film, The Princess and the Frog. The project had been in discussion since 2019 and is being overseen by Walt Disney Imagineer Senior Creative Producer Charita Carter with Splash Mountain's original creator Tony Baxter serving as a creative adviser. =Attractions and entertainment= * Big Thunder Mountain Railroad * Country Bear Jamboree * Splash Mountain * Frontierland Shootin' Arcade * Frontierland Hoedown Happening * Tom Sawyer Island * Walt Disney World Railroad =Restaurants and refreshments= * Diamond Horseshoe * Golden Oak Outpost * Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn & Café * Westward Ho =Shops= * Big Al's * Briar Patch * Frontier Trading Post * Prairie Outpost and Supply Tokyo Disneyland Big Thunder Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland Tokyo Disneyland's instance is known as Westernland, as \\"frontier\\" does not adequately translate into the Japanese language.

Unlike all of the other instances, this instance has an elaborate backstory concerning the town of Thunder Mesa, founded by Henry Ravenswood to support the mining of Big Thunder Mountain. This backstory also serves as the foundation for several of the attractions, such as Phantom Manor, a version of the popular Haunted Mansion attraction that can be found at some of the other parks featuring a Western theme and a darker tone to fit in with the rest of Frontierland. The land is the largest of all of the Frontierlands thus far, containing the entire Rivers of the Far West within its borders. Two riverboats circle the river here, the Molly Brown and the Mark Twain. Critter Corral was an old area of the land converted into Woody Roundup, a meet and greet area with Woody from Toy Story and Jessie from Toy Story 2. It was later rethemed into an Arendelle market for the Frozen Fun season and is currently used as a special meet and greet environment for the Signature Experience in the Lion King and Jungle Festival. The land is converted into 'Halloweenland' in October, with many pumpkins and other scary characters lurking around every corner. Frontierland borders Adventureland and the Central Plaza of Main Street USA via Fort Comstock. In October 2008, for the first time in Disney history Jack Skellington and Sally from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas made appearances as meet and greet characters in Halloween and Christmas overlay.

Grizzly Gulch is much smaller compared to the \\"Frontierlands\\" of other Disney Parks, featuring only one ride, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. This roller coaster attraction provides a cross between the Big Thunder Mountain Railroads of the classic Frontierlands with elements from Expedition Everest, featuring special ride elements unique to this attraction, including backwards portions, and a high speed launch section. Grizzly Gulch is themed as a Northern California mining town established on August 8, 1888, a founding date chosen as \\"the luckiest day of the luckiest month of the luckiest year\\". Though geyser fields disrupted the initial settlements, the town eventually found success when a family of bears lead one of the prospectors to a bountiful gold find, resulting in the establishment of the Big Grizzly Mountain Mining Company. The bears were declared as being a lucky charm for the town and were given protected status, despite their activity occasionally disrupting work in the mines. =Grizzly Gulch=Attractions and entertainment * Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars * Geyser Gulch * Welcome Wagon Show * Wild West Photo Fun Restaurants and refreshments *Lucky Nugget Saloon Shops *Bear Necessities ReferencesExternal links * WDWHistorys Frontierland Page * Grizzly Gulch at Hong Kong Disneyland (official webpage) Category:American frontier Category:Themed areas in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Category:Disneyland Category:Magic Kingdom Category:Tokyo Disneyland Category:Disneyland Park (Paris) Category:Hong Kong Disneyland Category:Amusement parks opened in 1955 Category:1955 establishments in California ","title":"Frontierland"},{"id":"1611691","text":"Shootfighting is a martial art and combat sport, with competitions governed by the International Shootfighting Association (ISFA). Shootfighting incorporates techniques from a multitude of traditional martial arts, the most principal of these being wrestling and kenpo. Shootfighting was previously used synonymously with mixed martial arts competitions in Japan, as opposed to shoot-style professional wrestling competitions. This usage of the term is retired from common usage because it became a registered trademark of Bart Vale, who uses it to describe his hybrid fighting system derived from shoot wrestling. However, it is still sometimes used colloquially. Examples which were once considered shootfighting styles, tournaments or organizations are Pancrase, Shoot boxing and Shooto, where many fighters still considered themselves to be shootfighters. Ken Shamrock is possibly the most recognisable shoot fighter, as this was the discipline he was credited as using in the early days of the UFC. History Shootfighting's use as a synonym for mixed martial arts had its genesis in the 1970s, when Karl Gotch taught a group of Japanese professional wrestlers catch wrestling techniques, called \\"hooking\\" or \\"shooting\\". In 1976, one of these pro-wrestlers, Antonio Inoki, hosted a series of mixed martial arts matches. This led to an increased interest in real and effective technique, and eventually led to the creation of shoot wrestling, with some shoot-style professional wrestling organizations hosting legitimate mixed martial arts bouts, called \\"shoots\\". In the 1990s the interest grew, and certain shoot-style organizations like Pancrase evolved into pure \\"shoot\\" organizations. The term \\"shootfighting\\" was frequently used to describe these events and styles. The word \\"shootfighting\\" was however coined by Bart Vale, an American with a background in Concocted Combat. He was the Japanese Professional Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi (PWFG, a Japanese shoot- style professional wrestling organization) champion for close to three years. Upon moving back to America, Bart Vale used the term \\"shootfighting\\" to describe his own hybrid fighting system, which was a combination of the shoot wrestling techniques he had learned in Japan, and his experience in kenpo, jujutsu and Muay Thai. He also founded the International Shootfighting Association to promote shootfighting as a combat sport. Rules :(Extract from the ISFA homepages) Currently professional shootfighting matches consists only of a heavyweight (200 lb or more) division. But there are lighter divisions for amateur competitors. Pro matches run 30 minutes non-stop, amateurs 10 minutes. Held inside a standard wrestling ring, competitors are allowed to kick, knee or elbow any part of the body except the groin, as well as headbutt. Punches are allowed to the body. Since no gloves are worn to facilitate wrestling, punches aren't allowed to the head, although open hand palms and slaps are allowed. Any type of throw or takedown is legal and competitors are allowed to hit a downed opponent. Additionally, any type of joint lock is legal as are chokes against the side of the neck. The only foul consists of punches to the face, eye-gouges, techniques against the windpipe and groin strikes. Fights are won when a competitor is knocked down for a 10 count, knocked down 5 times or forced to submit. A fighter caught in a submission hold may grab the ropes to break the hold, but this counts as a 1/3 of a knock down. Grabbing the ropes 15 times equals a loss. Bouts that go to the full time limit are declared a draw.

He is remembered today for the claim that he discovered a previously unknown primate, De Loys's ape, during a 1920 oil survey expedition in Venezuela. The identity of the animal he photographed has long been established with considerable confidence to be a spider monkey, and the identification as a new species is generally regarded as a hoax.Heuvelmans, Bernard. On the Track of Unknown Animals. Hill & Wang, New York, 1959http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of- geology/2012/10/07/de-loys-ape/?WT_mc_id=SA_CAT_EVO_20121008 History Between 1917-1920, de Loys and his men were searching for oil around the River Tarra and Rio Catatumbo at the Venezuelan - Colombian border in South America (Bernard Heuvelmans, 1959). This mountainous region, the Sierra de Perijaa, was heavily forested, and that time was inhabited by the 'dangerous' \\"Motilone Indians\\". One day, while de Loys and his crew were resting near the Tarra River deep in the jungle, two monkeys suddenly stepped out of the woods, screaming and shaking branches. They were holding onto bushes, walked upright, then broke off several branches, waving them like weapons. When the monkeys threw their own excrement at the terrified de Loys and his exhausted companions, they grabbed their guns and fired at the more aggressive-looking male, but killed the female. The male stepped aside, though wounded, and disappeared in the forest. Since de Loys and his people had never seen such large monkeys, he wanted to preserve the carcass. When finally de Loys returned home with the only remaining evidence, a picture which he had placed into his travel-notebook, he basically forgot about his encounter with the unknown monkeys. Years later his friend, French anthropologist Georges Montandon, flipped the pages of de Loys' notebook, and discovered the photo. Although Professor Montandon was familiar with most of the monkeys discovered to that date, he had never seen one like that in de Loys' picture. Montandon speculated that the large monkey on the picture was a very human-like creature. It had no tail. Its size, according to de Loys, was 4 feet 5 inches. It had 32 teeth. It had all the features like the anthropoids in the Old World have and, therefore, must be an anthropoid Ape. Not just any Ape, but an 'American' Ape—a 'Missing Link'! He asked de Loys for more details, calculated some measurements by estimating and comparing the size of the box with the body on the picture, and in 1929, convinced de Loys to tell the story to the Illustrated London News (Loys, 1929 op. cit.: Keith, 1929; Heuvelmans, 1959; Hill, 1962) Shortly thereafter, Montandon published his statement in the Journal de la Societe des Americanistes (Montandon, 1929a); then wrote another note which he presented at the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. (Montandon, 1929b). \\"Montandon went so far as to create a new genus Amer- anthropoides for the reception of the new animal, giving it the specific name loysi in honour of its discoverer.\\" (Hill, 1962). \\"de Loy's Ape\\" At the meeting of the French Academy of Sciences Montadon tried to present some convincing 'evidence' about his major discovery of the American Ape, a so-far unknown 'American version' of the African chimpanzee and gorilla, and the Asian orangutan. He and de Loys - who under Montandon's pressure also tried to support the new discovery hypothesis - had to face numerous questions at the Academy. Naturalists and anthropologists questioned them very suspiciously. They raised many questions about the photograph: the size of the monkey sitting on the box, about her 'missing' tail, her set of only 32 teeth, her spider-monkey-like face (Joleaud, 1929), her female sex organ - that resembled that of a female spider monkey. (Female spider monkeys have a long, bulbous clitoris, that people even today often mistake for the male sex organ). The skepticism and some of the criticisms resulted in heated debates, often ridiculing Montandon's alleged hypothesis as a fraud (Keith, 1929 op. cit.; Heuvelmans, 1959). When Montandon ran out of more convincing arguments in order to support his hypothesis, he tried to bring up some anecdotes based on stories of Indian tribes like about the guayazi, the di-di, and the vasitri or 'big-devil' that was believed to attack women. These stories were similar in nature to those that people were attributing to gorillas in Africa (Heuvelmans, 1959). A. de Humboldt, who did not believe any of these stories, attributed these alleged attacks to the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) and Marquis de Wavrin mentions these creatures as 'marimunda' which were later also identified as spider monkeys: Ateles belzebuth (Wendt, 1956; Heuvelmans, 1959; Hill, 1962). Montandon was defeated in scientific circles, but the story created some ambiguity, which led into more investigations for years to come, and in the mind of some, even today, that there are still some large, mysterious creatures of several kinds, like Bigfoot, and Yeti still roaming the wilderness. There is also a drawing of a creature by the naturalist George Edwards in A Study of Anthropoid Life.Edwards, George \\"The Man of the Woods\\" Gleanings of natural history, exhibiting figures of quadrupeds, birds, insects, plants, (...) most which have not, till now, been either figured or described: with Desriptions [sic] of seventy different subjects, designed, engraved and coloured after Nature. This primate bears an uncanny resemblance to the one shot by de Loys. The text under the drawing says, \\"The painter- naturalist Edwards (1758-64) stands as a somewhat notable figure in the history of anthropoid knowledge because in addition to writing a readable popular description of the 'man of the woods' he illustrated it with a figure entitled 'The Satier, Sauage, Wild-man, Pigmy, Orang-outang, Chimp-anzee, A.D. 1757, Geo. Edwards, Delin.et Sculp.,' in which he so skilfully mingled the structural characters of oran-outan, chimpanzee, and gibbon that one cannot more exactly name the figure than by the synonyms which the artist himself used...It is but natural then that we should find it difficult to think of him as an anthropoid authority.\\" Further reading *Brian Regal, Human Evolution: A Guide To The Debates, pages 63–64 (ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2004). *Robert Silverberg, Scientists and Scoundrels: A Book of Hoaxes, pages 178-187 (New York: Crowell, 1965). *Scientific American account of hoax References Category:1892 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Swiss geologists Category:Cryptozoology Category:20th-century geologists ","title":"François de Loys"},{"id":"1611718","text":"Searsport may refer to a location in the United States: * Searsport, Maine, a town * Searsport (CDP), Maine, census-designated place comprising the center of the town ","title":"Searsport"},{"id":"1611721","text":"The University's main building in the historic center of Guanajuato City. View of the Templo de la Compañía from the courtyard of the former Faculty of Industrial Relations The Universidad de Guanajuato (in English, the University of Guanajuato) is a university based in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, made up of about 33,828 students in programs ranging from high school level to the doctorate level. Over 17,046 of those are pursuing undergraduate, masters, and doctorate degrees. The university offers 153 academic programs, including 13 doctorates, 39 masters programs, and 65 bachelor's degrees. The university has schools in fourteen cities throughout the state of Guanajuato. History The university traces its history back to the educational institute called the Hospice of the Holy Trinity, which was established on October 1, 1732. On August 29, 1827, upon the signing of the first constitutional government, the school changed its name to the College of the Immaculate Conception and fell under government responsibility. Programs founded around this time included Mining, Law, Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In 1831, a library was established. The name of the college changed again in 1867, this time to the National College of Guanajuato. During the following decade, technical programs at the school grew rapidly, as did research. Finally, in 1945, the college changed its name to the University of Guanajuato, and the school was granted autonomy by the state legislature beginning on May 21, 1994.  Mission  Increase, preserve and share all knowledge aimed towards the upright development of the human being, through the preservation of its environment and the construction of a democratic, just and free society.

Sisterhood (Philanthropic Educational Organization) is a U.S.-based international women's organization of about 230,000 members, with a primary focus on providing educational opportunities for female students worldwide. The Sisterhood is headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, with chapters throughout the United States and Canada. Among other projects, it owns and supports Cottey College, an independent college for women in Nevada, Missouri. History The Sisterhood was founded on January 21, 1869,Clapp 1968, p. 1. as a seven-member sorority at Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. It was the second sorority to be founded in the U.S., after I. C. Sorosis (now known as Pi Beta Phi) in Monmouth, Illinois in April 1867. The founding members were Mary Allen [Stafford] (1848–1927), Ella Stewart (1848–94), Alice Bird [Babb] (1850–1926), Hattie Briggs [Bousquet] (1849–77), Franc Roads [Elliott] (1852–1924), Alice Virginia Coffin (1848–88), and Suela Pearson [Penfield] (1851–1920). The sisterhood was founded after only some of the seven girls were invited to join a chapter of I. C. Sorosis organized in Mount Pleasant a month earlier, and they would not join without the others. The organization was originally rooted in the philosophy and institutions of the Methodist Church, which actively promoted women's rights and education in America during the 19th century.Moudry 2013. Further chapters were founded, and in 1883 local chapters of the P.E.O. founded a \\"Supreme Chapter\\" to coordinate the Sisterhood on a national level.Preuss 1924, p. 396. The first International chapter (i.e. outside the United States) was established in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1911.Clapp 1968, p. 289. Although P.E.O. began as a collegiate sorority at Iowa Wesleyan, tensions developed between that original chapter and the wider body. In 1902 the Iowa Wesleyan chapter left P.E.O., to be reconstituted as the second chapter of Alpha Xi Delta (founded in 1893 at Lombard College, Illinois). Since then, P.E.O. has been essentially a community-based organization. Name For much of its history, the meaning of \\"P.E.O.\\" in the organization's name was a closely guarded secret and was never made public.Talking P.E.O.: How does an organization introduce a new identity to the public? By first reassuring itself that 'It's OK' to change. (article by Sheree Clark in Feb./Mar. 2006 issue of Dynamic Graphics magazine) In 1924, it was said that \\"These letters are 'mystic'. None save the initiated know their meaning.\\"Preuss 1924, p. 395. The organization's avoidance of publicity, and the secrecy of its name, caused it to be regarded as a \\"secret society\\".\\"Hide it Under a Bush, Hell No: Women's Volunteer Associations as Adult Education Initiatives\\" Patricia Moran (2007). ProQuest. In 2005, the Sisterhood unveiled a new logo and an \\"It's OK to Talk About P.E.O.\\" campaign, which sought to raise the public profile of the organization while nonetheless maintaining its traditions of secrecy. In 2008, it revised its website to indicate that \\"P.E.O.\\" now publicly stands for \\"Philanthropic Educational Organization\\". However, the Sisterhood acknowledges that \\"P.E.O.\\" originally had a different meaning that continues to be \\"reserved for members only\\", and so the public meaning is not the only one. Sources outside of P.E.O. have suggested that the secret meaning is \\"Protect Each Other\\".  Ritual and symbolism  Membership in P.E.O. is by invitation but is not secret. Meetings for members are, however, highly guarded and a secret password must be used to prove membership. They are opened with prayers and with inspirational readings chosen by members, but P.E.O. meetings and activities do not require any particular religion or religious practice, except for a belief in God. Meetings follow a structured agenda, but do not involve religious rites, and do not meet any formal definition of \\"ritualistic\\". At her initiation, every member receives a P.E.O. emblem, a five-pointed star. Members are encouraged to wear their emblems on January 21, Founders' Day. The emblem is lent to the individual for as long as she remains an active member of a chapter. On her death, it may be buried with her if she has requested this in writing: otherwise, it is to be returned to her chapter or to the P.E.O. Executive. The P.E.O. official flower is the marguerite daisy. Activities P.E.O.'s core mission is to promote educational opportunities for women. It has six philanthropic projects, which include Cottey College, an independent, liberal arts and sciences college for women. Five programs provide assistance to women for higher education: P.E.O. Educational Loan Fund, P.E.O. International Peace Scholarship Fund, P.E.O. Program for Continuing Education, P.E.O. Scholar Awards, and P.E.O. STAR Scholarship. As of April 2020, nearly $366 million has been awarded to over 113,000 women from the organization's six educational philanthropies. P.E.O. has awarded Educational Loan Fund (ELF) dollars totaling more than $221 million, International Peace Scholarships (IPS) are more than $42.1 million, Program for Continuing Education (PCE) grants are more than $62.4 million, P.E.O. Scholar Awards (PSA) are more than $28.2 million and P.E.O. STAR Scholarships (STAR) are more than $12.8 million. =Cottey College= Cottey College, established in 1884, is an independent liberal arts and sciences college for women located in Nevada, Missouri. Its residential student capacity of 350 students typically represents 40 states and 25 countries annually. Cottey is wholly owned by the P.E.O. Sisterhood. =P.E.O. Educational Loan Fund= Educational Loan Fund (ELF) is a revolving loan fund established in 1907 to lend money to qualified women students to assist them in securing a higher education. =P.E.O. International Peace Scholarship= P.E.O. International Peace Scholarship (IPS) Fund was established in 1949 to provide scholarships for international women students to pursue graduate study in the United States and Canada. =P.E.O. Program for Continuing Education= P.E.O. Program for Continuing Education (PCE) was established in 1973 to provide need-based grants to women in the United States and Canada whose education has been interrupted and who find it necessary to return to school to support themselves and/or their families. =P.E.O. Scholar Awards= P.E.O. Scholar Awards (PSA) was established in 1991 to provide substantial merit-based awards for women of the United States and Canada who are pursuing a doctoral level degree at an accredited college or university. =P.E.O. STAR Scholarship= The P.E.O. STAR Scholarship was established in 2009 to provide a $2,500 scholarship for exceptional high school senior women to attend an accredited postsecondary educational institution in the United States or Canada in the following academic year.  Membership  In 1966 the Sisterhood had 130,000 members. At that time membership was open to women over 18, who believed in God and had lived at their present address for a least a year. It was said to appeal to \\"Protestant women of some social standing and college education\\". Although always officially nonsectarian, P.E.O. has evolved over recent generations into a deliberately diverse, community-based organization with nearly 6,000 chapters and some 230,000 members. It has chapters in each of the 50 United States, District of Columbia and in six Canadian provinces. It now aims to serve women worldwide, and to welcome women of all races, religions and backgrounds. It emphasizes that it does \\"not discriminate against any woman based on age, ethnicity, religion or education. The Sisterhood is based on friendship and mutual respect. P.E.O. is not political nor is it a political action group.\\" Notable members * Laura Chenoweth Butz * Saidie Orr Dunbar * Isabel H.

It has applications in the analysis of time series. It was introduced by David Brillinger.David Brillinger, \\"The calculation of cumulants via conditioning\\", Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Vol. 21 (1969), pp. 215-218. It is most transparent when stated in its most general form, for joint cumulants, rather than for cumulants of a specified order for just one random variable. In general, we have : \\\\kappa(X_1,\\\\dots,X_n)=\\\\sum_\\\\pi \\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_i : i\\\\in B \\\\mid Y) : B \\\\in \\\\pi), where * κ(X1, ..., Xn) is the joint cumulant of n random variables X1, ..., Xn, and * the sum is over all partitions \\\\pi of the set { 1, ..., n } of indices, and * \\"B ∈ ;\\" means B runs through the whole list of \\"blocks\\" of the partition , and * κ(Xi : i ∈ B  Y) is a conditional cumulant given the value of the random variable Y. It is therefore a random variable in its own right--a function of the random variable Y. ExamplesThe special case of just one random variable and n = 2 or 3= Only in case n = either 2 or 3 is the nth cumulant the same as the nth central moment. The case n = 2 is well-known (see law of total variance). Below is the case n = 3\\\\. The notation μ3 means the third central moment. :\\\\mu_3(X)= \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\mu_3(X\\\\mid Y))+\\\\mu_3(\\\\operatorname{E}(X\\\\mid Y)) +3\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\operatorname{E}(X\\\\mid Y),\\\\operatorname{var}(X\\\\mid Y)). =General 4th-order joint cumulants= For general 4th-order cumulants, the rule gives a sum of 15 terms, as follows: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) \\\\[5pt] = {} & \\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & \\\\left.\\\\begin{matrix} & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_3,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_2,X_3,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_1\\\\mid Y)) \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}(\\\\text{partitions of the } 3+1 \\\\text{ form}) \\\\[5pt] & \\\\left.\\\\begin{matrix} & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_2\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3,X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2,X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2,X_3\\\\mid Y))\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}(\\\\text{partitions of the } 2+2 \\\\text{ form}) \\\\[5pt] & \\\\left.\\\\begin{matrix} & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_2\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_2,X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_1\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_4\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_2,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_1\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[5pt] & {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_3,X_4\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_1\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2\\\\mid Y)) \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}(\\\\text{partitions of the } 2+1+1 \\\\text{ form}) \\\\[5pt] & \\\\begin{matrix} {}+\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa(X_1\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_2\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_3\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa(X_4\\\\mid Y)). \\\\end{matrix} \\\\end{align} =Cumulants of compound Poisson random variables= Suppose Y has a Poisson distribution with expected value λ, and X is the sum of Y copies of W that are independent of each other and of Y. :X=\\\\sum_{y=1}^Y W_y. All of the cumulants of the Poisson distribution are equal to each other, and so in this case are equal to λ. Also recall that if random variables W1, ..., Wm are independent, then the nth cumulant is additive: :\\\\kappa_n(W_1+\\\\cdots+W_m)=\\\\kappa_n(W_1)+\\\\cdots+\\\\kappa_n(W_m). We will find the 4th cumulant of X. We have: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\kappa_4(X) = {} & \\\\kappa(X,X,X,X) \\\\[8pt] = {} &\\\\kappa_1(\\\\kappa_4(X\\\\mid Y))+4\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa_3(X\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa_1(X\\\\mid Y))+3\\\\kappa_2(\\\\kappa_2(X\\\\mid Y))  & {}+6\\\\kappa(\\\\kappa_2(X\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa_1(X\\\\mid Y),\\\\kappa_1(X\\\\mid Y))+\\\\kappa_4(\\\\kappa_1(X\\\\mid Y)) \\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\kappa_1(Y\\\\kappa_4(W))+4\\\\kappa(Y\\\\kappa_3(W),Y\\\\kappa_1(W)) +3\\\\kappa_2(Y\\\\kappa_2(W))  & {}+6\\\\kappa(Y\\\\kappa_2(W),Y\\\\kappa_1(W),Y\\\\kappa_1(W)) +\\\\kappa_4(Y\\\\kappa_1(W)) \\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\kappa_4(W)\\\\kappa_1(Y)+4\\\\kappa_3(W)\\\\kappa_1(W)\\\\kappa_2(Y) +3\\\\kappa_2(W)^2 \\\\kappa_2(Y)  & {}+6\\\\kappa_2(W) \\\\kappa_1(W)^2 \\\\kappa_3(Y)+\\\\kappa_1(W)^4 \\\\kappa_4(Y) \\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\kappa_4(W)\\\\lambda + 4\\\\kappa_3(W)\\\\kappa_1(W)\\\\lambda + 3\\\\kappa_2(W)^2+6\\\\kappa_2(W) \\\\kappa_1(W)^2 \\\\lambda + \\\\kappa_1(W)^4\\\\lambda \\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname E(W^4) \\\\qquad\\\\text{(the punch line -- see the explanation below).} \\\\end{align} We recognize the last sum as the sum over all partitions of the set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, of the product over all blocks of the partition, of cumulants of W of order equal to the size of the block. That is precisely the 4th raw moment of W (see cumulant for a more leisurely discussion of this fact). Hence the moments of W are the cumulants of X multiplied by λ. In this way we see that every moment sequence is also a cumulant sequence (the converse cannot be true, since cumulants of even order ≥ 4 are in some cases negative, and also because the cumulant sequence of the normal distribution is not a moment sequence of any probability distribution). =Conditioning on a Bernoulli random variable= Suppose Y = 1 with probability p and Y = 0 with probability q = 1 − p. Suppose the conditional probability distribution of X given Y is F if Y = 1 and G if Y = 0\\\\. Then we have :\\\\kappa_n(X)=p\\\\kappa_n(F)+q\\\\kappa_n(G)+\\\\sum_{\\\\pi<\\\\widehat{1}} \\\\kappa_{\\\\left\\\\pi\\\\right}(Y)\\\\prod_{B\\\\in\\\\pi} (\\\\kappa_{\\\\leftB\\\\right}(F)-\\\\kappa_{\\\\leftB\\\\right}(G)) where \\\\pi<\\\\widehat{1} means is a partition of the set { 1, ..., n } that is finer than the coarsest partition - the sum is over all partitions except that one. For example, if n = 3, then we have :\\\\kappa_3(X)=p\\\\kappa_3(F)+q\\\\kappa_3(G)+3pq(\\\\kappa_2(F)-\\\\kappa_2(G))(\\\\kappa_1(F)-\\\\kappa_1(G))+pq(q-p)(\\\\kappa_1(F)-\\\\kappa_1(G))^3.

He has worked on several projects with Josh Levy and PJ DeBoy, and has appeared in small parts on television shows and films.  The Kids in the Hall  Paul Bellini was briefly a member of the sketch comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall in 1984, during its first year of existence. He was replaced by Scott Thompson. For the troupe's eponymous TV series, which ran from 1988 to 1995, Bellini served as Thompson's writing partner. He received several Gemini Award, Emmy Award and CableACE Award nominations as part of the show's writing team.Andrew Matte, \\"Is there one last chance to touch Paul Bellini?: Helping out the kids: Gemini-winning writer pitching ideas in Toronto\\". National Post, January 22, 2000. During the same era, Bellini and Thompson also collaborated in a queercore band called Mouth Congress.Mike Vanderbilt, \\"Now you can listen to Scott Thompson’s pre-Kids In The Hall band online\\". The A.V. Club, September 28, 2015. Bellini's on-screen presence in The Kids in the Hall began when CBC Television suggested that the troupe conduct some form of sweepstakes in order to determine the makeup of the show's fanbase. Turning down such conventional ideas as a free show taping or a cash prize, the members of KITH decided that the \\"prize\\" would be Paul Bellini in a towel. Thus the \\"Touch Paul Bellini\\" contest was born, wherein the winner was granted the chance to gently poke the betoweled Bellini with a stick. During the fourth season, Mike Szabo won a breakfast with him at the Ottawa airport. During these and other appearances on the show, Bellini would wander into a sketch wearing nothing but a towel and never speaking, thus himself becoming an absurd character in the show. At the end of the final episode, however, after the cast is buried alive during the end credits, Bellini approaches their grave, turns to the camera, and intones, \\"Thank God that's finally over.\\" He then picks up a flower and proceeds to dance on their grave. Founded in 1989, the Paul Bellini Fan Club quickly outgrew the Kids in the Hall fan club. The Paul Bellini Fan Club was based in Montreal, with smaller chapters in Winnipeg, Kitchener, Toronto, Abbotsford, Halifax, New York, Utah and parts of Europe. His fans travelled to Toronto to attend tapings of the Kids in the Hall with homemade \\"We Love Paul Bellini\\" signs. When the Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet (the band who recorded the show's theme song) came to play in cities where the Bellini fans lived, they brought gifts or home baking for the band members to deliver back to him in Toronto. The club also recorded more than 20 covers of popular songs with modified lyrics that were distributed among members and sung at the Paul Bellini music festival in 1993. The group hosted a Bellini Bratwurst Bar-be- que, produced regular newsletters, and a video depicting a fanciful re- enactment of Bellini's early life. At one event, Bellini brought a bag full of Timmins souvenirs as thank you gifts for his loyal fan club. He was subsequently a writer for This Hour Has 22 Minutes,Anne McIlroy, \\"Newscasts provide fodder for 22 minutes of laughs\\".

I-291 is roughly a northeast/southwest highway. It merges with I-91 at its southwestern terminus, via a flyover. The road meets the Mass Pike at its northeastern terminus. Getting onto the Pike from I-291 is straightforward, but getting from the Pike to I-291 requires a left turn at an at-grade traffic signal. I-291 travels directly through highly populated areas of Springfield, and passes under several overpasses. From its southwestern terminus to exit 5A, Interstate 291 is concurrent with U.S. Route 20. I-291 is only from Interstate 291 in Connecticut, and there are no intervening Interstate Highway interchanges between them. It can be easy for travelers to become confused between the two highways. Route description Interstate 291 begins as a spur of Interstate 91 at Exit 8 in Springfield, concurrent with U.S. 20, which merges from the north. The two entry ramps from I-91 merge with each other after Exits 2A and 2B, where a sign for the beginning of I-291 east is posted. I-291 and U.S. 20 run eastbound concurrently until Exit 5A (U.S. 20 joins westbound at Exit 5), where U.S. 20 east leaves the highway for a junction with Route 20A. I-291 continues east into Chicopee, where it intersects the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90). I-291 ends at an odd intersection at a stoplight on Burnett Road, but I-291 east traffic can exit uninterrupted by way of a ramp to the Mass Pike. However, drivers coming from the Mass Pike must deal with this traffic light, as a left turn across the intersection is required to get on I-291 west. The westbound interchange with I-91 is unusual in that the ramps for Exit 1A-B split before the ramps for Exits 2A-B do. Traffic bound for Exit 2A (Chestnut Street) must first take the ramp for Exit 1A (I-91 South), and traffic bound for Exit 2B (Dwight St.) must first take the ramp for Exit 1B (I-91 North). Traffic bound for U.S. 20 West from I-291 takes Exit 1B. U.S. 20 does not actually join with I-91, but rather this exit splits, left for the on-ramp to I-91 North, the right to continue on the U.S. 20 access ramp. History I-291 was originally conceived in 1953, prior to the creation of the Interstate Highway System, as the Springfield Expressway, which would bypass US 20 and connect to the US 5 expressway (now I-91) and the proposed Massachusetts Turnpike. I-291 follows the original planned alignment of the expressway, except for the stretch between exit 4 (St. James Avenue) and exit 5 (US 20/MA 20A/Page Boulevard). The original planned alignment had the route turn in almost a perfect 90 degree angle onto Roosevelt Avenue, but industrial development (including the relocation of Smith & Wesson's corporate headquarters) had the highway turn more gently. The first section of the expressway that was built was the bridge over the Chicopee River. The first section of the expressway that opened was from US 20/MA 20A to I-90 (Mass. Turnpike) in 1957; work on the freeway started up again in 1967 and the entire highway was completed in 1971. The construction delay was due to I-91 having priority through western Massachusetts. Exit list All interchanges were to be renumbered to mileage-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016.However, this project was indefinitely postponed until on November 18, 2019, MassDOT announced that this route will not be changing the exit numbers.

The area is being rapidly deforested. Consisting of more than 60% of Paraguay's land area, but with less than 10% of the population, the Chaco is one of the most sparsely inhabited areas in South America. The surrounding Gran Chaco area is also a large geographic area that is sparsely populated. Many of those living in the region are indigenous. It covers the departments of Boquerón, Upper Paraguay and the Department of Presidente Hayes, Paraguay. The Chaco region was the scene of the longest territorial war to occur in South America; an armed conflict between Paraguay and Bolivia, lasting from 1932 to 1935. It is also home to sites of historical significance that have been preserved, including Boquerón, Campo Grande, Via Campo, Nanawa, the site of the battle of Cañada Strongest, Carmen, Kilometro 7, Picuiba, and Villamontes, amongst others. Location The Paraguayan Chaco is located between the Pilcomayo and Paraguay Rivers, which provide saline soils that attract a rich variety of plants and animals. Its boundaries are the border with Argentina along the Pilcomayo River to the west; the border with Brazil over the mouth of Apa River to the south-east; is the border with Bolivia to the north; and the border with the Región Oriental (Eastern Region) to the south.

Animals The Chaco has an abundance of wildlife. Larger animals present in the region include jaguar, ocelot, puma, tapir, giant armadillo, giant anteater, many species of foxes, numerous small wildcats, the agouti (a large rodent), the capybara (water hog), the maned wolf, the palustrian deer, peccaries, including the endemic Chacoan peccary, and the guanaco (the wild relative of the llama). The region has an abundant and varied bird population and one of the largest populations of the greater rhea (or nandu), a large flightless South American bird. The streams host more than 400 fish species, among which are the salmon-like dorado and the flesh-eating piranha. The region is home to many species of insects, some of which cause discomfort for travellers. Reptiles also are abundant, with numerous lizards and at least 60 known species of snakes, including many pit vipers and constrictors. The region is also home to many unique amphibians, including the iconic waxy monkey tree frog Phyllomedusa sauvagii that produces a waxy secretion to prevent drying out and coraline frog Leptodactylus laticeps that spends the dry season deep in a burrow, emerging with the rains to feed on other frogs. Flora The vegetation of the Chaco varies from the east to the west, reflecting the changing nature of the soil. Eastern Chaco is noted for its park-like landscape of clustered trees and shrubs interspersed with tall, herbaceous savannahs. To the west, a wide transition zone grades into the espinal, a dry forest of spiny, thorny shrubs and low trees. Chaco's vegetation has adapted to grow in arid conditions, and is highly varied and exceedingly complex. One of the most impressive vegetation formations is called the quebrachales, which consists of vast, low hardwood forests where various species of quebracho trees are dominant. The quebracho tree is economically important as a source of tannin and lumber. These forests cover extensive areas away from the rivers; nearer the rivers they occupy the higher, better-drained sites, giving rise to a landscape in which the forests appear as islands amid a sea of savannah grasses growing as high as a person on horseback. In the more arid western Chaco, thorn forests, the continuity of which is occasionally broken by palm groves, saline steppes, and savannas, created by fire or deforestation, are dominated by another quebracho tree that has a lower tannin content and is used most often for lumber. There is also a marked increase in the number and density of thorny species, among which the notorious vinal (Prosopis ruscifolia) was declared a national plague in Argentina because of how its thorns, up to a foot in length, posed a livestock hazard in the agricultural lands it invaded. Main features Ecotourism remains a potential industry for the region because of its rich biodiversity, allowing for a similar type of ecotourism seen in the Amazon. The region remains of interest to hunting enthusiasts. It also hosts the annual Trans Chaco Rally, a prominent automobile race, which is considered one of the most difficult the continent, mainly because of the dusty and dry roads which comprise its routes, and the extreme heat. Chaco is known for its cultural, religious and economic diversity. The Indigenous peoples of the Gran Chaco maintain their cultures, particularly in the northern Chaco. Northern Chaco is also known as an ideal place to purchase indigenous fine crafts. In the forest reserves, the Sanapaná and Nivaclé peoples speak Sanapaná and Nivaclé languages, respectively. The karanda'y is the material used for the manufacture of handbags, wallets, vases, porta tereré (bags to hold thermos flasks for tereré, the typical summer drink) carrying baskets and mats. The natives are experts in natural medicine. The thorny varieties of plants are replacing the trees with deciduous leaves in these areas. Chaco also offers an excellent option for rural tourism. One place offering rural tourism opportunities is the area Estancia La Patria, Department of Boquerón, Colony Neuland, which was created by the national government with the aim of boosting the development of this area of the country. It is located 110 kilometers from Infante Rivarola, a military post located on the border with Bolivia. The Chaco area is famous for the large number of hunters who visit, despite a ban on hunting of endangered animals. It is a high floodplain with a gentle slope to the east, and experiences relatively little rainfall (400 mm/year). Some areas are flooded occasionally, during which time the appearance of species adapted to such an environment is seen. The soils in the region are salty, and their use is limited because of their aridity. The Chaco is irrigated by the rivers Pilcomayo and Paraguay, both of which sprout many tributaries.

It is one of the few musical instruments that still uses watch-key or Preston tuners. It is iconically associated with the musical genre known as Fado, and is now an icon for anything Portuguese. History Portuguese guitar The Portuguese guitar now known has undergone considerable technical modification in the last century (dimensions, mechanical tuning system, etc.) although it has kept the same number of courses, the string tuning and the finger technique characteristic of this type of instrument. It is a descendant of the Medieval citole, based on evidence of its use in Portugal since the thirteenth century (then known as 'cítole' in Portuguese) amongst troubadour and minstrel circles and in the Renaissance period, although initially it was restricted to noblemen in court circles. Later it became popular and references have been found to citterns being played in the theater, in taverns and barbershops in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in particular. In 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and described its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people’s love for the cittern and other musical instruments. In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of King John IV of Portugal containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us to believe that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal. Fado, by José Malhoa (1910) The angel playing the cittern (c.1680), a sculpture of large dimensions in the Alcobaça Monastery, depicts in detail the direct ancestor of the Portuguese guitar. In the first half of the eighteenth century, Ribeiro Sanches (1699–1783) had cittern lessons in the town of Guarda, Portugal, as he mentions in a letter from St. Petersburg in 1735. In the same period there are other evidence to the use of the cittern alluding to a repertoire of sonatas, minuets, etc. shared with other instruments such as the harpsichord or the guitar. Later in the century (c. 1750), the so-called English guittar made its appearance in Portugal. By 1786 those made by Simpson, an English luthier, became highly popular, and it was noted that he could also provide reliable nickel-silver strings. There was a type of cittern locally modified by German, English, Scottish and Dutch makers and enthusiastically greeted by the new mercantile bourgeoisie of the city of Porto who used it in the domestic context of Hausmusik practice. This consisted of the \\"languid Modinhas\\", the \\"lingering Minuets\\" and the \\"risqué Lunduns\\", as they were then called.See Estudo de Guitarra (...) by António da Silva Leite (1759-1833) published in Oporto in 1796. The use of this type of guitar never became widespread. It disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century when the popular version of the cittern came into fashion again by its association with the Lisbon song (fado) accompaniment. The last detailed reference to the cítara appeared in 1858 in J.F. Fètis' book The Music Made Easy. The Portuguese translation includes a glossary describing the various characteristics (tunings, social status, repertoire, etc.) of both cittern and \\"English\\" guitar of the time. Gradually the Simpson design was transformed by Portuguese luthiers, with a wider body, longer scale length, and a wider fingerboard, made more manageable by using a large radius, rather than a flat fingerboard. The Portuguese guitar is used for solo music (guitarradas) as well as the accompaniment, which it shares with a steel strung classical guitar (viola de fado) and occasional double bass or guitar-bass, and its wide repertoire is often presented in concert halls and in the context of classical and world music festivals all around the world. Models There are two distinct Portuguese guitar models: the Lisboa and the Coimbra. The differences between the two models are the scale length (445 mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470 mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament (caracois - snail) that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop- shaped (lagrima) motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences. As early as 1905 luthiers were building larger Portuguese guitars (called guitarrão, the plural being guitarrões), seemingly in very small numbers and with limited success. Recently, the famed luthier Gilberto Grácio has built a guitarrão, which he named a guitolão instead; this instrument which allows for a wider timbric range, on the low and the high end, than a regular Portuguese guitar. Technique The techniques employed to play the Portuguese guitar are what are historically called figueta and dedilho. Figueta technique comprises playing solely with the thumb and the index fingers and it was inspired by the technique used to play Viola da Terra. Dedilho technique concentrates on up and down strokes of the index finger to play complex passages. On the Portuguese guitar the strings are picked with the corner of the fingernails, avoiding contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the guarda-unhas on the soundboard. Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks (unhas) were traditionally made of tortoiseshell, but today are usually nylon or plastic. While Lisboa unhas are commonly rectangular shaped for a clearer attack, Coimbra unhas tend to follow the natural curve of the fingernail. Technique basics are the fado maior, fado menor and fado Mouraria. Then one masters the trinado (a triplet ornament), slides, picking individual strings (instead of both in a course), and intense characteristic vibrato to embellish the melody. Finally, in addition to the fados, there are traditional virtuosic pieces—the fado Lopes, and Variaçoes em Re Menor, La Menor, Mi Menor and Si Menor. A good guitarrista should know at least a hundred of the over two hundred standard fados in any key requested by the fadista. = Lisboa = The Lisboa style of playing traditionally utilizes the Guitarra de Lisboa, but today it is increasingly more common to see musicians with Guitarra de Coimbra tuned tighter to accommodate the Lisboa tuning. In accompanying Lisbon Fado the guitarrista plays the introduction, traditionally based on the second half of the vocal melody, then alternates between the techniques described above and short expressive phrases answering the fadista's phrases in a musical call-and- response. In faster fados the guitarra often improvises virtuosically throughout, including soloing over the fadista's singing. = Coimbra = The Coimbra style of playing, popularized by Artur and Carlos Paredes, originates with the university students from the historic Universidade de Coimbra. The male students and graduates would traditionally play a Coimbra Fado at night or serenata (serenade) for a woman to be courted. Instead of bridging the gap between a singer's phrases, in Coimbra Fado, the guitarra plays the chordal accompaniment alongside the Acoustic guitar. As opposed to the rapid, more technically challenging Lisbon Fado, the guitarrista plays a downstroke with the thumb followed by a rolled chord across all the strings which ends with the index finger crossed in front of the thumb. This pattern is easily modified to fit the time signature of the specific Coimbra Fado being played. Notable artists António Chainho and his Portuguese guitar (Lisbon model) Armandinho, born in 1891, became one of the most influential guitar players in Lisbon, leaving a vast repertoire of variations and fados behind. He is credited with popularizing the second soloist approach to guitarra playing in fado accompaniment over the usage of simple plucked chords. Following in Armandinho's footsteps came other guitarists, such as Jaime Santos, Raul Nery, José Nunes, Carlos Gonçalves and Fontes Rocha. Artur Paredes, born in 1899, was an equally important player in the city of Coimbra. Many of today's Coimbra guitar features can be traced back to his contact with local luthiers. His son Carlos Paredes was a virtuoso and attained great popularity, becoming the most internationally known Portuguese guitar player. His compositions on the Portuguese guitar go beyond the traditional use of the instrument in fado musicianship giving him (and the instrument) a status above folk or regional music. This soloistic tradition has been followed till today by several outstanding musicians such as Pedro Caldeira Cabral, Antonio Chainho, Ricardo Rocha, Paulo Soares, and several other virtuoso guitarists of the younger generation. The first concerto for Portuguese guitar and orchestra in history was composed and premiered by Pedro Henriques da Silva on December 5th, 2017 with the Orchestra of the Swan at Stratford ArtsHouse in Stratford-upon-Avon. Many leading guitarristas in Lisboa—Mario Pacheco, Luis Guerreiro, Jose Manuel Neto, Henrique Leitão, Bruno Chaveiro, Paulo de Castro, Ricardo Martins and Custodio Castelo - now use Oscar Cardoso guitarras, which feature the extraordinary innovation of a cutaway in the back of the guitarra, and a Coimbra string length but with Lisboa tuning. The virtuosity of these artists has changed the sound of fado radically, and their speed is extraordinary. Rocha has composed highly avant-garde pieces, and the original guitarradas of Pacheco, Castelo and Martins have become common repertoire in Lisboa, as those of Soares have become in Coimbra. Most advanced players will learn some of Carlos Paredes' difficult works. Marta Pereira Da Costa has achieved prominence as the first female virtuoso guitarrista. =Outside Portuguese music= The Portuguese guitar played a small role in Celtic and western folk music following the folk revival. In the 1970s, Andy Irvine of the band Planxty played a modified Portuguese guitar. British luthier Stefan Sobell based his early 1970s creation of the modern cittern on a Portuguese guitar he'd bought at a used shop in Leeds some years previously. Several jazz musicians have also recorded with the Portuguese guitar, including Brad Shepik. The Portuguese guitar features prominently on Sun Kil Moon's debut album Ghosts Of The Great Highway. British guitarist Steve Howe plays the instrument on the Yes songs \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" from The Yes Album (1971), \\"Wonderous Stories\\" from Going for the One (1977), also on \\"Hour of Need\\" from Fly from Here (2011) and finally on To Ascend from Heaven and Earth (2014). Portuguese guitar makers There are many Portuguese guitar makers still building guitars, according to traditional craftsmanship. Many families have passed on their knowledge for generations. Amongst the most notable guitarreiros, or guitar makers, are the Grácio family, Álvaro Ferreira, the Tavares family (now living in Toronto Canada), the Cardoso family—particularly Oscar Cardoso (whose guitarras are the subject of a recent book), António Guerra, Domingos Machado, Fernando Meireles, Antonio Monteiro and Domingos Cerqueira. The Grácio family and Álvaro Ferreira's instruments are usually considered as the pinnacle in terms of quality, although these instruments are very hard to find and can be quite expensive. Antonio Pinto de Carvalho's APC luthiery is one of the largest in Europe, and produces thousands of traditional Portuguese stringed instruments. Tuning Afinação de Lisboa (Lisboa tuning) Afinação de Coimbra (Coimbra tuning) Afinação natural (Natural tuning) The tuning chiefly employed on the Portuguese guitar was historically called afinação do fado or afinação do fado corrido. It was probably developed in the early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's fadistas by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either afinação de Lisboa, when tuned high, in D, or afinação de Coimbra, when tuned low, in C; this stems from the fact that while most Lisbon Fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a do/C is called re/D, a D is called mi/E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a transposing instrument similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a whole step higher than the note name that concert-pitch conventions would use). The natural tuning, inherited from the English guittar of the 18th century, was also very frequently employed up to the first half of the 20th century, being preferred to the former by some late-19th-century players; it was frequently tuned in E instead of C, as this simplified the change between the fado tuning for players who used both. Some variations of this tuning were also adopted, such as the afinação natural com 4ª, also known as afinação da Mouraria, or the afinação de João de Deus, also known as afinação natural menor. The natural tuning and its variations have been for the most part, out of practice for several decades.  Notation  The Portuguese guitar can read Portuguese guitar tablature, sheet music in treble, or a combination of both. The dedilho technique is notated with up and down arrows over multiple notes corresponding to a downstroke or upstroke of the index finger. An \\"i\\" is used to indicate a stroke with the index finger, or indicador, and a \\"p\\" is used for the thumb, or polegar. The middle finger is rarely used but notated with an \\"m\\" for médio. While one can find many virtuosic Coimbra pieces written out as sheet music, fados are generally improvised and require no music for a good guitarrista to play. The chord progression to each specific fado should be understood by the good guitarrista. While this skill has traditionally been acquired by younger players playing alongside a more advanced guitarrista in an ensemble, it was only in the early 2000s that the first fado school had been established to formally teach the improvisational style alongside the written version.

The Cakrasaṃvara Tantra (, khorlo demchok, The \\"Binding of the Wheels\\" Tantra) is an influential Buddhist Tantra. It is roughly dated to the late eight or early ninth century by David B. Gray (with a terminus ante quem in the late tenth century).Gray (2007), pp. 4, 11. The full title in the Sanskrit manuscript used by Gray's translation is: Great King of Yoginī Tantras called the Śrī Cakrasaṃvara (Śrīcakrasaṃvara-nāma-mahayoginī-tantra-tāja). The text is also called the Discourse of Śrī Heruka (Śrīherukābhidhāna) and the Samvara Light (Laghusaṃvara).Gray (2007), p. 5. \\"Cakrasaṃvara\\" may also refer to the main deity in this tantra as well as to a collection of texts or \\"cycle\\" associated with the root Cakrasaṃvara tantra. Tsunehiko Sugiki writes that this \\"Cakrasaṃvara cycle\\", \\"is one of the largest collections of Buddhist Yoginītantra literature from the early medieval South Asian world.\\"Sugiki, Tsunehiko. Review of David B. Gray, The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Śrī Heruka): A Study and Annotated Translation. JIABS Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 31 Number 1–2 2008 (2010), p. 505. As Gray notes, it seems to have been very popular in northern India \\"during the late tenth through late thirteenth centuries when the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet took place.\\"Gray (2007), p. 3. According to the modern scholar and translator David B. Gray, \\"its study and practice is maintained by the Newar Buddhist community in the Kathmandu valley, as well as by many Tibetan Buddhists, not only in Tibet itself but in other regions influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, including Mongolia, Russia, China, and elsewhere, as Tibetan lamas have been living and teaching in diaspora.\\"Gray (2007), p. xiii. In the Tibetan classification schema, this tantra is considered to be of the \\"mother\\" class of the Anuttarayoga (Unsurpassable yoga) class, also known as the Yoginītantras. These tantras were known for their sexual yogas. The text survives in several Sanskrit and Tibetan manuscripts. There are at least eleven surviving Sanskrit commentaries on the tantra and various Tibetan ones. The Cakrasamvara is mostly dedicated to describing rituals and yogic practices which produce either mundane siddhis (accomplishment) such as flight and the supramundane siddhi of awakening. These are achieved through practices such as deity yoga (visualizing oneself as the deity) and the use of mantras.Gray, David B. The Cakrasamvara Tantra: Its History, Interpretation, and Practice in India and Tibet, Santa Clara University, Religion Compass 1/6 (2007): 695–710, http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/chakrasamvara-tantra%20its%20history.pdf  Background  According to David B. Gray, the Cakrasaṃvara \\"developed in a non-monastic setting, and was composed via the active appropriation of elements of both text and practice belonging to non-Buddhist groups, most notably the Kapalikas, an extreme and quasi-heretical Saiva group focusing on transgressive practices.\\" The British Indologist Alexis Sanderson has also written about how the Cakrasaṃvara literature appropriated numerous elements from the Shaiva Vidyapitha tantras, including whole textual passages. Gray writes, > The term yogini in the name Yogini Tantra points to the unusual social > context in which these texts arose. It appears almost certain that the > Yogini Tantras, with their focus on sexual practices, the transgressive > consumption of \\"polluting\\" substances such as bodily effluvia, female > deities such as yoginis and dakinis, and fierce male deities, such as the > Heruka deities—who are closely modeled on Saiva deities such as Mahakala and > Bhairava, and bear the accoutrements of charnel ground dwelling yogins—did > not solely derive from a mainstream monastic Buddhist context. Instead, they > seem to have developed among and/or been influenced by liminal groups of > renunciant yogins and yoginis, who collectively constituted what might be > called the \\"siddha movement.\\" ... who chose a deliberately transgressive > lifestyle, drawing their garb and, in part, sustenance from the liminal > space of the charnel ground that was the privileged locus for their > meditative and ritual activities. The Saiva Kapalikas constituted the best- > known group in this subculture, as attested by the numerous references to > them in Sanskrit literature.Gray (2007), pp. 7-8. These appropriated non-Buddhist elements were transformed, explained or erased over time, with more Buddhist elements being added as the Cakrasaṃvara tradition developed and was adopted in major Buddhist institutions like Vikramashila (from about the 9th century onwards). A myth also developed in order to explain the appropriation (depicted as the subjugation of Shiva by Saṃvara). This both reduced Shiva (Rudra) and other Shaiva deities to a subordinate position under the Buddhist deities (which took their form) and explained the usage of Shaiva elements by Buddhists. In other cases, the presence of Saiva deities like Mahabhairava are explained referring to Buddhas (as stated in Jayabhadra's commentary).Gray (2007), p. 10.  Deity, Myth and Mandala  Cakrasamvara mandala, circa 1100, Nepal The Cakrasaṃvara commentators consider the tantra to be a timeless divine revelation of either the Dharmakāya Buddha Mahāvajradhara or of the goddess Vajravārāhī.Gray (2007), pp. 32-35. The central deity of the tradition is called Samvara, Śamvara, Śrī Heruka, or simply Heruka. This figure became popular in Buddhist circles around the 8th century.Gray (2007), p. 35. The noun samvara derives from a verb which means to \\"bind,\\" \\"enclose,\\" or \\"conceal,\\" and samvara commonly means \\"vow\\" and sometimes \\"sanctuary\\". In the tantra it appears in various compounds, such as \\"the binding of the dakini net\\" (ḍākinījālasamvara), which is associated with the term \\"union with Śrī Heruka.\\" In this sense, samvara can also refer to \\"union\\", which is supreme bliss and supreme awakening.Gray (2007), p. 36. According to Gray, the \\"dakini net\\" is the Cakrasaṃvara mandala, dominated by the three wheels of the dakinis and their consorts. Furthermore, \\"its 'binding' is the process of union or mystical identification in which the adept engages via creative visualization, thereby achieving \\"union with Sri Heruka.\\" This term thus refers to the \\"body mandala\\" practice in which the adept visualizes the three wheels of the mandala within his/her own body.\\"Gray (2007), p. 36. Gray writes that the name of Samvara has an ancient lineage. A figure called Śamvara can be found in the Rig Veda, as an enemy of Indra and as a kind of asura.Gray (2007), pp. 37-38. Asko Parpola has argued that Samvara and other similar deities which are associated with the power of illusion (maya) are remnants of pre-Aryan cults. Gray writes that there may have been an asura cult that the Buddhists drew from in their development of \\"new cults of deities who were viewed as manifesting hostility to the classical Hindu deities such as Siva and Visnu, just as the asura were the perpetual foes of the older vedic deities such as Indra.\\"Gray (2007), p. 39. In this, they may have also been influenced by Puranic sources which portrayed the Buddhist \\"heresy\\" as a trick meant to deceive the asuras. Regarding the name Heruka, it first appears as a name for a class of fierce demon like beings. Heruka also appears as a charnel ground deity which is said to be \\"the guise assumed by the Buddha Vajradhara in his effort to subdue evil doers,\\" in the Samayoga Tantra.Gray (2007), p. 40. In the Samayoga, the universe is being destroyed by evil beings (stirred up by Mara), and all the Hindu deities seek refuge in Vajradhara, who assembles all the Buddhas. Since these evil beings are not able to be subdued by peaceful means, the Buddhas must manifest ferocious appearances. Heruka is born from Vajradhara, and he burns up the entire universe, purifying it in the process.Gray (2007), pp. 41-43. Gray writes that eventually this earlier myth of Heruka's origin evolved into a more polemical version, in which Heruka is born to subdue Shaiva deities, like Rudra and Mahabhairava, which are here seen as the source of the cosmic disorder. This was probably influenced by another myth in which Shiva is subdued by Vajrapāṇi in the Tattvasaṃgraha An Indian version of this myth can be found in Indrabhuti's commentary and is cited by Gray. In it, Vajrapāṇi forces Mahadeva, i.e. Shiva (along with a host of deities) to appear in Akanishtha (Vajradhara's realm), whereupon he is annihilated when he refuses to turn from his evil ways. Then Vajrapāṇi revives Mahadeva with his mantric power, and Shiva then becomes a Buddha known as \\"Soundless Lord of Ashes.\\" 47-48 Then the myth also tells of how Vajradhara emerged as the manifestation body known as Śrī Heruka in order to subdue Bhairava and Kalaratri who had taken over the world with their hateful and lustful ways. Heruka takes Bhairava's form and sends out various deities to subdue and destroy Bhairava and his associated deities. These Buddhist deities then take the form of the Bhairava deities as a skillful means (upaya).Gray (2007), pp. 50-52. According to David Gray, > This myth represents the adoption of non-Buddhist elements while at the same > time representing the subordination of these elements within a Buddhist > cosmic hierarchy, graphically represented by the placement of the Saiva > deities under the feet of their Buddhist vanquisher. The myth provides an > elaborate fourfold scheme for this process of the appropriation and > subordination of a non-Buddhist tradition.Gray (2007), p. 53. Samvara is one of the principal yidam or meditational deities of the Sarma schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Samvara is typically depicted with a blue- coloured body, four faces, and twelve arms, and embracing his consort, the wisdom dakini Vajravārāhī (a.k.a. Vajrayoginī) in Yab-Yum (sexual union). Other forms of the deities are also known with varying numbers of limbs and features, such as a two armed version. According to the Buddhist Tantric scholar Abhayakaragupta, the deity's mandala is described thus: > In the Samvara mandala there is a variegated lotus atop Mount Sumeru within > an adamantine tent (vajrapañjara). Placed on it is a double vajra, which > sits as the base of a court in the middle of which is the Blessed Lord. He > stands in the archer (alidha) stance on Bhairava and Kalaratri who lie on a > solar disk atop the pericarp of the lotus. He is black and has four faces > which are, beginning with the front [and continuing around counter- > clockwise], black, green, red, and yellow, each of which has three eyes. He > has a tiger skin and has twelve arms. Two arms holding a vajra and a vajra- > bell embrace Vajravarahi. Two of his hands hold up over his back a white > elephant hide dripping with blood. His other [right hands hold] a damaru > drum, an axe, a flaying knife (kartri), and a trident. His remaining left > [hands hold] a khatvanga staff marked with a vajra, a skull-bowl filled with > blood, a vajra noose, and the head of Brahma. A garland of fifty moist human > heads hangs about his neck. He has the six insignia, and a sacred thread > made of human sinew. He has a row of five skulls above his forehead, and a > crest of black dreadlocks topped by a left-oriented crescent moon and a > double vajra. He is endowed with a fierce meditative state (vikrtadhyana) > and bears his fangs. He brings together in one the nine dramatic sentiments > (navarasa).Gray, David (2007), The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Sri > Heruka): Śrīherukābhidhāna: A Study and Annotated Translation (Treasury of > the Buddhist Sciences), pp. 44-45.  Practices  As Gray writes, the tantra's cryptic and obscure chapters mostly focus on \\"the description of rites such as the production of the mandala, the consecration ceremonies performed within it, as well as various other ritual actions such as homa fire sacrifices, enchantment with mantras, and so forth. Moreover, like many tantras, and perhaps more than most, it fails to give sufficient information for the performance of these rituals. It also often obscures crucial elements, particularly the mantras, which the text typically presents in reverse order, or which it codes via an elaborate scheme in which both the vowels and consonants are coded by number.\\"Gray (2007), p. 15. The reason for the text's obscurity is mostly likely that these rites were considered secret and one was supposed to receive instructions on them from one's guru after initiation. It is therefore difficult to understand the tantra's practices without relying on a commentary.  The Cakrasaṃvara literature  There are three genres of Cakrasaṃvara literature: \\"explanatory tantras\\" (vyakhyatantra); commentaries; and ritual literature (sadhanas, mandala manuals, initiation manuals). The explanatory tantras refers to independent tantras that are seen as being part of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle. The main explanatory tantras (given by Buton Rinchen Drub) are: the Abhidhānottara, the Vajradāka; Ḍākārṇava, Herukābhyudaya, Yoginīsaṃcāra, Samvarodaya, Caturyoginīsaṃpuṭa; Vārāhī-abhisambodhi, and the Sampuṭa Tantra.Gray (2007), p. 16. Most of these texts show no internal evidence they consider themselves as subsidiary to the root Cakrasaṃvara Tantra, and it is likely they were grouped into this category by the later tradition.Gray (2007), p. 18. Furthermore, it seems the root Cakrasaṃvara Tantra is not as important in the Newari tradition, which instead privileges the Samvarodaya.Gray (2007), p. 20. The main Indian commentaries to the root tantra are:Gray (2007), pp. 21-24. * Jayabhadra of Laṅka (early to mid 9th century scholar at Vikramashila), Śrī-cakrasaṃvara-mūla-tantra-pañjikā. The oldest, word-for-word commentary. It survives in two Sanskrit manuscripts and Tibetan translation. * Kambala (possibly 9th century), Sādhana-nidāna-nāma- śrī-cakrasaṃvara-pañjikā. This is another early commentary that was very influential and relied upon by various later authors. * Bhavabhaṭṭa (late 9th century scholar at Vikramashila), Śrī-cakrasaṃvara-pañjikā-nāma. This is a larger work which relies on Jayabhadra but also sometimes contradicts him. It also replies older Shaiva readings with more Buddhist oriented ones. * Devagupta's Commentary which is basically an expansion of Kambala's * Bhavyakīrti (early 10th century scholar at Vikramashila), Śrī-cakrasaṃvarasya- pañjikā-śūramanojñā-nāma. This is a shorter and more conservative commentary which stays closer to the Jayabhadra commentary. * Durjayacandra (late 10th century scholar at Vikramashila), Ratnagaṇa-nāma-pañjikā. This commentary is particularly important for the Sakya school since it was used by Rinchen Zangpo. * Tathāgatarakṣita (scholar at Vikramashila), Ubhayanibandha-nāma * Indrabuti's Commentary which relies on Kambala's * Vīravajra's two 11th century commentaries. Gray states that \\"They are very sophisticated works, and represent a high point of Indian tantric Buddhist scholarship. His commentaries are also among the most thorough. He relies both upon Jayabhadra and Kambala, as well as Bhavabhaṭṭa and Durjayacandra, and he is also quite erudite, quoting from a number of other sources, including Yogacara texts and a number of other tantras.\\" * *Śāśvatavajra (rtag pa'i rdo rje)'s śrī- tattvaviśadā-nāma-śrīsaṃvara-vṛitti, translated in the 14th century by Buton. There are also several Tibetan commentaries, including those of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092-1158), Buton (1290-1364), and Tsongkhapa (1357-1419).Gray (2007), p. 25.

Sol Liptzin characterized him as \\"a master of the picturesque vitriolic phrase.\\" [Liptzin, 1972, 46] Life He was raised a Hasidic Jew in Vinnytsia, Podolia (now in Ukraine), but revolted against his violent schoolteachers and cabalist father by aligning himself with the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment. His father tried to offset this development by marrying him at the age of fourteen to a twelve-year-old girl; he drew her away from Hasidism and Kabbalah, and his father forced him to divorce and remarry, this time to what Liptzin describes as \\"a deaf, moronic woman\\". Linetzky ran away to Odessa, Ukraine, where he acquired a secular education. Attempting to leave for Germany to continue his education, he was stopped at the border and brought back, a virtual prisoner, to Vinitza. At 23, he managed again to escape, this time to the government-sponsored rabbinical academy at Zhytomyr, where he developed a close friendship with Abraham Goldfaden. Like Goldfaden and several other Yiddish-language writers of his generation, he came to prominence in the 1860s as a writer for Kol Mevasser; like several others, he had first published in its Hebrew language sister publication Hamelitz. With Goldfaden, he was later involved in several Yiddish language newspapers, including as joint editors of the short-lived weekly Yisrolik (July 1875-February 1876) almost immediately before Goldfaden founded the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. The pogroms following the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II of Russia made Linetzky into an early Zionist. His 1882 booklet America or Israel aligned him with the Hovevei Zion movement, active in the Jewish colonization of Palestine. Works His semi- autobiographical picaresque novel, Dos Poylishe Yingl (The Polish Lad), an outright attack on the Hasidim, first appeared in installments in Kol Mevasser in 1867, and remained popular at least until the eve of World War II. Other works included a book of poems Der Beyzer Marshalik (The Angry Master of Ceremonies, 1879).

The Spencer was the world's first military metallic cartridge repeating rifle, and over 200,000 examples were manufactured in the United States by the Spencer Repeating Rifle Co. and Burnside Rifle Co. between 1860 and 1869. The Spencer repeating rifle was adopted by the Union Army, especially by the cavalry, during the American Civil War but did not replace the standard issue muzzle-loading rifled muskets in use at the time. Among the early users was George Armstrong Custer. The Spencer carbine was a shorter and lighter version designed for the cavalry. Design Diagram of the Spencer rifle showing the magazine in the butt The design for a magazine-fed, lever-operated rifle chambered for the .56-56 Spencer rimfire cartridge was completed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. Called the Spencer Repeating Rifle, it was fired by cocking a lever to extract a used case and feed a new cartridge from a tube in the buttstock. Like most firearms of the time, the hammer had to be manually cocked after each round in a separate action before the weapon could be fired. The weapon used copper rimfire cartridges, based on the 1854 Smith & Wesson patent, stored in a seven-round tube magazine. A spring in the tube enabled the rounds to be fired one after another. When empty, the spring had to be released and removed before dropping in fresh cartridges, then replaced before resuming firing. Rounds could be loaded individually or from a device called the Blakeslee Cartridge Box, which contained up to thirteen (also six and ten) tubes with seven cartridges each, which could be emptied into the magazine tube in the buttstock. Unlike later cartridge designations, the .56-56 Spencer's first number referred to the diameter of the case just ahead of the rim, the second number the case diameter at the mouth; the actual bullet diameter was . Cartridges were loaded with of black powder, and were also available as .56-52, .56-50, and a wildcat .56-46, a necked down version of the original .56-56. Cartridge length was limited by the action size to about ; later calibers used a smaller diameter, lighter bullet and larger powder charge to increase power and range over the original .56-56 cartridge, which was almost as powerful as the .58 caliber rifled musket of the time but under-powered by the standards of other early cartridges such as the .50–70 and .45-70. Military use When Spencer signed his new rifle up for adoption right after the Civil War broke out, the view by the Department of War Ordnance Department was that soldiers would waste ammunition by firing too rapidly with repeating rifles, and thus denied a government contract for all such weapons. (They did, however, encourage the use of breech-loading carbine, which is also single- shot like most firearms of the day, but is shorter than standard rifles and thus more suited to mounted warfare)Philip Leigh \\"Lee's Lost Dispatch and Other Civil War Controversies\\" (Yardley, Penna.: Westholme Publishing, 2015), 25-36 More accurately, they feared that the Army's logistics train would be unable to provide enough ammunition for the soldiers in the field, as they already had grave difficulty bringing up enough ammunition to sustain armies of tens of thousands of men over distances of hundreds of miles. A weapon able to fire several times as fast would require a vastly expanded logistics train and place great strain on the already overburdened railroads and tens of thousands of more mules, wagons, and wagon train guard detachments. Its unit cost (several times that of a Springfield Model 1861 rifled musket) also stood in the way. However, shortly after the famous Battle of Gettysburg, Spencer was able to gain an audience with President Abraham Lincoln, who invited him to a shooting match and demonstration of the weapon on the lawn of the White House. Lincoln was deeply impressed with the weapon, and ordered Gen. James Wolfe Ripley to adopt it for production. Ripley disobeyed the order and continued to use the old single-shooters. The Spencer repeating rifle was first adopted by the United States Navy, and later by the United States Army, and it was used during the American Civil War, where it was a popular weapon. The Confederates occasionally captured some of these weapons and ammunition, but, as they were unable to manufacture the cartridges because of their dire copper shortage, their utilization of the weapons was limited. Gettysburg was the first major battle of the war where Spencer rifles were used, as they had recently been issued to the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves. They were used at the Battle of Chickamauga and had become fairly widespread in the Western armies by 1864. Repeater rifles for comparison were rare in the Army of the Potomac. Notable early instances of use included the Battle of Hoover's Gap (where Colonel John T. Wilder's \\"Lightning Brigade\\" of mounted infantry effectively demonstrated the firepower of repeaters), and the Gettysburg Campaign, where two regiments of the Michigan Brigade (under Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer) carried them at the Battle of Hanover and at East Cavalry Field.Rummel III, George, Cavalry of the Roads to Gettysburg: Kilpatrick at Hanover and Hunterstown, White Mane Publishing Company, 2000, . As the war progressed, Spencers were carried by a number of Union cavalry and mounted infantry regiments and provided the Union army with a firepower advantage over their Confederate opponents. At the Battle of Nashville, 9,000 mounted infantrymen armed with the Spencer, under the command of Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson, chief of cavalry for the Military Division of the Mississippi, rode around Gen. Hood's left flank and attacked from the rear. President Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth was armed with a Spencer carbine at the time he was captured and killed. Spencer 1865 Carbine .50 caliber The Spencer showed itself to be very reliable under combat conditions, with a sustainable rate- of-fire in excess of 20 rounds per minute. Compared to standard muzzle- loaders, with a rate of fire of 2–3 rounds per minute, this represented a significant tactical advantage. However, effective tactics had yet to be developed to take advantage of the higher rate of fire. Similarly, the supply chain was not well prepared enough to transport the extra ammunition. Detractors also complained that the amount of smoke produced was such that it was hard to see the enemy, which was not surprising since even the smoke produced by muzzleloaders would quickly blind whole regiments, and even divisions as if they were standing in thick fog, especially on still days. One of the advantages of the Spencer was that its ammunition was waterproof and hardy, and could stand the constant jostling of long storage on the march, such as Wilson's Raid. The story goes that every round of paper and linen Sharps ammunition carried in the supply wagons was found useless after long storage in supply wagons. Spencer ammunition had no such problem owing to the new technology of metallic cartridges. 1867 Brigadier General James F. Rusling of the Quartermaster's Dept. recommended exclusive use of the carbine on cavalry against mounted Indians raiders after completing a 1-year tour of the new western territories. In the late 1860s, the Spencer company was sold to the Fogerty Rifle Company and ultimately to Winchester. Many Spencer carbines were later sold as surplus to France where they were used during the Franco- Prussian War in 1870. Even though the Spencer company went out of business in 1869, ammunition was manufactured in the United States into the 1920s. Later, many rifles and carbines were converted to centerfire, which could fire cartridges made from the centerfire .50-70 brass. The original archetype of rimfire ammunition can still be obtained on the specialty market.

Retrieved from , 10 January 2009. was a Dutch-Canadian-American journalist, writer, and Unitarian minister. He was born in Gorinchem, Netherlands, then emigrated with his parents to Canada in 1914. After entering a seminary, he served as a missionary to Ruthenian immigrants in the Alberta hinterland, where he helped with medical work. In 1917 he left theological school to serve with the Canadian army in France in World War I as an infantryman and sapper. In 1921 he became a journalist with the Toronto Globe, and a year later moved to the U.S. and began writing a syndicated column for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. From 1924 to 1931, Van Paassen worked as a foreign correspondent and columnist for the New York Evening World, based in Paris. After the World folded, he became a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star. Van Paassen spoke Dutch, French, English, and some Ruthenian (a language similar enough to Ukrainian that it allowed him to converse passably with many Russians), and later learned Hebrew. He gained fame reporting on the conflicts among Arabs, British, Jews and French in the Middle East, as well as on the ongoing African slave trade and colonial problems in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. He reported on Benito Mussolini's Italo-Ethiopian War, the Spanish Civil War and other European and colonial conflicts.  Journalistic career  In addition to his popular storytelling in the frequently ephemeral human interest stories that the papers principally hired him to write, van Paassen's many other personal accounts from the field brought home to American readers the often harsh results of European internal turmoil and of the foreign adventures of the interwar European colonial powers. From his earliest travels to Palestine in 1925, he saw and developed a regard for the work of the early Jewish immigrants to improve the area's agriculture and industry. Later he became one of the first non-Jews in America to write favorably about the campaign to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine, and remained a Zionist supporter afterwards. But fundamentally, Van Paassen was a Christian Democratic Socialist concerned, as he put it in his autobiographical Days of Our Years, with the enduring struggle for justice for ordinary individuals. He was a staunch opponent of fascism in Italy, Germany and France from the 1920s, reinforced by the ten days he spent as a prisoner in the Dachau Concentration Camp in late March 1933. His activities as a correspondent brought \\"expulsion from France by Pierre Laval, from Germany by Joseph Goebbels and from Eritrea by Count Ciano.\\" In 1933 Van Paassen traveled incognito to the Dome of the Rock, a famous Islamic shrine in Jerusalem. He was accompanied by a British Intelligence officer, and both smeared their faces and hands with burnt cork to give them an Arab appearance. They also wore long white garments to give them a \\"Hadjihs\\" appearance. Their evasiveness was a necessity, for nonbelievers were (and still are) not allowed in areas that are considered to be the holiest places in the world of Islam. The purpose of their venture was to get an inside look at the radical movement by listening to what the Mullahs were preaching in regards to the political turmoil that was taking place in then British controlled Palestine.Syracuse Herald, April 6, 1933. Front page. Retrieved from www.NewspaperArchives.com, October 2, 2006. Three years later The Great Uprising took form. This redoubled political violence was in part planned by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, whom Van Paassen had interviewed in 1929 about his incitement of the bloody uprising that year against the Jews in Palestine. = Autobiographies = Van Paassen's autobiography, Days of Our Years, published in 1939, detailed many events that he could not mention in his earlier newspaper reports. It was the bestselling nonfiction book in the United States for almost two years. \\"Since I could not afford to be excluded from a single European country with so general an assignment, it was in my interest to remain on the good side of all the nascent censorships in Europe. Hence many things I investigated or saw remained unreported. For example, in 1928... [about] the methods of the reactionary governments of Rumania and Bulgaria in suppressing popular movements - twelve thousand peasants and workers had been slain in Bulgaria alone that year - I could not send out a word. The police dogged our every footstep.... The managing editor, Mr. John H. Tennant, warned me more than once that I had not been sent over on a crusading mission. He added, moreover, that there was no confirmation from any reliable source on that horrible business in Bulgaria. The local agency correspondents had not sent a word. So I, too, remained silent. It was the only policy. Correspondents like George Seldes, Samuel Spivak, David Darrah Gedye, and myself discovered only too soon that if we did speak out, we did not last very long, either in the countries in which we were stationed or in our jobs.\\" Van Paassen became a US citizen in 1947. In his 1964 book To Number Our Days, Van Paassen wrote more about many of the same subjects he covered in Days of Our Years, especially the maneuvers of pre-World War II Europe's empires. The book only slightly extends Van Paassen's account after the US entering the war, but includes much about his pre-war life as a roving correspondent. Van Paassen's views of the potential of the Soviet Union appear to have changed between 1939 and 1941, and he writes less about Russia and less optimistically about it than in his writings of the 1920s and 1930s. In his books, Van Paassen was not a rigorous historian but used vivid accounts often taken from first-hand encounters with participants in the conflicts about which he wrote. During the 1929 Palestine uprising, after his reporting on the massacres contradicted both the Mufti's statements and local British officials' news releases, he became the target of several assassination attempts, after the last of which a Captain Saunders pointedly asked, \\"Moreover, why do these things happen to you? I have received no complaints from your colleagues of the press in Jerusalem.\\" Subsequently, he became persona non grata at Government House, but insisted that \\"I believe my offense was that I took nothing for granted.... I questioned everybody...\\"  Quotations  In 1938, before the Munich Accord, Van Paassen wrote of the Western European powers' strategic assessments of Germany's likely drive for expansion in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the potential shock to the European economy if the West were to make war and destroy Germany. Earlier, Germany's January 1936 commercial contracts for the output of the Spanish and Spanish Moroccan mines had gone awry with the opposition of a newly-elected government in Madrid. \\"Even so, the need for raw materials was pressing. Germany's war stocks were of the scantiest. Rather than forgo the unlimited supply that the mines of Iberia and the Riff offered, Hitler summoned General Sanjurjo from Lisbon (where he was living in banishment) to Berlin in March 1936, and the plot for a military insurrection against the Republic with the aid of the Fuehrer and Signor Mussolini was hatched.\\" After Sanjurjo's death his lieutenant, General Franco, duly launched the planned war from Morocco. However, French Prime Minister Léon Blum said that \\"every time we make a move to help the Spanish Republic, we are warned by Downing Street that if we become involved in war with Italy and Germany over Spain, France cannot count on British support.\\" Van Paassen was convinced that the British Empire's farsighted military planners and political leaders were not entirely displeased to see France's position weakened by Germany at that time, as it improved Britain's relative dominance over its ancient rival, France, in Britain's drive for worldwide hegemony. In his 1939 book Days of Our Years Van Paassen wrote: > Germany is much farther on the road to dechristianization than the Soviet > Union, even if the churches in the Reich remain open and the incense still > rises from the altars. In the place of God has come the would be almighty > state which, insatiable as the Moloch of old, demands man’s entire devotion, > mentally and physically. In 1941, Van Paassen wrote: > To many observers, amongst them a number of statesmen, the civil war in > Spain at one time appeared to be nothing more significant than a bloody > dispute between adherents of two equally obnoxious ideologies, Fascism and > Communism. Whichever of the two contending parties came out victorious > seemed, therefore, a matter of supreme indifference. Only in 1941 did it > become clear that Franco's early victories in 1937 had laid the ground for > Hitler's final blow to Great Britain's Mediterranean position in 1941. At the same time, he wrote, \\"The assumption that the Battle of the Atlantic is the pivot upon which world history turns is false. Britain as an empire stands or falls with the control of the Near East.\\" In To Number Our Days. published in 1964, after viewing the plight of blacks in Atlanta and after discussing President Franklin Roosevelt sympathetically as introducing \\"creeping socialism\\" (in the context as that term was understood in 1964), he notes that he made a prediction sealed in a vault at Oglethorpe University in 1942: \\"My prediction ran this way:... In AD 2042 when Oglethorpe's vault is opened, there will be a socialist president in Washington. He will be a Negro!\\" (p. 248).

Heruka (Sanskrit; ), is the name of a category of wrathful deities, enlightened beings in Vajrayana Buddhism that adopt a fierce countenance to benefit sentient beings. In East Asia, these are called Wisdom Kings. Herukas represent the embodiment of indivisible bliss and emptiness. They appear as Iṣṭha-devatā () or meditational deities for tantric sādhanā, usually placed in a mandala and often appearing in Yab-Yum. Derivation and meaning of the term The name \\"Heruka\\" is made up of the prefix \\"he-\\" is a teaching of the emptiness of general phenomena, \\"ru\\" is the emptiness of persons in particular, and together it is linked with \\"Ka\\" which refers to the overal union of a mind of great bliss and the emptiness of all phenomena. The Sanskrit term Heruka was translated into both Chinese and Tibetan as \\"blood drinker,\\" which scholar Ronald Davidson calls \\"curious,\\" speculating that the nonliteral translation derived from an association the term has with cremation grounds and 'charnel grounds' (Sanskrit: śmāśāna) (which absorb the blood of the dead).Indian Esoteric Buddhism by Ronald Davidson. pg 213 Sanskrit terms for blood drinker include asrikpa, reflecting a Sanskrit word for blood (asrik),A Sanskrit-English dictionary By Monier Monier-Williams, Ernst Leumann, Carl Cappeller. pg 121 and raktapa, raktapayin, or rakshasa, derived from an alternate root term for blood (rakta).A Sanskrit-English dictionary By Monier Monier-Williams, Ernst Leumann, Carl Cappeller. pg 861 Unlike the Chinese and Tibetan (', wylie: ') terms used to translate it, the Sanskrit term heruka does not literally mean blood drinker, although the fact that it was rendered as such into two other languages strongly suggests an according Indian interpretive etymology.The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Śrī Heruka): A Study and Annotated Translation. by David B. Gray, Columbia University: 2007 pg 40 n. 124 Eight Herukas of the Nyingma Mahayoga Yamantaka Vajrabhairav, British Museum. The eight Herukas (Wylie: sgrub pa bka’ brgyad) of the Nyingma mahayoga tradition (and their corresponding sadhanas) are said to have been received by Padmakara from the Eight Vidyadharas (Tib. Rigdzin), or Eight Great Acharyas: Manjushrimitra, Nagarjuna, Vajrahumkara, Vimalamitra, Prabhahasti, Dhanasamskrita, Shintamgarbha and Guhyachandra. They were proficient in the practices of, respectively: 1) Yamantaka (Tib. ', ') the wrathful Manjushri, the deity of body; 2) Hayagriva (Tib. Pema Sung, ') the wrathful Avalokiteśvara, the deity of speech; 3) Vishuddha/Sri Samyak (Tib. Yangdak Thuk, Wylie: ') the wrathful Vajrapani deity of mind; 4) Mahottara (Tib. Chem Chok, Wylie: ') the wrathful Samantabhadra, the deity of enlightened qualities; 5) Vajrakilaya/Vajrakumara (Tib. ', '), the wrathful Vajrasattva, the deity of purification; 6) Matarah (Tib. Mamo Botong, ') the wrathful Akasagarbha, the deity of calling and dispatching; 7) Lokastotrapuja-natha (Tib.

Padmasambhava is quoted in the Bardo Thodol (Antarabhavatantra - \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\"): \\"The crucial point is indeed that those who have meditated on the formal description of these Herukakaya ('bodies of Heruka'), and also made offerings and praise to them, or, at the very least, have simply seen their painted and sculpted images, may recognise the forms that arise here and attain moksha (liberation).\\" See also *Wrathful deities NotesReferences *Khenchen Palden Rinpoche.

She ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, seeking to represent New Jersey's 7th District, in 2006 and 2008. She was narrowly defeated by incumbent Representative Mike Ferguson in 2006 but lost by a wider margin to Leonard Lance in the November 4, 2008 election. Stender served as the Assembly's Deputy Speaker from 2006–2009 and currently serves in the Assembly on the State Government Committee (as Chair), Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee (as Vice-Chair), and the Appropriations committee. She is a former Vice Chairwoman of the Tourism and Gaming Committee and a former Vice Chairwoman of the Environment and Solid Waste Committee.

Stender and Quigley issued a press release in response to Coulter's criticism of the Jersey Girls, four widows of the September 11, 2001 attacks from New Jersey who have criticized U.S. policies in the events leading up to September 11. They did not seek any legislative prohibition, but in the press release, they called on New Jersey retailers to \\"express their outrage by refusing to carry or sell copies of Coulter's book.\\" =Alleged abuse of the Habitat for Humanity program= In February 2015, an investigation by NJ Advance Media found that Richard Stender, the husband of the Assemblywoman, had applied for assistance from Coastal Habitat for Humanity to demolish and then rebuild his house. The home, which was located in Manasquan, was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The home was deemed beyond repair and demolished with funds from the organization. In August 2014, plans were filled with the Manasquan Zoning Office to replace the original with a much larger home. The home that was requested was about three times larger than the original and much larger than the ones that the organization usually builds for low-income residents. When the organization received the plans, Maureen Mulligan, executive director of Coastal Habitat for Humanity immediately said \\"...no. This was not the type of house that Habitat builds, which is a three-bedroom one-and-a-half bath, 1,200 square foot house.\\" Habitat for Humanity helps homeowners who make up to 80 percent of Monmouth County's median household income, which is $84,526. However, Linda Stender's legislative financial disclosure records shows her combined income with her husband was at least $99,000 a year in 2012 and 2013. The financial disclosures also list the Manasquan property as the only one owned by either Stender or her husband. Stender registered to run for reelection in 2013 from a Scotch Plains address, and told her district-mate, Assemblyman Jerry Green, that she lives with her mother and that her husband lives in Manasquan. The controversy has led Stender to retire from the Assembly choosing not to run for re-election in 2015.

Lewin earned his doctorate in nuclear physics in 1965 at the Delft University of Technology and was a member of MIT's physics faculty for 43 years beginning in 1966 until his retirement in 2009. Lewin's contributions in astrophysics include the first discovery of a rotating neutron star through all-sky balloon surveys and research in X-ray detection in investigations through satellites and observatories. Lewin has received awards for teaching and is known for his lectures on physics and their publication online via YouTube, edX and MIT OpenCourseWare. In December 2014, MIT revoked Lewin's Professor Emeritus title after an MIT investigation determined that Lewin had violated university policy by sexually harassing an online student in an online MITx course he taught in fall 2013. Early life and education Lewin was born to Walter Simon Lewin and Pieternella Johanna van der Tang in 1936 in The Hague, Netherlands. He was a child when Nazi Germany occupied The Netherlands during World War II. It is unclear if his paternal grandparents Gustav and Emma Lewin, who were Jewish, were killed in Auschwitz in 1942, or died of typhus or starvation. To protect the family, Lewin's father simply left one day without telling anyone, leaving his mother to raise the children. Academic career Walter Lewin taught physics in high school while studying for his PhD, then he went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 1966 as a post- doctoral associate, and was appointed an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor of physics in 1968 and to full professor in 1974.Instructor Profile: Walter Lewin at MIT OpenCourseWare (archived 2009) At MIT, Lewin joined the X-ray astronomy group and conducted all-sky balloon surveys with George W. Clark. Through the late seventies, there were about twenty successful balloon flights. These balloon surveys led to the discovery of five new X-ray sources, whose spectra were very different from the X-ray sources discovered during rocket observations. The X-ray flux of these sources was variable. Among them was GX 1+4 whose X-ray flux appeared to be periodic with a period of about 2.4 minutes. This was the first discovery of a slowly rotating neutron star. In October 1967 when Scorpius X-1 was observed, an X-ray flare was detected. The flux went up by a factor of about 4 in ten minutes after which it declined again. This was the first detection of X-ray variability observed during the observations. The rockets used by other researchers could not have discovered that the X-ray sources varied on such short time scales because they were only up for several minutes, whereas the balloons could be in the air for many hours. Lewin was co-investigator on the Small Astronomy Satellite 3 (SAS-3) project. He directed the burst observations and discovered several X-ray bursters, among them was the rapid bursterhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/binaries/rapid_burster_lc.html which can produce thousands of X-ray bursts in one day. His group also discovered that the rapid burster produces two types of bursts and established a classification of bursts as type I (thermonuclear flashes) and type II (accretion flow instabilities). Lewin was co-principal investigator on High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1 HEAO-1 (A4), which has yielded the first all sky catalog at high-energy X rays. With H. Pedersen and J. van Paradijs, Lewin made extensive studies of optical bursts which are associated with X-ray bursts; for X-ray detections they used SAS-3 and the Japanese observatory \\"Hakucho\\". Their combined burst observations demonstrated that the optical bursts are a few seconds delayed relative to the X-ray bursts. This established the size of the accretion disc surrounding the accreting neutron stars. In his search for millisecond X-ray pulsations from low-mass X-ray binaries, in 1984–85 Lewin made guest observations with the European observatory EXOSAT in collaboration with colleagues from Amsterdam and Garching, Germany. This led to the unexpected discovery of intensity-dependent quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the X-ray flux of GX 5-1. During 1989 to 1992, using the Japanese observatory \\"Ginga\\", Lewin and his co-workers studied the relation between the X-ray spectral state and the radio brightness of several bright low-mass X-ray binaries. Lewin was closely involved in ROSAT observations of the nearby galaxies M31 and Messier 81. Lewin and his graduate student Eugene Magnier have made deep optical charge-coupled device observations of M31 in four colors; they have published a catalogue of 500,000 objects. Lewin and his graduate student David Pooley initiated the successful X-ray observations within six days of the appearance of supernova SN 1993J in M81. Lewin collaborated with his close friend Jan van Paradijs of the University of Amsterdam from 1978 until van Paradijs' death. They co-authored 150 papers. He became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993 and a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1993. Lewin and graduate student Jeffrey Kommers have worked on data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO). This was a collaboration with the BATSE Grouphttps://web.archive.org/web/20130215053749/http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/batse/instrument/ in Huntsville, AL. In early December 1995, with co-workers Chryssa Kouveliotou and Van Paradijs, they discovered a new type of X-ray burst source: (GRO J1744-28) the Bursting Pulsar, and received a NASA Achievement Award for this discovery. In 1996–1998, Lewin's collaboration with Michiel van der Klis in Amsterdam led to the discovery of kHz oscillations in many X-ray binaries. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Lewin and his graduate student David Pooley made extensive studies of supernovae and faint X-ray sources in globular clusters. This research was done in collaboration with scientists from the University of Washington, IAS in Princeton, UC Berkeley, the University of Amsterdam and Utrecht in The Netherlands, and the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. The research on supernovae produced the first X-ray spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution of SN 1989S. The research on globular clusters demonstrated that X-ray binary stars are cooked in the cores of the clusters where the stellar density is very high. With graduate student Jon Miller, Lewin made extensive studies of black-hole X-ray binaries in our galaxy. Evidence was found for spectral distortions of the iron line (in X-rays) indicative of the influence of general relativity on the iron-line emission in the vicinity of the \\"event horizon\\" of the black holes. This research on black-hole binaries is continuing using all available observatories in orbit – among them: Chandra, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), and the European observatories XMM-Newton, Integral and NuSTAR. Lewin has published about 450 scientific articles as of 2014. =Awards= * 1978 – NASA Award for Exceptional Scientific Achievement * 1984 – Alexander von Humboldt Award * 1984 – Guggenheim Fellowship * 1984 – MIT Science Council Prize for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching * 1988 – MIT Department of Physics W.

He was the only MIT faculty member (albeit, retired) to make it to that list. =Lectures= For about 15 years (starting in 1982) Lewin was on MIT Cable TV, with every week a different 1-hour program. They were aired 24 hours per day helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments (they were called help sessions). Walter Lewin's 1992 lectures on Newtonian mechanics (co-lectured with Bob Ledoux) and Lewin's help sessions have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, WA, reaching an audience of about four million people. Years later, Bill Gates wrote Lewin that he watched him very frequently on UWTV. Lewin personally responded to thousands of e-mail requests that he received per year from UWTV viewers. Videos of Lewin's 94 lectures on Newtonian mechanics (1999), electricity and magnetism (2002) and the physics of vibrations and waves (2004), among others, could be viewed on the MIT OpenCourseWare web site until MIT removed them after finding that Lewin had sexually harassed a student in the online course. The videos can also be viewed on YouTube, iTunes and Earth Academic. Since February 2015, Lewin has been running and managing his own YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEHVhv0SBMpP75JbzJShqw/ called \\"Lectures by Walter Lewin. They will make you ♥ Physics\\". All of his lectures can be viewed online on this channel, where Lewin also hosts quizzes on physics and art, and also vlogs about his everyday life. As of July 2020, his channel has over 700,000 subscribers and has over 10 million views per year. Several of Lewin's lectures have been viewed more than a million times. His 2011 farewell lecture \\"For the Love of Physics\\" is one of his most popular lectures. As of July 2020, this lecture has been viewed 12 million times - 1 million times on MIT's OCW, 6.5 million times on the channel \\"For the Allure of Physics\\" and 4.5 million times on his personal channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJG- rXBbmCc. In 2007, The New York Times featured Lewin on the front page, talking about his massive influence on online education. Two of Lewin's courses were converted into edX courses, 8.01x (classical mechanics) and 8.02x (electricity and magnetism). People who pass \\"x\\" courses receive a certificate from MIT. Lewin's course on electricity and magnetism went online in February 2013, Newtonian mechanics is online as of September 2013. As of May 2014, there were yet no plans to convert 8.03 \\"vibrations and waves\\" into an edX course. Videos of Lewin's lectures on Videos on Teaching Excellence at MIT, YouTube and iTunes U have been viewed more than 12 million times by people all over the world – including Bill Gates, who has confessed to repeated viewings. In the summer of 2012, Lewin returned from his retirement to deliver a lecture series initiated and funded by the Japanese Broadcasting Corporation (NHK). Each lecture features a selection of physics demonstrations that Lewin has used in his more than 43 years of teaching physics at MIT. The lectures consist of 8 TV programs that were broadcast in Japanese on NHK in Japan in 2013. As of 2015, a region 2 DVD box set of this series is available in Japanese, with an optional partial English audio track and English subtitles. = Sexual harassment = In early December, 2014, MIT announced that it had determined that Lewin engaged in online sexual harassment of an online MITx learner in violation of MIT's policies. Inside Higher Ed reported that this learner was one of many (at least 10) female students to whom Lewin had sent inappropriate messages. The alleged victim, who said that she was a 32-year-old woman living in France and that she came forward to ensure the case is not forgotten, asserted that Lewin pushed her to participate in sexual role-playing. As a consequence of its internal investigation, MIT revoked Lewin's professor emeritus title and indefinitely removed his lectures from the institute's online learning platforms. However, Lewin's lectures are readily available on several websites. Personal life Lewin is an art enthusiast and collector. He has lectured on the subject at MIT.Lewin, Walter (date unknown). \\"Walter Lewin: Looking at 20th Century Art through the Eyes of a Physicist\\".

It gives its name to the surrounding area, roughly bounded by Ball's Pond Road to the south, Petherton Road to the west, Green Lanes and Matthias Road to the north, and Boleyn Road to the east. The Green is in N16 and the area is covered by the N16, N1 and N5 postcodes.  Origins  The first record of the area is as 'Neutone' in the Domesday Survey of 1086, when it still formed part of the demesne of St Paul’s Cathedral. In the 13th century, Newton became Newington, whilst the prefix 'Stoke' was added in the area to the north, distinguishing it from Newington Barrow or Newington Berners in Islington. Newington Barrow later became known as Highbury, after the manor house built on a hill. There was probably a medieval settlement, and the prevailing activity was agriculture, growing hay and food for the inhabitants of nearby London. By the 15th century, the area had become more prosperous and in 1445 there were a good number of Londoners living in the hamlet. The name Newington Green was first mentioned in 1480. By the 1490s it was fringed by cottages, homesteads and crofts on the three sides in Newington Barrow manor in Islington. The north side was divided between the manors of Stoke Newington and Brownswood in South Hornsey.  Royal visitors and ministers  Henry VIII. Hunted in the area. In the 16th century the area was connected to the court of Henry VIII. The king used a house on the south side of the Green as a base for hunting the wild bulls, stags and wild boars that roamed the surrounding forest. In 1523 a resident of the north side of the Green, the future 6th Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy became engaged to Anne Boleyn. At the time he was page to Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Percy had not sought permission from either his father or the king, causing Wolsey to scold him and his father to refuse the marriage. He later found himself a member of the jury that convicted Anne of adultery. His home, Brook House, stood at the northeast corner of the square. It contained a central courtyard and was decorated with gilded and painted wainscotting. It was later demolished, renamed Bishop's Place, and divided into tenements for the poor. In 1535 Henry VIII's chief minister (equivalent of today's prime minister), Thomas Cromwell, took up residence at Canonbury Tower to the south of the area, from where he organised the Dissolution of the Monasteries and their transfer into royal ownership. Other Tower residents included, in the 16th century, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and afterwards Duke of Northumberland, general, admiral, and politician; in the 17th century, Francis Bacon, one of the fathers of the scientific method, at that time the Attorney General, and Sir Thomas Coventry, afterwards Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith, the writer.History of Canonbury Tower , hosted by Canonbury Masonic Research Centre  Samuel Pepys  The famous 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys was sent to the Newington Green and Kingsland area by his mother in order to benefit from the fresh air and open spaces of what was a rural area at that time.Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self by Claire Tomalin  Mildmay  A map showing the Mildmay ward of Islington Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. Newington Green's history is marked by several streets in the area taking their name from this period, such as King Henry’s Walk, Boleyn Road (formerly Ann Boleyn’s Walk), Wolsey Road and Queen Elizabeth’s Walk. Many other thoroughfares are named after the Mildmay estate, including Mildmay Park, Mildmay Grove North and Mildmay Grove South. Sir Walter Mildmay was the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Elizabeth I. He was one of the special commissioners in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, and founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584. His grandson Sir Henry Mildmay served as MP and was Master of the Jewel House for Charles I. Henry was critical of the king's religious policies, supported Parliament during the civil wars and attended the king's trial. After the Restoration Henry was arrested for his part in the regicide, but granted leniency because he had refused to sign the king's death warrant. Instead of the death penalty he was sent to the Tower of London, stripped of his knighthood and his estates and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mildmay Mission Hospital was founded in the 1890s, inspired by the work of the Reverend William Pennefather during the cholera epidemic of 1866. It was absorbed into the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and in the 1980s began pioneering work into the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS, which it continues. Mildmay Park, located on the street of the same name, was a station on the North London Railway. Opened in 1880, it closed in 1934. The station building was demolished in 1987, but remnants of the platforms can still be seen at track level. Nonconformists and the Dissenting Academies The area became the home of English Dissenters during the 17th century. Following the religious upheavals after the Restoration, some Protestants chose to remain in England and maintain their faith openly, but they had to live with the restrictions the state placed upon them. They moved to places tolerant of them; often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities.Thorncroft p5 One such place was Newington Green, then still an agricultural village, but conveniently near London.Allardyce, p22-23) Oliver Cromwell's family had links there: his great-granddaughter Mary was born at the Green on 11 April 1691. A critical mass of \\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\" and \\"the well- to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\" clustered around Newington Green, and other villages nearby such as Stoke Newington and Hackney.\\"Spaces of Dissent and the Public Sphere\\" by Ana M. Acosta inEighteenth-Century Life 2003 27(1):1-27; Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians: other notables include the Quaker physician John Coakley Lettsome and the Anglican pacifist Vicesimus Knox. One such academy was set up on north of the Green, run by Charles Morton. One of the academy's students was Daniel Defoe, the writer, journalist and spy famous for his novel Robinson Crusoe. Another pupil was the controversial poet Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, the great religious leader. A later schoolmaster was the Rev. James Burgh, author of The Dignity of Human Nature and Thoughts on Education, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to the church there. Unitarian Church, Price and Wollstonecraft The Unitarian church was built in 1708. In 1708 the Newington Green Unitarian Church was built on the north, Hackney side of the Green. That congregation continues today as New Unity. The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's \\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\".Allardyce, p18. He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658). Many important politicians, thinkers, reformers, and writers visited him at Newington Green, including Founding Fathers of the United States, British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as \\"Citizen Stanhope\\"), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt ; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb. Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of poet and banker Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. p15. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of The Dignity of Human Nature and Thoughts on Education, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons.Gordon, p42. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation.Allardyce, p23. When Joseph Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in. One of the most important residents of the Green was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784.Gordon, p40. This was Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who used her influence to find the young schoolmistress a house to rent and 20 students to fill it. The flavour of the village and the approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women. p51. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening.Gordon, p51 passim. A couple of years after she left Newington Green, these seeds germinated into A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women.Tomalin, p61. Newington Green had made its mark on Mary, and through this founding work of feminist philosophy, on the world.  The New River  New River in Clissold Park. In 1602 it was proposed that a new river should be constructed to provide London with its first clean, fresh water. Sir Hugh Myddleton, a Welsh goldsmith and philanthropist, was given the responsibility, and in 1609 he built a canal from the Hertfordshire rivers of Chadwell and Amwell, 38 miles to the New River Head in Clerkenwell. Originally open to the air, the aqueduct flowed down the centre of the present day Petherton Road. It was later covered for sanitary reasons.The Story of the New River (Thames Water) accessed 12 Dec 2007 In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister to Newington Green Unitarian Church. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743–1825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth.Thorncroft, p19 She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, \\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\". Two years later she wrote The Rights of Women, but this was not published until her death thirty years later. Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife and committed suicide by drowning himself in the river. In 1946 the supply was redirected at Stoke Newington and in 1990 the New River was replaced by deep mains. Part of the New River’s original course through Canonbury has now been turned into an ornamental walk.  Synagogues and Jewish life  Other religious institutions existed nearby. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936.Allardyce, p39. For a period from the end of the nineteenth century, the Newington Green Area was host to a large Jewish population, which was beginning to leave the East End and move northwards towards Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill. The original Adath Israel orthodox congregation was founded in 1911 and its first permanent building was in Alma Road, off Green Lanes, before moving on towards Stoke Newington and the other side of Clissold Park in the 1950s. A large United Synagogue was built in Poets Road in the 1870s and remained active until it closed down in the late 1960s, as the remaining Jewish population moved on further afield. At its height, the Poets Road Synagogue (or as it was known the Dalston Synagogue despite the fact that it was not in Dalston - well, in fact, it was originally very close to Dalson Junction Station) had hundreds of worshippers (unlikely as it had only 400 male members at that time http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr- uk/London/dalston/index.htm and, for a short while in the 1930s, was the home of one of the world's leading cantors, a member of the Kusevitsky family.Jacob Koussevitzky 1903 - 1959 By Rabbi Geoffrey Shisler http://www.chazzanut.com/articles/j_kussevitsky.html The synagogue site was eventually sold and the beautiful building, along with its stained glass windows, was demolished in 1970 and replaced by a block of council flats, leaving no trace of the Jewish life which existed in this area. 19th century In the early part of the 19th century, there was a change in the character of Newington Green. After a patient struggle of 150 years, the English Dissenters were finally freed from their civil disabilities with the passage of the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. With, it seemed, nothing left to fight for on that front, Nonconformists no longer needed the security of the Newington Green, and the area lost some of its intellectual cohesiveness. The church touched a low point. The nature of Newington Green had changed—the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a \\"thriving and expanding suburb\\".Thorncroft, p20. With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty,Allardyce, p33. and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity.Thorncroft, p2-23. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839–64) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792–1870). (Like many Anglican vicars,cf William Bedwell (1561-1632), Vicar of Tottenham nearby, and W.A. Diggens, Vicar of St Keverne, Cornwall 1896-1913 Index one of his hobbies was local history.) In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870. The \\"small but energetic community\\" continued to campaign on the larger political stage.Thorncroft, p25. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords. In the last decades of the 19th century, the church thrived and its congregation grew to 80 subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at Newington Green as the best in its class, educating up to 200 children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprang up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young men's and young women's groups met, as did the mothers' meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform and women's suffrage. Some individuals who lived at the Green during this period included Thomas Rees, the minister after Barbauld, who was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. Alexander Gilchrist, son of another minister, was the biographer of William Blake. Andrew Pritchard improved the microscope and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society.Thorncroft, p23-24. Marian Pritchard is described as an unsung heroine, and \\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.Thorncroft, p28, and throughout ch7 The Lights Go Out. John Stuart Mill recalls his family living in Newington Green \\"from 1810 to the end of 1813\\"; it was at the time \\"an almost rustic neighbourhood\\", and it was during walks with his father before breakfast \\"generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey\\" (\\"my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers\\") that John Stuart would recount to James Mill what he had learnt reading the previous day. pp. 5 & 6. 20th century Then came 1914, and the horrors of World War I. Men from Newington Green fell in battle. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. By 1930 \\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\",Thorncroft, p31. but it did, with an influential supporter, an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington. Although attendance at services was small, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.Thorncroft, p32-33.  Newington Green today  52-55 Newington Green - London's oldest surviving brick terrace, dated 1658. (November 2005) The Green, far from being a pleasant and well-manicured garden square, was for many years just a run-down green space that straddled the border between Islington N1 and Hackney N16. However, in 1979 the Newington Green Action Group (NGAG) was formed with the aim of regenerating the area. NGAG worked with Islington Council on this project and traffic calming measures were installed to ease the notorious local congestion, with additional pedestrian crossings providing easier and safer access to the Green on foot. The Green was regenerated to include more lawn space, a play area and a café. New planting has enhanced the Green and was chosen to encourage biodiversity. Newington Green has grown in popularity with the local community, evinced by the children that now play in the formerly deserted park, which is once more being used like a village green. Community groups hold fairs on the Green and NGAG has organised many events including the annual Jazz on the Green and Open Garden Squares day. These improvements are such that, in 2006, Newington Green won the first of many Green Flag Awards (the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, sponsored by Keep Britain Tidy). It has also won the Green Heritage Site Award for several years running, which is sponsored by English Heritage.English Heritage page explaining awards In 2010 NGAG teamed up with the Mayville Gardening Club and the King Henry's Walk Community Garden; the Newington Green area was awarded a High Silver Gilt Royal Horticultural Society Urban Communities Award, as part of the London in Bloom Scheme. The Newington Green Action Group also published a local history book The Village That Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16 by Alex Allardyce in 2008, which won the Walter Bor Award the following year. Newington Green and Newington Green Road to the south constitute the commercial and cultural centre of the district. This area shares in the gentrification of Islington and Stoke Newington, so the old shopping area has now been supplemented by a number of new and trendy shops, bars and restaurants. However, there is a substantial Turkish Cypriot community in the area, members of whom run many of the local grocery stores. Since the millennium, two new ministers at the Unitarian Church have injected energy into the Green and added to its events and publicity.

(October 2005) This outlying area of Islington carries a surprising wealth of historic architecture and Newington Green has become a conservation area. On the west side of the Green (numbers 52-55) is London's oldest surviving brick terrace, which is Grade I listed (see photo in section above). These were built in 1658, and 100 years later were home to Price and Rogers. Over the subsequent centuries many changes were made, internally and externally, in particular adding an extra storey to one of the middle houses and replacing its narrow staircase with a wider one with mid- Georgian detailing. At an unknown date the windows were enlarged and changed from mediaeval oak and leaded light mullion and transom pattern to Georgian vertically sliding sash windows. In the 1880s the floor levels of the front rooms were lowered to street level and shop fronts were added to all of them. In the 1980s the houses were in such poor condition that there was a serious danger of them collapsing. The Greater London Council bought three of them, carried out major structural repairs and sold them on to private clients. In 1994 conservation architects Roger Mears Architects were appointed to repair and/or reinstate the hugely significant plasterwork, panelling, doors, windows and other joinery and to return the houses to use as single family dwellings. New brick ground floor frontages replaced the shopfronts, to a design appropriate to the elevations above, and the first floor brick cornice was reinstated. Residential London, particularly outside Westminster and the City, is essentially an 18th or 19th-century city. Even in the centre, there are few brick houses this old, pre-dating the Great Fire of 1666. One of the properties has been extensively renovated under the guidance of Bere Architects (Islington). The Green also has two Grade II listed buildings. To the north is the Unitarian Church, which celebrated its tercentenary in 2008. The original 1708 building was financed with £300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison.Thorncroft, p8 It was a \\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\".History and Topography of the Parish of St Mary, Islington by Samuel Lewis, 1842, cited in Allardyce, p9. \\"Historic views show that the original façade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\"Hackney Council page on the church. This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-19th century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a \\"stuccoed frontage\\" was built, \\"mirroring the original façade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\".Allardyce, p35. In the mid-20th century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.Images of England photo and description To the west is its neighbour, the former headquarters of the China Inland Mission, an organisation founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865 and responsible for 18,000 converts to Christianity.Allardyce, p36.

John Hicks (1939) is attributed with introducing the concept of compensating and equivalent variation. The equivalent variation is the change in wealth, at current prices, that would have the same effect on consumer welfare as would the change in prices, with income unchanged. It is a useful tool when the present prices are the best place to make a comparison. The value of the equivalent variation is given in terms of the expenditure function (e(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot)) as EV = e(p_0, u_1) - e(p_0, u_0) = e(p_0, u_1) - w = e(p_0, u_1) - e(p_1, u_1) where w is the wealth level, p_0 and p_1 are the old and new prices respectively, and u_0 and u_1 are the old and new utility levels respectively.

Woolf, Enterprise Integration Patterns, Addison Wesley, 2004. is a set of published enterprise-wide standards that allows organizations to send semantically precise messages between computer systems. EMS systems promote loosely coupled architectures that allow changes in the formats of messages to have minimum impact on message subscribers. EMS systems are facilitated by the use of structured messages (such as using XML or JSON), and appropriate protocols, such as DDS, MSMQ, AMQP or SOAP with web services. EMS usually takes into account the following considerations: # Security: Messages must be encrypted if they travel over public interfaces. Messages must be authenticated or digitally signed if the receiver is to have confidence that the messages have not been tampered with in transit. # Routing: Messages need to be routed efficiently from the sender to the receiver. Intermediate nodes may need to route the messages if the body of the message is encrypted. # Metadata: The body of the document contains information that must be unambiguously interpreted. Metadata registries should be used to create precise definitions for each data element. # Subscription: Systems should be able to subscribe to all messages that match a specific pattern. Messages with a specific content may be routed differently. For example, some messages may have different priority or security policies. # Policy: Enterprise messaging systems should provide some consideration for a centralized policy of messages such as what classes or roles of users can access different fields of any message. EMS are also known as Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)Curry, Edward. 2004. \\"Message-Oriented Middleware\\". In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. . ] Separation of message header and message body The design of an EMS is usually broken down into two sections: # Message header design - Message headers contain the information necessary to route messages. Message headers are usually coded in clear text so that intermediate nodes receive all the necessary information they need to route and prioritize the message. Message headers are analogous to the information printed on the outside of a letter (to, from, priority of message etc.) # Message body semantics - Message body semantics include the precise definition of all of the data elements in the body of the message. Message semantics can be aided by the use of a precise data dictionary that documents metadata. Comparisons The commonalities between messaging systems (in terms of capabilities and architecture) have been captured in a platform-independent fashion as enterprise integration patterns (a.k.a. messaging patterns). Although similar in concept to an enterprise service bus (ESB), an EMS places emphasis on design of messaging protocols (for instance, using DDS, MSMQ or AMQP), not the implementation of the services using a specific technology such as web services, DDS APIs for C/C++ and Java, .NET or Java Message Service (JMS). Note that an Enterprise Messaging System should not be confused with an electronic mail system used for delivering human readable text messages to individual people. An example of a specific application programming interface (API) that implements an enterprise messaging system is the Java Message Service.

It is a nine- digit number beginning with the number “9”, has a range of numbers from \\"50\\" to \\"65\\", \\"70\\" to \\"88\\", “90” to “92” and “94” to “99” for the fourth and fifth digits and is formatted like a SSN (i.e. 9XX-7X-XXXX). Temporary identification numbers are issued to the main taxpayer only and these numbers are usually triggered after a 45-day suspension period. Filing the W-7 application incorrectly, checking the wrong box for the reason the individual is submitting a W-7 form or if the taxpayer's identifying documents are not accepted by the IRS, can be a reason for which the taxpayer may receive a temporary taxpayer identification number. ITIN numbers are issued by the IRS to individuals who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain, a valid U.S. Social Security Number, but who are required by law to file a U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. An individual required to file a tax return must check boxes b, c, d, e, f, or g on the W-7 application. Individuals who check boxes a, f or h meet certain conditions for not filing a U.S. tax return, and for obtaining an ITIN number from the IRS. Regardless of immigration status, both resident and nonresident immigrants may have Federal tax return and payment responsibilities under the Internal Revenue Code.NY Times, April 16, 2007 Individuals must have a filing requirement and file a valid federal income tax return to receive an ITIN, unless they meet an exception. An ITIN application cannot be filed electronically (efile). The application must be attached to a valid federal income tax return. The ITIN program was created in 1996 for the purpose of allowing tax return filing by individuals without a Social Security account number. Receiving an ITIN number does not in itself confer the right to work and receive income in the United States.NY Times,April 15, 2003 In 2006, 1.4 million people used ITINs when filing tax returns. Federal tax law generally prohibits the IRS from sharing data with other government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, assuring unauthorized aliensAlien vs Immigrant Comparison Chart that the tax information will be confidential and generally will not be used to initiate removal procedures.U.S. Tax Program for Illegal Immigrants Under Fire NPR, March 5, 2007.Boston Globe, February 17, 2008 ITINs are also used by real estate brokers to facilitate mortgages for unauthorized aliens.Politics Undercut Mortgages For Illegal Workers by Nancy Mullane; Morning Edition, National Public Radio, November 4, 2008. In addition to use by unauthorized aliens, ITINs are used by foreign investors in United States real estate. Such investors need ITINs to file federal and state tax returns to report rental income. An individual who meets eligibility requirements can file an ITIN application himself or herself. This involves submitting IRS form W-7, which records biographical information, along with specified types of valid supporting ID and a tax return. The applicant can apply directly or file with a certifying acceptance agent, who can assist with the application process for a fee. ITINs can also be issued for a spouse or dependents, if documentation and signature requirements are met and they are claimed on a valid tax return. Effective June 22, 2012 the IRS began requiring most applicants, even those using acceptance agents, to submit original supporting documents or copies certified by their issuing agency. The IRS will not accept notarized copies of the passport for ITIN application. In 2012, the IRS indicated that ITINs would expire after 5 years. In 2014, the IRS amended that policy to expire ITINs only if the numbers had not been used in the last 5 years. Under this revised policy, all ITIN's must be used to file a return or they will expire and be reassigned. This now includes those issued before 2013. These changes go into effect in 2016.Unused ITINS to Expire After Five Years; New Uniform Policy Eases Burden on Taxpayers, Protects ITIN Integrity IRS, June 30, 2014. The policy has since been revised again so that ITINs expire after three years of non-use. In addition, ITINs issued prior to 2013 will begin expiring in 2016, starting with those with middle digits of 78 and 79 (Example: (9XX-78-XXXX).

He was the most senior member of the crew to survive the Titanic disaster. As the officer in charge of loading passengers into lifeboats on the port side, Lightoller strictly enforced the women and children only protocol, not allowing any male passengers to board the lifeboats unless they were needed as auxiliary seamen. Lightoller served as a commanding officer of the Royal Navy during World War I and was twice decorated for gallantry. During World War II, in retirement, he provided and sailed as a volunteer on one of the \\"little ships\\" that played a part in the Dunkirk evacuation. Rather than allow his motoryacht to be requisitioned by the Admiralty, he sailed the vessel to Dunkirk personally and repatriated 127 British servicemen. Early life Charles Herbert Lightoller was born in Chorley, Lancashire, on 30 March 1874, into a family that had operated cotton-spinning mills in Lancashire since the late 18th century. His mother, Sarah Jane Lightoller (née Widdows), died of scarlet fever shortly after giving birth to him. His father, Frederick James Lightoller, emigrated to New Zealand when Charles was 10, leaving him in the care of extended family. Early maritime career At age 13, not wanting to end up with a factory job like most of Britain's youth at the time, young Charles began a four-year seafaring apprenticeship on board the barque Primrose Hill.Lightoller, Charles H. Titanic and Other Ships Chapter 32: eBook at Gutenberg of Australia On his second voyage, he set sail with the crew of the Holt Hill, and during a storm in the South Atlantic, the ship was forced to put in at Rio de Janeiro. Repairs were made in the midst of a smallpox epidemic and a revolution. Another storm, on 13 November 1889 in the Indian Ocean, caused the ship to run aground on an uninhabited four-and-a-half- square-mile island now called Île Saint-Paul. They were rescued by the Coorong and taken to Adelaide, Australia. Lightoller joined the crew of the clipper ship Duke of Abercorn for his return to England. Lightoller returned to the Primrose Hill for his third voyage. They arrived in Calcutta, India, where he passed his second mate's certificate. The cargo of coal caught fire while he was serving as third mate on board the windjammer Knight of St. Michael, and for his successful efforts in fighting the fire and saving the ship, Lightoller was promoted to second mate. In 1895, at age 21 and a veteran of the dangers at sea, he obtained his mate's ticket and left sailing ships for steamships. After three years of service in Elder Dempster's African Royal Mail Service on the West African coast, he nearly died from a heavy bout of malaria. Abandoning the sea, Lightoller went to the Yukon in 1898 to prospect for gold in the Klondike Gold Rush. Failing at this endeavour, he then became a cowboy in Alberta, Canada. In order to return home, he became a hobo, riding the rails back across Canada. He earned his passage back to England by working as a cattle wrangler on a cattle boat and arrived home penniless in 1899. He obtained his master's certificate and joined Greenshields, Cowie & Co, for whom he made another trip on a cattle boat, this time as third mate of the Knight Companion. In January 1900, he began his career with the White Star Line as fourth officer of the . While on the Medic, on a voyage from Britain to South Africa and Australia, Lightoller was reprimanded for a prank he and some shipmates played on the citizens of Sydney at Fort Denison in Sydney Harbour. In 1903 he found himself in Sydney again, having been transferred to the SS Suevic — possibly as punishment for another indiscretion. During the voyage, he met Sylvia Hawley Wilson, a returning Australian whom he married in St James' Church, Sydney and took back to England on the return passage.Winship, Patricia Charles Herbert Lightoller profile, encyclopedia- titanica.org; accessed 11 August 2017. He later joined the under the command of Captain Edward J. Smith in the Atlantic. From there, he was promoted to third officer on the , the flagship of the White Star Line. He returned to the Majestic as first mate and then back to the Oceanic as its first mate. Titanic Two weeks before the sinking, Lightoller boarded the in Belfast, acting as first officer for the sea trials. Captain Smith gave the post of chief officer to Henry Wilde of the Olympic, demoting the original appointee William McMaster Murdoch to first officer and Lightoller to second officer. The original second officer, David Blair, was excluded from the voyage altogether, while the ship's roster of junior officers remained unchanged. Blair's departure from the crew caused a problem, as he had the key to the ship's binocular case. Because the crew lacked access to binoculars, Lightoller promised to purchase them when the Titanic got to New York City. Later, the missing key and resultant lack of binoculars for the lookouts in the crow's nest became a point of contention at the U.S. inquiry into the Titanic disaster. On the night of 14 April 1912, Lightoller commanded the last bridge watch prior to the ship's collision with the iceberg, after which Murdoch relieved him. An hour before the collision, Lightoller ordered the ship's lookouts to continually watch for 'small ice' and 'particularly growlers' until daylight. He then ordered the Quartermaster, Robert Hichens, to check ship's fresh water supply for freezing below the waterline. Lightoller had retired to his cabin and was preparing for bed when he felt the collision. Wearing only his pyjamas, Lightoller hurried out on deck to investigate, but seeing nothing, retired back to his cabin. Deciding it would be better to remain where other officers knew where to find him if needed, he lay awake in his bunk until fourth officer Joseph Boxhall summoned him to the bridge. He pulled on trousers, and a navy-blue sweater over his pyjamas, and donned (along with socks and shoes) his officer's overcoat and cap. During the evacuation, Lightoller took charge of lowering the lifeboats on the port side of the boat deck. He helped to fill several lifeboats with passengers and launched them. Lightoller interpreted Smith's order for \\"the evacuation of women and children\\" as essentially \\"women and children only\\". As a result, Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, meaning to fill them to capacity once they had reached the water. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey Peuchen has the distinction of being the only adult male passenger Lightoller allowed into the boats on the port side evacuation, due to his previous nautical experience and offer of assistance when there were no seamen available from the Titanic's own complement to help command one of the lowering lifeboats. There were fears from some of the officers that the davits used for lowering the boats would not hold the weight if the boats were full, but they were unaware that the new davits on the Titanic had been designed to do so. Under this misapprehension, Lightoller's plan was to fill the lifeboats from the waterline and sent 10 men to open the gangway doors in the ship's port so that passengers would have access. The men failed in this task and were never seen again (presumed drowned carrying out this final order). The under-capacity boats then pulled away from the ship as soon as they hit the water, rendering the plan a failure. At least one boat is confirmed as wilfully ignoring officers' shouted orders to return. When Lightoller attempted to launch Lifeboat 2, he found it was occupied already by 25 male passengers and crewmen. He ordered them out of the boat and threatened them with his unloaded revolver, allegedly saying: \\"Get out of there, you damned cowards! I'd like to see every one of you overboard!\\" He then passed the duty of loading Lifeboat 2 over to Fourth Officer Boxhall. While initial accounts varied, it is now believed there were only 17 people aboard the lifeboat, out of a capacity of 40. Collapsible B. As the ship began its final plunge, the water came up onto the boat deck and washed over the bridge. Lightoller attempted to launch Collapsible B on the port side. This collapsible boat was one of the smaller Engelhardt lifeboats with canvas sides and was stowed atop the officers' quarters. The collapsible floated off the deck upside down. Lightoller then crossed over to the starboard side of the roof, to see if there was anything further to be done there. As the ship sank, seawater washed over the entire bow, producing a large wave that rolled aft along the boat deck. Seeing crowds of people run away from the rising water, Lightoller decided that he could do no more and dived into the water from the roof of the officers' quarters. Surfacing, Lightoller spotted the ship's crow's nest, now level with the water, and started to swim towards it as a place of safety before remembering that it was safer to stay away from the foundering vessel. Then, as water flooded down one of the forward ventilators, Lightoller was sucked under. He was pinned against the grating for some time by the pressure of the incoming water, until a blast of hot air from the depths of the ship erupted out of the ventilator and blew him to the surface. The suction pulled him down again against another grating. He did not know how he got away, but he resurfaced. He realized he couldn't swim properly because of the weight of the Webley revolver he was carrying in his coat pocket, so he swiftly discarded it.Lightoller, Charles H. Titanic and Other Ships, Chapter 34 Following this, he saw Collapsible B floating upside down with several swimmers hanging on to it. He swam to it and held on to a rope at the front. Then the Titanics Number 1 (forward) funnel broke free and hit the water, washing the collapsible further away from the sinking ship. Lightoller climbed on the boat and took charge, calming and organising the survivors (numbering around 30) on the overturned lifeboat. He led them in yelling in unison \\"Boat ahoy!\\", but with no success. During the night a swell arose, and Lightoller taught the men to shift their weight with the swells to prevent the craft from being swamped. If not for that, they likely would have been thrown into the freezing water again. At his direction, the men kept that up for hours until they were finally rescued by another lifeboat. Lightoller was the last survivor taken on board the . Lightoller, right, with third officer Herbert Pitman. After the sinking, Lightoller published a testimony in the Christian Science Journal crediting his faith in a divine power for his survival, concluding: \\"with God all things are possible\\". =Recommendations at inquiries= As the senior surviving officer, Lightoller was a key witness at both the American and British inquiries. In his autobiography he described the American inquiry as a \\"farce\\", due to the ignorance of maritime matters implicit in some of the questions. He took the British inquiry more seriously and wrote \\"it was very necessary to keep one's hand on the whitewash brush\\" as he \\"had no desire that blame should be attributed either to the B.O.T. (British Board of Trade) or the White Star Line\\", despite his belief that \\"one had known, full well, and for many years, the ever-present possibility of just such a disaster\\".Titanic and Other Ships (chapter 35), Lightoller, Charles Herbert, I. Nicholson and Watson (1935) Lightoller blamed the accident on the seas being the calmest that night that he had ever seen in his life and on the floating icebergs giving no tell-tale early-warning signs of breaking white water at their bases. He deftly defended his employer, the White Star Line, despite hints of excessive speed, a lack of binoculars in the crow's nest, and the plain recklessness of travelling through an ice field on a calm night when all other ships in the vicinity thought it wiser to heave to until morning. Later, however, in a recounting he gave of the night's events on a 1936 BBC I Was There programme, he reversed his defences. Lightoller was also able to help channel public outcry over the incident into positive change, as many of his recommendations for avoiding such accidents in the future were adopted by maritime nations. Basing lifeboat capacity on the number of passengers and crew instead of ship tonnage, conducting lifeboat drills so passengers know where their lifeboats are and crew know how to operate them, instituting manned 24-hour wireless (radio) communications on all passenger ships, and requiring mandatory transmissions of ice warnings to ships, were some of his recommendations at the inquiries which were acted on by the Board of Trade, its successor agencies, and their equivalents in other maritime nations. First World War Lightoller returned to duty with White Star Line, serving as a mate on RMS Oceanic. He received a promotion from Sub-Lieutenant to Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve in May 1913.London Gazette, 15 August 1913 At the outbreak of the First World War, as an officer in the RNR, he was called up for duty with the Royal Navy, first serving as a lieutenant on Oceanic, which had been converted to an armed merchant cruiser (HMS Oceanic). He served on this ship until it ran aground and was wrecked on the notorious Shaalds of Foula on 8 September 1914. In 1915, he served as the first officer during the trials of another former passenger liner, , which had just been converted into an aircraft carrier. In late 1915, he was given his own command, the torpedo boat HMTB 117. Whilst captain of HMTB 117 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for engaging Zeppelin L31 in a prolonged night battle. With the assistance of a lightship, Lightoller and his crew laid an ambush at the mouth of the Thames Estuary, waiting until L31 was directly above the HMTB. Lightoller opened fire on the \\"Zepp\\" with tracer rounds eventually hitting its tail and forcing the airship's withdrawal. This action resulted in his being appointed captain of , a C-class torpedo boat destroyer and for the next two years Lightoller served with the Falcon on the \\"Dover patrol\\", protecting the Dover straits and engaging German destroyers conducting night time raids. Lightoller wrote that whilst in command of the Falcon, he kept the ship in a constant state of readiness, the ship's guns were loaded and cleared for action at all times. He expected his men to think and act for themselves in times of an emergency. Falcon was sunk on 1 April 1918 after a collision, in fog, with the trawler, John Fitzgerald, while both ships were acting as escorts to a convoy in the North Sea. Lightoller was quickly exonerated in a court martial for the loss of the ship, and he was commended for remaining on board the ship along with his first officer until the majority of the crew had been evacuated to the boats (apart from three officers who were left trapped in the stern and had to be rescued by a trawler). Lightoller was subsequently given command of the River-class destroyer . = Sinking of UB-110 = On 19 June 1918, the German U-Boat UB-110, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Werner Fürbringer, was depth charged, rammed and sunk off the Yorkshire coast by Lieutenant Commander Lightoller and the crew of . In his 1933 memoirs, Kapitänleutnant Fürbringer accused Lightoller of heaving to (stopping) and ordering his crew to open fire on the unarmed survivors of UB-110 with revolvers and machine guns. During the alleged ensuing engagement, Fürbringer claimed he had seen the skull of an 18-year-old member of his crew being split open by a lump of coal hurled by a Royal Navy sailor. When Fürbringer attempted to help a wounded officer to swim, he was told, \\"Let me die in peace. The swine are going to murder us anyhow.\\" Fürbringer alleged that the shooting only ceased when the convoy the Garry had been escorting, which contained many neutral-flagged ships, arrived on the scene. Fürbringer later recalled, \\"As if by magic the British now let down some life boats into the water.\\"Werner Fürbringer (1999), Fips: Legendary German U-Boat Commander, 1915–1918, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis. pp. 118–21. Geoffrey Brooks, who translated Kapitänleutnant Fürbringer's memoirs into English, later commented, \\"Regarding the alleged atrocity committed against survivors of UB-110, the normal procedure would have been to report the matter to the German military legal authorities at the earliest opportunity. Depositions would then have been taken from all available witnesses. One can imagine how far it would have proceeded subsequently. It is not, and never has been, the practice of the British military authorities to try British service personnel for alleged war crimes committed against enemy belligerents in wartime no matter how strong the evidence.\\"Fürbringer (1999), pp. 140–41. Lightoller does not go into detail of the incident in his memoir, but he does mention that he 'refused to accept the hands up air' business. \\"In fact it was simply amazing that they should have had the infernal audacity to offer to surrender, in view of their ferocious and pitiless attacks on our merchant ships. Destroyer versus Destroyer, as in the Dover Patrol, was fair game and no favour. One could meet them and take them on as a decent antagonist. But towards the submarine men, one felt an utter disgust and loathing; they were nothing but an abomination, polluting the clean sea.\\" Lieutenant Commander Lightoller was awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking SM UB-110. At the time of the engagement, UB-110 had two confirmed hits on British ships, and a total kill-count of 30 civilian seamen. =Subsequent wartime service= On 10 June 1918, Lightoller was awarded the Reserve Decoration. He was promoted to acting Lieutenant-Commander in July and was placed on the retired list on 31 March 1919, with the rank of Commander. Retirement After the war, despite his loyal service to White Star Line and having faithfully defended his employers at Titanic inquiries, Lightoller soon found that opportunities for advancement within the line were no longer available. All surviving crewmembers would find that being associated with Titanic was a black mark from which they could not hope to escape. A disillusioned Lightoller resigned shortly thereafter, taking such odd jobs as an innkeeper, a chicken farmer, and later property speculator, at which he and his wife had some success. During the early 1930s, he wrote his autobiography, Titanic and Other Ships, which he dedicated to his \\"persistent wife, who made me do it\\". This book eventually became quite popular and began to sell well. However, it was withdrawn when the Marconi Company threatened a lawsuit, owing to a comment by Lightoller regarding the Titanic disaster and the role of the Marconi operators. Second World War Sundowner Information board in Twickenham near the Richmond Slipways where Lightoller lived and worked after 1947 The retired Lightoller did not turn his back on sailing altogether, as he eventually purchased a private motor yacht, Sundowner in 1929. In 1940, he, together with his son Roger and a young Sea Scout named Gerald Ashcroft,Levine, Joshua, in association with the Imperial War Museum, \\"Forgotten Voices of Dunkirk\\", Ebury Press, London, 2010, \\"Evacuation\\". crossed the English Channel in Sundowner to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation.Manchester, William, and Reid, Paul, \\"The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill Defender of the Realm 1940–1965\\", Little, Brown and Company, New York, Boston, London; First edition November 2012, Library of Congress card number 82-42972, , pp. 83–84. In a boat licensed to carry 21 passengers, Lightoller and his crew brought back 127 servicemen.Sources vary slightly. The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships says, \\"Sundowner embarked 130 men.\\" A member of Lightoller's crew says he \\"counted 129 troops aboard.\\" In a radio interview, Lightoller says, \\"We tallied up 130.\\" A commemorative plaque outside Lightoller's former home in Richmond says he \\"rescued 127 men.\\" Stenson (2011) says, \\"Including the three-man crew and the five men rescued from the [sinking ship] Westerly she now had exactly 130 on board.\\" On the return journey, Lightoller evaded gunfire from enemy aircraft, using a technique described to him by his youngest son, Herbert, who had joined the RAF and been killed earlier in the war. Gerald Ashcroft later recalled \\"We attracted the attention of a Stuka dive bomber. Commander Lightoller stood up in the bow and I stood alongside the wheelhouse. Commander Lightoller kept his eye on the Stuka till the last second – then he sang out to me \\"Hard a port!\\" and I sang out to Roger and we turned very sharply. The bomb landed on our starboard side.\\" At the time of the evacuation Lightoller's second son Trevor was a serving Second Lieutenant with Bernard Montgomery's 3rd Division which had retreated towards Dunkirk. Unknown to Lightoller senior, Trevor had already been evacuated 48 hours before Sundowner reached Dunkirk. For his actions during the evacuation, Charles Lightoller received a mention in despatches in 1944. His actions inspired the character of \\"Mr. Dawson\\" in Christopher Nolan's 2017 film, Dunkirk, portrayed by Academy Award Winner Mark Rylance. Sundowner is now preserved by Ramsgate Maritime Museum. After the Second World War, Lightoller managed a small boatyard in Twickenham, West London, called Richmond Slipways, which built motor launches for the river police. Family Lightoller's parents were Frederick James Lightoller and Sarah Jane Widdows. His siblings, Richard Ashton and Caroline Mary Lightoller, both died of scarlet fever in early childhood. On an Australian run on board the in 1903, Lightoller met Australian Iowa Sylvania Zillah Hawley-Wilson, known as \\"Sylvia\\", on her way home to Sydney after a stay in England. On the return voyage, she accompanied Lightoller as his bride. The couple had five children: Frederic Roger, Richard Trevor, Sylvia Mavis, Claire Doreen, and Herbert Brian. Their youngest son Brian, an RAF pilot, was killed in action on 4 September 1939 in a bombing raid over Wilhelmshaven, Germany, on the first night of Britain's entry into the Second World War. He was flying with 107 Squadron as 2nd Pilot. Their eldest son, Roger, served in the Royal Navy and was killed in March 1945 during the Granville raid whilst commanding a Motor Torpedo Boat. Trevor joined the army and gained the rank of lieutenant colonel, serving under General Bernard Montgomery's command for the duration of the war. Mavis served in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, and Doreen in the Political Intelligence Unit. His grandson, A.T. Lightoller, served in the Royal Navy, commanding the submarine in the early 1970s.Royal Navy postal cover RNSC 12 \\"30th Anniversary Midget Submarine attack on Tirpitz 22nd September 1943\\", 22 September 1973 signed by A.T.

Written by Ray Davies, the song is a nostalgic reflection on cultural English \\"village green\\", country, and hamlet lifestyle, and references many different characteristics and features of it, such as Tudor houses and draught beer. At the same time, it speaks negatively of modern, industrial traits, such as office blocks and skyscrapers. As the opening track of The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, it sets the theme for the majority of the rest of the album. It is also, according to AllMusic, the best-known track from the album. The song has been part of the Kinks' live setlist. The song inspired the band's slogan, \\"God Save the Kinks\\". Background Written by Kinks frontman Ray Davies, \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" was written as an ode to the things Davies treasured. Davies explained in 2018, \\"As 'The Village Green Preservation Society' is supposed to be about things I want to preserve, I thought I would try that song. Virginity is sacred. You only have it once. That innocence—and it's a thing to treasure. I still search for things that I do for the first time.\\" \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" was a late addition to the album, having been written with the purpose of being the album's title track. With this song, Davies wanted to sum up the Kinks' general sentiment of preserving the past that appears throughout the album; he wrote in a 1968 interview, \\"Somebody just mentioned to me that the Kinks do try to preserve things—we are all for that looking back thing. I thought it would be a nice idea to try to sum it up in one song. All the things in the song are things I'd like to see preserved.\\" Davies later called the song \\"an affectionate acknowledgement of our culture.\\" In another interview, Davies explained of the origin of the song's cultural references, \\"The people in it are all characters I liked as a kid or people my family could relate to, like Old Mother Riley and Mrs. Mop. Because I used to love listening to the BBC Light Programme on Sundays, like Round the Horne with Kenneth Williams. A time when the population was allowed to be trivial.\\" Of the song's political meaning, Davies said, \\"It's not right wing, but if I recorded it now, I'd probably be thrown off Question Time. I wouldn't be allowed on television, would I?\\" Reception \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" generally received positive reviews. Rolling Stone magazine praised the songs vocals and stated that \\"the tune, the rhythm, are more of a delight with each verse\\". AllMusic's Stewart Mason felt that the song was \\"one of Davies' sweetest creations\\", but felt that it is overrated and not as successful lyrically as 1967's \\"Autumn Almanac\\". The song was the second single released in America from The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (the first being \\"Starstruck\\"), but it did not chart.

It was shot exclusively on location in New Orleans, Louisiana, and features numerous New Orleans citizens in speaking and non-speaking roles.. The film tells the story of Lieutenant Commander Clinton Reed, an officer of the U.S. Public Health Service (played by Richard Widmark) and a police captain (Paul Douglas) who have only a day or two in which to prevent an epidemic of pneumonic plague after Reed determines a waterfront homicide victim is an index case. Co-stars include Barbara Bel Geddes (as Reed's wife Nancy), Jack Palance (in his film debut) and Zero Mostel – the latter two play associates of the victim who had prompted the investigation. The film was also the debut of Tommy Rettig, who played the Reeds' son. The film was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox as part of the Fox Film Noir collection, along with Laura and Call Northside 777, on March 15, 2005. The score was composed by Alfred Newman. The film was originally named Port of Entry, subsequently Outbreak, and ultimately Panic in the Streets. Plot After brawling over a card game in the wharf area of New Orleans, a man named Kochak (Lewis Charles), suffering visibly from a flu-like illness, is killed by gangster Blackie (Jack Palance) and his two flunkies, Kochak's cousin Poldi (Guy Thomajan) and a man named Fitch (Zero Mostel). They leave the body on the docks, and later when the dead man, who carries no identification, is brought to the morgue, the coroner grows suspicious about the bacteria present in his blood and calls Lieutenant Commander Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), a doctor and commissioned corps officer of the U.S. Public Health Service. Reed is enjoying a rare day off with his wife Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes) and their son Tommy (Tommy Rettig), but decides to inspect the body. After careful examination, he determines that Kochak had \\"pneumonic plague,\\" the pulmonary version of bubonic plague. Reed springs into action, insisting that everyone who came into contact with the body be inoculated. He also orders that the dead man's identity be determined, as well as his comings and goings during the previous few days. Reed meets with people from the mayor's office, the police commissioner and other city officials, but they are skeptical of his claims. Eventually, however, his impassioned pleas convince them that they have forty-eight hours to save New Orleans from the plague. Reed must also convince police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas) and the others that the press must not be notified, because report of a plague would spread mass panic. The group discuss how to deal with public safety. Warren and his men begin to interview Slavic immigrants, as it has been determined that the body may be of Armenian, Czech or mixed blood. Burdened by the knowledge that the massive investigation has little chance of success, Reed accuses Warren of not taking the threat seriously enough. In turn, Warren admits that he thinks Reed is ambitious and trying to use the situation to further his career. Reed, angry, decides to take matters into his own hands and, acting on a hunch that the man may have entered the city's port illegally, goes to the National Maritime Union hiring hall and passes out copies of the dead man's picture. Although the workers tell Reed that seamen never talk, he goes to a café next door hoping that someone will meet him with a tip. Eventually a young woman shows up and takes Reed to see her friend Charlie (Wilson Bourg Jr.), who reluctantly admits that he worked aboard the ship, the Nile Queen, upon which the already ill man was smuggled. Meanwhile, Fitch, who was questioned by Warren but claimed to know nothing, goes to Blackie and warns him about the investigation. Blackie plans to get out of town, but begins to suspect that his sidekick Poldi received expensive smuggled goods from Kochak, explaining the police's intense investigation of the man's murder. Reed and Warren, who is now convinced of Reed's integrity, go to the Nile Queen and convince the crew to talk by telling them that they will die if the sick man was indeed on their ship. After carrying up a sick cook from the hold, the seamen then permit Reed and Warren to inoculate and question them, revealing in the process that Kochak boarded at Oran and was fond of shish kebob. With this lead, Reed and Warren canvas the city's Greek restaurants, and just after they leave one such establishment, Blackie arrives to meet Poldi, who is very ill. A short time later, Reed receives word that a woman, Rita (Aline Stevens), has died of the fever and realizes that she was the wife of the Greek restaurant proprietor John Mefaris (Alexis Minotis) who had earlier lied about having served Kochak. Reed returns to headquarters to discover that a reporter (Dan Riss) is threatening to break the story that a pathogenic bacteria is endangering the city. Reed is impressed when the deeply committed yet unorthodox Warren throws the reporter into jail to keep him quiet. Late in the evening, a beleaguered Reed returns home for a few hours of sleep, and his wife announces that she is pregnant. She then tries to restore her husband's flagging self-confidence. A few hours later, Reed and Warren learn that the mayor is angry about their treatment of the reporter. The reporter, who has been released, announces that the story will appear in the morning paper in four hours, giving Reed and Warren little time to find their man. Meanwhile, Blackie goes to Poldi's room and tries to force him to reveal information about some smuggled goods, but the dying Poldi is delirious and only rants nonsensically. Blackie then brings in his own doctor and tells Poldi's grandmother that they will take care of him. Just then, Reed, having been tipped off by the nurse looking after Poldi, arrives, and Blackie and Fitch, who are carrying Poldi down the stairs, pitch the man over the side and flee. Reed chases the two to the docks, where he tries to explain to them about the plague. The men run desperately through depots, docks and a warehouse, and at one point, Warren shoots and injures Blackie, preventing him from shooting Reed. Blackie accidentally shoots Fitch and then tries to struggle onto a ship but, exhausted, he is unable to pass a rat guard on the mooring line, and falls into the water. His work finally done, Reed heads for home, and on the way, Warren offers to give him some of the smuggled perfume that Poldi had indeed received from Kochak. As the radio announces the resolution of the crisis, a proud Nancy greets her husband.

Pre-production  The production of Panic in the Streets underwent several rounds of edits with the effort to abide by the Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code). Originally titled Port of Entry, the temporary script of the film was sent on November 11, 1949 to Joseph Breen, the film censor with the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America who applied the Production Code to film production. Joseph Breen himself indicated in threads of letters with Colonel Jason S. Joy, the Director of Public Relations of the 20th Century Fox, the changes needed for the script. Suggestions such as \\"Violet must not be suggestive of a prostitute\\", \\"We assume there will be no suggestion that the police officer is killed\\", and \\"The scene of Martinez and the mattress falling should not be too realistically gruesome,\\" were made. On December 20, 1949, in the Joy's letter responding to the suggestion of Breen, the film had been renamed Outbreak. The sensitive content of the film, especially the scenes pointed out by Breen, were not fully changed until after a couple back and forth of letters that lasted for around 3 months. Ultimately, the film was named Panic in the Streets in the final version of the synopsis on March 8, 1950. Approved by the Production Code Administration (PCA) on March 14, 1950, the film officially entered the production stage.Production Code Administration. PANIC IN THE STREETS, 1950. Motion Picture Association of America. Production Code Administration records, Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. ReceptionBox office= The film failed to recover its costs at the box office which Darryl Zanuck blamed in part on location shooting. He felt if the film had been made for $850,000 it would have been profitable. =Critical response= The New York Times gave the film a mixed review and wrote, \\"Although it is excitingly presented, Panic in the Streets misses the mark as superior melodrama because it is not without obvious, sometimes annoying exaggeration that demands more indulgence than some spectators may be willing to contribute. However, there is an electric quality to the climax staged in a warehouse on the New Orleans waterfront that should compensate for minor annoyances which come to the surface spasmodically in Panic in the Streets.\\"The New York Times. Film review, August 5, 1950. Last accessed: February 8, 2008. Variety magazine liked the film and wrote, \\"This is an above-average chase meller. Tightly scripted and directed, it concerns the successful attempts to capture a couple of criminals, who are germ carriers, in order to prevent a plague and panic in a large city. The plague angle is somewhat incidental to the cops-and-bandits theme...There is vivid action, nice human touches and some bizarre moments. Jack Palance gives a sharp performance.\\"Variety. Film review, 1950. Last accessed: April 6, 2010. New Orleans film critic David Lee Simmons wrote in 2005, \\"The film noir elements come from the movie's use of post-war German Expressionist and Italian Neo-Realist techniques. Kazan admired how the Expressionists used chiaroscuro lighting to heighten emotion, and he related to the Neo-Realists' cinéma vérité portrayals of those living on the margin of society. Panic offered him a chance to explore these styles further by experimenting with cinematography and casting real people. After working with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood – Dorothy McGuire, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Dana Andrews, Gregory Peck and Ethel Barrymore – Kazan wanted to go in the opposite direction. To suit the needs of this picture and his new approach, he recruited not only lesser stars, but also some of his rougher cronies from the New York stage scene, and on top of that several New Orleanians with varied levels of acting experience.\\"Gambit Weekly film review April 5, 2005: Widespread Panic Retrieved 2011-11-25 Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 24 reviews and gave the film a score of 96%, with an average rating of 7.46 out of 10. =Awards= Wins * Venice Film Festival: International Award, Elia Kazan; 1950. * Academy Awards: Oscar, Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt; 1951.

It grows in dry woodlands and at forest edges and can reach tall with stems thick with smooth gray bark, but it can also remain relatively small in the shade of other plants. The leaves are green, rounded oval with a pointed tip, coarsely double-toothed, long and broad, with hairy undersides. The male flowers are catkins that form in the fall and pollinate single female flowers the following spring to allow the fruits to mature through the summer season.  Description  Corylus cornuta is named from its fruit, which is a nut enclosed in a husk with a tubular extension long that resembles a beak. Tiny filaments protrude from the husk and may stick into, and irritate, skin that contacts them. The spherical nuts, which are surrounded by a hard shell, are edible though small. The beaked hazel is the hardiest of all hazel species, surviving temperatures of at its northern limits. = Varieties = There are two varieties, divided by geography: *Corylus cornuta var. cornuta – Eastern beaked hazel. Small shrub, tall; 'beak' longer, or more. *Corylus cornuta var. californica – Western beaked hazel or California hazelnut. Large shrub, tall; 'beak' shorter, usually less than . The Concow tribe called this variety (Konkow language).  Range and uses  The seeds are dispersed by jays and rodents such as red squirrels and least chipmunks. Although C. cornuta is somewhat shade tolerant, it is more common in forests with fairly open canopies than denser ones. However, it is intolerant of entirely open areas that get hot and dry. Fire kills the above- ground portion of the shrub, but it resprouts fairly readily after fire, and in fact American Indians in California and Oregon used fire to encourage hazelnut growth, as they used hazelnuts for food, baskets, medicine, and other purposes. It is considered an excellent nut, with the same uses as any hazelnut. Squirrels eat the nuts of C. cornuta californica, and deer and livestock browse its foliage.

Early years A native of Port Huron, Michigan, Wismer displayed great interest and prowess in sports at an early age. He was a multiple sport star at Port Huron High School, but bad grades temporarily derailed his college plans and he entered a private school, earning letters in football, basketball, and baseball at St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin. Wismer played college football at both the University of Florida and Michigan State College, his playing career ending at the latter school when he damaged a knee severely during a game against the University of Michigan. He then began broadcasting Michigan State sports on MSC's radio station WKAR in a position arranged for him by Spartans head coach Charlie Bachman. In 1934, he was hired as the public-address announcer for the Detroit Lions. The Lions were in their first season in Detroit and were owned by George A. \\"Dick\\" Richards, who also owned Detroit radio station WJR. Wismer soon began doing a ten-minute daily radio show covering the Lions in addition to his PA duties, while continuing as a student at Michigan State. Broadcaster After the 1936 season, Wismer was encouraged by Richards to abandon his studies and come to work for WJR on a full-time basis as the station's sports director. Among Wismer's WJR duties was serving as play-by- play announcer for the station's Lions broadcasts. In August 1940, he resigned to join the Maxon, Inc., advertising agency as an account executive, with the provision that he would continue to broadcast Lions' games. In 1941, he was hired by the NBC Blue Network, the predecessor to ABC. During the 1940s Wismer was named Sportscaster of the Year three years running by Sporting News magazine.Port Huron (Mich.) Times Herald, 07/22/46. In 1947, he was named one of 10 outstanding young Americans of the year by the U.S. Jaycees, along with congressman John F. Kennedy, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and physicist Philip Morrison.Port Huron (Mich.) Times Herald, Jan 20, 1947. However, a subsequent management change at ABC led to a new regime that was hostile to sports, and Wismer became a free-lancer, selling his service to the highest bidder. Wismer became known for an enormous ego and developed a reputation as a \\"namedropper\\", preferring to announce the names of celebrities of his acquaintance who were in the audience to the actual game action, and was alleged at times to include them in the crowd of games which he announced when they were in fact elsewhere. In the late 1940s, he provided the voice talent to numerous 16 mm college football films. Wismer often added the sound commentary long after the games were over, and added a radio style commentary with sound effects such as referee whistles to recreate an authentic sound. He was owner of HarFilms, a short-lived New Orleans-based sports film production company. He appeared in the 1948 Hollywood production Triple Threat as a football broadcaster. Wismer achieved the height of his fame as the voice of the Washington Redskins. His first game for the Redskins was a most inauspicious one in December 1940, their 73–0 loss to the Chicago Bears' great \\"Monsters of the Midway\\" team in the 1940 championship game. At one point Wismer was a 25% owner of the club as well, with the majority of the stock being retained by founding owner George Preston Marshall. However, the relationship between the two had greatly degenerated by the mid-1950s over several issues, not the least of which was Marshall's steadfast refusal to sign any black players. The relationship dissolved in claims, counterclaims, and litigation, and Marshall then set out to destroy Wismer's future as a broadcaster, with some success. Wismer was also involved for a time in the broadcasting of Notre Dame football. In 1953, Wismer was involved in an early attempt to expand football into prime time network television, when ABC, now with a renewed interest in sports, broadcast an edited replay on Sunday nights of the previous day's Notre Dame games, which were cut down to 75 minutes in length by removing the time between plays, halftime, and even some of the more uneventful plays. (While this format was not successful in prime time, a similar presentation of Notre Dame football later became a staple of Sunday mornings for many years on CBS with Lindsey Nelson as the announcer.) Also that season was the first attempt at prime time coverage of pro football, with Wismer at the microphone on the old DuMont Network. Unlike ABC's Notre Dame coverage, DuMont's NFL game was presented live on Saturday nights, but interest was not adequate to save the DuMont Network, which had by this point already entered what would be a terminal decline (although it did mount a subsequent 1954 season of NFL telecasts, minus Wismer, which proved to be one of its last regular programs). AFL owner Wismer was a charter owner in the AFL, which was announced in 1959 and began actual play in 1960. He was one of two owners with experience in sports team ownership and in broadcasting. He had previously been a part owner of the Detroit Lions and the Washington Redskins (Buffalo's Ralph Wilson was also a part owner of the Lions). His New York franchise was nicknamed the \\"Titans\\". Wismer devised a plan in which the proceeds from the broadcast rights to league games (initially with ABC) would be shared equally by all teams, very innovative at the time but setting the standard for all future professional football television broadcasting contracts. As Wismer owned what would seem to have been the most potentially lucrative franchise, especially with regard to broadcasting rights, in the nation's largest media market, the act seemed at first blush most generous for a self-described \\"hustler\\". However, Wismer realized that the fledgling league needed for all of the eight franchises to be successful in order to survive long-term. Unfortunately for Wismer, his own team, despite being located in the nation's largest city, was probably the most problematic in the league in its initial years. For one thing, the team was relegated to playing its home games in the rotting remains of the old Polo Grounds, which had been abandoned after the 1957 season by the New York Giants baseball team for San Francisco and was never a particularly satisfactory football venue. In contrast, the NFL football Giants played across the Harlem River in prestigious Yankee Stadium in The Bronx; they had moved out of the Polo Grounds after the 1955 season. Additionally, the New York media for the most part was derisive and dismissive of the Titans, when it deigned to mention them at all. For most New York sports reporters of the era, professional football in New York City began and ended with the Giants. Wismer's volatile personality was of little help in this area; he resented not only other media figures but also Dallas Texans owner Lamar Hunt, whom Wismer saw as a rich boy whose father had bought him a football team as a toy. Wismer also had an ongoing feud with AFL commissioner Joe Foss, and had at times a far-less-than-warm relationship with the Titans' first head coach, hall of fame quarterback Sammy Baugh. (Baugh had been the losing tailback in the 73-0 debacle back in 1940 that had marked Wismer's debut with the Redskins as noted above.) Wismer also lacked the truly \\"deep pockets\\" of some of the other early AFL owners, particularly Hunt, possessed. For the most part their wealth had come from sources outside the field of sports, which, although already quite popular in the U.S., was not the major industry it was shortly to become. Wismer's wealth, such as it was, had come entirely from his sports involvement. The blue-and-gold Titans drew just 114,682 total paid admissions at the Polo Grounds in the initial season in 1960; by 1962 this number had dwindled to a mere 36,161 total for seven home games under new head coach Clyde \\"Bulldog\\" Turner and Wismer was broke. Supposedly it was loans from other AFL owners, including Wilson and Houston Oilers owner Bud Adams, which kept Wismer and the Titans (as well as several other teams including the Oakland Raiders and Boston Patriots) afloat. This was a necessity for the league to remain viable, as U.S. broadcasters have traditionally had a very limited level of interest in team sports leagues without a viable New York franchise, due to the size of that market area. Wismer, who had long tended to live \\"hard-and-fast\\", began to drink even more heavily, and eventually ruined his relationships with all of the other AFL owners, even Adams. They arranged the March 1963 sale of the team to a more financially stable group of investors headed by Sonny Werblin, who changed the team name to the \\"Jets\\" in April and hired Weeb Ewbank as head coach. The now green-and-white Jets were still at the Polo Grounds in 1963, with four of their home games on Saturday nights, then moved into the new Shea Stadium in 1964, where they played for two decades. When Werblin signed University of Alabama star quarterback Joe Namath in January 1965 for a package worth a then-unheard of value of roughly $430,000, the Jets, and the AFL, were made. The Namath signing, and his subsequent stardom, along with a new, more lucrative television contract with NBC, led more than any other single factor to the AFL–NFL merger. Wismer was left embittered and with debts totalling approximately $2.5 million, which he eventually struggled to settle for 78 cents on the dollar. When Werblin sold his share of the team in May 1968, the franchise value had gone from $1 million to $15 million in those five years. Final years Wismer wrote a book, The Public Calls It Sport, which was something of a combination autobiography and explanation of his philosophy of life. Sales were not particularly brisk. He got involved in the Michigan Speedway project, which, to his great chagrin, was very slow to get under way. Wismer's health, far from brisk, broke completely from depression and alcoholism on top of his other problems after a trip overseas. In 1967, he sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic for cancer before returning to his hometown of Port Huron, where he underwent more treatments, including the replacement of his cancerous hip. Largely given up on, Wismer rallied, and soon fulfilled his desire to return to New York City. Once there, he found that he was no longer a celebrity or even much noticed, and of those who did notice, more held him in contempt than liked him. His drinking problem returned with a vengeance, and on December 3 he suffered a fall at a restaurant while drunk, falling down a flight of stairs. Still weakened from his earlier health problems, he died the early the next morning on December 4. \\"Harry Wismer Dies after Fall on Restaurant Stairs\\", Chicago Tribune, December 5, 1967, p3-1 An autopsy gave a skull fracture as being the immediate cause of death. Wismer's brother John, a Port Huron radio station owner, claimed ever afterward Harry had been thrown down the stairs by mobsters, though for what reason wasn't clear. Today Wismer is remembered primarily as something of an eccentric rather than as a crucial founder of the AFL and one of the creators of professional football's modern era through shared broadcast revenues. Personal life Wismer was married twice. His first wife, Mary Elizabeth Bryant, was related to the Henry Ford family. They divorced in 1959. His second marriage in 1962 was to Mary Zwillman, the widow of New Jersey mobster Abner Zwillman. Mary Zwillman Wismer was appointed as the Titans' nominal chief executive officer.Harry Wismer Dies After Fall On Restaurant Stairs Chicago Tribune December 5, 1967Namath: A Biography by Mark Kriegal Quote > \\"...no matter how good you think you are, how shrewd you are, there is > always someone down the block, across the street, in the next town, who is a > little better, shrewder, more ruthless.\\" From The Public Calls It Sport In popular culture In a song on Commentary! The Musical, a bonus feature on the DVD of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Simon Helberg mentions his character Moist's fear of stairs, commenting \\"That's how Harry Wismer died.\\" While pulling the New York Titans and the AFL together, Wismer was approached by writer George Plimpton, who asked to join the team's training camp for a Sports Illustrated profile. Wismer agreed, later forgot about it, and Plimpton ended up playing with and writing about Wismer's old team, the Detroit Lions, for the magazine and in the book Paper Lion. Plimpton on Wismer: \\"He was an odd man. He used to say 'Congratulations' to many people he met, on the grounds that they had probably done something they could be proud of.\\"Plimpton, George.

He is a co- founder of Hamas and a member of the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip. Since the formation of the Hamas/\\"Change and Reform\\" government in the Palestinian National Authority in March 2006, al-Zahar has served as foreign minister in the government of prime minister Ismail Haniyeh. Prior to that he was seen as a major candidate among the Hamas members elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council for prime minister, as he was at that time the most senior official within the organization. His son, a member of the Hamas military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was killed by Israeli fire in Gaza on 5 January 2008. Early life Little is known about al-Zahar's early life beyond the fact that he was born in Gaza City in 1945, and the report that he was born to a Palestinian father and an Egyptian mother. At the age of 26, he graduated from the Cairo University Faculty of Medicine and five years later he got his Masters Degree in General Surgery from Ain Shams University, Cairo. He then became the adviser to the Palestinian Health Minister, and helped create the Palestinian Medical Society and was one of the primary founders of the Islamic University in Gaza in 1978. Hamas Instrumental to the creation of Hamas in 1987, al-Zahar has remained a senior official and spokesperson for the group and is rumoured to have succeeded to leadership of the group following Israel's assassination of Ahmed Yassin in 2004. Hamas routinely denied this rumour, but refused to name who their new leader was, for fear of Israeli action. In response to a campaign of suicide bombings by the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, an Israeli F-16 dropped on 10 September 2003 a large bomb over his house in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza, which only managed to slightly wound him, while his son Khaled, and a personal bodyguard were killed, and twenty others wounded including his daughter Rima. His house was destroyed, and ten other houses nearby were damaged, as well as the nearby Al- Rahman mosque. The resulting funeral was attended by over two thousand mourners, who called on Hamas to avenge the deaths. On 15 January 2008, al- Zahar's son Hussam was reportedly killed in an IDF air strike on a car full of Hamas fighters in northern Gaza. In 2010, al-Zahar revealed to the press that Yasser Arafat had instructed Hamas to launch militant attacks—including suicide bombings—against Israel in 2000, due to peace talks not going anywhere.\\"Arafat ordered Hamas attacks against Israel in 2000\\", Jerusalem Post, reported 29 June 2010 Foreign Minister On 20 March 2006, Hamas named al-Zahar foreign minister. Al-Zahar's main challenge has been to break the US- led diplomatic boycott of the Haniyeh government. On 14 June 2006, Palestinian officials reported that Palestinian Foreign Minister Mahmoud al-Zahar brought twelve suitcases stuffed with US$26.7 million in cash into Gaza through its border with Egypt, which is controlled by Palestinian guards loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah. Al-Zahar was at least the third known Hamas official to be caught with large sums of cash: Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri had been stopped the previous month.\\"Hamas minister carries millions of dollars into Gaza\\", ABC News, reported 14 June 2006 Hardline positionIncitement controversy= During the 2008–2009 Gaza War, al-Zahar, during a television broadcast, was reported to have said that the Israelis \\"have legitimised the murder of their own children by killing the children of Palestine... They have legitimised the killing of their people all over the world by killing our people.\\" This remark was widely reported as advocating the \\"murder\\" of Jewish children worldwide. Maajid Nawaz condemned the remarks as \\"depraved\\" and \\"perverse Al-Qaeda logic,\\" writing that, as opposed to Hamas, \\"Israel does not have an active policy of deliberately capturing children to murder them, or even deliberately murdering civilians for that matter.\\" Basim Naim, the minister of health in the Hamas government in Gaza, said Zahar's statements had been misquoted and mistranslated, and that what he did was to \\"warn that by carrying out these barbaric massacres of children and women, and by destroying our mosques, the Zionists are creating the conditions for people to believe it is justified or legitimate to take revenge....Dr Zahar did not even mention 'Jews' in his comments\\". Park51 endorsement In an interview on New York's WABC radio, al-Zahar was asked by Aaron Klein to comment on the construction of the mosque Park51 near the World Trade Center site. Zahar, endorsed the building, by saying, \\"We have to build the mosque as you are allowed to build the church and the Israeli are building their holy places. We have to build everywhere – in every area we have Muslims, we have to pray, and this mosque is the only site of prayer especially for the people when they are looking to be in the group – not individual\\".

Weighing , the Netherland Dwarf is one of the smallest rabbit breeds. Its popularity as a pet or show rabbit may stem from its neotenic appearance. The Netherland Dwarf is recognised by both the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) and the British Rabbit Council (BRC). The Netherland Dwarf is often confused with the Polish breed of rabbit, but the latter has longer ears, a non-brachycephalic head and less cobbiness. History The Netherland Dwarf breed was first produced in the Netherlands in the early 20th century. Small Polish rabbits were bred with smaller wild rabbits; after several generations the resulting animal was a very small domestic rabbit available in a wide variety of colours and patterns. Netherland Dwarfs were first imported into the United Kingdom in 1948. In the 1960s and 1970s the United States imported its first Netherland Dwarf rabbits. The breed was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association in 1969 using a modification of the British standard. Early dwarfs, even into the 1970s and 1980s, had fearful and sometimes aggressive temperaments. This was a result of breeders selecting wild breeding animals for their size. The first dwarf rabbits behaved more like these wild rabbits than domestic animals and were not good pets. However, through generations of selective breeding, the modern Netherland Dwarf has become a gentle, friendly pet rabbit, though it still can retain a more energetic disposition than larger breeds. 11-week-old Netherland Dwarf rabbit. (Vienna Marked Black Otter) Appearance Young blue-eyed-white Netherland Dwarf eating timothy hay. The Netherland Dwarf's head and eyes are disproportionately large with respect to its short-coupled and stout (\\"cobby\\") body. Its ears are notably short and carried high on the head and its face is rounded and brachycephalic. These neotenic features, a result of dwarfism, cause the Netherland Dwarf to retain an infantile appearance even into adulthood. 1½ year old red-eyed-white (REW) Netherland Dwarf. The Netherland Dwarf has been bred in a wide variety of colours, including: Ruby Eyed White, Blue Eyed White, Black, Blue, Chocolate, Lilac, Red, Siamese Sable, Siamese Smoke, Sealpoint, Blue Point, Chocolate Point, Tortoiseshell, Agouti, Red Agouti, Opal, Cinnamon, Lynx, Chinchilla, Squirrel, Tan, Marten Sable, Marten Smoke, Black Otter, Blue Otter, Chocolate Otter, Lilac Otter, Fox, Orange, Fawn, Hotot, Himalayan, Harlequin, Magpie, Broken, Butterfly and Mantle . 7 years old Netherland Dwarf. Netherland Dwarfs as pets Due to their size and overall disposition, Netherlands Dwarfs often do not make good pets for children (although suitability will vary between individual rabbits). There is often a mismatch with small children, because they like to play with the pet or pick it up to cuddle with it. Dwarf rabbits do not like to be picked up or held tightly; and they can bite, scratch or struggle wildly if the child does so. This often leads to accidents if the child drops them out of fright, leading to major injuries because a rabbit has very fragile bones. Larger breeds of rabbits are recommended for children, because they have fewer issues with temperament. However, dwarf rabbits can make excellent pets for adults. They thrive in a quiet, stable environment with plenty of human interaction. They are trainable, quiet and clean. Grooming needs are minimal, but the rabbit enjoys a daily brushing. Time is needed to bond with the rabbit and to build trust, because Dwarf breeds are often more nervous and more aloof than larger breeds. However, when the rabbit has bonded with their owner they make affectionate pets. The expected lifespan of domesticated Netherland Dwarfs is 10-12 years. Behaviour They can be litter-trained because they have a natural tendency to choose the same spot for their droppings and they have a much higher intelligence than most rabbits making it easier to litter train them. Netherland Dwarfs can be skittish, wild and/or of a disagreeable nature. This is a leftover stereotype from the beginnings of the breed. This has changed through selective breeding; however, they are skittish and aloof. They are extremely active and energetic, requiring the same amount of exercise as other breeds of rabbit. They also have a higher tendency towards nervousness and stress. As with any species, disposition will vary from individual to individual. Diet A 4-week-old Netherlands Dwarf rabbit from a litter of four in St. Catharines, ON, Canada. Their diet consists of good quality pellets, veggies and an unlimited supply of hay. Root vegetables and fruit are high in sugar and should not be given often or in large amounts. Pellets should be fed in limited amounts—1/8 cup per pound of body weight. Vegetables,namely dark, leafy greens, should also be given, at 2 cups or more per 6 pounds of body weight.Proper Rabbit Maintenance Diet At a juvenile age, Netherland Dwarfs (as with most other rabbit breeds) should be fed unlimited quantities of alfalfa pellets and hay. As they age, the alfalfa should be gradually replaced with other hays and pellets. The pellets should be reduced to proportion with the weight of the rabbit.Rabbit Food - House Rabbit Society Dwarf breeds An adult female Netherland Dwarf, Black Self. Rabbit breeds derived from breeding larger rabbits with the Netherland Dwarf (or any rabbit with a dwarf gene) are known as dwarf breeds. Most smaller breeds, like the Mini Rex, the Jersey Wooly, and the Holland Lop, are results of such breedings. Generally dwarf breeds are slightly larger than the typical Netherland Dwarf, not growing larger than 4 to 5 lb (1.8 to 2.3 kg). Most have shortened faces compared to larger rabbits, and some even preserve the rounded head, large eyes or small ears of the Netherland Dwarf. These features make them look little. Specifically, the Netherland Dwarf body should be round, compact and equally broad from front to back. Dwarf rabbits also have short legs and a large head in relation to the body. Their foreheads are broad and they have well developed muzzles. Furthermore, the eyes are large and prominent. Their ears are erect and close together, reaching between one and three inches in length. They have to be shorter than 2 inches and a half (ARBA), if not, this is a disqualification from competition in the Netherland Dwarf breed. Dwarf rabbits typically weigh 2 to 2.5 pounds according to ARBA.Wegler, Monika. \\"The Dwarf Breeds.\\" My Dwarf Rabbit. Hauppauge, NY: Barron's, 2008. 26-31. Print. Breeding A one-year-old Chestnut (Agouti in UK) Netherland Dwarf The gene (symbol Dw) responsible for the common appearance of the dwarf was discovered in the United States during the beginning of the 20th century. When two \\"true dwarfs\\" (both buck and doe) are bred, the genetic pattern which makes them \\"true dwarfs\\" (Dwdw) ensures that 25 percentage of their offspring will inherit the lethal genetic combination dwdw. These offspring, often called \\"peanuts\\" by rabbit breeders, are destined to struggle with life for up to three weeks and then to die. Reasons behind the death are unknown, but it is believed that peanuts have underdeveloped digestive tracts. The condition is 100% fatal, although if fed by hand every hour and kept warm it is possible for a peanut to survive, even though it will be handicapped for its entire life. Many ethical breeders humanely euthanise peanuts upon finding them soon after birth. Peanuts are easily distinguished from non-peanuts; they have extremely pinched hindquarters, a bulbous head and their ears are often set further back than normal (sometimes almost onto the neck). If two true dwarfs are bred, the statistical result will be 25% fatal 25% false, and 50% true. The actual numbers of true/false/peanuts in a real litter varies. \\"False Dwarfs\\" tend to have longer bodies, longer/larger ears, longer faces, and are mostly heavier than the 2.5 pound maximum weight for showing. While false dwarfs (referred to as BUD's by breeders, BUD meaning big ugly doe) do not make good show rabbits, does from a good background are vital to a breeder's programme. They have the same \\"good genes\\" as a true dwarf and are capable mothers, possibly even having larger and more successful litters than true dwarfs. Also False Dwarfs are unable to produce peanuts. Their litters will be 50% false dwarfs and 50% true dwarfs if they are bred to a true dwarf buck. False dwarfs are easily judged for quality as the traits are generally the same, only bigger. Ear thickness/shape, fullness of hindquarter, topline and other traits are the same. It is common practice among Netherland Dwarf breeders to breed a proven show quality true dwarf buck to a quality false dwarf doe. This eliminates the chance of peanuts and yields quality offspring. The chances of false dwarfs is higher, but those offspring generally go toward breeding (some false dwarf bucks have proven themselves valuable to a breeding programme) or are sold as pets. Usually false dwarf bucks are not kept by breeders.

The governing philosophy has therefore shifted around economic growth to overall societal balance and harmony. Along with a moderately prosperous society, it was set to be one of the national goals for the ruling vanguard Communist Party. The concept of social harmony dates back to ancient China, to the time of Confucius. As a result, the philosophy has also been characterized as a form of New Confucianism.Arnold, Perris. 1983. \\"Music as Propaganda: Art at the Command of Doctrine in the People's Republic of China.\\" Ethnomusicology 27(1):1–28. In modern times, it developed into a key feature of General Secretary Hu Jintao's signature ideology of the Scientific Development Concept developed in the mid-2000s, being re-introduced by the Hu–Wen Administration during the 2005 National People's Congress. The promotion of the \\"Harmonious Society\\" demonstrated that Hu Jintao's ruling philosophy had departed from that of his predecessors.Zhong, Wu. October 11, 2006. \\"China yearns for Hu's 'harmonious society'.\\" Asia Times. Near the end of his tenure in 2011, Hu appeared to extend the ideology to an international dimension, with a focus on the international peace and cooperation, which is said to lead to a \\"harmonious world\\" whereas the administration of Hu's successor, Xi Jinping, has used the philosophy more sparingly, likely in favor of emphasizing his vision of the Chinese Dream.  History  The concept of harmony in Chinese culture comes from music; during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, discussion of music flourished under Confucius and the schools of thought he created, known as Confucianism. Confucianism played a key part in the formulation of the earliest form of Chinese music, Qin. Qin music illustrates the concept of harmony through its techniques such as the level of pressure and the speed of tempo, which symbolize Yin and Yang and the different temperature in the four seasons. The moderate unison of sounds maintains the perfect order and managing these opposing elements into a moderate piece of musical work is considered the best sound.Ko, Yi-Fang. 2006. \\"Confucianism in Qin Music.\\" Chinese Music 29(2):32–39. Furthermore, one of the most influential works by Ru Jia (otherwise known as Book of Music), reads: > When the early rulers formed the li [rituals] and yue [music] their purpose > was not to satisfy the mouth, stomach, ear and eye, but rather to teach the > people to moderate their likes and hates, and bring them back to the correct > direction in life. Music, under Confucian concepts, has the power to transform people to become more civilized and the goal of music is to create balance within individuals, nature and society. Leading people \\"back to the correct direction in life\\" not only signifies the guiding role of music, but also emphasizes on the power of the rulers, \\"The correct 'mood' was set by the chief of state, the emperor, the son of Heaven.\\" The power of the rulers reflects a fundamental theme in Chinese civilization. The State, or the ruling government, has the special role of taking care of the people; however, what distinguishes the Chinese ruling government from other ruling governments is the respectful attitude of the citizens, who regard the government as part of their family. In fact, the ruling government is \\"the head of the family, the patriarch.\\"Jacques, Martin. 2010. \\"Understanding the Rise of China\\" (video). London: TED. Therefore, the Chinese look to the government for guidance as if they are listening to their father who, according to Chinese tradition, enjoys high reverence from the rest of the family. Furthermore, \\"still another tradition that supports state control of music is the Chinese expectation of a verbal 'message.'\\" A \\"verbal message\\" is the underlying meaning behind people's words. In order to get to the \\"verbal message,\\" one needs to read into words and ask oneself what the desired or expected response would be. The Chinese tradition of reading into words makes it easier for the government, or \\"the father,\\" who possesses more attention and respect, to pass down its wishes through songs.  Political context  The \\"Socialist Harmonious Society\\" concept represents a new direction of Chinese communist leadership that signified the transition between Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Although on the surface, \\"socialist harmonious society\\" seems benign, many scholars believe that General Secretary Hu has a vision for a deeper reform of the political system in China.Geis, John and Blaine Holt. 2009. \\"'Harmonious Society' Rise of the New China.\\" Strategic Studies Quarterly 3(4):75–94. In addition, the idea of scientific development stresses on scientific discovery and technological advance, engines for sustainable growth in the long run. Sustainable growth is a concept in macroeconomics that signifies GDP at potential (i.e. all that is produced is being consumed and there is no cyclical unemployment) for years to come. In addition, the Socialist Harmonious Society concept was a response to the problem of social inequality/ wealth gap, which if not dealt with immediately, could lead to social unrest and even turmoil. A key reason contributing to a widening wealth gap was social injustice, which features collusion between entrepreneurs and officials. Through collusion, entrepreneurs were able to buy land from farmers and then sell it at high prices. Furthermore, with the protection of local officials, private coal mine owners ignored safety regulations to cut production costs. As a result, thousands of miners are killed in accidents. Since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the leadership has been extremely sensitive about maintaining stability. General Secretary Hu's focus on stability and openness is the central model addressed in the book The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall by Ian Bremmer. According to Bremmer, the Chinese government is trying carefully to avoid instability by jumping from a controlled social environment on one end to complete openness on the other. The \\"J Curve\\" model is applicable to the political development of most nations and presents a choice between stability and openness. The concept of \\"Socialist Harmonious Society\\" is said to include both elements of the model. Hence, Hu's \\"socialist harmonious society\\" has an underlying message of establishing political reform as well as safeguarding social justice and equality. New interpretation Hu Jintao visited the US in early 2011, two years before he stepped down as the General Secretary of the Communist Party (the paramount leader). One of the key messages of his visit was the idea of peace and cooperation: \\"China and the United States have major influence in international affairs and shoulder important responsibilities in upholding world peace and promoting common development.\\"Johnson, Ian. January 18, 2011. \\"China's Leader Has Message of Harmony, but Limited Agenda..\\" The New York Times. In addition to attending state dinners, President Hu visited the US- China Business Council, a Chinese-owned auto parts plant in Ohio, and Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago/Confucius Institute of Chicago. When asked about the differences between the US and China at Walter Payton Prep, Hu Jintao responded, \\"China and the US have different histories, culture, social systems and levels of development, but their peoples are peace-loving and in pursuit of growth. I hope that the friendship between our two nations will last forever.\\"\\"President Hu Jintao Paid a Visit to the Confucius Institute in Chicago News.\\" Hanban.org. January 27, 2011. With few agendas at hand before his retirement, Hu Jintao brought to America a concept of harmony that is based on peace, cooperation and \\"soft power\\" exchanges. Soft power is a concept developed by Joseph Nye to describe the ability to attract and cooperate rather than using coercion, force or money as a means of persuasion. The means of persuasion by using force or money, on the other hand, is called hard power. Nye, as a past Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs in the Clinton Administration, stresses on the combination of soft power and hard power, which he calls smart power. Nye believes that the using of smart power in today's dynamic international relations will be highly effective.Joseph Nye on Global Power Shift, video file, directed by Joseph Nye (Oxford, England: TED, 2010). Now looking back at President Hu's visit to US and linking it with the multidimensional rise of Chinese influence on the international stage, one can discover the subtle similarity between Chinese and American foreign policies. In addition to the utilization of smart power, the Chinese leader also understands the concept of \\"Shadow of the Future\\": At the high school, Hu Jintao told the students, \\"The young are the future of a nation and the hopes of the world. The prospects of China-US relations are in the hands of the young people of the two countries.\\" \\"Shadow of the Future\\" is a concept in Joseph Nye's book, Understanding Global Conflict and Cooperation: An Introduction to Theory and History. The key to Shadow of the Future is to lengthen the period of peace and cooperation and to reduce fear of power conflicts. One of the paramount reasons that contributes to the Peloponnesian War, according to Thucydides, is \\"the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.\\" Hu's perspective claims to try to reduce the deadly psychological feeling in the nature of humans as well as nations. On the other hand, the American foreign policy goes beyond the message of peace, understanding and cooperation. As the world's superpower, the United States has a tough stance on the rise of China. The appropriateness of such a tough stance, nevertheless, is debatable given the political environment at the time of American elections. During Hu's visit, President Barack Obama assured China that the US is reasserting its influence in East Asia and in the Pacific Ocean.Fallows, James. “A Final State Dinner Note.” The Atlantic, January 20, 2011. Indeed, the US has increased its military and political presence in the Pacific through its military deployment in Australia and its diplomatic/military pressure on the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea in early 2012. The administration of Hu's successor, Xi Jinping, has used the phrase more sparingly. It was mentioned only once in the resolutions passed by the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee. Criticism and satire While initially the public's reaction to the idea was positive, over the years \\"Harmonious Society\\" has emerged as a euphemism for \\"stability at all costs,\\" and has garnered its share of critics. The government often uses \\"Harmonious Society\\" to justify the suppression of dissent and the tight control on information in China. Some social commentators have pointed out the irony that in building a \\"harmonious society\\" the country has become less just, less equal, and less fair. Meanwhile, some of Hu's critics say that application of the \\"Socialist Harmonious Society\\" concept has resulted in anything but itself. China scholar Cheng Li said that Hu's failure in implementing the Socialist Harmonious Society program has been his \\"gravest pitfall\\" during his tenure. Critics cite the increased wealth gap, higher internal security budgets, and unprecedented corruption in state-owned industries as evidence that Socialist Harmonious Society has failed in practice. = River crab = The term \\"River crab\\" () has been adopted as internet slang in Mainland China in reference to Internet censorship. The word river crab sounds similar to the word \\"harmonious\\" in Mandarin Chinese. In addition, the word harmonious can itself also be the placeholder verb for \\"to censor\\", most often referring to posts on a forum that have been deleted because of unacceptable content, or the censorship of stories reporting sensitive issues in the press. Something that has been censored in this manner is often referred to as having been \\"harmonized\\" ().

On March 31, 2004, Air America was launched with much fanfare on flagship WLIB in New York City. Soon afterward it was discovered that Cohen had secured part of the money used to found the network by a loan from his employer, the non- profit Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Clubs. Approved by the board of directors and in the amount of $480,000, it went to Cohen's company Progress Media, then owner of Air America Radio. The Gloria Wise group was a non-profit organization, partially funded by the city of New York, which provided services for children and seniors in the Bronx. The city suspended further funding of the agency, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America revoked the group's right to use their name, likeness or logo. When the funds were transferred Evan Montvel Cohen was still Director of Development for Gloria Wise. This was part of a larger misappropriation of funds by the organization's executives, which saw several of them receiving money from the organization that was in turn used for personal expenditures. By the time this was revealed, Progress Media Inc. had sold its Air America rights to Piquant LLC (in November 2004), who subsequently agreed to repay Gloria Wise $875,000 worth of the debt, as a condition of the sale.

Rattlesnake Island is an island located on Lake Erie near Put-In-Bay, northeast of Port Clinton, Ohio. It is part of Put-in-Bay Township, in Ottawa County. It is one of several islands known as the Lake Erie Islands. The name Rattlesnake comes from the actual rattlesnakes that formerly inhabited the island, ( and supposedly also from the overall shape of the island — two small islets near the northern tip were said to resemble a rattlesnake's rattle).  History  During the later-1700s, the Lake Erie Islands were still part of the Canadian territory (having been claimed for Great Britain, by the Governor of Canada, and who also named St. George’s Island, when he visited these islands circa-1797). However, the Connecticut Land Company later (circa-1806) surveyed them as being part of the Connecticut Western Reserve (but, none of these Lake Erie islands were ever a part of the Firelands Grant). Put-in-Bay was a strategic location during the War of 1812, when Oliver Hazard Perry - Commodore of the United States fleet on Lake Erie - rendezvoused with General William Henry Harrison at Sandusky Bay, and following discussions concerning the upcoming campaign the commanders selected Put-in-Bay harbor for the American naval base. From this strategic location Perry was able to observe British fleet movements, and eventually engaged and defeated them. Perry's victory gave the Americans control of Lake Erie and a relative calm prevailed amongst the islands. In 1854, Abigail Dunning of Hartford, Connecticut, sold Rattlesnake Island to Horace Kelley of Cleveland, Ohio. Soon thereafter, post offices were established on South Bass Island (1860), North Bass Island (1864), and Middle Bass Island (1864). Rattlesnake Island was largely uninhabited at the time and on June 22, 1861 Rattlesnake Island became a part of Put-In-Bay Township. For the subsequent two decades, the only known residents of Rattlesnake Island, were the David Hammond family (who moved here from Vermilion, Ohio), including several of David’s children who were born on the island.  Modern history  Rattlesnake Island and its \\"rattles\\" viewed from South Bass Island. The modern history of Rattlesnake Island began with the purchase of the island about 1929 by Hubert D. Bennett, the owner of the Toledo Scale Company, who developed the island by putting in a lodge, harbor, and east-west landing strip. A second north-south landing strip was added in the 1950s by a Catholic order. In 1959, the island was sold to James P. Frackelton, M.D., a Cleveland surgeon and owner of the Cleveland Stamp and Coin Company, and Robert C. Schull, a stockbroker. Frackelton and Schull further developed the island, but economic and market conditions forced the sale of the island in 1989. Rattlesnake Island then became a private island that was re-sold in 1992 for $4.6 million. Frackelton and sixty-five other investors re-purchased the island in 1999. Today, Rattlesnake Island is accessible only to the 65 members of the Rattlesnake Island Club. There are currently only about fifteen private and exclusive lots on the island. Sale of property on the island is controlled by the island club. Most of the members travel to the island to take advantage of the private facilities, including a bar, restaurant, large pool and hot-tub, health club, tennis courts, bocci courts, miniature golf, and much more. Inside the main building, underneath the bar, is a racquetball court, basketball court, pool table, dart board, big screen television, a pinball machine, card table, and even a suit of armor. There are two landing strips for airplanes, which come and go often. These grass landing strips double as a small golf course. The pilot's lounge doubles as a pro-shop, with access to score cards and golf balls. Near the runway is a small cage containing peacocks. Members and guests on the island travel from one place to another on an electric golf cart. There are also seven hotel rooms which members can stay in for the night. Rattlesnake Island clothing can be purchased from a store located in a small shed adjacent the restaurant. In recent years, a second marina was added to the island. The summer staff, mostly from Eastern Europe, numbers around 25 and there are separate dorms for the men and women working there. There is also a year-round caretaker and chef. The island's workers are trained to recognize each of the members and their families both by appearance and by the yacht they come in on. Any non-members will immediately be turned away by armed security guards in one of the island's two boats before the intruders even have time to dock. Because of the secrecy behind the island, many rumors and myths have arisen, including a rumor that criminal organizations use the island as a place to relax. With the tight security, the best place to view the island is atop the Perry Monument on Put-in-Bay. In order to join the Island Club, one of the current members must quit, and the potential member must receive recommendations from at least two of the island's current members. The cost to join is estimated to be between $90,000 and $200,000 initially, as well as a monthly maintenance fee. The reported population as of the 2000 census was only 2 persons.  Rattlesnake Island local post  cover of 31 December 1966. The island operated the only USPS- sanctioned local post in the United States. For many years, service was provided by way of a Ford Trimotor which shuttled mail between the island and the mainland. From 1966 to 1989, USPS mail was routed by way of Port Clinton, Ohio. Under revived operations, outgoing mail from the island entered the USPS mail stream by way of Sandusky, Ohio. Local Post service began in 1966 and continued through 1989, when the island was sold and the new owners discontinued the service. It was restarted in 2005. A notice on the official Rattlesnake Island website has posted a notice that as of 2013, the local post is closed indefinitely. The stamps of Rattlesnake Island Local Post appear in the 2017 Edition of Phillips' Modern US Local Posts CD Catalog.

He has since had success as a recording artist, with gold and platinum discs to his credit. Biography Way was born in London, England, and was a chorister by the age of eight. He is the sixth child out of eight siblings. His mother (Eileen Way) was a housewife. His father (Garry Way) worked as an officer at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. In 1990, the prison chaplain, the Rev. Ray Guymer, suggested to Way's father that young Anthony should go for a voice trial at St Paul's Cathedral. Way passed the audition and was given a place at the Cathedral Choir School at the age of nine. At the age of twelve, he received attention for his portrayal of Henry Ashworth in the lavish 1995 BBC mini- series based on the Joanna Trollope novel The Choir as a gifted young chorister whose voice saved a cathedral and its choir. The series comprised five one-hour episodes, and has aired on America's PBS Network. Way was the prominent voice on The Choir soundtrack, and was backed by the Gloucester Cathedral Choir and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. Released by Polygram label Decca, the recording went platinum, selling 350,000 copies worldwide and spent 15 weeks at the top of the UK Classical Chart. It was notably the fastest-selling classical release since the Three Tenors five years previously. Meanwhile, in the UK Singles Chart the album secured a No 3 spot, squeezing out Michael Jackson. (The DVD of the series was eventually released in March 2006, shortly after \\"The Choirboys\\" debut album became the fastest selling classical debut album). In 1995, his record label released \\"The Choirboy,\\" an amalgamation of classic and contemporary songs which was excluded from the UK Classical Chart. A court battle then ensued between Way's record label and the Classic Chart compilers that resulted in media controversy and saw Way splashed across the national press, propelling the album to gold status and taking total album sales to half a million. The chart compilers soon thereafter started a new classical crossover chart (in January 1996). From this album also came the hit singles \\"Panis Angelicus\\" and \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" which both went gold or platinum within a short time of their release. In mid=1995, Way and the choir played an important part in the \\"VE Day 50\\" celebrations: Firstly, St Paul's Cathedral hosted the National Service of Thanksgiving that was broadcast live on British television; the day after in London's Hyde Park, the youngster performed \\"Panis Angelicus\\" in front of an estimated crowd of 150,000 people including the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family. The event was broadcast live to millions of people on television worldwide and introduced the boy to a whole new audience. By the summer of 1996, Way had risen to Deputy Head Chorister at St Paul's. The choir was given the honour of serenading Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on her 96th Birthday. Way recorded The Choirboy's Christmas with the English Chamber Orchestra, released in November 1997. This album was recorded in London's Temple Church, where chorister Ernest Lough had recorded his version of \\"O For the Wings of a Dove\\" more than sixty years earlier. It was reported that Decca spent an initial advertising budget of £300,000 in the run up to Christmas to promote his new album. By the following Easter, the album had sold over 60,000 copies. The choir also recorded two other albums at this time, How Can I Keep From Singing? and Passiontide at St. Paul's, both of which featured a number of soloists, including Way on one track. In May of that year, maturity took its toll on his signature treble voice forever. His final few concerts saw him perform in King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and at the home of the English Sinfonia in Stevenage, where he performed tracks live from the album for the last time, alongside his old friend and \\"Choirgirl of the Year 1995\\", Tabitha Watling. To mark his retirement as a treble soloist, Decca released The Best of Anthony Way in 1998. He starred as Tom Long in 1999's film version of Tom's Midnight Garden, alongside Greta Scacchi, James Wilby, Joan Plowright and Nigel Le Vaillant, filmed in the summer of 1997 in England and the Isle of Man. The film won critical acclaim on its release at the Giffoni Film Festival in Italy. Anthony Way biography.

It is an algorithmic, deterministic event generator, utilizing early digital integrated circuits to generate an audio output that can sound very musical. It produces a sequence of notes based on the settings of about a dozen different parameters, including four small sliders that control Volume, Tempo, Pitch, and Fine Pitch. Only a few hundred were ever made. The Muse was a featured exhibit for years at the Museum of Science, Boston. The exhibit signage explained the device's algorithmic approach to the creation of its seemingly random music. Far from being random, its preset \\"song\\" played continuously—and was even given a name, \\"Museum Musings,\\" by the staff. The Muse is the subject of U. S. Patent 3610801. Notable users It was known to be used by the first wave of electronic musicians in the Philadelphia area in the late 70s. Users included: Charles Cohen, Lenny Seidman, Jeff Caine, George Kuetemeyer, Eddie Jobson, Rex X Ray and Stephan Spera, Paul Wozniki, and the groups Heavenside Layer, Ghostwriters, Watersports, and The Orchestra of Philadelphia Electronic Musicians. The Muse was also used during the WXPN radio show Star's End by host Gino Wong in the fall of 1977.

Biography Born in Piraeus, Greece, on 2 March 1928, his parents emigrated to the United States when he was only two months old. He grew up in Manhattan, graduating from the Hellenic College, Brookline, Massachusetts. After attending Yale Divinity School, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Athens. From 1956 to 1965 he was Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the Holy Cross Theological School in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1968 he was appointed as tenured Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the University of Thessaloniki, Greece, a position he held until his retirement in 1982. His latest position was Professor of Theology at Balamand Theological School, in Lebanon. Romanides died in Athens, Greece on 1 November 2001. He was a \\"candidate for the Far Right in the 1977 parliamentary elections in Greece\\". Theology Romanides belonged to the \\"theological generation of the 1960s\\", which pleaded for a \\"return to the Fathers\\", and led to \\"the acute polarization of the East-West divide and the cultivation of an anti-Western, anti-ecumenical sentiment.\\" According to Kalaitzidis, his early theological interests are \\"wide and broad-minded\\", but narrowed with the publication of Romiosini in 1975, which postulates an absolute divide between the Eastern Churches and the Western Church: \\"[h]ereafter, the West is wholly demonized and proclaimed responsible for all the misfortunes of the Orthodox, both theological and historical/national.\\" Romanides contributed many speculations, some controversial, into the cultural and religious differences between Eastern and Western Christianity. According to Romanides, these divergences have impacted the ways in which Christianity has developed and been lived out in the Christian cultures of East and West. According to Romanides, these divergences were due to the influences of the Franks, who were culturally very different from the Romans. His theological works emphasize the empirical (experiential) basis of theology called theoria or vision of God, (as opposed to a rational or reasoned understanding of theory) as the essence of Orthodox theology, setting it \\"apart from all other religions and traditions\\", especially the Frankish-dominated western Church which distorted this true spiritual path. Studying extensively the works of 14th-century Byzantine theologian St. Gregory Palamas, he stated religion to be identical with sickness, and the so-called Jesus prayer of hesychasm to be both the cure of this sickness and the core of Christian tradition: His research on Dogmatic Theology led him to the conclusion of a close link between doctrinal differences and historical developments. Thus, in his later years, he concentrated on historical research, mostly of the Middle Ages but also of the 18th and 19th centuries. =Augustine of Hippo= Romanides sees St Augustine as the great antagonist of Orthodox thought. Romanides claims that, although he was a saint, Augustine did not have theoria. Many of his theological conclusions, Romanides says, appear not to come from experiencing God and writing about his experiences of God; rather, they appear to be the result of philosophical or logical speculation and conjecture. Hence, Augustine is still revered as a saint, but, according to Romanides, does not qualify as a theologian in the Eastern Orthodox church.\\"While pointing this out, this writer has never raised the question about the sainthood of Augustine. He himself believed himself to be fully Orthodox and repeatedly asked to be corrected\\" Original sin versus ancestral sin Romanides rejects the Roman Catholic teachings on Original Sin.The Ancestral sin by John S. Romanides (Author), George S. Gabriel (Translator) Publisher: Zephyr Pub (2002) Orthodox theologians trace this position to having its roots in the works of Saint Augustine. Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Assyrian Church of the East, and Eastern Catholicism, which together make up Eastern Christianity, contemplate that the introduction of ancestral sin into the human race affected the subsequent environment for humanity, but never accepted Augustine of Hippo's notions of original sin and hereditary guilt. It holds that original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405 Rejection of St. Augustine Eastern Orthodox theologians John Romanides and George Papademetriou say that some of Augustine's teachings were actually condemned as those of Barlaam the Calabrian at the Hesychast or Fifth Council of Constantinople 1351.This claim is made by Romanides in the title of his Augustine's Teachings Which Were Condemned as Those of Barlaam the Calabrian by the Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1351,Augustine himself had not been personally attacked by the Hesychasts of the fourteenth century but Augustinian theology was condemned in the person of Barlaam, who caused the controversy. This resulted in the ultimate condemnation of western Augustinianism as presented to the East by the Calabrian monk, Barlaam, in the Councils of the fourteenth century. Saint Augustine in the Greek Orthodox Tradition by Rev. Dr. George C. Papademetriou It is the vision or revelation of God (theoria) that gives one knowledge of God. Theoria, contemplatio in Latin, as indicated by John Cassian,\\"Videtis ergo principalem bonum in theoria sola, id est, in contemplatione divina Dominum posuisse\\" (Ioannis Cassiani Collationes I, VIII, 2) meaning vision of God, is closely connected with theosis (divinization). John Romanides reports that Augustinian theology is generally ignored in the Eastern Orthodox church. Romanides states that the Roman Catholic Church, starting with Augustine, has removed the mystical experience (revelation) of God (theoria) from Christianity and replaced it with the conceptualization of revelation through the philosophical speculation of metaphysics.Revelation for Palamas is directly experienced in the divine energies and is opposed to the conceptualization of revelation. The Augustinian view of revelation by created symbols and illumined vision is rejected. For Augustine, the vision of God is an intellectual experience. This is not acceptable to Palamas. The Palamite emphasis was that creatures, including humans and angles, cannot know or comprehend God's essence Romanides, Franks, Romans, Feudalism, p.67Revelation for Palamas is directly experienced in the divine energies and is opposed to the conceptualization of revelation. The Augustinian view of revelation by created symbols and illumined vision is rejected. For Augustine, the vision of God is an intellectual experience. This is not acceptable to Palamas. The Palamite emphasis was that creatures, including humans and angles, cannot know or comprehend God's essence Romanides, Franks, Romans, Feudalism, p.67 Romanides does not consider the metaphysics of Augustine to be Orthodox but Pagan mysticism. Romanides states that Augustine's Platonic mysticism was condemned by the Eastern Orthodox within the church condemnation of Barlaam of Calabria at the Hesychast councils in Constantinople. Criticism The Greek Old Calendarist, Archimandrite [later Archbishop] Chrysostomos of Etna, CA, criticized Romanides' criticism of Augustine: =Heaven and Hell= Icon of monks falling into the mouth of a dragon representing hell Icon of hell According to Romanides, the theological concept of hell, or eternal damnation is expressed differently within Eastern and Western Christianity. According to John S. Romanides, \\"the Frankish [i.e. Western] understanding of heaven and hell\\" is \\"foreign to the Orthodox tradition\\". According to Romanides, the Orthodox Church teaches that both Heaven and Hell are being in God's presence,(St. Isaac of Syria, Mystic Treatises) The Orthodox Church of America website which is being with God and seeing God, and that there is no such place as where God is not, nor is Hell taught in the East as separation from God. One expression of the Eastern teaching is that hell and heaven are being in God's presence, as this presence is punishment and paradise depending on the person's spiritual state in that presences. For one who hates God, to be in the presence of God eternally would be the gravest suffering. Aristotle Papanikolaou and Elizabeth H. Prodromou wrote in their book Thinking Through Faith: New Perspectives from Orthodox Christian Scholars that for the Orthodox: Those theological symbols, heaven and hell, are not crudely understood as spatial destinations but rather refer to the experience of God's presence according to two different modes.Thinking Through Faith: New Perspectives from Orthodox Christian Scholars page 195 By Aristotle Papanikolaou, Elizabeth H. Prodromou The saved and the damned will both experience God's light, the Tabor light. However, the saved will experience this light as Heaven, while the damned will experience it as Hell.Regarding specific conditions of after-life existence and eschatology, Orthodox thinkers are generally reticent; yet two basic shared teachings can be singled out. First, they widely hold that immediately following a human being's physical death, his or her surviving spiritual dimension experiences a foretaste of either heaven or hell. (Those theological symbols, heaven and hell, are not crudely understood as spatial destinations but rather refer to the experience of God's presence according to two different modes.) Thinking Through Faith: New Perspectives from Orthodox Christian Scholars page 195 By Aristotle Papanikolaou, Elizabeth H. Prodromou Theories explicitly identifying Hell with an experience of the divine light may go back as far as Theophanes of Nicea. According to Iōannēs Polemēs, Theophanes believed that, for sinners, \\"the divine light will be perceived as the punishing fire of hell\\".Iōannēs Polemēs, Theophanes of Nicaea: His Life and Works, vol. 20 (Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1996), p. 99 Other Eastern Orthodox theologians describe hell as separation from God.Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov) speaks of \\"the hell of separation from God\\" (Archimandrite Sophrony, The Monk of Mount Athos: Staretz Silouan, 1866-1938 (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001 ), p. 32).\\"The circumstances that rise before us, the problems we encounter, the relationships we form, the choices we make, all ultimately concern our eternal union with or separation from God\\" (Life Transfigured: A Journal of Orthodox Nuns, Vol. 24, No. 2, Summer 1991, pp.8-9, produced by The Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration, Ellwood City, Pa.).\\"Hell is nothing else but separation of man from God, his autonomy excluding him from the place where God is present\\" (In the World, of the Church: A Paul Evdokimov Reader (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001 ), p. 32).\\"Hell is a spiritual state of separation from God and inability to experience the love of God, while being conscious of the ultimate deprivation of it as punishment\\" (Father Theodore Stylianopoulos).\\"Hell is none other than the state of separation from God, a condition into which humanity was plunged for having preferred the creature to the Creator. It is the human creature, therefore, and not God, who engenders hell. Created free for the sake of love, man possesses the incredible power to reject this love, to say 'no' to God.

According to Iōannēs Polemēs, the important Orthodox theologian Gregory Palamas did not believe that sinners would experience the divine light: \\"Unlike Theophanes, Palamas did not believe that sinners could have an experience of the divine light [...] Nowhere in his works does Palamas seem to adopt Theophanes' view that the light of Tabor is identical with the fire of hell.\\"Iōannēs Polemēs,Theophanes of Nicaea: His Life and Works, vol. 20 (Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1996), p. 100 =Theosis= The practice of ascetic prayer called Hesychasm in the Eastern Orthodox Church is centered on the enlightenment, deification (theosis) of man. Theosis has also been referred to as \\"glorification\\", \\"union with God\\", \\"becoming god by Grace\\", \\"self- realization\\", \\"the acquisition of the Holy Spirit\\", \\"experience of the uncreated light\\" (Tabor light). Theosis (Greek for \\"making divine\\",Henry George Liddell; Robert Scott [1940], A Greek-English Lexicon \\"deification\\",Archimandrite George, Mount Athos, Theosis – Deification as the Purpose of Man's Life (extract)Translator of Kallistos Katafygiotis, On Union with God and Life of Theoria \\"to become gods by Grace\\",Archimandrite George, Mount Athos, Theosis: The True Purpose of Human Life, Glossary and for \\"divinization\\", \\"reconciliation, union with God\\"Fellow Workers With God: Orthodox Thinking on Theosis (Foundations) by Normal Russell pg and \\"glorification\\")Theosis as the Purpose of Mankinds existence by Archimarite George is expressed as \\"Being, union with God\\" and having a relationship or synergy between God and man. God is Heaven, God is the Kingdom of Heaven the uncreated is that which is infinite and unending, glory to glory. Since this synergy or union is without fusion it is based on free will and not the irresistibly of the divine (i.e. the monophysite). Since God is transcendent (incomprehensible in ousia, essence or being), the West has over-emphasized its point by qualifying logical arguments that God cannot be experienced in this life.At the heart of Barlaam's teaching is the idea that God cannot truly be perceived by man; that God the Transcendent can never be wholly known by man, who is created and finite. According to John Romanides, following Vladimir LosskyThe mystical theology of the Eastern Church By Vladimir Lossky pgs 237-238 in his interpretation of St. Gregory Palamas, the teaching that God is transcendent (incomprehensible in ousia, essence or being), has led in the West to the (mis)understanding that God cannot be experienced in this life. Romanides states that Western theology is more dependent upon logic and reason, culminating in scholasticism used to validate truth and the existence of God, than upon establishing a relationship with God (theosis and theoria). Influence According to Kalaitzidis, Romanides had a strong influence on contemporary Greek Orthodoxy, to such an extent that some speak about \\"pre- and post-Romanidian theology\\". Kalaitzidis further notes that Romanides' post-1975 theology has \\"furnished a convenient and comforting conspiratorial explanation for the historical woes of Orthodoxy and Romiosyne\\", but is \\"devoid of the slightest traces of self-criticism, since blame is always placed upon others\\". James L. Kelley's recent article has argued that Kalaitzidis's concern that Orthodox theologians engage in \\"self-criticism\\" is a ploy to engineer a \\"development of Orthodox doctrine\\" so that, once the Orthodox place some of the blame on themselves for \\"divisions of Christian groups\\", they will adjust the teachings of Orthodoxy to suit the ecumenist agenda (see James L. Kelley, \\"Romeosyne\\" According to John Romanides and Christos Yannaras: A Response to Pantelis Kalaitzidis [Norman, OK: Romanity Pres, 2016]).

It is situated in the village of Ranshofen, which is in Braunau am Inn (Upper Austria).  History  The aluminium smelting business was founded in 1938 in Ranshofen as Mattigwerk, with reference to the Mattig river. After the Second World War, the factory was occupied by US troops until 1946, when it was handed over the Austrian government. It was nationalized as Österreichische Metallwerke AG (ÖMAG), and this name as later changed again to Vereinigte Aluminiumwerke AG (VAW). In 1957, VAW merged with the non-ferrous metal business of Arthur Krupp AG to form Vereinigten Metallwerke Ranshofen- Berndorf AG (VMW). To expand the product portfolio with cast aluminium wheels, a 100% subsidiary was founded in 1983, Alu-Guß GmbH. It was later sold to the Borbet group. Similarly, the Berndorf business was spun off and sold in 1988. The name of the company was changed to Austria Metall AG (AMAG). AMAG was privatised in 1996, in the form of a Management-Buyout by Klaus Hammerer (40%) and an employee trust (20%), the remaining stock (40%) being acquired by Constantia. In 2007, Hammerer sold its stake to Constantia Packaging AG. Extrusion business carried by AMAG extrusion GmbH remained however in the hands of Hammerer, and became HAI Hammerer Aluminium Industries GmbH. In the end of 2007, Constantia bought 10% of the shares from the employee trust. Stake rose to 90% in 2009 and, on 8 April 2011, Austria Metall was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.

Its primary targets are armoured vehicles and tanks with secondary soft target (anti personnel) capabilities. It entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1973. BL755 was developed as a new-generation anti-tank weapon that would allow extremely low-level attacks against Soviet armor formations. The introduction of the ZSU-23-4 Shilka rendered the pop-up attack profile demanded by iron bombs and air-to-ground rockets almost suicidal. The cluster munition would be dropped in pairs while the aircraft overflew the formation at and 300 feet altitude, covering an area of . The weapon's first use in combat was during the Falklands War where it was used in the anti-infantry role. When dropped from ultra-low altitudes, the bomblets proved to have a very high failure rate because the parachutes often did not deploy in time. A new version was ordered for the Gulf War that added a radar altimeter allowing release from medium altitudes and then opening at the proper altitude. As part of the 2007 Convention on Cluster Munitions negotiations, the RAF agreed to remove the BL755 from its inventory by 2008. Its role has been replaced by the CRV7, an air-to-ground rocket with such improved performance that it is effective even in the face of the ZSU. HistoryPrevious systems= For many years the standard RAF anti-armor weapon was the RP-3, the World War II- era air-to-ground rocket made famous by the Hawker Typhoons of the Second Tactical Air Force. These were still being widely used in the 1960s, especially during the battles between Yemen and Radforce in what was then the Aden Protectorate where Hawker Hunters fired a total of 2,508 RP-3 over 642 sorties. With the British withdrawal in November 1967, the Hunters moved to Bahrain and the RP-3 retired after decades of service. The RP-3 was replaced by the Matra-produced SNEB, a version of the seminal post-war rocket design, the US Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR). These rockets were fired from a streamlined pod rather than individual rails, which greatly reduced drag and dramatically increased the number of rockets that could be carried. While a Hunter might carry eight RP-3s, it typically carried two 18-rocket pods for a total of 36 SNEBs. The SNEB was also more accurate; the RP-3 had an average dispersion around 2.3 degrees, while the larger snap-out fins of the SNEB reduced this to just over 1 degree. However, the smaller rocket motor did result in slightly lower velocity and longer flight times, although the effective range was slightly longer. The SNEB appears to have been fit operationally only once, when it was mounted on some British Army Aérospatiale Gazelles during the Falklands War in 1982, but it appears none were actually fired. The SNEB was also cleared for carriage by many other aircraft used in the conflict, but due to the possibility that shipboard radars might fire the electrical ignitors, most used an older Royal Navy 2-inch rocket design instead. =SR(A)1197= In the early 1970s the Ministry of Defense was startled by reports of the effectiveness of the ZSU-23-4 Shilka which first entered service in 1965 and had replaced all earlier systems in Soviet use by the early 1970s. Using older weapons like the 1000 lb iron bomb or the SNEB against tanks required the aircraft to fly low and then \\"pop up\\" during the final approach to about altitude and then fly directly at the target. In the case of the SNEB this required a dive at around 10 degrees and firing at a range of about . This was right within the engagement envelope of the Shilka. Furthermore, a total of 20 aircraft would be needed to guarantee the formation would be broken up, meaning the Shilka would have many chances to attack. This led to serious concerns about the survivability of the RAF in the anti-armor role. As it was later stated: This led to the issuing of staff requirement SR(A)1197 for a new weapon capable of being delivered from very low altitudes, about , while overflying the target area without the need to pop up. =BL755= Hunting Aircraft won the contract with what became BL755. The weapon looked like a conventional iron bomb, but contained a total of 147 sub- munitions arranged in seven rows of 21 each. After release from the aircraft, the \\"bomb\\" was popped open using an inflatable bag that drove the munitions outward, breaking the covers and scattering the bombs. The sub-munitions consisted of a small high explosive anti-tank warhead with a stabilizing \\"coronet\\" that flipped out on ejection to ensure they were facing forward when they impacted. The trigger was mounted on a spring that extended after launch to ensure the bomb fired at the right range from the armor. The weapon reached its initial in-service version with the No. 1 Mk. 4 design of 1973, with carriage on the Hawker Harrier GR.3, SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 and Blackburn Buccaneer S.2. Some indication of its effectiveness compared to the SNEB is that calculations suggested 9 aircraft each dropping two BL755s would have the same effect as 20 aircraft firing 36 SNEB each. =IBL755= It was precisely at this time that the Soviets began introducing the T-72 into service, which had enough armor to defeat the BL755 if it hit the frontal arc of the tank. In response, Hunting modified the design to replace the coronet with a small parachute contained in a basket at the back of the sub-munitions. This slowed the weapon so that it normally impacted the tank from the top where it had no problems penetrating the armor. This No. 2 Mk. 1 version, also known as IBL755, remained effective against Soviet armor for the rest of the BL755's history. =RBL755= BL755 had its first major use during the Falkland's war, where it was extensively used by the Hawker Harrier aircraft. It was found that when the Safety, Arming and Functioning Unit (SAFU) was set to its lowest altitude setting, the parachutes did not have time to fully deploy and the bomblets often struck the ground at an angle that meant their trigger was not set off. When the RAF began preparing for the Gulf War in 1991, they decided that all weapons would be released from medium altitudes, which the BL755 was not really suited to given the SAFU was designed for a range of altitudes from low to ultra-low. This led to an Urgent Operational Requirement and the modification of those remaining BL755's with No. 1 Mk. 4 with the addition of a Motorola radar altimeter to produce the RBL755. The incorporation of the altimeter meant the weapon always released the sub-munitions at the right time to ensure they had the right trajectory to trigger, which also had the side- effect of eliminating any pre-setting on the part of the pilot. =Replacement= As part of the international Convention on Cluster Munitions carried out in Oslo in 2007, the RAF agreed to remove the BL755 from service. Its replacement was the CRV7, another rocket developed from the FFAR, but one with a new solid-propellant rocket of dramatically improved performance. Whereas the RP-3 and SNEB had an effective firing range on the order of 1,500 yards, the CRV7 is effective to about and flies at about three times the speed of these earlier weapons. This allows the launching aircraft to fire whilst still outside the range of weapons like the Shilka. Design The BL755 looks like a standard general-purpose bomb but with a hard \\"saddle\\" on the spine for ejector release and crutching pad loads and a distinctive large turbine-like air arming vane on the nose. The four rear fins are squared off in appearance, but on closer inspection can be seen to be hollow and telescopic. A central extruded aluminum skeleton is divided into seven bays, each containing 21 submunitions (147 total). The bays are covered by a frangible cover that the submunitions break during ejection. The submunitions are ejected by a central gas cartridge and individual inflatable bladders for each bay, operating in a similar manner to a car airbag. Ejection on the original BL755 bomb is triggered by the rotation of the arming vane, driven by the airflow. Each submunition is contained within its own SAFU (safety and arming unit) and is telescoped shut. Upon release, the submunition is expanded by a spring. A focal distance standoff and detonating device deploys at the front and a fan of stabilizing fins at the rear. Each has a shaped charge HEAT warhead for armour penetration, the casing of which is constructed from wound tessellated square wire, which produces around 1,400 anti-personnel fragments. A single cluster bomb produces a total of more than two hundred thousand fragments. Deployment The bomb is cleared for use by the Tornado aircraft in the British Royal Air Force. =United Kingdom= The BL755 was used in combat by the Royal Navy and the RAF during the Falklands War, and the RAF during the second Gulf War (Operation Telic) and Bosnian War. (note it was not used during the first Gulf War except for a small number deployed by RAF Jaguars). =Yugoslavia= On the night of 27 October 1991, a Yugoslavian Soko J-22 Orao mistakenly dropped two BL755 Mk.3 bombs on the outskirts of Barcs, a small city in southernmost part of Hungary, causing extensive material damage, but no casualties. The incident led to an emergency upgrade of the Hungarian Air Force, which obtained 28 new MiG-29B fighter jets in exchange for a write-off of ex-Soviet state debt. The Hungarian government also invited NATO's E-3 AWACS planes to patrol over the Lake Balaton area, keeping a constant radar eye on the Balkan civil war theatre. =Zimbabwe= The Air Force of Zimbabwe's BAE Hawks were armed with BL755s, which were used against the Rwandan, Ugandan and Congolese rebel forces during the early stages of the Second Congo War, in support of Congolese leader Laurent Kabila. =Iran= The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force heavily used BL755 cluster bombs on Iraqi troop and armour concentrations during the Iran-Iraq War. They were carried by the F-5E, F-5F, F-4D and F-4E Phantoms. =Saudi Arabia/UAE= Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have used the BL755 cluster bomb in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and Yemeni civil war (2015–present).

AMEs are practitioners of aviation medicine, although most are also qualified in other medical specialties. The International Civil Aviation Organization have established basic medical rules for determining whether a pilot is fit to act in that capacity, and they are codified in Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. However, most countries' aviation authorities have developed their own specific details and clarifications to be used in addition to – frequently more stringently than – the high-level standards prescribed by ICAO. The military equivalent of the AME is the flight surgeon. AMEs in the United States AMEs are private physicians, not employees of the FAA. Interested physicians apply through their regional flight surgeon's office. If selected and authorized, they are trained through a national process. A pilot can go to any examiner from a list of designated doctors and undergo an examination at any time. New AMEs are designated based upon the local demand for aeromedical certification services. All AMEs may issue second-class or third-class certificates. Some AMEs are designated \\"senior aviation medical examiner\\", and may issue first-class certificates, which are required for pilots flying in air carrier operations. An AME can no longer issue combined medical/student pilot certificates as the FAA now issues separate student pilot certificates as of April 1, 2016. As of 2008, the FAA had approximately 3,927 civilian AME's located in 9 regions, 291 international AMEs located in 81 countries, and 350 federal AMEs (military, U.S. Coast Guard, NASA, and other agencies). The average age of American AME's is almost 60 years old and only 10% that serve are female.http://goflightmedicine.com/become-an-aviation- medical-examiner-today-keep-the-skies-safe/ AMEs in the JAA area Member countries of the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe issue their own medical certificates. Most now do so according to the established guidance provided by JAR-FCL 3 (Medical), in a similar arrangement to the US whereby the local aviation authority in each country appoints AMEs. The JAA regulations prescribe two standards of medical certificate. Class 2 is required for private flying on a PPL and the more stringent class 1 is for professional pilots (CPL or ATPL). An initial Class 1 medical examination must be performed by the Aeromedical Centre (AMC) of the country which will issue the license, but may be renewed by any suitably authorized AME. Medical regulation in the JAA area is expected to gradually change in or after 2008 as the European Aviation Safety Agency takes over responsibility.

Conway leads a unit run in celebration of the Marine Corps birthday. The unit run is a United States military tradition wherein an entire unit (battalion, company or platoon) of service members run in an organized formation along a set route. The run is normally conducted on a military post on streets that are closed to traffic. Many units conduct the unit run before or around sunrise during the week. Distance and pace of the run depend on the terrain, weather, and overall fitness level of the unit. Military units can vary greatly in size. Larger units tend to run slower than smaller groups. However, since the primary purpose of the unit run is the development of esprit de corps, speed is not important. It is considered more important that the group stay together as a coherent formation. Since a large unit can be unwieldy in a single formation, it is normally divided into its constituents (such as companies for a battalion run. In some cases, the companies further organize themselves by platoons). A distinguishing feature of the unit run is the use of the unit's colors at the front of the formation. The Commanding Officer (or next-ranking officer in the commander's absence) will be at the front of the column. The colors will be just behind (and often to the left). It is common for the staff officers to run immediately behind the commander, followed by the smaller unit formations.  Purpose  The established reasons for having a unit run include: * Allowing the commander to assess his troops' physical fitness * Building unit esprit de corps * Physical conditioning Unit runs are often performed to mark an anniversary or holiday, or simply to maintain camaraderie and adhesion within the unit.  Military traditions  Traditions vary among battalions, but the following are some of the most common. *The colors and guidons are carried. Because the run is for purposes of morale and unit pride, the guidon bearer will often run around the formation during the course of the run, holding the guidon high. * Military cadence is sung. The rhythmic, cadenced verse that accompanies military runs is intended to keep all the soldiers running in step at the same pace. During a unit run, those service members who are best at calling cadence are utilized to make the run more fun for the participants and to make a positive impression on leadership.

Nananan is famous for her realistic josei work featuring understated artwork with a sense of detachment. In addition, she has affiliated herself with the \\"La nouvelle manga\\" movement. Her first work was published in Garo in 1993. Three of her works have been made into live-action movies: Blue (2001), Strawberry Shortcakes (2006), and Pumpkin and Mayonnaise (2017). At the Angoulême International Comics Festival 2008, she won the Prix de l'école supérieure de l'image.  Style  Kiriko Nananan says she is obsessed with seeing everything in-between the lines. She uses the spaces in the panels/the backgrounds, as characters to suggest feelings such as hope or emptiness. It is for this reason that, unlike most manga artists, she will not have assistants do the details for her, since the little details play an important role in her stories. She draws each panel so that it can be isolated, like a picture on a poster or T-shirt, rather than drawing/thinking of her manga as a series of boxes. When she draws each panel, she says she sometimes will take even four hours on just one, repeating the same picture dozens of times. Nananan says her stories and characters are only partially fictional, and believe they are all true-to-life. She bases the way the characters think on how she thinks, then links everything together with fictional events. She feels she can't have writing assistants either since she is the only one who can tell her stories.

The option is invoked when the majority leader raises a point of order that contravenes a standing rule, such as that only a simple majority is needed to close debate on certain matters. The presiding officer denies the point of order based on Senate rules, but the ruling of the chair is then appealed and overturned by majority vote, establishing new precedent. This procedure uses Rule XX to allow the Senate to decide any issue by simple majority vote, regardless of Rule XXII, which requires the consent of 60 senators (out of 100) to end a filibuster for legislation and 67 for amending a Senate rule. The term \\"nuclear option\\" is an analogy to nuclear weapons being the most extreme option in warfare. In November 2013, Senate Democrats led by Harry Reid used the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote rule on executive branch nominations and federal judicial appointments, but not for the Supreme Court. In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell extended the nuclear option to Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. As of September 2020, a three-fifths majority vote is still required to end debates on legislation. BackgroundThe 60-vote rule= upright=1.3 Beginning with a rules change in 1806, the Senate did not restrict the total time allowed for debate. In 1917, Rule XXII was amended to allow for ending debate (invoking \\"cloture\\") with a two-thirds majority, later reduced in 1975 to three-fifths of all senators \\"duly chosen and sworn\\" (usually 60). Thus, although a bill might have majority support, a minority of 41 or more senators can still prevent a final vote through endless debate, effectively defeating the bill. This tactic is known as a filibuster. Since the 1970s, the Senate has also used a \\"two-track\\" procedure whereby Senate business may continue on other topics while one item is filibustered. Since filibusters no longer required the minority to actually hold the floor and bring all other business to a halt, the mere threat of a filibuster has gradually become normalized. In the modern Senate, this means that any controversial item now typically requires 60 votes to advance, unless a specific exception limiting the time for debate applies. Changing Rule XXII to eliminate the 60-vote rule is made difficult by the rules themselves. Rule XXII sec. 2 states that to end debate on any proposal \\"to amend the Senate rules...the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.\\" This is typically 67 senators assuming all are voting. Meanwhile, Rule V sec. 2 states that \\"[t]he rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules.\\" These provisions, by themselves, mean that the general 60-vote cloture rule in Rule XXII cannot be modified without the approval of 67 senators. =Rule XX= Although rule XXII requires three-fifths of Senators to close debate, rule XX states that \\"A question of order may be raised at any stage of the proceedings\\" and \\"shall be decided by the Presiding Officer without debate, subject to an appeal to the Senate...and every appeal therefrom shall be decided at once, and without debate\\". =Procedure to invoke the option= The \\"nuclear option\\" is invoked when the presiding officer's enforcement of rule XXII is overruled by the full Senate without debate under rule XX. Without debate, there is no need for a three-fifths majority to end debate. The presiding officer is therefore overruled by a simple majority. Following a failed cloture vote, the majority leader raises a point of order that Rule XXII should be interpreted – or disregarded on constitutional grounds – to require only a simple majority to invoke cloture on a certain type of business, such as nominations. The presiding officer, relying on the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, then denies the point of order based upon rules and precedent. But the ruling of the chair is then appealed, and is overturned by simple majority vote. For example, the option was invoked on November 21, 2013, as follows: > Mr. REID. I raise a point of order that the vote on cloture under rule XXII > for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is > by majority vote. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the rules, the point of > order is not sustained. Mr. REID. I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask > for the yeas and nays. (48–52 vote on upholding ruling of the chair) The > PRESIDENT pro tempore. The decision of the Chair is not sustained. The > PRESIDENT pro tempore. *** Under the precedent set by the Senate today, > November 21, 2013, the threshold for cloture on nominations, not including > those to the Supreme Court of the United States, is now a majority. That is > the ruling of the Chair. A new precedent is thus established allowing for cloture to be invoked by a simple majority on certain types of actions. These and other Senate precedents will then be relied upon by future Parliamentarians in advising the chair, effectively eliminating the 60-vote barrier going forward. (Riddick's Senate Procedure is a compilation by Senate parliamentarians of precedents established throughout the entire history of the Senate by direct rulings of the chair, actions relating to rulings of the chair, or direct Senate action.) =Validity= The legality of the nuclear option has been challenged. For example, then-Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin expressed opposition to the nuclear option in 2005. Successive Congressional Research Service reports have made it clear that the use of the nuclear option would by itself \\"involve violations of Senate rules and practices already in existence\\". However, its validity has not been seriously challenged since being invoked by both parties in 2013 and 2017, at least with regard to invoking cloture on judicial nominations by simple majority vote. =Terminology= Republican Party Senator Ted Stevens suggested using a ruling of the chair to defeat a filibuster of judicial nominees in February 2003. The code word for the plan was \\"Hulk\\". Weeks later, Senator Trent Lott coined the term nuclear option in March 2003 because the maneuver was seen as a last resort with possibly major consequences for both sides. The metaphor of a nuclear strike refers to the majority party unilaterally imposing a change to the filibuster rule, which might provoke retaliation by the minority party. The alternative term \\"constitutional option\\" is often used with particular regard to confirmation of executive and judicial nominations, on the rationale that the United States Constitution requires these nominations to receive the \\"advice and consent\\" of the Senate. Proponents of this term argue that the Constitution implies that the Senate can act by a majority vote unless the Constitution itself requires a supermajority, as it does for certain measures such as the ratification of treaties. By effectively requiring a supermajority of the Senate to fulfill this function, proponents believe that the current Senate practice prevents the body from exercising its constitutional mandate, and that the remedy is therefore the \\"constitutional option\\". HistorySenate rules before 1917= The first set of Senate rules included a procedure to limit debate called \\"moving the previous question.\\" This rule was dropped in 1806 in the misunderstanding that it was redundant. Starting in 1837, senators began taking advantage of this gap in the rules by giving lengthy speeches so as to prevent specific measures they opposed from being voted on, a procedure called filibustering. In 1890, Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich threatened to break a Democratic filibuster of a Federal Election Bill (which would ban any prohibitions on the black vote) by invoking a procedure called \\"appeal from the chair.\\" At this time, there was no cloture rule or other regular method to force an immediate vote. Aldrich's plan was to demand an immediate vote by making a point of order. If, as expected, the presiding officer overrules the point, Aldrich would then appeal the ruling and the appeal would be decided by a majority vote of the Senate. If a majority voted to limit debate, a precedent would have been established to allow debate to be limited by majority vote. Aldrich's plan was procedurally similar to the modern option. In the end, the Democrats were able to muster a majority to table the bill, so neither Aldrich's proposed point of order nor his proposed appeal was ever actually moved. In 1892, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Ballin that both houses of Congress are parliamentary bodies, implying that they may make procedural rules by majority vote. =Early cloture era, 1917–1974= The history of the constitutional option can be traced to a 1917 opinion by Senator Thomas J. Walsh (Democrat of Montana). Walsh contended that the U.S. Constitution provided the basis by which a newly commenced Senate could disregard procedural rules established by previous Senates, and had the right to choose its own procedural rules based on a simple majority vote despite the two-thirds requirement in the rules. \\"When the Constitution says, 'Each House may determine its rules of proceedings,' it means that each House may, by a majority vote, a quorum present, determine its rules,\\" Walsh told the Senate. Opponents countered that Walsh's constitutional option would lead to procedural chaos, but his argument was a key factor in the adoption of the first cloture rule later that year. In 1957, Vice President Richard Nixon (and thus President of the Senate) wrote an advisory opinion that no Senate may constitutionally enact a rule that deprives a future Senate of the right to approve its own rules by the vote of a simple majority.See 103 Cong. Rec. 178–79 (1957) (statement of Vice President Nixon). (Nixon made clear that he was speaking for himself only, not making a formal ruling.Betsy Palmer, Changing Senate Rules: The “Constitutional” or “Nuclear” Option, Congressional Research Service report no. RL32684, updated April 5, 2005, p. CRS-4.) Nixon's opinion, along with similar opinions by Hubert Humphrey and Nelson Rockefeller, has been cited as precedent to support the view that the Senate may amend its rules at the beginning of the session with a simple majority vote.See Christopher M. Davis and Betsy Palmer, Proposals to Amend the Cloture Rule, CRS Report RL32149 (Feb. 17, 2005), at 5–6 PDF. The option was officially moved by Democratic Party Senators Clinton P. Anderson (1963), George McGovern (1967), and Frank Church (1969), but was defeated or tabled by the Senate each time. =60-vote rule takes hold, 1975–2004= A series of votes in 1975 have been cited as a precedent for the nuclear option, although some of these were reconsidered shortly thereafter. According to one account, the option was arguably endorsed by the Senate three times in 1975 during a debate concerning the cloture requirement. A compromise was reached to reduce the cloture requirement from two-thirds of those voting (67 votes if 100 Senators were present) to three-fifths of the current Senate (60 votes if there were no current vacancies) and also to approve a point of order revoking the earlier three votes in which the Constitutional option had been invoked. (This was an effort to reverse the precedent that had been set for cloture by majority vote). Senator Robert Byrd was later able to effect changes in Senate procedures by majority vote four times when he was majority leader without the support of two-thirds of senators present and voting (which would have been necessary to invoke cloture on a motion for an amendment to the Rules): to ban post-cloture filibustering (1977), to adopt a rule to limit amendments to an appropriations bill (1979), to allow a senator to make a non-debatable motion to bring a nomination to the floor (1980), and to ban filibustering during a roll call vote (1987). However, none of these procedural changes affected the ultimate ability of a 41-vote minority to block final action on a matter before the Senate via filibuster. =2005 debate on judicial nominations= The maneuver was brought to prominence in 2005 when Majority Leader Bill Frist (Republican of Tennessee) threatened its use to end Democratic-led filibusters of judicial nominees submitted by President George W. Bush. In response to this threat, Democrats threatened to shut down the Senate and prevent consideration of all routine and legislative Senate business. The ultimate confrontation was prevented by the Gang of 14, a group of seven Democratic and seven Republican Senators, all of whom agreed to oppose the nuclear option and oppose filibusters of judicial nominees, except in extraordinary circumstances. Several of the blocked nominees were brought to the floor, voted upon and approved as specified in the agreement, and others were dropped and did not come up for a vote, as implied by the agreement. =Minor rules reforms, 2011 and 2013= In 2011, with a Democratic majority in the Senate (but not a supermajority), Senators Jeff Merkley and Tom Udall proposed \\"a sweeping filibuster reform package\\" to be implemented via the constitutional option but Majority Leader Harry Reid dissuaded them from pushing it forward. In October 2011, however, Reid triggered a more modest change in Senate precedents. In a 51-48 vote, the Senate prohibited any motion to waive the rules after a filibuster is defeated, although this change did not affect the ultimate ability of a 41-vote minority to block final action via an initial filibuster. The nuclear option was raised again following the congressional elections of 2012, this time with Senate Democrats in the majority (but short of a supermajority). The Democrats had been the majority party in the Senate since 2007 but only briefly did they have the 60 votes necessary to halt a filibuster. The Hill reported that Democrats would \\"likely\\" use the nuclear option in January 2013 to effect filibuster reform, but the two parties managed to negotiate two packages of amendments to the Rules concerning filibusters that passed on January 24, 2013, by votes of 78 to 16 and 86 to 9, thus avoiding the need for the nuclear option. In the end, negotiation between the two parties resulted in two packages of \\"modest\\" amendments to the rules on filibusters that were approved by the Senate on January 24, 2013, without triggering the nuclear option. Changes to the standing orders affecting just the 2013-14 Congress were passed by a vote of 78 to 16, eliminating the minority party's right to filibuster a bill as long as each party has been permitted to present at least two amendments to the bill. Changes to the permanent Senate rules were passed by a vote of 86 to 9. In July 2013, the nuclear option was raised as nominations were being blocked by Senate Republicans as Senate Democrats prepared to push through a change to the chamber’s filibuster rule. On July 16, the Senate Democratic majority came within hours of using the nuclear option to win confirmation of seven of President Obama's long-delayed executive branch appointments. The confrontation was avoided when the White House withdrew two of the nominations in exchange for the other five being brought to the floor for a vote, where they were confirmed. Use in 2013 and 20172013: Nominations except Supreme Court= On November 21, 2013, the Senate voted 52–48, with all Republicans and three Democrats voting against (Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas), to rule that \\"the vote on cloture under Rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote,\\" even though the text of the rule requires \\"three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn\\" to end debate. This ruling's precedent eliminated the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster against all executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the Supreme Court. The text of Rule XXII was never changed. A 3/5 supermajority was still required to end filibusters unrelated to those nominees, such as for legislation and Supreme Court nominees.Ryan Grim; Michael McAuliff (2013-11-21). \\"Senate Votes For Nuclear Option\\". Huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved 2013-11-21. Rationale for change The Democrats' stated motivation for this change was expansion of filibustering by Republicans during the Obama administration, in particular blocking three nominations to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Republicans had asserted that the D.C. Circuit was underworked, and also cited the need for cost reduction by reducing the number of judges in that circuit. At the time of the vote, 59 executive branch nominees and 17 judicial nominees were awaiting confirmation. Prior to November 21, 2013, in the entire history of the nation there had been only 168 cloture motions filed (or reconsidered) with regard to nominations. Nearly half of them (82) had been during the Obama Administration,Richard S. Beth and Elizabeth Rybicki. \\"Nominations with Cloture Motions\\". Congressional Research Service (November 21, 2013). but those cloture motions were often filed merely to speed things along, rather than in response to any filibuster.Kessler, Glenn. \\"Has Mitch McConnell ‘blocked the Senate’ over 400 times?\\", The Washington Post (October 29, 2013): > Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) often files cloture on multiple > bills or nominations at once to speed things along even if no one is slowing > things down....A number of the cloture motions that Reid has filed were > intended to speed things up, to suit his parliamentary preferences.... In contrast, there were just 38 cloture motions on nominations during the preceding eight years under President George W. Bush.Hook, Janet and Peterson, Kristina. \\"Senate Adopts New Rules on Filibusters\\", The Wall Street Journal (November 21, 2013). Most of those cloture votes successfully ended debate, and therefore most of those nominees cleared the hurdle. Obama won Senate confirmation for 30 out of 42 federal appeals court nominations, compared with Bush's 35 out of 52.\\"Do Obama Nominees Face Stiffer Senate Opposition?\\", The Wall Street Journal (November 21, 2013). Regarding Obama's federal district court nominations, the Senate approved 143 out of 173 as of November 2013, compared to George W. Bush's first term 170 of 179, Bill Clinton's first term 170 of 198, and George H.W. Bush's 150 of 195.McMillion, Barry. \\"President Obama’s First-Term U.S. Circuit and District Court Nominations: An Analysis and Comparison with Presidents Since Reagan\\", Congressional Research Service (May 2, 2013). Filibusters were used on 20 Obama nominations to U.S. District Court positions,\\"Senate Votes For Nuclear Option\\", The Huffington Post (November 21, 2013). but Republicans had allowed confirmation of 19 out of the 20 before the nuclear option was invoked.Kamen, Al. \\"Filibuster reform may not open confirmation floodgates\\", The Washington Post (November 22, 2013). =2017: Supreme Court nominations= On April 6, 2017, Senate Republicans invoked the nuclear option to remove the Supreme Court exception created in 2013. This was after Senate Democrats filibustered the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States, after the Senate Republicans had previously refused to take up Merrick Garland's nomination by President Obama in 2016. Proposed use for legislation Following elimination of the 60-vote rule for nominations in 2017, senators expressed concerns that the 60-vote rule will eventually be eliminated for legislation via the nuclear option. =Donald Trump= President Donald Trump has spoken out against the 60-vote requirement for legislation on several occasions. On January 21, 2018, President Trump said on Twitter that if the shutdown stalemate continued, Republicans should consider the \\"nuclear option\\" in the Senate. He repeated the call on December 21, 2018 with a fresh shutdown looming. Policy argumentsIssues= Policy debates surrounding the nuclear option – a tool to implement a rule change – are closely related to arguments regarding the 60-vote requirement imposed by Rule XXII. Issues include: *whether a simple majority of the Senate should be able to confirm a judicial nominee or pass a bill; *whether a three-fifths vote (60/100) should be required for cloture, as required by Rule XXII; *whether the rule should differ for nominations vs. legislation; and *whether the Constitution mandates either threshold. =Constitutional provisions= The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly address how many votes are required for passage of a bill or confirmation of a nominee. Regarding nominations, Article II, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution says the president \\"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges....\\" The Constitution includes several explicit supermajority rules, including requiring a two-thirds majority in the Senate for impeachment, confirming treaties, overturn a vetoLII: Constitution. expelling one of its members,LII: Constitution. and concurring in the proposal of Constitutional Amendments.LII: Constitution. =Arguments for simple majority=Constitutional argument Supporters of a simple majority standard argue that the Constitution's silence implies that a simple majority is sufficient; they contrast this with Article II's language for Senate confirmation of treaties. Regarding nominations, they argue that the Appointments Clause's lack of a supermajority requirement is evidence that the Framers consciously rejected such a requirement. They also argue that the general rule of parliamentary systems \\"is that majorities govern in a legislative body, unless another rule is expressly provided.\\" From this, supporters argue that a simple-majority rule would bring current practices into line with the Framers' original intent – hence supporters' preferred nomenclature of the \\"constitutional option\\". They argue that the filibuster of presidential nominees effectively establishes a 60-vote threshold for approval of judicial nominees instead of the 51-vote standard implied by the Constitution. A number of existing Judges and Justices were confirmed with fewer than 60 votes, including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas (confirmed in a 52–48 vote in 1991). Obstruction Supporters have claimed that the minority party is engaged in obstruction. In 2005, Republicans argued that Democrats obstructed the approval of the president's nominees in violation of the intent of the U.S. Constitution. President Bush had nominated forty-six candidates to federal appeals courts. Thirty-six were confirmed. 10 were blocked and 7 were renominated in Spring 2005. Democrats responded that 63 of President Clinton's 248 nominees were blocked via procedural means at the committee level, denying them a confirmation vote and leaving the positions available for Bush to fill.Congressional Record – 108th Congress (2003–2004) – THOMAS (Library of Congress). Thomas.loc.gov (2003-09-30). Retrieved on 2013-11-21.Judicial nominee logjam? Change the rules.. CSMonitor.com. Retrieved on 2013-11-21. Majority rule In 2005, pro-nuclear option Republicans argued that they had won recent elections and in a democracy the winners rule, not the minority. They also argued that while the Constitution requires supermajorities for some purposes (such as 2/3 needed to ratify a treaty), the Founders did not require a supermajority for confirmations, and that the Constitution thus presupposes a majority vote for confirmations. =Arguments for 60-vote rule=Constitutional arguments Proponents of the 60-vote rule point out that while the Constitution requires two-thirds majorities for actions such as treaty ratification and proposed constitutional amendments, it is silent on other matters. Instead, Article I, Section V of the Constitution permits and mandates that each house of Congress establish its own rules. Regarding nominations, they contend that the word \\"Advice\\" in the Constitution refers to consultation between the Senate and the President with regard to the use of the President's power to make nominations. Tradition Supporters of the right to filibuster argue that the Senate has a long tradition of requiring broad support to do business, due in part to the threat of the filibuster, and that this protects the minority. Starting with the first Senate in 1789, the rules left no room for a filibuster; a simple majority could move to bring the matter to a vote. However, in 1806, the rule allowing a majority to bring the previous question ceased to exist. The filibuster became possible, and since any Senator could now block a vote, 100% support was required to bring the matter to a vote. A rule change in 1917 introduced cloture, permitting a two-thirds majority of those present to end debate, and a further change in 1975 reduced the cloture requirement to three-fifths of the entire Senate. Majority rule Proponents of the 60-vote rule have argued that the Senate is a less-than-democratic body that could conceivably allow a simple majority of senators, representing a minority of the national population, to enact legislation or confirm appointees lacking popular support. Ensuring broad support In 2005, Democrats claimed the nuclear option was an attempt by Senate Republicans to hand confirmation power to themselves. Rather than require the President to nominate someone who will get broad support in the Senate, the nuclear option would allow Judges to not only be \\"nominated to the Court by a Republican president, but also be confirmed by only Republican Senators in party-line votes.\\"Home  Al Gore 2008 Draft Campaign.Democratic Leader Harry Reid's Letter to Bill Frist . Of the 9 U.S. Supreme Court Justices seated as of May 2005, 6 were confirmed with the support of 90 or more Senators, 2 were confirmed with at least the support of 60 senators, and only 1 (Thomas) was confirmed with the support of fewer than 60 Senators, however, since John G. Roberts was confirmed, no candidate has gotten more than 68 votes. Conservative nominees for Appellate Courts that were given a vote through the \\"Gang of 14\\" were confirmed almost exclusively along party lines: Priscilla Owen was confirmed 55–43, Janice Rogers Brown was confirmed 56–43, and William Pryor was confirmed 53–45. Public opinion In 2005, polling indicated public support for an active Senate role in its \\"advise and consent\\" capacity. An Associated Press-Ipsos poll released May 20, 2005, found 78 percent of Americans believe the Senate should take an \\"assertive role\\" examining judicial nominees rather than just give the president the benefit of the doubt. The agreement to stave off the \\"nuclear option\\" reached by 14 moderate Senators supports a strong interpretation of \\"Advice and Consent\\" from the Constitution: Court-packing Some fear that removing the 60-vote rule for judicial nominations would allow the courts to be \\"packed\\" by a party that controls the other two branches of the government. As of November 2013, Republican presidents have appointed five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court and all four of the chief justices since the Truman administration. In 1937, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat, sought to alter the court through the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 (a.k.a. \\"the court-packing plan\\"). Noting that the Constitution does not specify a number of Supreme Court justices, the bill would have added a seat for every justice over the age of 70½, creating a new majority on the Court. Roosevelt allowed the bill to be scuttled after Justice Owen Roberts began upholding the constitutionality of his New Deal programs. Elimination of the 60-vote rule is a significantly less drastic strategy, only allowing the majority to fill existing vacancies on the Court. However, if the two strategies are combined, a party that controls the Presidency and has a simple majority in the Senate, as FDR's Democrats did in 1937, could quickly gain control of the Court as well. =Opportunism= In general, senators from both parties have been very opportunistic in making these policy arguments. Senators in the majority often argue for simple majority rule, especially for nominations, while senators in the minority nearly always defend the 60-vote rule. However, since a simple-majority rule for nominations was progressively adopted in 2013 and 2017, a significant bipartisan majority remains opposed to eliminating the 60-vote rule for legislation. Examples of opportunism abound. In 2005 Republicans pointed out that several Democrats once opposed the filibuster on judicial nominees, and only recently changed their views as they had no other means of stopping Bush's judicial appointees. However, Republicans were staunch supporters of the filibuster when they were a minority party and frequently employed it to block legislation. Republicans continued to support the filibuster for general legislation – the Republican leadership insisted that the proposed rule change would only affect judicial nominations. According to the Democrats, arguments that a simple majority should prevail apply equally well to all votes where the Constitution does not specify a three-fifths majority. Republicans stated that there is a difference between the filibustering of legislation – which affects only the Senate's own constitutional prerogative to consider new laws – and the filibustering of a President's judicial or executive nominees, which arguably impinges on the constitutional powers of the Executive branch. Other uses of \\"nuclear option\\" Beyond the specific context of U.S. federal judicial appointments, the term \\"nuclear option\\" has come to be used generically for a procedural maneuver with potentially serious consequences, to be used as a last resort to overcome political opposition. In a 2005 legal ruling on the validity of the Hunting Act 2004Jackson and others v. Her Majesty's Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56, 13 October 2005 the UK House of Lords used \\"nuclear option\\" to describe the events of 1832, when the then-government threatened to create hundreds of new Whig peers to force the Tory-dominated Lords to accept the Reform Act 1832. (Nuclear weapons were not theorized until the 20th century, so the government's threat was not labeled as \\"nuclear\\" at the time.) The term is also used in connection with procedural maneuvers in various state senates. The nuclear option is not to be confused with reconciliation, which allows issues related to the annual budget to be decided by a majority vote without the possibility of filibuster.McClatchy: Here's how 'reconciliation' works in Congress.

Biography Frédéric Boilet in October, 2007. Frédéric Boilet's debut in comic art was in 1983 with La Nuit des Archées. He created Le Rayon vert in 1987, followed by 36 15 Alexia in 1990, two albums where he experimented with a method of working, that is still uniquely his today, in which he resorts almost exclusively to photographs and video. His encounter with Benoît Peeters in 1990 turned his work toward semi- autobiographical stories tinged with humour : Love Hotel (1993), Tôkyô est mon jardin (1997) and Demi-tour (1997). For some years Boilet lived in Japan, where Tôkyô est mon jardin, meaning \\"Tokyo is my garden,\\" was translated in 1998 and Demi-tour the following year., http://www.boilet.net/am/biographie.html. He started doing work for manga magazines in the late nineties, and was a rare example of a western comics artist having some degree of success in the Japanese market. In 2001, on the occasion of the simultaneous publication in France and Japan of the critically acclaimed Yukiko's Spinach, he launched the Nouvelle Manga movement in Tokyo, which sought to combine mature sophisticated daily life manga with the artistic style of traditional Franco-Belgian comics. Boilet's final production work was L'apprenti Japonais. Boilet claims to have finished his editorial career with this work, a book of unused drawings from the twelve years spanning from 1996 to 2008 all concerning the time he had spent in Japan. He now resides again in his native France.

She is best known as the voice of the villainous, selfish socialite Cruella de Vil from Walt Disney's animated film, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) for which she was named a Disney Legend in 1996. Life and careerEarly life= Gerson was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on April 20, 1914, but raised in Birmingham, Alabama, where her father was an executive with a steel company. She was Jewish. She was educated in private schools in Birmingham and Miami, Florida. At age 16, she moved with her family to Chicago, where she performed in the radio serial The First Nighter Program. She later moved to New York City. =Radio and film= She began her acting career in radio drama in 1935, while still in her 20s, and became a mainstay of soap operas during this period, appearing on Arnold Grimm's Daughter (as the titular daughter Constance in 1938), Midstream (in the lead role of Julia), Women in White (as Karen Adams), Road of Life (as Nurse Helen Gowan), Lonely Women (as Marilyn Larimore), and the radio version of The Guiding Light, as Charlotte Wilson in the mid-1940s. She co-starred with Jim Ameche in the 1938 summer drama Win Your Lady and was the resident romantic lead on romantic anthologies such as Curtain Time and Grand Hotel. Moving to Los Angeles in the 1940s, she established herself on series such as The Whistler, Mr. President (as the presidential secretary), Crime Classics, Escape, and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar. She was heard in several episodes of Lux Radio Theater, cast in such roles as Glinda in a 1950 dramatization of The Wizard of Oz. She also played a variety of roles on Johnny Modero, Pier 23. In an early example of the comic genius that her Cruella later showcased, she parodied her main radio persona in the Sam Spade detective series, \\"The Soap Opera Caper\\" episode which aired on February 16, 1951. Around this time, she was cast as the narrator in Walt Disney's animated version of Cinderella (1950). Eleven years later, she provided the voice of the villainous, selfish socialite Cruella de Vil in Disney's animated feature One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Her few on-camera film roles include appearances in The Fly (1958), The Miracle on the Hills (1959), and Mary Poppins (1964) in a small cameo as an old crone. In television, she made three guest appearances on Perry Mason, including the role of murderer Marjory Davis in the episode, \\"The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll\\" (1959). She also guest starred on The Twilight Zone, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Hazel, Wanted Dead or Alive, and The Rifleman. =Family and later life= In 1936, Gerson married Joseph T. Ainley at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago. At that time, he was radio director of the Leo Burnett Company, Incorporated. The couple remained married until his death in 1965. The union was childless. Gerson retired in 1966, though still using her voice, working at the telephone answering service of her second husband, Louis R. \\"Lou\\" Lauria, to whom she was married from 1966 until his death in 1994. That union was also childless. She was honored as a Disney Legend in 1996. She returned to films one last time in 1997, providing the voice of Frances in Cats Don't Dance. Death Gerson died from a stroke in Los Angeles on January 12, 1999, at the age of 84.

It has become one of the premier film festivals for independent and, especially, experimental filmmakers to showcase their work. Now entering its 55th year, the Ann Arbor Film Festival attracts over 3,000 entries from filmmakers in more than 60 countries, and distributes over $20,000 in cash awards. As a pioneer of the traveling festival concept in 1964, each year the Ann Arbor Film Festival Tour continues to present a collection of short films at more than 30 art house theaters, universities, galleries and cinematheques throughout the world. Created as an alternative to commercial cinema, the annual week-long festival remains true to its original mission of promoting film as an art form. The Ann Arbor Film Festival also fosters the growth of emerging and established film and video makers. The festival is open to film and video of all lengths and genres, including experimental, narrative, animation, documentary, and genre hybrids. The mission of the Ann Arbor Film Festival is to promote bold, visionary filmmakers through the advancement of film and new media art, and to engage communities with remarkable cinematic experiences. History The Ann Arbor Film Festival was founded in 1963 by University of Michigan professor George Manupelli. Manupelli originally screened only films in the 16 mm format, and thus the festival was called the 16 mm Film Festival. The festival gained prominence quickly, as it was one of the few outlets for experimental filmmakers to screen their work. In 1980 the festival moved from Lorch Hall on the University of Michigan campus to the Michigan Theater, an Ann Arbor landmark with a seating capacity of 1700. In 1983, after becoming independent from the University of Michigan, the festival became a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. In 2003 the festival began accepting entries in digital formats, opening up the festival to more filmmakers. In 2007 the festival was named one of Variety magazine's \\"Top Ten Festivals We Love.\\" In 2020 due to the COVID-19 Outbreak, the festival moved to streaming online for free, rather than showing at the Michigan Theater. Since its inception, thousands of influential filmmakers and artists have showcased early work at the AAFF, including luminaries such as Kenneth Anger, Agnès Varda, Andy Warhol, Yoko Ono, Gus Van Sant, Barbara Hammer, Lawrence Kasdan, Devo and George Lucas.

It lies on the south wall of Yosemite Valley, southwest of Glacier Point and northeast of Profile Cliff. Sentinel Dome is known for a Jeffrey Pine that grew from its peak (see photograph). The pine was photographed as early as 1867 by Carleton Watkins, and was the subject of a well-known photograph by Ansel Adams. The tree died during the drought of 1976, but remained standing until August 2003. History The iconic Jeffrey Pine photographed August 7, 1968. The tree formerly stood atop Sentinel Dome The original Native American name of Sentinel Dome, in the Southern Sierra Miwok language, was \\"Sakkaduch\\". The Bunnell survey named it \\"South Dome\\", but the Whitney survey renamed it Sentinel Dome (from its likeness to a watch-tower). The view from the top offers a 360 degree view of Yosemite Valley and surroundings. One can see Half Dome, El Capitan, Yosemite Falls, North Dome, Basket Dome, and much more. Sentinel Dome provides a 360 degree view of the night sky and it and nearby Glacier Point are popular places for stargazing. Hiking trail The trail to the base of Sentinel Dome is a relatively easy hike. The trailhead, the same as the Taft Point trailhead, is located from Bridalveil Creek on the Glacier Point road. Once at the base, hikers traverse the less imposing northeast granite slope to the summit. In winter, Sentinel Dome can be reached from Badger Pass by a 10-miles ski tour.

The stadium was named after the Peruvian mestizo Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and inaugurated in 1960, with an initial capacity of 30,000. It is owned by the Instituto Peruano del Deporte (Peruvian Institute of Sport).¿Reabrirán el estadio Garcilaso del Cusco? Retrieved 17 June 2018 The increase in spectator capacity came after CONMEBOL chose Peru to host the Copa América 2004, prompting the Peruvian government to invest in a five-million dollar renovation program for its stadia, including the Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega. Its renovation cost approximately $1,720,000, which helped boost its official spectator capacity to 42,056. The stadium ended up hosting the third place game of the Copa América 2004. Thanks to the event, the city of Cusco received even more tourists than it already receives as Peru's top tourist destination. The Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega is also recognized as one of the most beautiful stadiums in all of South America. This recognition is due to its well-maintained grass and its resistance to the sometimes aggressive and highly variable climate of the city of Cuzco. The awe is the stadium's perpetual beauty even after these climates. It is this resistive beauty that inspires soccer commentators and visitors alike. The stadium is currently home to three football clubs. The first two original clubs since the 1950s are Cienciano of the Peruvian Primera Division and Deportivo Garcilaso of the Copa Perú, and the third is Cusco FC, also of the Peruvian Primera División. center See also * Peru national football team * List of Peruvian stadiums ReferencesExternal links * Peruvian Soccer Federation (in Spanish) Category:Football venues in Peru Estadio Garcilaso Category:Copa América stadiums Category:Sports venues completed in 1950 Estadio Garcilaso ","title":"Estadio Garcilaso"},{"id":"1612471","text":"You're in the Picture is an American television game show that aired on CBS for only one episode on Friday, January 20, 1961 at 9:30pm, the evening of the Inauguration of John F. Kennedy. The show, created by Don Lipp and Bob Synes, was an attempt by its host and star Jackie Gleason to \\"demonstrate versatility\\" after his success within variety shows and The Honeymooners. Gleason was joined by Johnny Olson as announcer and Dennis James doing live commercials for sponsor Kellogg's cereals. Technically, the show could be said to have run for two episodes, since the following Friday, Gleason appeared at the same time, but in a studio \\"stripped to the brick walls\\" and using the time to give what Time magazine called an \\"inspiring post-mortem\\", asking rhetorically \\"how it was possible for a group of trained people to put on so big a flop.\\" Time later cited You're in the Picture as one piece of evidence that the 1960-61 TV season was the \\"worst in the 13-year history of U.S. network television.\\" Gameplay A four-member celebrity panel would stick their heads into a life-sized illustration of a famous scene or song lyric with a hole cut out, then take turns asking yes/no questions to Gleason to try to figure out what scene they were a part of. If they were able to figure out the scene, 100 CARE Packages were donated in their name; if they were stumped, the packages were donated in Gleason's name. Live music was provided by a Dixieland band (supposedly arranged by Gleason himself, who had some experience in easy listening arrangements outside his television work) under the direction of Norman Leyden. =Panelists= The celebrity panel for the premiere consisted of Pat Harrington Jr., Pat Carroll, Jan Sterling, and Arthur Treacher. Among the tableaux-like backdrops featured in the premiere were a scene of Pocahontas saving John Smith, a depiction of four playing cards, and a scene of high school hurdlers in a track meet. Apology The debut of You're in the Picture received negative reviews across the board. The following Friday (January 27), instead of the game, the broadcast consisted of Gleason sitting alone in a chair on the now-bare stage apologizing for the previous week's show. Stating that the series failed because of \\"the intangibles of show business\\", Gleason also noted that more than three hundred combined years' worth of show business experience had been involved in the production. Gleason commented that the program \\"laid, without a doubt, the biggest bomb in history\\", adding that it \\"would make the H-Bomb look like a two-inch salute.\\" Acknowledging the critics, he also stated that, \\"You don't have to be Alexander Graham Bell to pick up the phone and find out it's dead.\\" Gleason included some topical remarks in the opening moments of the apology, joking that he had been set to go watch the Los Angeles Open golf tournament that was held on January 8, 1961, Gleason implied that it would have been more enjoyable to watch Arnold Palmer struggle on the 18th hole at Rancho Park where he took a 12 or that he could have gone on a cruise on a Portuguese ship and been spared from hosting the show, referencing the Santa Maria hijacking. Gleason also recalled other flops he was involved in adding at one point, \\"I wish I didn't know so much about these things\\". He then brought out the John Smith/Pocahontas illustration to show what the format for the game was for those, \\"fortunate enough not to see last week's show\\". Gleason also fulfilled contractual obligations by incorporating live commercials into the broadcast. He noted that nobody commented on the quality of the show was after it finished airing, instead mentioning how good the commercials were and that the show went off the air at the right time. Gleason ended his commentary with, \\"I'm coming back next week! I don't know what we're gonna do ... so, take my word for it ... tune in on the next chapter, because this might be the greatest 'soapless' opera you've ever seen!\\". This comical half-hour apology got much better reviews than the game show. Gleason finished out his series commitment by renaming the program The Jackie Gleason Show and turning it into a talk/interview show, which lasted until March 24, 1961. Shortly after the series commitment was completed, CBS picked up on a more permanent basis another talk/variety program from Gleason, American Scene Magazine, which would run from 1962 to 1970. However, due to a moment during the apology in which Gleason hinted that the coffee cup he was sipping from wasn't really filled with \\"coffee\\" (he called it \\"Chock Full O'Booze\\"), the show's original sponsor, Kellogg's, pulled out of the series a week later and publicly claimed, \\"This isn't the show we bought\\". They reportedly told CBS executives they were offended by the coffee cup reference, and wanted no further association with the show or Gleason. However, Liggett & Myers, the show's alternate sponsor, continued with the series until it ended. The supposedly \\"spiked\\" cup of coffee was a running gag Gleason often used as part of the monologue of his variety shows. Reception Upon the premiere, the game show received extremely negative reviews. In 2002, TV Guide ranked the series number 9 on its \\"50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\\" list. In his book What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History, author David Hofstede ranked the show at number 4 on the list. Episode status Both the premiere and Gleason's apology exist and are available for viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City. Both appear to be from the original broadcasts, as both have the original commercials intact. The apology episode is widely circulated on video-sharing sites like YouTube. In an October 18, 1985, Tonight Show interview with Gleason, Johnny Carson stated that he appeared on the program; surviving clips do not show him involved, however.Gleason's big bomb! Television's Most Forgotten Show?, a tvparty.com article on the program, including links to clips. Pat Carroll confirmed that Carson had been involved in an episode but stated he left before taping: \\"Johnny Carson was supposed to be on it. But he did one rehearsal and we never saw him again. He knew better than we did. Ha!\\" Rumors of a second episode being taped but never aired appear to be untrue, as Carroll stated that she and the other panelists were ready to go on stage to tape the second episode but wound up instead being a backstage witness to the apology, causing her to wonder why she was even in the studio in the first place. Similar guessing games The concept of a contestant putting his or her head through a hole in a portrait and trying to guess the picture was attempted again for a 2013 episode of the UK panel show Celebrity Juice. The Dutch television game show De Jongens tegen de Meisjes also includes a challenge in which the celebrity candidates have to guess who they are by asking their team members yes-no questions about their identity.

The highway serves as the primary corridor through Algonquin Provincial Park, where it is dedicated as the Frank McDougall Parkway. East of Algonquin Park, the route serves east–west traffic in the highlands of central Ontario. It begins at Highway 11 in Huntsville and ends at Highway 17 near Renfrew. Highway 60 was designated in 1937 between Huntsville and Lake Dore, near where it met Highway 41\\\\. During the 1940s, the route shared a common termini with Highway 41 at Golden Lake. When Highway 41 was extended north to Pembroke in 1957, Highway 60 was routed along it between Golden Lake and Eganville. It was extended east to Highway 17 in downtown Renfrew circa 1961. It was extended further east when Highway 17 was rerouted around Renfrew in 1977, establishing the current route.  Route description  Highway 60 and Algonquin Park are renowned for their autumn displays. Highway 60 begins at an interchange with Highway 11 in Huntsville. It crosses through central Ontario in a generally east–west orientation. The triangle-shaped area bounded by Highways 11, 17 and 60 is largely uninhabited wilderness dotted with lakes and muskeg. East of Huntsville, Highway 60 meanders east then south through the northeastern corner of Muskoka District, meeting Highway 35 at Dwight. It travels northeast from there, briefly passing through Haliburton County before crossing into Nipissing District and entering Algonquin Park. An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not required to drive through Algonquin Park. However, one is required for the use of any trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose and deer are very common through Algonquin, especially at night and in the morning, and present a major driving hazard. The journey through Algonquin Park offers some of the most famous scenery in Canada, including vistas of numerous lakes and geological formations that have been captured in the arts of Group of Seven painter Tom Thomson among others. The park is considered the most important place in Canada for biological and environmental research. Highway 60 between Barry's Bay and Whitney. Highway 60 exits the park in the Township of South Algonquin travelling south into Whitney, curving east and intersecting Highway 127\\\\. Beyond Highway 127, it passes through the Madawaska Highlands, following the historic Opeongo Line. It passes through Madawaska, encountering Secondary Highway 523, then curves southeast into Renfrew County. The route enters Barry's Bay, where it turns east and meets the southern leg of former Highway 62, where a concurrency with it began prior to 1998. After passing through Wilno, the route curves northeast around Killaloe, intersecting the northern leg of former Highway 62 and Highway 512. Continuing around Golden Lake and through the village of the same name, Highway 60 travels southeast into the Ottawa Valley towards Eganville, where it has a concurrency with Highway 41\\\\. For the remainder of the route, the highway travels near the Bonnechere River. It continues east then south to Douglas, where drivers must turn northeast to continue along the highway. Highway 60 slowly curves southeast before entering the town of Renfrew, where it is known as Stewart Street, Bridge Street, Raglan Street South, Veterans Memorial Boulevard and O'Brien Road. It encounters the eastern terminus of Highway 132 before curving east to end at Highway 17 on the outskirts of the town.  History  Highway 60 through Algonquin Park circa 1950 Highway 60 was assumed on April 1, 1937, when the Department of Northern Development was amalgamated by the Department of Highways (DHO). At that time, the highway ended in Lake Dore, north of Eganville and was long. Highway 41 travelled along the portion of what is now Highway 60 between Eganville and Golden Lake. The route was shortened by to create a shared terminus with Highway 41 between 1942 and 1949. On April 11, 1957, the Eganville–Pembroke Road was assumed as an extension of Highway 41, with the former portion of the route between Eganville and Golden Lake being renumbered as part of Highway 60. Highway 60 was extended to Highway 17 near Rosebank, north of Renfrew, circa 1961. With the construction of the Renfrew Bypass, which began in June 1974, and was completed in 1977, the section of Highway 17 between O'Brien Road east of Renfrew and Haley Road north of Haley Station was renumbered as an extension of Highway 60, establishing the current route of the highway. In 1976, the section through Algonquin Park was dedicated in honour of the 35 years of service by Frank Archibald MacDougall: ten years as park superintendent and 25 as Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests. It is signed as the Frank MacDougall Parkway.

This was similar to the final alignment, with stations at Sai Ying Pun, Belcher and Kennedy Town. In revisions in 2003 and 2004, the West Island Line became its own line, which would interchange with the Island Line at Sheung Wan or Sai Ying Pun. On 28 May 2004, planning for the line was deferred. =Final scheme= Alignment of the final scheme On 25 February 2005, the Panel of Transport of Legislative Council had a meeting discussing the West and South Island Lines. MTR submitted a revised scheme on 22 February. An introduction to the scheme was conducted in the meeting. In the scheme, the West Island Line included only the extension to Island Line. The rest became the west section of South Island Line.

The play won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Production The play premiered at The Center for the Performing Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on December 31, 1990, before moving to Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on February 21, 1991, where it ran for 780 performances and eleven previews. Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by Gene Saks, the cast included Jamie Marsh as Jay, Irene Worth as Grandma, Mercedes Ruehl as Bella, Kevin Spacey as Louie, Lauren Klein as Gert, Danny Gerard as Arty, and Mark Blum as Eddie. Plot Brooklyn, 1942, Evelyn Kurnitz has just died following a lengthy illness. Her husband, Eddie Kurnitz, needs to take a job as a traveling salesman to pay off the medical bills incurred, and decides to ask his stern and straight talking mother, from whom he is slightly estranged, if his two early-teen sons, Jay and Arty (who their Grandma insists on calling by their full given names, Jacob and Arthur, which she pronounces \\"Yakob\\" and \\"Artur\\"), can live with her and their Aunt Bella Kurnitz in Yonkers. She refuses. After a threat by Bella, she lets them stay without ever saying they could stay. Despite their Grandma owning and operating a candy store, Jay and Arty don't like their new living situation as they're afraid of their Grandma, and find it difficult to relate to their crazy Aunt Bella, whose slow mental state is manifested by perpetual excitability and a short attention span, which outwardly comes across as a childlike demeanor. Into their collective lives returns one of Eddie and Bella's other siblings, Louie Kurnitz, a henchman for some gangsters. He is hiding out from Hollywood Harry, who wants what Louie stole and is hiding in his small black bag. Jay and Arty's mission becomes how to make money fast so that they can help their father and move back in together, which may entail stealing the $15,000 their Grandma has hidden somewhere. Bella's mission is to find a way to tell the family that she wants to marry Johnny, her equally slow movie theater usher boyfriend; the two could also use $5,000 of Grandma's hidden money to open their dream restaurant. And Louie's mission is to survive the next couple of days. Characters Jay: He is fifteen \\"and a half\\" years old. He insists on the \\"and a half\\". The death of his mother forces him to be more mature than he is ready to be when his father leaves him and his younger brother with his family so he can sell scrap iron during World War Two. The play tells his coming-of-age story. Arty: Jay's younger brother, he is 13 \\"and a half\\" years old. More of an observer than the rest of his family, he often goes with the flow of things, but also can be a little childish. Originally played on Broadway by Danny Gerard. Bella: Jay's thirty-five-year-old aunt. She is sometimes a bit off-center and is mentally challenged, but despite this she is also loving and protective of her nephews. Much of the second half of the play focuses on her attempts at independence from her stern mother. Louie: Jay's flamboyant, jovial uncle, in his late 30s, who comes to live with the family when he is hiding from the local mob. He is considered by Grandma Kurnitz to be the \\"survivor\\" of the family. He has a strong, mercurial nature, and a certain underlying dark side, which the kids uncover in the second act of the play. He works as a \\"bag-man\\" for the mob. Grandma Kurnitz: Jay's grandmother. A very old and stern woman, an immigrant from Germany. Owing to her harsh childhood, she has always been very intolerant of what in others she calls \\"weaknesses\\". She is blunt, sometimes even in a funny way, and always knows what is going on with the people around her. Eddie: Jay's middle-aged father. After the death of his wife, he is forced to send his two sons to live with their grandmother, while he repays his large financial debts. He is shown to be, much like his sisters, a nervous wreck around Grandma. Gert: Jay's aunt, and Grandma's daughter. She is a very interesting addition to the family. Her most noticeable issue is that when she breathes she has a tendency to suck in while still speaking, as a result of trauma instilled in her by Grandma from a young age. Film adaptation Simon adapted his play for a 1993 feature film directed by Martha Coolidge, and starring Brad Stoll as Jay. Worth and Ruehl reprised their stage roles, and Richard Dreyfuss was cast as Louie. Bella's beau Johnny, an unseen character in the play, was portrayed by David Strathairn.Maslin, Janet. \\"Movie Review.

On the other hand, its economy has been pictured either as an empty space of backwardness waiting to be filled by capitalism, or, conversely, as a zone of total dependency and exploitation, a metaphor for all that is wrong with the American political economy.\\" Either portrayal, Billings argues, are \\"essentialist\\" views that reduce the complexity of Appalachia and its people to a one-dimensional preconception.Billings, Dwight.

Foote received the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. This was one of four Foote plays the group produced during its 1994/1995 season. Overview In this play Foote revived characters which had been in his The Orphans' Home Cycle of nine plays. Will Kidder — 64 years old in this play — was in his early twenties in Lily Dale, and approaching middle age in Cousins. Sixty-year-old Lily Dale Kidder was introduced in Roots in a Parched Ground as a ten-year- old, and was portrayed in subsequent life stages in Lily Dale and Cousins. Her stepfather, 72-year-old Pete Davenport, first appears at age thirty in Roots in a Parched Ground. According to the playwright, he thought he was done with these characters after Cousins, but in the early 1990s found himself thinking about them again and started work on this play. Plot In 1950, Will Kidder, age 64, is at his office at the Sunshine Southern Wholesale Grocery, where he has worked since his early 20s. He and his wife Lily Dale have just moved into their new house in Houston and, in Will's words, \\"There's no finer house in Houston.\\" He was poor as a child and had a successful career. However, Will is fired. Will talks about his only son, Bill, who had moved to Atlanta. Bill drowned six months ago, and Will suspects Bill actually committed suicide. Lily Dale refuses to consider that he committed suicide, instead believing that his death was an accident. Bill's roommate, Randy Carter, the \\"Young Man from Atlanta\\", had been trying to see Will, who believes that all he wants is money.

Chase received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work in 1945. It has been adapted for film and television several times, most notably in a 1950 film starring James Stewart and Josephine Hull. Plot Elwood P. Dowd is an affable man who claims to have an unseen (and presumably imaginary) friend Harvey — whom Elwood describes as a six-foot, three-and-one-half-inch (192 cm) tall pooka resembling an anthropomorphic rabbit. Elwood introduces Harvey to everyone he meets. His social-climbing sister, Veta, increasingly finds his eccentric behavior embarrassing. She decides to have him committed to a sanitarium. When they arrive at the sanitarium, a comedy of errors ensues. The young Dr. Sanderson mistakenly commits Veta instead of Elwood, but when the truth comes out, the search is on for Elwood and his invisible companion. When Elwood shows up at the sanitarium looking for his lost friend Harvey, it seems that the mild-mannered Elwood's delusion has had a strange influence on the staff, including sanitarium director Dr. Chumley. Only just before Elwood is to be given an injection that will make him into a \\"perfectly normal human being, and you know what bastards they are!\\" (in the words of a taxi cab driver who has become involved in the proceedings) does Veta realize that she would rather have Elwood the same as he has always been — carefree and kind — even if it means living with Harvey. But the only reason Veta hears from the cab driver is that she can't find her coin purse and has to get the cab fare from Elwood. That is when the cab driver sees what is happening and goes into his spiel. Later Veta realizes that the purse was there all along, but Harvey hid it from her.

The original production was directed by Antoinette Perry and produced by Brock Pemberton and starred Frank Fay as Elwood P. Dowd and Josephine Hull as Elwood's sister Veta. Elwood was subsequently played during this run by Joe E. Brown, James Stewart, James Dunn, Bert Wheeler, and Jack Buchanan. The play also had a production in 1949 at London's Prince of Wales Theatre starring Sid Field and Athene Seyler then, after Field's death, Leslie Henson. Dooley Wilson starred as Elwood in the 1951 Negro Drama Guild production, which also featured Butterfly McQueen as Myrtle Mae.Schildcrout, p. 84.

In 1975 Stewart appeared in a West End revival at the Prince of Wales Theatre, with Mona Washbourne in the role of Veta.Catholic Herald archive, catholicherald.co.uk; accessed January 1, 2013. According to theatre historian Jordan Schildcrout, the reputation of the play, which had become a staple of amateur theatre groups, improved in the late 1980s because of critically esteemed professional revivals at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C., in 1987 and the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis in 1989.Schildcrout, p. 85. Other major productions at regional theatres followed at the Steppenwolf Theatre (1990), Cleveland PlayHouse (1991), Seattle Rep (1993), and La Jolla Playhouse (1994).

Three US television adaptations have been made: * The first, in 1958, starred Art Carney, Marion Lorne, Elizabeth Montgomery, Larry Blyden, Fred Gwynne, Charlotte Rae, and Jack Weston. * In the second, James Stewart reprised his screen role in 1972 along with Helen Hayes, Fred Gwynne, Richard Mulligan, Madeline Kahn, Martin Gabel, and Arlene Francis. Hayes' portrayal of Veta is notably different from Hull's: At the end, when Veta discovers her change purse, she smiles. * The last, in 1998, starred Harry Anderson, Swoosie Kurtz, Jessica Hecht (who appears in the 2012 revival), Leslie Nielsen, and William Schallert. In addition, versions of the play were produced for West German television in 1959, 1967, 1970 (with Heinz Rühmann) and 1985 as Mein Freund Harvey (My Friend Harvey). The play was adapted as Say Hello to Harvey, a stage musical by Leslie Bricusse, opening on September 14, 1981 in Toronto, where it closed prior to Washington DC and New York engagements. As Ken Mandelbaum noted in his 1991 book Not Since Carrie: On August 2, 2009, it was revealed that Steven Spielberg had committed to a new adaptation of the play, to be a co-production between 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks, with a screenplay written by Jonathan Tropper. However, on December 4, 2009, Spielberg revealed that he had quit the project, partly due to his inability to find an actor willing and able to play Elwood Dowd.IMDb reference to Spielberg's Harvey; accessed May 27, 2014.

The 16th installment of the Madden NFL series, it features former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis on the cover. Al Michaels and John Madden return as game commentators. Released on August 9, 2004, the game is the first Madden game to feature Xbox Live. It was the last Madden game to play on the PlayStation, and the first Madden game to play on the Nintendo DS as a launch title. Reception The game was met with universal acclaim to average reception, with the game frequently being compared to its competitor ESPN NFL 2K5. The game has also been heavily criticized for its questionable soundtrack, which was a common recurrence throughout the series. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 90.33% and 91 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 90% and 90 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 89.50% and 91 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 83.73% and 85 out of 100 for the PC version; 80% and 79 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; and 69.07% and 68 out of 100 for the DS version. IGN called the PS2 version the 98th best PlayStation 2 game due to its AI quality and graphics. The staff also claimed that it beat out ESPN NFL 2K5 due to EA's video game exclusivity deal with the NFL. ESPN NFL 2K5 was the first in the 2K series priced at $19.99 the day it shipped, much lower than market leader Madden NFL at $49.99. This greatly reduced Madden sales that year; one EA Sports developer recalled that \\"[i]t scared the hell out of us\\". EA reduced Madden NFL 2005s price to $29.95. In December 2004 EA Sports acquired an exclusive rights agreement with the NFL and NFLPA to be the sole creator of NFL video games.

Rundle, Banff N.P., Canada Snowkiters use large kites to travel across snow and jump in the air. Snowkiting on lake Kallavesi, Kuopio, Finland in March 2005. thumb Snowkiting Snowkiting or kite skiing is an outdoor winter sport where people use kite power to glide on snow or ice. The skier uses a kite to give them power over large jumps. The sport is similar to water-based kiteboarding, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. The principles of using the kite are the same, but in different terrain. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays many kiteboarders use inflatable kites. However, since 2013, newly developed racing foil kites seem to dominate speed races and expedition races, like Red Bull Ragnarok (held on the Norwegian Hardangervidda plateau) and the Vake mini- expedition race (held at Norway's most northern Varanger peninsula). Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction. Like kiteboarding, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting is becoming increasingly popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the Northern and Central United States. The sport is becoming more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration.  History  20th century = As a child Dieter Strasilla, inspired by Otto Lilienthal, practiced gliding around Berchtesgaden and in the 1960s he began parapente experiments (also with his brother Udo in USA) in Germany and Switzerland, parachute-skiing in 1972 and later perfected a kiteskiing system using self- made paragliders and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to kitesail upwind or uphill, but also to take off into the air at will, swivelling the body around to face the right way.Skywing Kiteskiers began kiteskiing on many frozen lakes and fields in the US midwest and east coast. Lee Sedgwick and a group of kiteskiers in Erie, PA were early ice/snow kiteskiers. In 1982 Wolf Beringer started developing his shortline Parawing system for skiing and sailing. This was used by several polar expeditions to kite-ski with sleds, sometimes covering large distances.Wolf Behringer, Parawings , 1996 Ted Dougherty began manufacturing 'foils' for kiteskiing and Steve Shapson of Force 10 Foils also began manufacturing 'foils' using two handles to easily control the kite. In the mid-1980s Shapson, while icesailing, took out an old two line kite and tried to ski upwind on a local frozen lake in Wisconsin. Shapson demonstrated the sport of 'kiteskiing' in Poland, Germany, Switzerland and Finland. He also used grass skis to kiteski on grassy fields. Early European kiteskiers were Keith Stewart and Theo Schmidt, who also were among the first to waterski with kites. American Cory Roeseler together with his father William developed a Kiteski system for waterskiing and began winning in windsurf races featuring high following winds, such as in the gorge of the Columbia river. The following terms describe the sport of 'Traction Kiting' or some refer to as 'Power Kiting': Kite buggying, kite skiing, kitesurfing and kite landboarding. In the mid-1980s e.g. some alpine skiers used a rebridled square parachute to ski upwind on a frozen bay in Erie, PA. In the late 1990s small groups of French and North American riders started pushing the boundaries of modern freestyle snowkiting. The Semnoz crew from France began hosting events at the Col du Lautaret and other European sites where the mountainous terrain lent itself to \\"paragliding\\" down the hills. In North America, riders were mainly riding snow-covered lakes and fields where tricks were being done on the flat ground, jumps, rails and sliders. = 21st century = The 2000s have seen a giant leap forward in snowkite-specific technologies, skill levels and participants in every possible snow-covered country. The development of snowkite specific, de-powerable, foil kites have allowed snowkiters to explore further and push the limits of windpowered expeditions. Recent crossings in record times of large snowfields and even Greenland have been accomplished through the use of snowkites. On the forefront of extreme freestyle snowkiting, dedicated snowkiting communities from Utah to Norway are pushing the freestyle envelope and documenting their efforts through films like Something Stronger and Dimensions,SnowkiteFilm.com and Snowkite MagazineDrift Snowkite Magazine which is available as a digital magazine. The extreme envelope of snowkiting freestyle and back country is being pushed by Chasta, a French kiter sponsored by Ozone KitesOzone Kites now based in New Zealand. Better equipment, safety practices, community know-how and qualified instructors are readily available in many areas, allowing people to learn properly and safely through different means than trial and error. The sport is currently being enjoyed by kiters of all ages and in a wide variety of activities ranging from mellow jaunts on a lake, to kitercross events, from multi-day expeditions, to flying off mountains, from freestyle jib tricks, to huge cliff jumps as well as endurance and course racing. On 20 January 2007, during the Antarctic summer, Team N2i became the first people to reach the Antarctic pole of inaccessibility without powered aid, using kite skiing as their primary means of propulsion.\\"UK team makes polar trek history\\", BBC news story, retrieved June 2007 There is a small segment of kiters that participate in GPS speed competitions where kiters record speed data on a GPS unit and submit it to a coordinating body for comparison to other kiter's speeds. In the StormboardingStormboarding world wide speed ranking Joe Levins, an American kiter, was the first to reach 70 mph/112 km/h in 2008. In 2009 Christopher Krug, an American kiter sponsored by Peter Lynn KiteboardingPeter Lynn Kiteboarding pushed the envelope further to a speed of 73.5 mph/118 km/h. On 5 June 2010, Canadian Eric McNair-Landry and American-French Sebastian Copeland kite-skied in 24 hours to set a distance world record.Greenland ski wrap-up: New kite world record The team completed the first partial east to west crossing of Antarctica using kites, a distance of over 4,000 kilometers via Pole of Inaccessibility research station and the South Pole over 82 days in 2011–12.Polar News ExplorersWeb - ExWeb interview Sebastian Copeland and Eric McNair-Landry (part 2/2): An odd encounter in a paralleled universe Technique and Ride Snowkiting is very similar to windsurfing in technique. It is harder to maintain balance than with basic snowboarding, since the hands and arms have to control the kite and thus are not completely available for balance. However, the balance issue can be somewhat offset by the up-and- forward force generated by the kite. With previous snowboard models, it was necessary to minimize side cuts to avoid inadvertently riding upwind. This happens because in leaning back to be a counterweight against the force of the kite, the heels of the snowkiter naturally dig into the snow, causing the board to turn upwind. Modern reverse camber snowboards have addressed this problem. There are specialized equipment for snowkiting.CustomSkis.ru - Specially skis and snowboards for snowkiting They have a radius of 100-150m, skis for snowkiting are 215cm long, snowkiteboards have a length of 200cm. Rotational snowboard bindings that go between the board and traditional boot binding are becoming popular among snow kiters. The rotational binding relieves stress in the ankles and knees often associated with snowkiting. Terrain Kite Boarding is practical on very many areas, as long as there is a significant amount of wind to keep the kite up. It is not always used on slopes, and can in fact be used with no slope, or even an upwards slope, as long as there is enough wind to offset the drag incurred. It can prove more difficult to have any riding time when you go on a steeper slope, as the wind can be blocked and or become turbulent passing over the peak of the hill, causing the kite to behave erratically and even fall or be pushed to the ground.

Little is truly known about Kane; many of his followers draw a direct connection between him and the Abrahamic figure of Cain, which he does not go out of his way to confirm or deny. Considered a charismatic and brilliant sociopath by the outside world, Kane is seen by his followers as a holy figure and a messiah. Kane's origins in the Command & Conquer series date back to the 1996 game Command & Conquer: Red Alert, a prequel set before the first game in which Kane can be seen acting in an advisory capacity for USSR leader Joseph Stalin during an alternate World War II fought between the Allies and the Soviet Union. After Stalin's assassination in this timeline, Kane disappears from the political scene, re- emerging in the 1990s to lead the Brotherhood of Nod, a quasi-religious terrorist organization. Over the course of the next fifty years Kane's Brotherhood of Nod engages in an ongoing conflict with the Global Defense Initiative, a multinational military force backed by the United Nations. The conflict between the two parties is characterized by long periods of cold war between the two factions separated by periods of brief but violent military combat on a global scale. Typically, these periods of open conflict coincide with or occur during periods when Kane re-emerges to personally lead the Brotherhood of Nod, while the periods of cold war typically occur during times when Kane is absent from the Brotherhood of Nod. Kane's last appearance was in the 2010 game Tiberium Twilight, in which he and his followers were last seen entering the extraterrestrial Threshold 19 tower, from which they vanished from the Earth. In all games in which the character has been featured the role of Kane has been portrayed by Joseph D. Kucan. Kane has been the only character in the Command & Conquer franchise to have appeared in all four primary Command & Conquer titles, and is also the only character to have appeared in both the Command & Conquer and Red Alert timelines. Kane's presence in the game series also survived the acquisition and subsequent closure of Westwood Studios by Electronic Arts. Over the years Kane has been well received, earning praise from several independent reviewers and a place in the Guinness Book of Records. Character development and promotion Kane is portrayed by Las Vegas-based actor Joseph D. Kucan, who also handled directing the FMV cutscenes for all C&C; games, with the exception of more recent installments - these were handled by EA in-house cinematic director Richard Taylor. Since his creation, the character became a highly popular and iconic character to fans of the Command & Conquer franchise since the inception of both in 1995. Consistently used in various games within the franchise, the character's popularity with fans led to EA Los Angeles launching a promotional website for C&C; dedicated entirely to the Kane character,http://www.kanelives.org/ along with devoting the storyline of Command & Conquer 3s expansion pack, entitled \\"Kane's Wrath\\", exclusively to expanding Kane's background, history and motives. In 2008, Kucan was inducted in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008 as the longest recurring actor in any video game franchise to date for his portrayal of Kane. StoryWorld War II= Although the first published game in which the character appeared was the initial Command & Conquer in 1995, Kane's first chronological appearance was as an obscure counsellor to Joseph Stalin during the Soviet Union's invasion of Europe in the 1996 prequel Command & Conquer: Red Alert; the story of which is placed nearly half a century before the events of the original C&C; game. Kane proved to be the concealed mastermind behind the actions of Joseph Stalin and thus the Soviet Union, and appeared to have instigated the world war between the Soviets and the Allies in order to further the Brotherhood of Nod's long-term goals. This was done with the aid of a woman known as Nadia—the head of the NKVD, Stalin's mistress and evidently a member of the Brotherhood herself as early as the 1950s. In Red Alert's alternative ending the USSR's conquest of Europe was completed, which would swiftly result in Stalin's assassination at the hands of Nadia, and her revealing the name of Kane as well as the existence of the Brotherhood of Nod to the player. Nadia then proceeded to reveal that Nod planned to continue to dwell in the shadows for several decades still, to openly emerge sometime \\"in the early 1990s\\". Kane however shoots her without warning upon those revelations, and the cutscene closes with the character stating the foreboding words to the player; \\"Comrade Chairman, I am the future\\". Kane apparently then disappears after the ending of Red Alert for five decades. =First Tiberium War= His reappearance literally marked the beginning of a new age. Under his direction, the now emerged Brotherhood of Nod began researching the alien substance of Tiberium almost immediately after its arrival on Earth through a meteorite impact in the year 1995, stating that it had the potential to bring about the next stage in humanity's evolution. This guidance of Kane led Nod to gain a near monopoly on the world's rapidly increasing Tiberium deposits, as the Brotherhood's technologies for harvesting Tiberium initially were the only viable method of extracting the crystals, giving them enormous amounts of capital in a relatively short period of time and causing Nod to pioneer unique Tiberium-based technology in virtually every field. Kane himself is believed to have invented these technologies, which are frequently referred to by his many followers worldwide as \\"The Technology of Peace\\". The period in which these events transpired, which would increasingly come to be known as the First Tiberium War, was marked by the Brotherhood of Nod openly starting to preach to many of the third world nations to throw off their \\"shackles of slavery\\" under the industrialized countries, while at the same time preaching an ideology of a Tiberium revolution to the entire world. Many would begin to sign up for Nod's utopian vision of global prosperity and peace for the human race by embracing Tiberium and the unifying ways of the Brotherhood, rendered blind to the implications of Nod's mantra \\"Peace through Power\\". For all these actions, Kane quickly rose to the top of the most wanted list of the United Nations' newly instituted Global Defense Initiative task force, as the war between the GDI and the Brotherhood would eventually escalate into one of the most brutal conflicts in human history. The end of this war saw a GDI strike force laying siege to Kane's Temple and the main base of operations in Sarajevo, which would lead to the Brotherhood of Nod's first apparent downfall. Reports of Kane's demise were inconsistent however; some say he was buried underneath rubble when the Temple started to fall apart, but other sources stated that the Global Defense Initiative's ion cannon firing upon the main Temple structure had killed Kane—indeed, a security video eventually substantiated this story. In it, Kane is seen embracing the light of the ion beam seconds before the Temple exploded under its force. However, his body was never found. =Second Tiberium War= Despite the Brotherhood's defeat at the end of the First Tiberium War, Kane's followers never wavered and always believed that he lived in death, and were vindicated when he rose again in Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun almost thirty years later to once again lead waiting Nod forces worldwide and begin a new open war with the GDI. Although he appeared to his followers during a ceremony with a flawless face, looking virtually the same as during the events shown in Red Alert and the First Tiberium War, his real appearance was less aesthetically pleasing—almost a half of his head was covered by a metal plate, obscuring the massive burns presumably inflicted by the GDI ion cannon strike thirty years ago. He focused Nod's efforts on Tiberium weapons research anew, resulting in the development of a world-altering missile. The missile's launch was foiled by a daring GDI assault under the command of Michael McNeil, who ignored his superior's orders to refrain from the attack in order to allow GDI more time to plan and prepare for the deciding conflict. Kane was confronted by McNeil within his pyramid near Cairo and was impaled by him on a piece of metallic debris, which would result in the Brotherhood of Nod's second defeat. During the subsequent events portrayed in Tiberian Sun: Firestorm, an unholy alliance was formed between GDI and the remaining Nod forces to stop the rogue actions of Nod's advanced AI system known as \\"CABAL\\". After the final defeat of CABAL and his cyborg forces, the Nod ending shows Kane's dormant body hooked into the CABAL system core and being kept alive in a cryonic capsule, apparently recovering from his grave injury sustained at the end of the second conflict at the hands of Michael McNeil. The screen of the AI's system core is shown to be continually splicing between the CABAL entity and Kane, as a single individual, with both of them referring to Kane's \\"vision\\" with disjointed voices, yet with Kane referring to it in the first person using the word \\"my\\" whereas CABAL refers to it with the word \\"your\\" in an almost respectful manner. Suddenly only CABAL's voice can be heard, and the last words spoken by the continued union of Kane and the AI are \\"Our directives must be reassessed.\\" =Third Tiberium War= At the advent of the Third Tiberium War, seventeen years afterwards, Kane made his second re-appearance to the world, rallying waiting and prepared Nod forces everywhere anew and promptly initiating an overly aggressive attack on GDI by taking out their control centre for space defences, and subsequently annihilating the organization's orbital command station GDSS Philadelphia with a nuclear missile. Although the worldwide assault on GDI's installations which followed suit was successful and Nod did at one point very nearly achieve a complete military victory over the disorganized and reeling Global Defense Initiative, GDI would manage to turn the tide on them after weeks of fierce urban warfare, a turn of events Kane apparently had anticipated. Kane had knowledge that a liquid Tiberium explosion of tremendous magnitude would attract the attention of an alien species known as the Scrin. Through the war he had initiated, Kane successfully provoked and lured GDI into attacking his main \\"Temple Prime\\" complex in retaliation to the Brotherhood of Nod's brutal assault on GDI-protected blue zones across the world. The plot worked, as under the order of Acting Director Redmond Boyle the ion cannon was fired directly upon \\"Temple Prime\\" in Sarajevo in an eerie repetition of historical events, which detonated a liquid Tiberium deposit purposely hidden deep underneath the Temple Prime and causing a cataclysmic explosion across south- eastern Europe. Soon after the detonation, the alien Scrin arrived on Earth in order to begin large-scale harvesting of the world's Tiberium deposits. Kane's apparent purpose in bringing them to Earth was to gain access to their highly advanced technology, as he thought to use the monolithic \\"Threshold\\" towers the extraterrestrials constructed to bring him and his followers to reach \\"ascension\\". As explained in the campaigns, the towers were vulnerable to assault and destruction while under construction, but once completed would partially phase out of existence, rendering them immune to all known human weaponry. To prevent the Scrin from completing construction of the towers GDI forces utilized their ion cannons to strike at the towers in order bring them down before their construction was completed, however, Nod loyalists in Italy would eventually manage to secure one of these gigantic structures (later identified as \\"Threshold 19\\") under Kane's guidance, placing it under the Brotherhood's control. During the Scrin campaign in Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, it is revealed that the alien species quickly became aware their premature awakening was a deliberate act by someone or something on Earth. After intercepting a transmission between Kane and the Nod commander (the player), they immediately focused their attention on Kane as the possible cause of this unprecedented incident, coming to the conclusion that the being of \\"Kane\\" somehow already existed in their master data matrix, and more disturbingly, that Kane's genetic material is unrecognizable even to the vast ancient knowledge of their space-faring species. Five years after this third world war, an artificial intelligence named \\"LEGION\\" arises, with Kane promptly placing a secret army of cyborg soldiers known as the \\"Marked of Kane\\" under the entity's command in order to reclaim the mysterious Tacitus device from GDI's Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Soon after, the Marked launch an unrelenting assault on the heavily fortified military research complex, overrunning GDI's finest defenses and obtaining the Tacitus for Nod once again. The final cutscene, titled \\"Ascendance\\", shows Kane inserting the object into LEGION while proclaiming: \\"LEGION, my child, you are my greatest creation. It is time for you to take center stage; time for you to achieve the purpose for which you were created! One Vision, One Purpose!\\" With this, the story of Command & Conquer 3 concludes with a major cliffhanger. =Fourth Tiberium War = Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight covers Kane's effort to bring the Scrin Threshold Tower to operational condition. At this point, most of the Earth had been overrun with Tiberium, and the failure to develop a solution to the Tiberium poisoning had rendered the Earth almost uninhabitable to Carbon-based life. Due to the failure of scientists to determine an effective way to contain Tiberium, the scientific community had predicted that humanity faced a very real threat of extinction due to the ongoing spread of the substance. In the midst of this crisis, Kane re-emerged and presented himself to GDI officials with a proposal to join his Brotherhood of Nod and the UN's Global Defense Initiative to allow for the construction of a Tiberium Control Network (TCN) that would inhibit the spread of Tiberium across the globe with the alternative purposes of furthering Kane's goal of ascension. While moderate GDI and Nod factions agreed to work together on the network, hardliners splintered off and began to assault each other, precipitating the 4th Tiberium War. Despite the conflict, Kane was able to finish the Tiberium Control Network and wire it into Threshold 19, completing the preparations needed to bring it back online. At the end of Tiberian Twilight, Kane convinces Commander Parker, the protagonist, to activate a portal in the Tower and enters, along with his Brotherhood followers, seemingly leaving Earth. In the aftermath of the apparent departure of Kane and his followers via Threshold 19 it is revealed that the Tiberium Control Network jointly constructed by Nod and GDI has successfully contained the spread of Tiberium. More importantly, the TCN had caused Tiberium to recede in certain places, allowing for some of the formally designated red-zones that are regarded as too toxic to sustain carbon based life to be reclassified as yellow zones that can support human or other carbon based life forms. Reception The character was well received by critics and fans alike. In 1998, Kane was ranked fifth on GameSpot's list of the best game villains as \\"one of the most vile characters you'll ever butt heads with in any PC game.\\" GameSpy placed him tenth in their 2001 list of top villains in games, commenting he \\"generally makes your life a living hell\\". GameDaily ranked Kane as the eighth top evil mastermind of all time, praising him for his determination and intelligence despite being \\"a little bit on the nutty side.\\" In 2008, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Kane as the fifth top PC game NPC of all time, naming Kucan's \\"legendarily melodramatic\\" portrayal, the character's \\"sheer charisma\\", and its aura of mystery for the reasons why Kane \\"is one of the most long-toothed and loved villains of PC gaming.\\" In 2010, GamePro ranked him 43rd on the list of top most diabolical video game villains of all time. In 2011, Empire ranked him as 31st among the greatest video game characters as \\"one brilliant bad guy, and one of the most entertaining masterminds ever to scheme an evil scheme,\\" noting that Kucan \\"was recently on the receiving end of a Guinness World Record nod for longest-running actor in any video game franchise.\\" GamesRadar also praised Kane's role as a charismatic antagonist, putting him in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 25.

The sacred bull common throughout Anatolia was his signature animal, represented by his horned crown or by his steeds Seri and Hurri, who drew his chariot or carried him on their backs. = Family = The Hurrian myth of Teshub's origin—he was conceived when the god Kumarbi bit off and swallowed his father Anu's genitals, similarly to the Greek story of Uranus, Cronus, and Zeus, which is recounted in Hesiod's Theogony. Teshub's brothers are Aranzah (personification of the river Tigris), Ullikummi (stone giant) and Tashmishu. In the Hurrian schema, Teshub was paired with Hebat the mother goddess; in the Hittite, with the sun goddess Arinniti of Arinna—a cultus of great antiquity which has similarities with the venerated bulls and mothers at Çatalhöyük in the Neolithic era. His son was called Sarruma, the mountain god. = Illuyanka = According to Hittite myths, one of Teshub's greatest acts was the slaying of the dragon Illuyanka. Myths also exist of his conflict with the sea creature (possibly a snake or serpent) Hedammu (CTH 348).

It is the seat of the canton of Porto- Vecchio, which it shares with Sari-Solenzara, Conca and Lecci. Porto-Vecchio is a medium-sized port city placed on a good harbor, the southernmost of the marshy and alluvial east side of Corsica. The inhabitants are called Porto- Vecchiais in French, and Portivechjacciu in Corsican. Geography The canton of Porto-Vecchio has a population of about 12,900 living in four communes making up a total of . It is divided in two by the commune of Zonza, which holds a section of the coast around the Gulf of Pinarellu. Porto-Vecchio has two communes to the north, Sari-Solenzara and Conca, and two to the south, Porto-Vecchio and Lecci.. The commune of Porto-Vecchio is east of Sartène. The north shore of the gulf has many resorts, such as Benedettu, Marina di Fiori, and others of the commune of Lecci. The east coast, a shore with cliffs, is less habitable; beyond Chiappa Point (a naturist site) the coast goes southwest to the border of Bonifacio commune. Off the southeast shore are the four îles Cerbicale (seldom shown on the map but visible from satellite photographs), protected by a nature reserve of , which are part of the larger reserve of Bouches de Bonifacio (\\"Straits of Bonifacio\\"; see under Bonifacio). From north to south are: Forana; Maestro Maria, the smallest; Piana, the largest, which ascends to and Pietrocaggiosa a little more distant. Hills to the northwest are included in the national park; the village of Ospedale there probably takes its name and origin from a large ancient hospital of the Roman era. It never lost that function but continues as a health center employing about 150 people. Nearby is a reservoir, the Lac de l'Ospedale, created with a dam at the foot of punta di Corbu in the forest of Ospedale. These hills culminate at the \\"peak of the dead cow\\" (punta di a Vacca Morta). Ecology The heights of Ospedale (or Spedale in earlier literature) are noted for their forest of Corsican Pine. Between them and the coast extends a plain drained by the Stabacciu, which flows into the end of the Gulf of Porto through salt marshes, where Cork Oak and Eucalyptus grow. These marshes were a barrier between the Roman settlements along the Via Corsicana of the eastern plain and the Roman ports of the south. Some marshland was filled to make the modern city and commercial salt pans were constructed on other parts (from which the commercialized slogan \\"city of salt\\"); the rest remains. Crossed by Highway N198 south, it is no longer a barrier. Facilities Map of Porto-Vecchio (blue) within Sartène (grey) Porto-Vecchio is easily accessed through FigariSud Corse Airport, which is away. It has a public high school and two community colleges, a private hospital of 107 beds, a medical school, a cork industry and extensive tourist facilities. The port includes moorings for 450 small craft, commercial facilities and a ferry station. The population expands to 50,000 in the summer, predominantly Italian. The beaches are well- populated, especially Palombaggia Beach to the south-east. In 1983 it acquired a Film Institute, which organizes an annual film festival.

Dated to the Corsican Bronze Age, it features circular or semi-circular (abutting) citadels of stone. In the direction of Figari, the hamlet of Ceccia also has prehistoric remains, and not far away is another Torréen site, Castellu di Tappa. Castellu d'Araghju is at , just above the village of Araggio. It has a circuit wall thick and high. West of the commune is the prehistoric site of Tivulaghju. History Porto-Vecchio is placed in a region that in earlier times was marshy and suffered greatly from malaria; however, the anchorage for a port is excellent. The name means \\"Old Port\\", which may refer to the Roman port that left traces in the vicinity. Subsequently, the region was more or less abandoned because of the malarial marshes but became part of a large Christian parish. The city was refounded in 1539 by the Bank of Saint George at Genoa on a hill overlooking the gulf. They already had a presence in Bastia. The Genoese were careful to preserve the Roman port within the walls, which are trapezoidal and enclose the main square, place de la République, near the church, Église St.-Jean Baptiste. The Genoese intended a colonia, or replacement of the population, but malaria soon assassinated most of the Genoese settlers. Another colony in 1546 suffered the same fate and subsequently the colony became a conurbation instead. Sempiero Corso occupied the city for a few months in 1564. Some of the population began to return with the drainage projects instituted under the Second Empire but they were minimally successful. World War II brought the presence of allies who were determined to eradicate malaria for the health of all concerned, but especially the soldiers and airmen. Through drainage, filling and spraying they succeeded, making the region newly attractive because less pestilential. The current population derives from an expansion that started about 1950.

A stall that results in the complete disruption of the airflow through the compressor is referred to as a compressor surge. The severity of the phenomenon ranges from a momentary power drop barely registered by the engine instruments to a complete loss of compression in case of a surge, requiring adjustments in the fuel flow to recover normal operation. Compressor stall was a common problem on early jet engines with simple aerodynamics and manual or mechanical fuel control units, but has been virtually eliminated by better design and the use of hydromechanical and electronic control systems such as Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Modern compressors are carefully designed and controlled to avoid or limit stall within an engine's operating range. Types An animation of an axial compressor showing both the stator and rotor blades. There are two types of compressor stall: =Rotating stall= Rotating stall is a local disruption of airflow within the compressor which continues to provide compressed air, but with reduced effectiveness. Rotating stall arises when a small proportion of airfoils experience airfoil stall, disrupting the local airflow without destabilising the compressor. The stalled airfoils create pockets of relatively stagnant air (referred to as stall cells) which, rather than moving in the flow direction, rotate around the circumference of the compressor. The stall cells rotate with the rotor blades, but at 50 to 70% of their speed, affecting subsequent airfoils around the rotor as each encounters the stall cell. Propagation of the instability around the flow path annulus is driven by stall cell blockage causing an incidence spike on the adjacent blade. The adjacent blade stalls as a result of the incidence spike, thus causing stall cell \\"rotation\\" around the rotor. Stable local stalls can also occur which are axi-symmetric, covering the complete circumference of the compressor disc, but only a portion of its radial plane, with the remainder of the face of the compressor continuing to pass normal flow. A rotational stall may be momentary, resulting from an external disturbance, or may be steady as the compressor finds a working equilibrium between stalled and unstalled areas. Local stalls substantially reduce the efficiency of the compressor and increase the structural loads on the airfoils encountering stall cells in the region affected. In many cases however, the compressor airfoils are critically loaded without capacity to absorb the disturbance to normal airflow such that the original stall cells affect neighbouring regions and the stalled region rapidly grows to become a complete compressor stall. =Axi-symmetric stall or compressor surge = Axi-symmetric stall, more commonly known as compressor surge; or pressure surge, is a complete breakdown in compression resulting in a reversal of flow and the violent expulsion of previously compressed air out through the engine intake, due to the compressor's inability to continue working against the already-compressed air behind it. The compressor either experiences conditions which exceed the limit of its pressure rise capabilities or is highly loaded such that it does not have the capacity to absorb a momentary disturbance, creating a rotational stall which can propagate in less than a second to include the entire compressor. The compressor will recover to normal flow once the engine pressure ratio reduces to a level at which the compressor is capable of sustaining stable airflow. If, however, the conditions that induced the stall remain, the return of stable airflow will reproduce the conditions at the time of surge and the process will repeat.Kerrebrock 1992, p.261. Such a \\"locked-in\\" or self- reproducing stall is particularly dangerous, with very high levels of vibration causing accelerated engine wear and possible damage, even the total destruction of the engine through the breaking of compressor and stator vanes and their subsequent ingestion, destroying engine components downstream. Causes A compressor will only pump air in a stable manner up to a certain pressure ratio. Beyond this value the flow will break down and become unstable. This occurs at what is known as the surge line on a compressor map. The complete engine is designed to keep the compressor operating a small distance below the surge pressure ratio on what is known as the operating line on a compressor map. The distance between the two lines is known as the surge margin on a compressor map. Various things can occur during the operation of the engine to lower the surge pressure ratio or raise the operating pressure ratio. When the two coincide there is no longer any surge margin and a compressor stage can stall or the complete compressor can surge as explained in preceding sections. =Factors which erode compressor surge margin= The following, if severe enough, can cause stalling or surging. *Ingestion of foreign objects which results in damage, as well as sand and dirt erosion, can lower the surge line. *Dirt build-up in the compressor and wear that increases compressor tip clearances or seal leakages all tend to raise the operating line. *Complete loss of surge margin with violent surging can occur with a bird strike. Taxiing on the ground, taking off, low level flying (military) and approaching to land all take place where bird strikes are a hazard. When a bird is ingested by a compressor the resultant blockage and airfoil damage causes compressor surging. Examples of debris on a runway or aircraft carrier flight deck that can cause damage are pieces of tire rubber, litter and nuts and bolts. A specific example is a metal piece dropped from another plane.The crash of Air France Flight 4590 was initiated by a piece of titanium alloy, dropped from a DC-10, on the runway. The metal debris ruptured a tire of the Air France Concorde, and pieces of the exploding tire damaged the plane, rupturing a fuel tank and causing wing structural failure and engine failure. While the metal debris did not cause a compressor failure, the Concorde accident is an example of a small piece of metal debris being dropped by one aircraft onto a runway and struck by another aircraft, and it is certainly possible that such a piece of debris, once deposited on a runway, might be thrown up by a wheel forward of a jet engine's intake and ingested by the engine, causing compressor damage. Furthermore, the surges of the port engines of the Flight 4590 Concorde could be examples of compressor stall, induced by the spikes in internal engine pressure as leaking fuel was ingested into the engines (outside of throttle control) and rapidly burned. Runways and aircraft carrier flight decks are cleaned frequently in an attempt to preclude ingestion of foreign objects. * Aircraft operation outside its design envelope; e.g., extreme flight manoeuvres resulting in airflow separations within the engine intake, flight in icing conditions where ice can build up in the intake or compressor, flight at excessive altitudes.\\"Jet Propulsion for Aerospace Applications\\" 2nd edition 1964 Walter J.hesse Nicholas V.S. Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation p201 * Engine operation outside its flight manual procedures; e.g., on early jet engines abrupt throttle movements (slam acceleration) when pilot's notes specified slow throttle movements. The excessive over-fuelling raised the operating line until it met the surge line. (Fuel control capability extended to automatically limit the over-fuelling to prevent surging). * Turbulent or hot airflow into the engine intake, e.g., use of reverse thrust at low forward speed, resulting in re-ingestion of hot turbulent air or, for military aircraft, ingestion of hot exhaust gases from missile firing. * Hot gases from gun firing which may produce inlet distortion; e.g., Mikoyan MiG-27. Effects Sukhoi Su-57 prototype suffering a compressor stall at MAKS 2011. Compressor axially-symmetric stalls, or compressor surges, are immediately identifiable, because they produce one or more extremely loud bangs from the engine. Reports of jets of flame emanating from the engine are common during this type of compressor stall. These stalls may be accompanied by an increased exhaust gas temperature, an increase in rotor speed due to the large reduction in work done by the stalled compressor and — in the case of multi-engine aircraft — yawing in the direction of the affected engine due to the loss of thrust. Response and recovery The appropriate response to compressor stalls varies according to the engine type and situation, but usually consists of immediately and steadily decreasing thrust on the affected engine. While modern engines with advanced control units can avoid many causes of stall, jet aircraft pilots must continue to take this into account when dropping airspeed or increasing throttle.  Notable stall occurrences  Aircraft development = Rolls-Royce Avon engine  The Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine was affected by repeated compressor surges early in its 1940s development which proved difficult to eliminate from the design. Such was the perceived importance and urgency of the engine that Rolls-Royce licensed the compressor design of the Sapphire engine from Armstrong Siddeley to speed development. The engine, as redesigned, went on to power aircraft such as the English Electric Canberra bomber, and the de Havilland Comet and Sud Aviation Caravelle airliners. Olympus 593 During the 1960s development of the Concorde Supersonic Transport (SST) a major incident occurred when a compressor surge caused a structural failure in the intake. The hammershock which propagated forward from the compressor was of sufficient strength to cause an inlet ramp to become detached and expelled from the front of the intake.Note: Before ejection from the intake the inlet ramp first travelled inward and struck the front face of the compressor causing considerable damage to the initial compressor stages. Despite this damage, the Olympus 593 still remained operable up to around 80% power. The ramp mechanism was strengthened and control laws changed to prevent a re-occurrence.Trubshaw, Brian; Edmondson, Sally. Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot. p 110. = Aircraft crashes = U.S. Navy F-14 crash  A compressor stall contributed to the 1994 death of Lt. Kara Hultgreen, the first female carrier-based United States Navy fighter pilot. Her aircraft, a Grumman F-14 Tomcat, experienced a compressor stall and failure of its left engine, a Pratt & Whitney TF30 turbofan, due to disturbed airflow caused by Hultgreen's attempt to recover from an incorrect final approach position by executing a sideslip; compressor stalls from excessive yaw angle were a known deficiency of this type of engine.  Southern Airways Flight 242  The 1977 loss of Southern Airways Flight 242, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-9-31, while penetrating a thunderstorm cell over Georgia was attributed to compressor stalls brought on by ingestion of large quantities of water and hail. The stalls caused blades to clash with stationary vanes in both of its Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9 turbofan engines. The stalls were so severe as to cause the destruction of the engines, leaving the flight crew with no choice but to make an emergency landing on a public road, killing 62 passengers and another eight people on the ground.  1997 Irkutsk Antonov An-124 crash  An Antonov 124 transport plane was destroyed when it crashed immediately after takeoff from Irkutsk-2 Airport in Russia. Three seconds after lifting off from Runway 14, at a height of about , the number 3 engine surged. Climbing away with a high angle of attack, engines 1 and 2 also surged, causing the aircraft to crash some past the end of the runway. It struck several houses in a residential area, killing all 23 on board, and 45 people on the ground.http://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=19971206-0  Trans World Airlines Flight 159  On November 6, 1967, TWA Flight 159, a Boeing 707 on its takeoff roll from the then-named Greater Cincinnati Airport, passed Delta Air Lines Flight 379, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 stuck in the dirt a few feet off the runway's edge. The first officer on the TWA aircraft heard a loud bang, now known to have been a compressor stall induced by ingestion of exhaust from Delta 379 as it was passed. Believing a collision had occurred, the copilot aborted the takeoff. Because of its speed, the aircraft overran the runway, injuring 11 of the 29 passengers, one of whom died four days later as a result of the injuries. Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751 In December 1991 Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751, a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 on a flight from Stockholm to Copenhagen, crashed after losing both engines due to ice ingestion leading to compressor stall shortly after takeoff. Due to a newly installed auto-throttle system designed to prevent pilots reducing power during the takeoff climb, the pilot's commands to reduce power on recognising the surge were countermanded by the system, leading to engine damage and total engine failure. The airliner successfully made a forced landing in a forest clearing without loss of life.

A modal test consists of an acquisition phase and an analysis phase. The complete process is often referred to as a Modal Analysis or Experimental Modal Analysis. There are several ways to do modal testing but impact hammer testing and shaker (vibration tester) testing are commonplace. In both cases energy is supplied to the system with a known frequency content. Where structural resonances occur there will be an amplification of the response, clearly seen in the response spectra. Using the response spectra and force spectra, a transfer function can be obtained. The transfer function (or frequency response function (FRF)) is often curve fitted to estimate the modal parameters; however, there are many methods of modal parameter estimation and it is the topic of much research. Sample layout of a modal testing system  Impact Hammer Modal Testing  An ideal impact to a structure is a perfect impulse, which has an infinitely small duration, causing a constant amplitude in the frequency domain; this would result in all modes of vibration being excited with equal energy. The impact hammer test is designed to replicate this; however, in reality a hammer strike cannot last for an infinitely small duration, but has a known contact time. The duration of the contact time directly influences the frequency content of the force, with a larger contact time causing a smaller range of bandwidth. A load cell is attached to the end of the hammer to record the force. Impact hammer testing is ideal for small light weight structures; however as the size of the structure increases issues can occur due to a poor signal to noise ratio. This is common on large civil engineering structures.  Shaker Modal Testing  A shaker is a device that excites the object or structure according to its amplified input signal. Several input signals are available for modal testing, but the sine sweep and random frequency vibration profiles are by far the most commonly used signals. Small objects or structures can be attached directly to the shaker table. With some types of shakers, an armature is often attached to the body to be tested by way of piano wire (pulling force) or stinger (Pushing force). When the signal is transmitted through the piano wire or the stinger, the object responds the same way as impact testing, by attenuating some and amplifying certain frequencies. These frequencies are measured as modal frequencies. Usually a load cell is placed between the shaker and the structure to obtain the excitation force. For large civil engineering structures much larger shakers are used, which can weigh 100kg and above and apply a force of many hundreds of newtons. Several types of shakers are common: rotating mass shakers, electro-dynamic shakers, and electrohydraulic shakers. For rotating mass shakers the force can be calculated from knowing the mass and the speed of rotation; for the electro-dynamic shaker the force can be obtained through a load cell, or an accelerometer placed on the moving mass of the shaker. Shakers can have an advantage over the impact hammer as they can supply more energy to a structure over a longer period of time. However, problems can also be introduced; shakers can influence the dynamic properties of the structure and can also increase the complexity of analysis due to windowing errors.

It was designed to deal with discriminatory laws and practices in the segregated South, by which blacks and Mexican Texans had been effectively disenfranchised since the late 19th and start of the 20th century. It extended the life of the Civil Rights Commission, previously limited to two years, to oversee registration and voting practices. The act was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and served to eliminate certain loopholes left by the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Background By the late 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement had been pressuring Congress to enact legislation to protect the constitutional civil rights of African Americans. The first major piece of civil rights legislation passed by Congress was the Civil Rights Act of 1957. While enforcing the voting rights of African Americans set out in the Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the act had several loopholes. Southern states continued to discriminate against African Americans in application of voter registration and electoral laws, in segregation of school and public facilities, and in employment. The new legislation was proposed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his message to the 86th Congress on February 5, 1959, when he stated \\"that every individual regardless of his race, religion, or national origin is entitled to the equal protection of the laws.\\" =Eisenhower's mandate= Toward the end of his presidency, President Eisenhower supported civil rights legislation. In his message to Congress, he proposed seven recommendations for the protection of civil rights: *Strengthen the laws that would root out threats to obstruct court orders in school desegregation cases *Provide more investigative authority to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in crimes involving the destruction of schools/churches *Grant Attorney General power to investigate Federal election records *Provide temporary program for aid to agencies to assist changes necessary for school desegregation decisions *Authorize provision of education for children of the armed forces *Consider establishing a statutory Commission on Equal Job Opportunity Under Government Contracts (later mandated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to create the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) *Extend the Civil Rights Commission an additional two years Legislative historyHouse of Representatives= The bill, H.R. 8601, began in the House of Representatives under jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee. The chairman of the committee, Congressman Emanuel Celler of New York, was known to be a firm supporter of the civil rights movement. The bill was easily approved by the Judiciary Committee, but the Rules Committee attacked the Judiciary Committee to prevent the bill coming to the floor of the House of Representatives. The bill was introduced to the House on March 10, 1960. The \\"voter referees\\" plan was part of a House amendment to the original bill to substitute Representative Robert Kastenmeier's \\"enrollment officers\\" plan. After several amendments, the House of Representatives approved the bill on March 24, 1960 by a vote of 311-109. 179 Democrats and 132 Republicans voted Aye. 93 Democrats, 15 Republicans, and 1 Independent Democrat voted Nay. 2 Democrats and 1 Republican voted present. =Senate= The Senate's Judiciary Committee also faced attempts to dislodge the bill. Southern Democrats had long acted as a voting bloc to resist or reject legislation to enforce constitutional rights in the South and made it difficult for proponents of civil rights to add strengthening amendments. After amendments in the Senate, H.R. 8601 was approved by the Senate on April 8, 1960 by a vote of 71-18. The House of Representatives approved the Senate amendments on April 21, 1960 by a vote of 288-95 and the bill was signed into law by President Eisenhower on May 6, 1960. No Republican Senators voted against the Bill. TitlesTitle I—obstruction of court orders= Title I which amended Chapter 17 of title 18 of the United States Code, , outlawed obstruction of court orders. If convicted, one could be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year. =Title II—flight from prosecution, explosives, threats and false information= Title II outlawed fleeing a state for damaging or destroying a building or property, illegal possession or use of explosives, and threats or false threats to damage property using fire or explosives. Section 201 amended Chapter 49 of title 18 (). The amendment outlaws interstate or international movement to avoid prosecution for damaging or destroying any building or structure. The section also outlaws flight to avoid testimony in a case relating to such an offense. If convicted, one could be fined no more than $5,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than five years. Section 203 amended Chapter 39 of title 18 (). The amendment dealt with the illegal use or possession of explosives. The section outlaws transportation or possession of any explosive with intent to damage a building or property. The section also makes the conveying of false information or threats to damage or destroy any building or property illegal. =Title III—federal election records= Section 301 calls for the preservation of all election records and papers which come into an officer or custodian's possession relating to poll tax or other act regarding voting in an election (except Puerto Rico). If an officer fails to comply, he/she could be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year. Section 302 declares that any person that intentionally alters, damages, or destroys a record shall be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year. Section 304 establishes that no person shall disclose any election record. Section 306 defines the term \\"officer of election\\". =Title IV—extension of powers of the civil rights commission= Section 401 of Title IV amended Section 105 of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 () declaring that \\"each member of the Commission shall have the power and authority to administer oaths or take statements of witnesses under affirmation.\\" =Title V—education of children of members of armed forces= Title V arranged for the provision of free education for children of members of the armed forces. =Title VI—protection of voting rights= Title VI amended section 131 of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 () to address the issue of depriving African-Americans the right to vote. Section 601 declares that those given the legal right to vote shall not be deprived of that right on account of race or color. Any person denying that right shall \\"constitute contempt of court.\\" The section also states that the courts can appoint \\"voting referees\\" to report to the court their findings of voting infringement. The section also defines the word \\"vote\\" as the entire process of making a vote effective--registration, casting a ballot, and having that ballot counted. =Title VII—separability= Title VII established the separability of the act, affirming that the rest of the act shall go unaffected if one provision is found invalid. Subsequent history Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the act of 1957 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 were deemed ineffective for the firm establishment of civil rights. The later legislation had firmer ground for the enforcement and protection of a variety of civil rights, where the acts of 1957 and 1960 were largely limited to voting rights. The Civil Rights Act of 1960 dealt with race and color but omitted coverage of those discriminated against for national origin, although Eisenhower had called for it in his message to Congress. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 worked to fulfill the seven goals suggested by President Eisenhower in 1959. The two satisfied proponents of the civil rights movement to end state-sponsored racial discrimination and protect legal equality in the United States.

It was directed by Oscar Luis Costo. Plot A few survivors have dedicated themselves to preserving and protecting what is left of mankind; among these is former Army Captain John Thomas Garth (Grant Show). Approached by Lapierre (Steve Bacic), a former comrade now employed by eco-profiteer Anton Reich (Art Hindle), Garth is made an offer he cannot refuse. In exchange for his father's and other's survival, Reich agrees to lead a small team of mercenaries into the impenetrable Vincent estate to \\"liberate\\" the priceless works of art that had been stored there. Accompanied by reconnaissance specialist Fernandez (Naomi Gaskin), sniper King (Matthew G. Taylor), and tech genius Ebershaw (Wayne Ward), Garth must find a way to circumvent Encrypt, the deadly computerized security system surrounding the estate. Other obstacles include the Rook, a killer robot, and Diana (Vivian Wu), the holographic security chief of the estate. With the help of Lapierre, Garth destroys the Rook and discovers that it actually protects a device that can restore the ozone layer. With the help of Diana, Garth triggers it, but presumably dies soon afterwards.

Often the belt covers areas where homes could be considered more affordable yet the cost of servicing the mortgage loan represents a high proportion of the families' available income. Changes to cost of servicing a mortgage, seen through interest rate fluctuations, can trigger widespread satisfaction or dissatisfaction towards the government of the day. In the 2004 federal election, the media played up the narrative the mortgage belt voted highly in favour of the Coalition, in fear that economic management under the Australian Labor Party could increase interest rates. As the Coalition ran a fear campaign on the issue and this became one of the keystones which helped it win a successive fourth term. However, it is generally agreed that governments have little control over interest rates, which are set by the Reserve Bank of Australia. There is little evidence in the political science literature to support the media's narrative for the mortgage belt making negative economic assessments of the Labor Party instead leader effects had a far larger impact on vote choice with a significant effect for negative assessments of the Labor leader, Mark Latham, on the defection of Labor partisans to the Coalition. In March 2005, interest rates rose by a quarter of a percent. Mortgage belt areas played a significant role in the 2007 election where Labor won back many mortgage belt Liberal strongholds won in the 1996 election due to general disaffection with the incumbent government as well as high interest rates. The term has also seen use in New Zealand by political and economic commentators.

Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), also commonly referred to as the Steel Seizure Case or the Youngstown Steel case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that limited the power of the President of the United States to seize private property. The case served as a check on the most far-reaching claims of executive power at the time and signaled the Court's increased willingness to intervene in political questions. In the midst of the Korean War, the United Steel Workers of America threatened a strike, for higher wages, against the major steel producers in the United States. As President Harry S. Truman believed that a strike of any length would cause severe dislocations for defense contractors, Truman seized control of steel production facilities, keeping the current operating management of the companies in place to run the plants under federal direction. Though the steelworkers supported the move, the steel companies launched a legal challenge to the seizure on the grounds that the president lacked the power to seize private property without express authorization from Congress. In his majority opinion, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the president lacked the power to seize the steel mills in the absence of statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. Five other justices agreed with the outcome of the case but wrote concurring opinions; some of these justices argued that the president might have the power to seize property absent legislative authorization in more extreme circumstances. Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring opinion laid out a tripartite framework of presidential power that would prove influential among legal scholars and others charged with assessing executive power. In his dissent, Chief Justice Fred Vinson argued that the president's action was necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future. Truman was stunned by the decision, but he immediately restored control of the steel mills to their owners. Background The United States was involved in the Korean War in 1950, when President Truman chose not to impose price controls, as the federal government had done during World War II. Instead, the administration attempted to avoid inflationary pressures by the creation of a Wage Stabilization Board that sought to keep down the inflation of consumer prices and wages while it avoided labor disputes whenever possible. Those efforts failed, however, to avoid a threatened strike against all major steel producers by the United Steel Workers of America when the steel industry rejected the board's proposed wage increases unless they were allowed greater price increases than the government was prepared to approve. The Truman administration believed a strike of any length would cause severe dislocations for defense contractors and the domestic economy as a whole. Unable to mediate the differences between the union and the industry, Truman decided to seize production facilities while he kept the current operating management of the companies in place to run the plants under federal direction. Rather than seizing the plants, Truman might have invoked the national emergency provisions of the Taft–Hartley Act to prevent the union from striking. The administration rejected that option, however, both from a distaste for the Act, which had been passed over Truman's own veto five years earlier and because the administration saw the industry, rather than the union, as the cause of the crisis. The administration also rejected use of the statutory procedure provided under Section 18 of the Selective Service Act, which might have permitted seizure of the industry's steel plants on the ground that compliance with the procedure was too time- consuming and that its outcome too uncertain. Truman chose not to go to Congress to obtain additional statutory authorization for a seizure of the steel industry for the same reasons. That left invocation of the President's inherent authority to act in response to a national emergency. The steelworkers favored government seizure of the plants under any available theory to a Taft–Hartley injunction against it; Arthur Goldberg, General Counsel for the Steelworkers and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), argued that the President had the inherent power to seize the plants as well as the statutory authority under the Selective Service Act and the Defense Production Act. The steel industry, on the other hand, appears to have been taken by surprise, as it had apparently assumed, until shortly before Truman made his April 8, 1952 announcement, that he would take the less risky step of seeking a national emergency injunction under the Taft–Hartley Act instead. However, the industry was, as events showed, ready to act once Truman had announced the seizure by a national television and radio broadcast. Prior history The steel companies reacted immediately by sending attorneys to the home of Judge Walter Bastian of the D.C. District Court within 30 minutes of the end of the President's speech to ask for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. Judge Bastian scheduled a hearing for 11:30 the next day to hear arguments on the motion. Because hearings on emergency motions came before a randomly-chosen judge, the hearing the next day was before Judge Alexander Holtzoff, a Truman appointee. Judge Holtzoff denied the motion on the ground that the balance of equities favored the government. The case was then assigned to Judge David Andrew Pine, who heard the steel companies' motions for a preliminary injunction. In its papers, the government stressed the ultimate constitutional issue of whether the President had the power to seize the mills. The steel companies appeared to be shying away from that issue by focusing on the equities and asking the Court merely to enjoin the federal government from entering a collective bargaining agreement with the Steelworkers. Judge Pine indicated, however, that he was interested in the fundamental issue of Presidential power. Even so, the steel companies' attorneys continued to steer the discussion back to the equities and the President's statutory power under the Taft–Hartley Act. After the attorney for one of the smaller producers, Armco Steel Corporation, finally challenged the government's right to seize its property without Congressional authorization, Judge Pine then asked the attorney for the government to respond. The Assistant Attorney General may have done more harm to the government's case than the steel companies had. Asked by Judge Pine for the source of the President's authority, he offered, \\"Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Article II of the Constitution and whatever inherent, implied or residual powers may flow therefrom.\\" When the Court asked if the government took the position that \\"when the sovereign people adopted the Constitution ... it limited the powers of the Congress and limited the powers of the judiciary, but it did not limit the powers of the Executive\\", he assured Judge Pine that to be the case. He was, however, unable to name any cases that had held that the President had that power. His presentation committed the Truman administration to an absolutist version of presidential power that went beyond the administration's own position. Truman's supporters in Congress first distanced themselves from the argument and then spread the message that Truman disavowed it as well. Finally, Truman issued a statement responding to a constituent's letter in which he acknowledged in very general terms the limitations that the Constitution imposed on his power to respond in a national emergency. Two days later, Judge Pine issued an injunction, barring the government from continuing to hold the steel plants that it had seized. The Steelworkers began their strike within minutes of the announcement of the injunction. The government promptly appealed. It first, however, formally requested for Judge Pine to stay his order and permit the government to resume control of the plants, ending the strike by the Steelworkers, but Judge Pine declined to do so. The government then applied for a stay in the D.C. Circuit. The Court, sitting en banc, granted the government's request for a stay by a 5–4 vote on April 30 and denied a motion for reconsideration by the steel companies that sought to amend the stay order to bar the government from increasing wages by the same margin the next day. The stay granted by the Court of Appeals was conditioned, however, on the government's filing of a petition for certiorari by May 2, 1952, and lasted only until the Supreme Court acted on that petition. The government filed its petition for certiorari on May 2, only to discover that the steel companies had already filed one of their own. The government renewed its request for a stay. In the meantime, the White House convened a meeting between the Steelworkers and the major steel companies on May 3. The talks made rapid progress and might have produced an agreement, but the announcement that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari and issued a stay that allowed the government to maintain possession of the steel mills but, coupled with an order barring any increase in wages during the pendency of the appeal, had removed any incentive for the steel companies to reach agreement on a new contract with the union. Proceedings The Court set the matter for oral argument on May 12, 1952, less than ten days later. The government's brief opened with an attack on Judge Pine's application of equitable principles to the facts before him but devoted much of its 175 pages to the historical records of governmental seizure of private property in wartime from the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 to Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and seizure of telegraph and railroad lines to the government's seizure of industrial properties in the First and the Second World Wars. The steel industry's brief focused instead on the lack of statutory authority for this seizure and emphasizef Congress's decision, when it had enacted the Taft–Hartley Act, to give the President the power to seek an injunction against strikes that might affect the national economy instead. It denied that the President had any power to seize private property without express legislative authorization and noted that Truman himself had asked for such legislative authority when the United Mine Workers of America went out on strike in 1950. The Court set aside five hours for oral argument and allowed the Steelworkers and the railroad unions to speak as amicus curiae. Before an overflow crowd, John W. Davis argued for the steel companies that the President had no powers to make laws or, more particularly, to seize property without Congressional authorization. He explained away his own actions when he had defended the government's seizure of property while he had been US Solicitor General in Woodrow Wilson's administration and urged the justices to look beyond the transitory labor dispute before them to the constitutional principles at stake, closing with Thomas Jefferson's words, slightly misquoted: \\"In questions of power let no more be said of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution\\". Justice Frankfurter was the only Justice to interrupt Davis, with only one question, during his argument. Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman had a rockier argument, as the Justices pressed him with questions on many of the points he made. Justice Jackson took pains to distinguish the facts concerning the seizure of the North American Aviation Company in 1941, which he had overseen as Attorney General at the time. Justice Douglas commented that if Perlman were correct as to the scope of the President's powers, there was no need for Congress. When Perlman attempted to close on a rousing note, reminding the Justices that it was during wartime, Justices Jackson and Frankfurter immediately contradicted him by noting that Congress had not declared war. Goldberg, speaking for the Steelworkers, addressed whether the Taft–Hartley Act would have allowed for injunctive relief in those circumstances. The attorneys for the railroad brotherhoods, which were parties to a similar action coming up for review, addressed the President's inherent powers. Davis then gave his rebuttal by using only a few minutes of the hour that he had reserved. Even despite the Court's evident lack of sympathy for the broad claims of inherent power made by the government, Truman and many other observers expected the Court to uphold his authority to act in the absence of express statutory authorization. Many commentators predicted that the Court would avoid the constitutional question, but others stressed the background that all of the Justices had in the New Deal and Fair Deal, when the powers of the Presidency had expanded greatly, and the past support of Justices such as Black, Reed, Frankfurter, and Douglas for the expansive application of the President's war powers. As it turns out, most of those predictions were wrong. While Justice Burton harbored fears at one point that he might be the only Justice to vote against the government's position, he was encouraged by his private conversations with other Justices. In the end, the Court voted 6–3 to affirm the District Court's injunction to bar the President from seizing the steel plants. Majority opinion Justice Black wrote for the majority opinion that was delivered exactly three weeks after the oral hearing on June 2. Black took, as he often did, an absolutist view by holding that the President had no power to act except in those cases that are expressly or implicitly authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress. Black wrote that the President's role in law-making is solely to recommend or veto laws. He cannot overtake Congress's role to create new laws.Urofsky, Melvin I., and Paul Finkelman, \\"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952).\\" Documents of American Constitutional and Legal History, third ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 723–725. Concurring opinionsWilliam O. Douglas= Douglas took a similarly-absolutist approach to the President's assertion of inherent power to cope with a national emergency. =Felix Frankfurter= Frankfurter avoided the sweeping condemnation of the administration's claims that Black and Douglas had offered. While he would not rule out the possibility that the President might acquire the power to take certain actions by a long course of conduct that was unobjected to by Congress, he found the statutory history persuasive evidence that Congress had not acquiesced, much less authorized, seizure of private property in the absence of a formal declaration of war. =Robert Jackson= Jackson's opinion took a similarly flexible approach to the issue by eschewing any fixed boundaries between the powers of Congress and the President. He divided Presidential authority towards Congress into three categories (in descending order of legitimacy): * Cases in which the President was acting with express or implied authority from Congress * Cases in which Congress had thus far been silent, referred to as a \\"zone of twilight\\" * Cases in which the President was defying congressional orders (the \\"third category\\") Jackson's framework would influence future Supreme Court cases on the president's powers and the relation between Congress and the presidency. =Harold Hitz Burton= Burton likewise concluded that Congress, not the President, had the power to act in emergencies by having the exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether the President might, in more extreme circumstances, have the authority to act. =Tom Campbell Clark= Justice Clark, who had been Truman's Attorney General for four years before Truman appointed him to the Court, rejected the absolute approach of Black and Douglas and concluded that the President had some inherent power to act in the case of grave and imperative national emergencies. Clark refused, however, to define the boundaries of that power; in his view, the fact that Congress had provided in the Taft–Hartley Act, the Selective Service Act, and the Defense Production Act for procedures that the executive could have used ended the discussion by barring the President from relying on any inherent powers that he might otherwise have to choose a solution that was other than the ones that Congress had allowed. Dissenting opinion Chief Justice Vinson dissented, joined by Justices Reed and Minton. His opinion dealt at some length with the history of presidential seizures. In the oral presentation of his opinion, he went out of his way to make a sarcastic reference to the contrary positions that Jackson and Clark had taken when they were the Attorneys General for Franklin Roosevelt and Truman, respectively. Rejecting the view that Congress had limited the executive's authority to seize property in this case by providing for different procedures in the legislation it had enacted, Vinson's opinion still appeared to recognize Congress's primacy in enacting legislation by justifying the seizure in this case as necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future. However, he mocked arguments based on the Constitution's provision that allowed the President to recommend legislation, rather than make it himself, as \\"the messenger-boy concept of the Office\\". Aftermath President Harry Truman Within minutes of the Court's ruling, Truman ordered Commerce Secretary Charles Sawyer to return the steel mills to their owners; he did so immediately. The Steelworkers went out on strike again shortly thereafter. The strike lasted for more than 50 days until the President threatened to use the somewhat-cumbersome procedures under the Selective Service Act to seize the mills. Truman was stunned by the decision, which he continued to attack years later in his Memoirs. Justice Black was concerned enough that Truman would take the decision personally that he invited Truman and his fellow Justices to a party at his home. Truman, still smarting from the defeat, was mollified somewhat by Black's hospitality; as he told Black, \\"Hugo, I don't much care for your law, but, by golly, this bourbon is good.\\" The multiplicity of opinions made it difficult to determine just what the Court had decided as to whether and when the President had authority to act without Congressional authorization. That was largely the result of the fact that the administration had made a weak case. The evidence of an actual emergency was tenuous because of the substantial stockpiles of steel products in many sectors of the economy made the administration's case even weaker by overstating its position and offering incoherent arguments in the early phases of the litigation, which turned public opinion against it, and framed the public debate in the most simplistic terms. The decision still has had a broad impact by representing a check on the most extreme claims of executive power at the time and the Court's assertion of its own role in intervening in political questions. The Court later did so in Baker v. Carr and Powell v. McCormack and also applied the Frankfurter-Jackson approach to analyzing Congress' legislative authorization of Presidential action in invalidating efforts by the Nixon administration to plant wiretaps without prior judicial approval, and it cited the case more generally in support of its decision to permit litigation against the president to proceed in Clinton v. Jones. The Supreme Court also relied on Youngstown in Medellín v. Texas, 06-984 (2008) in which President George W. Bush had pressured the state of Texas to review the murder conviction of a Mexican citizen who had tortured and raped two teenage girls in 1993 by arguing that a 2004 decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) required law enforcement authorities to tell the accused of his right under the Vienna Convention to notify Mexican diplomats of his detention. In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that ICJ rulings were not enforceable in the United States and that Bush's actions were unconstitutional. Quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Chief Justice John Roberts concluded, \\"The president's authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, 'must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself'.\\"Quoted in David Stout (March 25, 2008). \\"Justices Rule Against Bush on Death Penalty Case\\". The New York Times. However, the Court drew back from some of the implications of its decision by refusing to rely on Youngstown as authority to review the failed challenges brought against the War in Vietnam and deferring to the executive branch's authority over foreign policy in cases such as Zemel v. Rusk. The Supreme Court also cited Youngstown in the 2006 decision Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. See also * Burnet v.

She believes that she belongs in a more luxurious place and that she is destined to be a famous theatrical actress. Erica attends Barringa East primary where she is entering the 6th grade at the beginning of the novel, and she is distant towards the other students as she feels her intellect is far higher than theirs. Erica often creates highly exaggerated stories about herself to impress her classmates and hide the true lack of class in her family and is a hypochondriac, constantly visiting the School sickbay for made-up ailments. While many of the teachers at Barringa East primary are incompetent, her grade 6 teacher Miss Belmont is intelligent and disciplinary, and Erica thrives under her control. She outshines her classmates by putting effort in her projects, and just as her ego begins to bloom, a section of one of the upper-class estates surrounding Barringa East is reclassified as part of their suburb, and due to the zoning system a new student, Alison Ashley, is placed in Erica's class. Alison Ashley is a beautiful, rich, neat and intelligent girl, traits that Erica instantly grows envious of. She is seated beside Erica in class and though at first Erica wants to impress Alison in the hopes that she will befriend Erica, her jealousy of the girl grows stronger throughout the day, until she finally pushes Alison away. Over the next few days, Alison's organisation and talent angers Erica until finally she snaps, offending Alison and calling her a snob. On many occasions, Alison appears to want to instigate a friendship, though Erica stubbornly turns her away out of spite and envy. Alison visits Erica's house, and after Erica's family humiliates her several times she accuses Alison of being judgmental and nosy. Shortly after, Erica finds Alison's belongings mixed up with hers and begrudgingly returns them to her, envious of Alison's luxurious house and clean living which is the polar opposite of her own. Though Alison attempts to be friendly, Erica unintentionally wakes up Alison's mother who has a demanding late-night job, and after she furiously asks Alison who is with her, Alison quickly says \\"No one,\\" something Erica views as the ultimate indignity and causes her to once again refuse to speak to Alison. The two girls are later placed in a cabin and group together on the annual Grade Six camp. Erica is once again outdone and thus infuriated by Alison Ashley, particularly in the camp play, where she is horrified to discover that she, having always dreamed of being an actress, suffers from stage fright while Alison displays skill as an actress and is cast in the lead role. On performance she can not bear to watch Alison take the spotlight and flees to her cabin, where she is touched to find that Alison has compiled the script that Erica wrote for the play into a book as a gesture of friendship. Erica also discovers that although Alison was in the lead role, her mother did not bother to attend the camp performance night as she cared little about her daughter, revealing to Erica that Alison was genuinely envious of her chaotic but warm family life and making Erica reconsider her disdain for her family. Erica and Alison reconcile and become friends.

Since July 2012, the organisation has been officially known as NPS MedicineWise. NPS MedicineWise provides practical tools (such as medicines lists), evidence- based information, and educational activities, with the intention of improving the way health technologies, including how medicines and medical tests, are prescribed and used. Overview NPS MedicineWise was founded in 1998 as part of an Australian Government shift in health policy to address issues around Quality Use of Medicines (QUM). NPS MedicineWise' initial mandate was to reduce cost of medicines to Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) by providing clinically reviewed independent information about medicines to doctors, pharmacists, and other health professionals. Many of these materials relate to new drugs or more complex grey-areas in the prescription process. Since 2003, NPS MedicineWise has assumed a secondary mandate: promoting discussion of basic medicine-related issues in the community via consumer education programs and major award-winning campaigns, including Be Medicinewise Week, launched in January 2011. The campaign has been broadcast across a wide spectrum of media channels and addressed common health issues such as lower back pain, antibiotics, and the active ingredient of medicines. Although NPS MedicineWise has brought wide-ranging savings to the Australian health system, critics have questioned the actual causes and ramifications of such savings.\\"You're joking. Nearly all the reduction in prescribing is because of the threat of Medicare investigating us for not being below the 50th percentile. Nothing to do with balanced education and practical advice to GPs.\\" Dr. I-M Suspicioustoo. http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/commentall.asp?artid=201782534 However the savings reported by the organisation are comprehensively evaluated and accepted by government, demonstrating a clear correlation between NPS MedicineWise programs and improved prescribing.  Historical success  In the period between 1998 and 2004, 90% of all GPs were actively involved in one or more educational activities run by NPS MedicineWise, while approximately sixty per cent of GPs and pharmacists rated its printed educational materials as good or very good. NPS MedicineWise activities have generated substantial financial savings to the PBS, with the organisation claiming that its information and education campaigns have reduced unnecessary prescriptions and improved prescribing decisions within the medical community. Various health professionals argue that, despite potential conflicts between cost-saving and the organisation's Quality Use of Medicines mandate, NPS Medicinewise will continue to improve on the current PBS system.Moulds R (2003). \\"Good prescribing: where to next?\\".

He previously played for the San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, Arizona Diamondbacks, Houston Astros, and Washington Nationals. He has also competed for the Mexican national baseball team in the 2006, 2009, and 2013 World Baseball Classics. Professional careerSan Diego Padres= Pérez was signed by the San Diego Padres as an amateur free agent in 1999. He made his debut with the Padres in . Pérez did well for a rookie after being called up by the Padres in 2002, striking out over a batter per inning, but he suffered from control issues at times. He regressed somewhat in . =Pittsburgh Pirates= In August 2003, Pérez was sent by San Diego to Pittsburgh along with Jason Bay and Cory Stewart in exchange for Brian Giles. Before the season, the team overhauled his pitching mechanics. His average of 10.97 strikeouts per nine innings was highest in the Majors (239 SO/196 IP); his 2.98 ERA was fifth in the National League (tied with Roger Clemens); and his 12–10 record could have been ever better with reasonable run support early in the season. Pirates' bats provided two or fewer runs in Pérez' 16 starts before All-Star break, causing him to post a 5–4 record with five no decisions despite a 3.24 ERA. In that season, Pérez pitched at least six innings and allowed three or fewer runs in 21 of his 30 starts (70%). Through this first three seasons, Pérez had compiled a 20–25 record with 474 strikeouts and a 3.86 ERA in 412.2 innings. His 239 strikeouts that year are currently the third-most in a season by a modern-day Pirate, trailing only Bob Veale's 276 in and 250 in . By contrast, Pérez's season was disappointing. He posted a 5.85 ERA in a season plagued by injuries. The Pirates were forced to place him on the disabled list on June 29 after he broke his toe kicking a cart following a loss to St. Louis. He missed two and a half months, returning in September to post a 4.58 ERA in 19.2 late season innings. Pérez had also lost significant speed off his fastball. Pérez represented Mexico in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, where Mexico was eliminated in the second group stage. In 2006, Pérez opened the Pirates' season as the number one starter. On June 27, Pérez was sent to the Pirates bullpen after struggling through the first half of the season with an ERA over 6.00. On June 29, he was sent to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, with Tom Gorzelanny being called up to replace him in the starting rotation. =New York Mets= New York Mets in 2010 On July 31, 2006, Pérez and Roberto Hernández were traded to the New York Mets in exchange for Xavier Nady. The Mets assigned Pérez to their AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides. He was recalled to the Mets' major league roster on August 26, 2006. After two subpar starts, Pérez threw a complete game shutout against the Atlanta Braves in the second game of a doubleheader on September 6. After the Mets lost two starting pitchers to injury in the final week before the playoffs started, they were forced to use Pérez in the playoff rotation. His first playoff start came in Game 4 of the NLCS, in which he picked up his first career postseason win. His second playoff start came in Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS vs. the Cardinals. He pitched six innings in, allowing one ER, and was on the mound for Endy Chavez's famous catch. The Mets eventually lost the game 3–1. Entering the season, there were concerns about the Mets' pitching staff and whether Pérez could live up to his potential. However, Pérez finished the 2007 season 15–10 with a 3.56 ERA, striking out 174 in 177 innings pitched, while walking 79 (7th-most in the NL). In the 2008 season, Pérez was inconsistent, posting a record of 10–7 with a 4.22 ERA. He was also prone to big innings striking at any moment. An example was in a start against the San Francisco Giants, he went of an inning allowing 5 hits and 6 runs, all of them earned. An example of his dominance was his start against the New York Yankees on June 29. Pérez went 7 innings allowing just one run on a home run by Wilson Betemit, striking out a season-high 8 batters. After the firing of manager Willie Randolph, Pérez pitched better. At the request of Pedro Martínez and pitching coach Dan Warthen, he changed his delivery to the plate. Instead of letting his head hang down when he made his delivery, he made a bowing motion. He led the majors in walks, with 105, and was 10th in the NL in wild pitches, with 9. His 17 no decisions were the most among MLB starting pitchers in 2008. On February 3, , the Mets signed Pérez to a three-year $36 million deal. On May 6, Pérez was put on the disabled list due to patellar tendinitis in his right leg. He returned to the rotation on July 8, 2009. On August 26, Pérez was diagnosed with patellar tendinitis in his right knee and underwent season-ending surgery. He finished the season 3–4 with a 6.82 ERA. Pérez with the Harrisburg Senators in On May 15, 2010, manager Jerry Manuel moved Pérez to the bullpen. Pérez refused a minor league assignment to work on his pitching, despite both his poor play and repeated attempts by the Mets' front office. On June 5, 2010, the Mets placed Pérez on the 15-day DL due to patella tendinitis of his right knee. As Pérez was placed on the DL soon after refusing an assignment to the minor leagues a second time, the league investigated the timing of the DL stint, later clearing it. After July 21, Pérez made only six appearances, all in relief. Pérez finished the 2010 season 0-5, with a 6.80 ERA in 46.1 innings pitched. The Mets unconditionally released Pérez on March 21, 2011, still responsible for the remaining $12 million on his contract. =Washington Nationals= On March 23, 2011, the Washington Nationals signed Pérez to a minor league contract. Perez chose to join the Nationals because their pitching coordinator, Spin Williams, was his pitching coach with Pittsburgh. Pérez was assigned to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League. He was 3-5 and pitched to a 3.09 ERA in 15 starts, but did not receive a promotion. Williams suggested to Pérez that he should transition into a relief pitcher.Oliver Perez wants to reward Nats for initiating career revival - Nationals Pastime =Seattle Mariners= Seattle Mariners in 2013 On January 19, 2012, the Seattle Mariners signed Pérez to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. The contract contained a $750,000 bonus for making the Mariners 25-man roster and $250,000 in performance incentives. Pérez made 22 relief appearances with the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, was 2-2 with a 4.65 ERA, and was promoted to the major league club on June 16 as a reliever. In his first month back in the majors since 2010, observers took note of his improved fastball velocity and strikeout-to-walk ratio. In 2012, Pérez went 1-3 with a 2.12 ERA with 29.2 innings in 33 games. On November 3, Pérez signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with up to $600,000 in performance bonuses. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On March 10, 2014, the Arizona Diamondbacks officially confirmed that Pérez had signed a two-year, $4.25 million contract. =Houston Astros= Houston Astros in 2015 On August 7, 2015, the Arizona Diamondbacks traded Pérez to the Houston Astros for minor league pitcher Junior Garcia. In 2015 with Houston, he was 0-3 with a 6.75 ERA. He was included on the Astros ALDS roster against the Kansas City, he was 0-0 with a 27.00 ERA in 2 appearances as the Astros lost in five games. =Second stint with the Nationals= Washington Nationals in 2016 On December 11, 2015, Pérez signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the Washington Nationals. On April 24, 2016, with the Nationals trailing the Minnesota Twins after 15 innings, and with two outs and Nationals shortstop Danny Espinosa on second base, Pérez hit a bunt that appeared to be rolling foul, but Minnesota catcher John Ryan Murphy picked it up and threw it away while attempting a putout at first, allowing Espinosa to score the tying run from second. In the next inning, Washington right fielder Chris Heisey hit a leadoff home run to end the game, and Pérez was credited with the win. In 2016, he was 2-3 with a 4.95 ERA. In 2017, he was 0-0 with a 4.64 ERA. =Cincinnati Reds= On February 24, 2018, Pérez signed a minor-league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. He was released on March 22, 2018. =New York Yankees= On March 31, 2018, Pérez signed a minor-league contract with the New York Yankees. He was released on June 1, 2018, after exercising an opt-out clause that would grant him his release if he was not called up to the majors. =Cleveland Indians= Cleveland Indians in 2019 On June 2, 2018, Pérez signed a major-league deal with the Cleveland Indians. He contributed to a notable oddity on June 29, when he recorded a relief appearance with a walk and no pitches. This is because under recent MLB rules changes, it was no longer necessary to actually pitch four balls in order to grant an intentional walk. After Perez had been brought into the game by manager Terry Francona to pitch to left-handed batter Dustin Fowler, Oakland Athletics' manager Bob Melvin sent right-handed batter Mark Canha to pinch hit. Francona then ordered an intentional base on balls, and Canha was awarded first base with no pitches being thrown. Melvin then had Chad Pinder (right) pinch-hit for Matt Joyce (left), so Francona countered by replacing Pérez with right-handed reliever Zach McAllister, thus making Pérez the first MLB pitcher to officially pitch in a game without actually throwing any pitches. The Indians re-signed Pérez to a one-year contract on January 25, 2019. The deal includes a vesting option for the 2020 season. For the 2019 season, Pérez finished with a 3.98 ERA in 67 games. On July 26, 2020, Pérez appeared in the 18th Major League season of his career, becoming the longest-tenured Mexican player in league history. With the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Pérez appeared in 21 games, compiling a 1-1 record with 2.00 ERA and 14 strikeouts in 18.0 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/oliver-perez-424144 Personal life Pérez and his wife have three children.

He was introduced in 1979 in response to the popularity of the Phillie Phanatic introduced one year earlier, as the Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies had a fierce intrastate rivalry at the time. History The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named \\"Captain Flint\\". The Parrot debuted on April Fools' Day, 1979 when he \\"hatched\\" at Three Rivers Stadium. That year, the \\"We Are Family\\" Bucs went on to win the World Series, with the Parrot serving as somewhat of a cheerleader to the crowd along the way. The Pirate Parrot getting involved in the Great Pierogi Race, seen with Oliver Onion and Cheese Chester. His initial appearance bore more resemblance to The San Diego Chicken, being thinner and \\"meaner\\". He wore more pirate-related items such as a captain's hat and vest, and often waved a Jolly Roger around on a flag pole. Shortly before the Pittsburgh drug trials of 1985 (see below), the Parrot was redesigned to his current appearance, gaining weight and making him more goofy-looking in order for him to appeal to children more. In addition, he dropped the traditional pirate garb in favor of wearing a Pirates jersey and backwards baseball cap. In 1995, the Parrot was briefly paired with a secondary mascot, the Buccaneer, who was quickly dropped.Fuoco, Michael A. \\"Buccaneer swims clear of trouble with the law\\", The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 24, 1995, p. A16. The Parrot has become a staple within the Pittsburgh region, often appearing at events and Pirates team functions. He often appears in ads for the team on television. He has been embraced more in Pittsburgh among older fans than Steely McBeam of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and along with Iceburgh of the Pittsburgh Penguins serves as one of two bird-based mascots in Pittsburgh. In May 1986 the Pirate Parrot joined in the Pittsburgh section of Hands Across America. The three Pittsburgh mascots have been known to \\"fight\\" each other. In 2008, a parody attack ad based on the then-upcoming Presidential election was made to \\"attack\\" the Parrot, due to the Pirates then-16 consecutive losing seasons while the Penguins went on to lose in the Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings earlier in the year. (The Pens would win the Stanley Cup the following year.) The following year, all three mascots took part in a groundbreaking of an expansion of the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, with Steely McBeam tossing dirt at the Parrot's feet. In some cases, the Parrot has accompanied the Pirates on road trips if the game is in close proximity to Pittsburgh. For instance, the Parrot appeared at two games for the Pirates during a weekend interleague series against the Cleveland Indians in Cleveland in 2012, with the Parrot having friendly interactions with the Indians mascot, Slider, and even assisting Slider in interfering with the Indians Hot Dog Race, much like what the Parrot does with the Great Pierogi Race.http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2012/06/17/indians-notes-travis- hafner-pleased-with-rehab-feels-good/ According to the Parrot's biography on the Pirates official website, the Parrot hopes to eventually be inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame. As of 2015, he has yet to be listed as a candidate, much less inducted. Impact on the Pittsburgh drug trials Kevin Koch, the original portrayer of the Pirate Parrot, was later discovered to be high from cocaine during several games as the Pirate Parrot, and was later discovered to be the \\"middle man\\" between players and drug dealers, introducing them to cocaine. The trials proved to be an embarrassment to baseball. Koch, who has lived a private life since, has shown regret for doing cocaine and sharing it with the players. Despite the embarrassment to the scandal, the Pirates kept the Parrot, although Koch himself was fired.

This was at a point when Conservative fortunes were starting to turn and Bevan's Labour Party was facing disillusionment and division. Young Tories took on the description with ironic self-deprecation and set up the Vermin Club. Members took to wearing vermin badges (a chrome badge featuring a rat and the word VERMIN).

Spreckels, and dubbed \\"The Impossible Railroad\\" by engineers of its day due to the immense logistical challenges involved. It linked San Diego, its western terminus, with El Centro, its eastern terminus, where passengers could connect with Southern Pacific's transcontinental lines, eliminating the need to first travel north via Los Angeles or Riverside. The company charter was executed on December 14, 1906, and the groundbreaking ceremony was held the following September. Numerous delays (including government intervention during World War I) delayed the completion of the line to November 15, 1919. Damage to the lines from both natural disasters and sabotage exerted great financial pressure on the company, and in 1932 Spreckels' heirs sold their interests in the railroad to the Southern Pacific, which was named the San Diego & Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&AE;). History The company was chartered on December 14, 1906, and groundbreaking ceremonies held at the intersection of San Diego's Main and 26th Streets on September 7, 1907. Construction delays, attacks by Mexican revolutionaries, and government intervention during World War I all served to push the construction completion to November 15, 1919 when the \\"golden spike\\" was finally driven by John Spreckels. J.D. Spreckels drives the \\"golden spike\\" to ceremonially complete the San Diego and Arizona Railway on November 15, 1919. The first through SD&A; passenger train left Campo on the morning of November 30, and made the full run from El Centro to San Diego's downtown Union Station for the official opening of the line on December 1, 1919. The total construction cost of the of track laid was approximately $18 million, or some $123,000 per mile; the original estimate was $6 million. The long segment through Carrizo Gorge (which included of tunnels, 17 in all) alone cost over $4 million to construct; the three miles (5 km) of tunnels (21 total) along the entire line ran another $1.8 million. Almost of bridges and trestles were built as well. The tracks departed downtown San Diego south where they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border at San Ysidro. From there the line traversed eastward through Tijuana, then headed northeast through Tecate and back over the border to the town of Campo. To construct and maintain the 44-mile (72 kilometer) stretch through Mexico the SD&A; formed the Ferrocarril Tijuana y Tecate, S.A. de C.V., at the behest of the Mexican government. East of Campo the road traveled through Clover Flats, across the Coast Range (elevation 3,660 feet), then descended through the breathtaking but treacherous Carrizo Gorge, the builders' most significant obstacle. Though the SD&A; line ended in Seeley, trackage rights gave the railroad the ability to run trains as far east as El Centro and as far south as Calexico. Branch lines ran from downtown to as far north and east as the community of Lakeside, with a separate line which rounded San Diego Bay to service Coronado Heights, Coronado, and North Island. Damage to the lines from heavy rainstorms, landslides, and fires took a financial toll on the railroad, as did border closings with Mexico. Clashes with the Industrial Workers of the World resulted in acts of vandalism as well. In 1932, financial difficulties forced Spreckels' heirs to sell their interests in the firm for $2.8 million to the Southern Pacific, which renamed the railroad the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway (SD&AE;). Timeline * 1873: The Texas and Pacific Railroad fails in an attempt to establish a direct rail link between San Diego and the East during the \\"Panic of 1873.\\" * 1905: The San Diego and Eastern Railroad (SD&E;) conducts a survey for a planned rail line to Arizona but folds prior to commencing track laying. * December 14, 1906: John D. Spreckels announces he will form the San Diego and Arizona Railway Company (SD&A;) and build a line between San Diego and El Centro. Spreckels has an agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) to silently fund the project (ironically, Spreckels later became an outspoken critic of the Southern Pacific Railroad and their monopolistic practices, and often used his newspaper interests as a platform to denounce the company and its officers). * September 7, 1907: Groundbreaking ceremonies for the SD&A; are held in downtown San Diego at the foot of 26th Street (now known as Dewey Street) and Main Street. The line will follow in part the route surveyed by the defunct SD&E.; * 1909: The Mexican Government orders the SD&A; to form the Tijuana and Tecate Railway Company, which will construct and hold a 99-year lease on the Mexican rail segment. * July 29, 1910: The first passenger train on the SD&A; enters Mexico. * 1911: Mexican revolutionaries mount several attacks on the SD&A; construction crews to conscript soldiers and supplies, and cut telephone wires. * 1916: The \\"Great Flood\\" washes out several rail lines. World War I increases the cost of railway construction materials by 50 to 150 percent. * 1917: The U.S. federal government seizes control of all railroads and stops construction of the SD&A; as part of its war effort to conserve resources, but later grants Spreckels special exemption on the grounds the SD&A; will serve a military installation. The SD&A; absorbs the struggling San Diego and Southeastern Railway (SDSR), assuming operation of the company's steam divisions and gas-electric motor cars. The San Diego Electric Railway (SDERy) continues to operate the interurban line to Chula Vista under lease. The remaining SDSR tracks not damaged in the previous year's flooding function as a \\"bridge\\" line between the SD&A; and SDERy, which allows for the interchange of freight traffic. * November 15, 1919: The \\"golden spike\\" is driven and construction of the SD&A; is completed at a cost of $18 million (three times the original estimate). The first SD&A; through passenger train \\"arrives\\" in San Diego on December 1, 1919 to officially open the line. * December 1, 1919: The first passenger train \\"arrives\\" in San Diego from El Centro for the official line opening ceremony. * December 10, 1919: Through Pullman service to Chicago is initiated; the cars are switched to the Southern Pacific's Golden State passenger train in Yuma. * 1922: A new emblem, depicting a scene in the Carrizo Gorge and lettered \\"San Diego Short Line,\\" is adopted. * 1926, 1927, and 1929: Heavy rains take out large sections of trackage east of San Diego. * 1928: Motor service to La Mesa and Lakeside is discontinued. The film Beggars of Life is filmed along the line. * January 1932: Fire breaks out in Tunnel 3 in Baja California, which leads to a collapse. Repairs take 45 days. * March 27, 1932: A huge mountain slide, loosened by heavy rains, blocks the line in the vicinity of Tunnel 15. Repairs are completed and freight and passenger services are re-established on July 6 and 7th. * October 22, 1932: Tunnel 7 burns and is subsequently abandoned. * October 24, 1932: Financial problems force Spreckels' heirs to transfer their share of SD&A; ownership to the Southern Pacific Transportation Company for $2.8 million. * January 23, 1933: A bypass track along the cliff at Tunnel 7 is completed and the line is reopened to traffic. * February 1, 1933: The San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway assumes all operations of the SD&A.; * December 1985, the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum revives the historic San Diego & Arizona Railway name (reporting mark SDAX), inaugurating its Golden State demonstration passenger trains over the railway out of Campo, CA east to Miller Creek and west to Division and tunnel four at the international border. These trips continue to this day.

It was discovered on 18 July 1968, by Chilean astronomers Carlos Torres and S. Cofre at the Cerro El Roble Station of Chile's National Astronomical Observatory, and named after the indigenous warrior Galvarino.  Classification and orbit  Galvarino is a stony S-type asteroid and a member of the Eos family, an orbital group of more than 4,000 asteroids, which are well known for mostly being of stony composition with a relatively high albedo. It is also classified as a M- and L-type asteroids by WISE and PanSTARRS, respectively. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.1 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,890 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. Its observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in 1968, as no precoveries and no previous identifications were made.  Physical characteristics  As of 2016, a single rotational lightcurve of Galvarino has been obtained. The photometric observations were made in the 1990s, giving a well-defined rotation period of 7.004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.6 magnitude (). According to the surveys carried out by NASA's WISE satellite with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 9.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.145, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.14 and calculates a diameter of 10.2 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the indigenous warrior Galvarino, the heroic figure during the Arauco War, a long-running conflict between colonial Spaniards and the Mapuche people of the 16th century in what is now Chile. He was condemned by the Spanish soldiers to have his hands cut off and then to be freed as a living lesson to other Indians. Since his request for death was not granted, he promised revenge. He continued to fight the conquerors until recaptured and condemned to the gallows. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 June 1980 ().

He made contributions to quantum mechanics, radio wave propagation in the atmosphere, solid state physics, and information theory. Early life Brillouin was born in Sèvres, near Paris, France. His father, Marcel Brillouin, grandfather, Éleuthère Mascart, and great-grandfather, Charles Briot, were physicists as well. Education From 1908 to 1912, Brillouin studied physics at the École Normale Supérieure, in Paris. From 1911 he studied under Jean Perrin until he left for the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), in 1912. At LMU, he studied theoretical physics with Arnold Sommerfeld. Just a few months before Brillouin's arrival at LMU, Max von Laue had conducted his experiment showing X-ray diffraction in a crystal lattice. In 1913, he went back to France to study at the University of Paris and it was in this year that Niels Bohr submitted his first paper on the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.Bohr Model – Niels Bohr On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules, Philosophical Magazine Series 6, Volume 26, July 1913, pp. 1–25. From 1914 until 1919, during World War I, he served in the military, developing the valve amplifier with G. A. Beauvais.M. A. Ainslie, Principles of Sonar Performance Modeling (Springer, 2010), p12 At the conclusion of the war, he returned to the University of Paris to continue his studies with Paul Langevin, and was awarded his Docteur ès science in 1920.Brillouin thesis title: La théorie des solides et les quanta, as cited in Mehra, Volume 5, Part 2, p. 882. Brillouin's thesis jury was composed of Langevin, Marie Curie, and Jean Perrin and his thesis topic was on the quantum theory of solids. In his thesis, he proposed an equation of state based on the atomic vibrations (phonons) that propagate through it. He also studied the propagation of monochromatic light waves and their interaction with acoustic waves, i.e., scattering of light with a frequency change, which became known as Brillouin scattering.Mehra, Volume 5, Part 2, p. 579.Léon Brillouin – Biography Career After receipt of his doctorate, Brillouin became the scientific secretary of the reorganized Journal de Physique et le Radium. In 1932, he became associate director of the physics laboratories at the Collège de France. In 1926, Gregor Wentzel,Gregor Wentzel Eine Verallgemeinerun der Quantenbedingungen für die Zwecke der Wellenmechanik, Z. Physik. 38 518–529 (1926). As cieted in Mehra, 2001, Volume 5, Part 2, p. 961. Hendrik Kramers,H. A. Kramers Wellenmechanik und halbzahlige Quantisierung, Z. Physik. 39 828-840 (1926). As cited in Mehra, 2001, Volume 5, Part 2, p. 920. and BrillouinLéon Brillouin La mécanique ondulatoire de Schrödinger; une méthode générale de resolution par approximations successives, Comptes rendus (Paris) 183 24–26 (1926). As cited in Mehra, 2001, Volume 5, Part 2, p. 882. independently developed what is known as the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation, also known as the WKB method, classical approach, and phase integral method.Schiff, 1968, p. 269. In 1928, after the Institut Henri Poincaré was established, he was appointed as professor to the Chair for Theoretical Physics. During his work on the propagation of electron waves in a crystal lattice, he introduced the concept of Brillouin zones in 1930. Quantum mechanical perturbations techniques by Brillouin and by Eugene Wigner resulted in what is known as the Brillouin–Wigner formula.Author Catalog: Brillouin – American Philosophical Society Since Brillouin's study with Sommerfeld, he was interested and did pioneering work in the diffraction of electromagnetic radiation in a dispersive media.Léon Brillouin Über die Fortpflanzung des Lichtes in dispergierenden Medien, Ann. d. Phys. (4) 44 203–240 (1914), as cited in Mehra, Volume 1, Part 2, p. 746. As a specialist in radio wave propagation, Brillouin was appointed Director General of the French state-run agency, Radiodiffusion Nationale about a month before war with Germany, August 1939. In May 1940, upon the collapse of France, as part of the government, he retired to Vichy. Six months later, he resigned and went to the United States. Until 1942, Brillouin was a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and then he was a professor at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island, until 1943. For the next two years, he was a research scientist with the National Defense Research Committee at Columbia University, working in the field of radar. From 1947 to 1949, he was professor of applied mathematics at Harvard University. During the period 1952 to 1954, he was with IBM Corporation in Poughkeepsie, New York, as well as a staff member of the IBM Watson Laboratory at Columbia University. In 1954, he became an adjunct professor at Columbia University. He lived in New York City until he died in 1969. His wife Marcelle died in 1986. Brillouin was a founder of modern solid state physics for which he discovered, among other things, Brillouin zones. He applied information theory to physics and the design of computers and coined the concept of negentropy to demonstrate the similarity between entropy and information. Brillouin offered a solution to the problem of Maxwell's demon. In his book, Relativity Reexamined, he called for a \\"painful and complete re-appraisal\\" of relativity theory which \\"is now absolutely necessary.\\" Honors *1953 - Elected to the US National Academy of Sciences Books * Les mesures en haute fréquence, with H.

United States, and since 1998 has been the research director at the M.I.N.D. Institute, an affiliate of UC Davis, engaged in interdisciplinary research into the causes and treatment of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Amaral joined the UC Davis faculty as a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Neuroscience and as an investigator at the California Regional Primate Research Center in 1991. Since 1995, he has been a professor of psychiatry in the UC Davis School of Medicine, with an appointment to the Center for Neuroscience.David G. Amaral Education In 1972, Amaral earned his bachelor's degree in psychology from Northwestern University, and in 1977 his PhD in neurobiology and psychology at the University of Rochester. From 1977 to 1980, Amaral was a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellow with Dr. W. Maxwell Cowan at the Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis, Missouri. Research Amaral is a specialist on the organization and functioning of the hippocampus, the amygdala and other parts of the primate and human brain. Amaral has directed several million dollars worth of research with grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which has included primate research investigations on the function of the amygdala, a brain region associated with emotion processing. Amaral investigated \\"Postmortem Neuroanatomical Evaluation of the Amygdaloid Complex in Autism\\". His earlier studies detected alterations in the amygdala, which some have speculated underlies the social and emotional abnormalities in autism. Amaral's awards include the McKnight Foundation Scholars Award, 1981, the Sloan Foundation Fellow, 1983, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Merit Award, 1989 and 1993. He is the first holder of the Beneto Foundation Chair, an endowed position at UC Davis created by the Beneto Foundation of Sacramento. Amaral was the President of the International Society for Autism Research and is the Editor-in-Chief of the society's journal Autism Research. MIND Institute Amaral was the founding Research Director of the MIND Institute. This institute was started at UC Davis in collaboration with the parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Amaral's research team is dedicated to understanding the biological and behavioral features of autism, with the goal of prevention and decreased disability. The partnership between the parents and Amaral's team of researchers secured $34 million in funding from the California legislature, primarily for research purposes. After raising additional funds and building a state-of-the-art facility in Sacramento, California, the institute has become one the premier autism research centers in the world. The MIND Institute studies all aspects of autism spectrum disorder. Amaral heads a unique longitudinal analysis of young children with autism call the Autism Phenome Project. Started in 2006, this project involves over 400 families as of 2015 and is determining unique features of brain development in children as young as two years of age.

The biscuits are similar to Eccles cake as well as the Golden Raisin Biscuits once made by Sunshine Biscuits. Popular with British consumers as a snack for over 150 years, the Garibaldi biscuit is conventionally consumed with tea or coffee, into which it may be dunked in informal social settings. The biscuits also exist under different names in other countries, including Australia (with the name: \\"Full O'Fruit\\") and New Zealand (with the name: \\"Fruitli Golden Fruit\\"). Appearance When bought in supermarkets in the UK (under several brands, all very similar), Garibaldi biscuits usually come in four strips of five biscuits each. They have a golden brown, glazed exterior and a moderately sweet pastry, but their defining characteristic is the layer of squashed fruit which gives rise to the colloquial names fly sandwiches, flies' graveyards, dead fly biscuits, or squashed fly biscuits, because the squashed fruit resemble squashed flies. History The Garibaldi biscuit was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian general and leader of the struggle to unify Italy. Garibaldi made a popular visit to South Shields in England in 1854. The biscuit was first manufactured by the Bermondsey biscuit company Peek Freans in 1861 following the recruitment of Jonathan Carr, one of the great biscuit makers of Carlisle. In the United States, the Sunshine Biscuit Company for many years made a popular version of the Garibaldi with raisins which it called \\"Golden Fruit\\". Sunshine was bought out by the Keebler Company which briefly expanded the line to include versions filled with other fruits. The entire Golden Fruit product line was discontinued when the Keebler company became a division of Kellogg's in 2001. Varieties covered with plain or milk chocolate have also been marketed in the past, but appear not to have been available for many years.

Planetary protection is a guiding principle in the design of an interplanetary mission, aiming to prevent biological contamination of both the target celestial body and the Earth in the case of sample-return missions. Planetary protection reflects both the unknown nature of the space environment and the desire of the scientific community to preserve the pristine nature of celestial bodies until they can be studied in detail. There are two types of interplanetary contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another celestial body. Back contamination is the transfer of extraterrestrial organisms, if such exist, back to the Earth's biosphere. History The potential problem of lunar and planetary contamination was first raised at the International Astronautical Federation VIIth Congress in Rome in 1956. In 1958Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars (2006) - Page 12 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) passed a resolution stating, “The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America urges that scientists plan lunar and planetary studies with great care and deep concern so that initial operations do not compromise and make impossible forever after critical scientific experiments.” This led to creation of the ad hoc Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX), which met for a year and recommended that interplanetary spacecraft be sterilized, and stated, “The need for sterilization is only temporary. Mars and possibly Venus need to remain uncontaminated only until study by manned ships becomes possible”.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars In 1959, planetary protection was transferred to the newly formed Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). COSPAR in 1964 issued Resolution 26 affirming that: 400pxrightthumbSignatories of the Outer Space Treaty - includes all current and aspiring space faring nation states. By signing the treaty, these nation states have all committed themselves to planetary protection. In 1967, the US, USSR, and UK ratified the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The legal basis for planetary protection lies in Article IX of this treaty: This treaty has since been signed and ratified by 104 nation states. Another 24 have signed but not ratified. All the current space-faring nation states have both signed and ratified it. Amongst nations with space faring aspirations, some have not yet ratified: the United Arab Emirates, Syria and North Korea have signed but not yet ratified. The Outer Space Treaty has consistent and widespread international support, and as a result of this, together with the fact that it is based on the 1963 declaration which was adopted by consensus in the UN National Assembly, it has taken on the status of customary international law. The provisions of the Outer Space Treaty are therefore binding on all states, even those who have neither signed nor ratified it. For forward contamination, the phrase to be interpreted is \\"harmful contamination\\". Two legal reviews came to differing interpretations of this clause (both reviews were unofficial). However the currently accepted interpretation is that “any contamination which would result in harm to a state’s experiments or programs is to be avoided”. NASA policy states explicitly that “the conduct of scientific investigations of possible extraterrestrial life forms, precursors, and remnants must not be jeopardized”.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars, page 13 Summarizes this para in the book: COSPAR recommendations and categories The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) meets every two years, in a gathering of 2000 to 3000 scientists,COSPAR scientific assemblies and one of its tasks is to develop recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. Its legal basis is Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 ) - Page 13 (see history below for details). Its recommendations depend on the type of space mission and the celestial body explored.COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY (20 October 2002; As Amended to 24 March 2011) COSPAR categorizes the missions into 5 groups: *Category I: Any mission to locations not of direct interest for chemical evolution or the origin of life, such as the Sun or Mercury. No planetary protection requirements.Office of Planetary Protection - About The Categories *Category II: Any mission to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution and the origin of life, but only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations. Examples include the Moon, Venus, and comets. Requires simple documentation only, primarily to outline intended or potential impact targets, and an end of mission report of any inadvertent impact site if such occurred. *Category III: Flyby and orbiter missions to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution or the origin of life, and with a significant chance that contamination could compromise investigations e.g., Mars, Europa, Enceladus. Requires more involved documentation than Category II. Other requirements, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, clean room assembly, bioburden reduction, and if impact is a possibility, inventory of organics. *Category IV: Lander or probe missions to the same locations as Category III. Measures to be applied depend on the target body and the planned operations. \\"Sterilization of the entire spacecraft may be required for landers and rovers with life-detection experiments, and for those landing in or moving to a region where terrestrial microorganisms may survive and grow, or where indigenous life may be present. For other landers and rovers, the requirements would be for decontamination and partial sterilization of the landed hardware.\\" :: Missions to Mars in category IV are subclassified further: :*Category IVa. Landers that do not search for Martian life - uses the Viking lander pre-sterilization requirements, a maximum of 300,000 spores per spacecraft and 300 spores per square meter. :*Category IVb. Landers that search for Martian life. Adds stringent extra requirements to prevent contamination of samples. :*Category IVc. Any component that accesses a Martian special region (see below) must be sterilized to at least to the Viking post-sterilization biological burden levels of 30 spores total per spacecraft. *Category V: This is further divided into unrestricted and restricted sample return. :* Unrestricted Category V: samples from locations judged by scientific opinion to have no indigenous lifeforms. No special requirements. :* Restricted Category V: (where scientific opinion is unsure) the requirements include: absolute prohibition of destructive impact upon return, containment of all returned hardware which directly contacted the target body, and containment of any unsterilized sample returned to Earth. For Category IV missions, a certain level of biological burden is allowed for the mission. In general this is expressed as a 'probability of contamination', required to be less than one chance in 10,000 of forward contamination per mission, but in the case of Mars Category IV missions (above) the requirement has been translated into a count of Bacillus spores per surface area, as an easy to use assay method.Keeping it clean More extensive documentation is also required for Category IV. Other procedures required, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, the use of clean rooms during spacecraft assembly and testing, bioload reduction, partial sterilization of the hardware having direct contact with the target body, a bioshield for that hardware, and, in rare cases, complete sterilization of the entire spacecraft. For restricted Category V missions, the current recommendationMars Sample Return backward contamination – Strategic advice and requirements - foreword and section 1.2 is that no uncontained samples should be returned unless sterilized. Since sterilization of the returned samples would destroy much of their science value, current proposals involve containment and quarantine procedures. For details, see Containment and quarantine below. Category V missions also have to fulfill the requirements of Category IV to protect the target body from forward contamination. =Mars special regions= A special region is a region classified by COSPAR where terrestrial organisms could readily propagate, or thought to have a high potential for existence of Martian life forms. This is understood to apply to any region on Mars where liquid water occurs, or can occasionally occur, based on the current understanding of requirements for life. If a hard landing risks biological contamination of a special region, then the whole lander system must be sterilized to COSPAR category IVc. Target categories Some targets are easily categorized. Others are assigned provisional categories by COSPAR, pending future discoveries and research. The 2009 COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies covered this in some detail. Most of these assessments are from that report, with some future refinements. This workshop also gave more precise definitions for some of the categories:COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies European Space Policy Institute (ESPI), 15–17 April 2009COSPAR power point type presentation, gives good overview of the detailed category decisions =Category I= * Io, Sun, Mercury, undifferentiated metamorphosed asteroids =Category II= * Callisto, comets, asteroids of category P, D, and C, Venus,Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Venus Missions -- Letter Report Kuiper belt objects (KBO) < 1/2 size of Pluto. =Provisional Category II= * Ganymede, Titan, Triton, the Pluto-Charon system, and other large KBOs (> 1/2 size of Pluto),COSPAR Final Ceres, Provisionally, they assigned these objects to Category II. However, they state that more research is needed, because there is a remote possibility that the tidal interactions of Pluto and Charon could maintain some water reservoir below the surface. Similar considerations apply to the other larger KBOs. Triton is insufficiently well understood at present to say it is definitely devoid of liquid water. The only close up observations to date are those of Voyager 2. In a detailed discussion of Titan, scientists concluded that there was no danger of contamination of its surface, except short term adding of negligible amounts of organics, but Titan could have a below surface water reservoir that communicates with the surface, and if so, this could be contaminated. In the case of Ganymede, the question is, given that its surface shows pervasive signs of resurfacing, is there any communication with its subsurface ocean? They found no known mechanism by which this could happen, and the Galileo spacecraft found no evidence of cryovolcanism. Initially, they assigned it as Priority B minus, meaning that precursor missions are needed to assess its category before any surface missions. However, after further discussion they provisionally assigned it to Category II, so no precursor missions are required, depending on future research. If there is cryovolcanism on Ganymede or Titan, the undersurface reservoir is thought to be 50 – 150 km below the surface. They were unable to find a process that could transfer the surface melted water back down through 50 km of ice to the under surface sea.COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Titan and Ganymede This is why both Ganymede and Titan were assigned a reasonably firm provisional Category II, but pending results of future research. Icy bodies that show signs of recent resurfacing need further discussion and might need to be assigned to a new category depending on future research. This approach has been applied, for instance, to missions to Ceres. The planetary protection Category is subject for review during the mission of the Ceres orbiter ('Dawn') depending on the results found.Catharine Conley Planetary Protection for the Dawn Mission, NASA HQ, Jan 2013 =Category III / IV= * Mars because of possible surface habitats. * Europa because of its subsurface ocean. * Enceladus because of evidence of water plumes. =Category V= In the category V for sample return the conclusions so far are: * Unrestricted Category V: Venus, the Moon. * Restricted Category V: Mars, Europa, Enceladus. =Other objects= If there has been no activity for 3 billion years, it will not be possible to destroy the surface by terrestrial contamination, so can be treated as Category I. Otherwise, the category may need to be reassessed. The Coleman-Sagan equation The aim of the current regulations is to keep the number of microorganisms low enough so that the probability of contamination of Mars (and other targets) is acceptable. It is not an objective to make the probability of contamination zero. The aim is to keep the probability of contamination of 1 chance in 10,000 of contamination per mission flown. This figure is obtained typically by multiplying together the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft, the probability of growth on the target body, and a series of bioload reduction factors. In detail the method used is the Coleman-Sagan equation.edited by Muriel Gargaud, Ricardo Amils, Henderson James Cleaves, Michel Viso, Daniele Pinti Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Volume 1 page 325 P_c = N_0 R P_S P_t P_R P_g. where : N_0 = the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft initially : R = Reduction due to conditions on spacecraft before and after launch : P_S = Probability that microorganisms on the spacecraft reach the surface of the planet : P_t = Probability that spacecraft will hit the planet - this is 1 for a lander : P_R = Probability of microorganism to be released in the environment when on the ground, usually set to 1 for crashlanding. : P_g = Probability of growth. For targets with liquid water this is set to 1 for sake of the calculation. Then the requirement is P_c < 10^{-4} The 10^{-4} is a number chosen by Sagan et al., somewhat arbitrarily. Sagan and Coleman assumed that about 60 missions to the Mars surface would occur before the exobiology of Mars is thoroughly understood, 54 of those successful, and 30 flybys or orbiters, and the number was chosen to endure a probability to keep the planet free from contamination of at least 99.9% over the duration of the exploration period.Carl Sagan and Sidney Coleman Decontamination Standards for Martian Exploration Programs, Chapter 28 from Biology and the Exploration of Mars: Report of a Study edited by Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh, Wolf Vishniac, J. P. T. Pearman, National Academies, 1966 - Life on other planets =Critiques= The Coleman Sagan equation has been criticised because the individual parameters are often not known to better than a magnitude or so. For example, the thickness of the surface ice of Europa is unknown, and may be thin in places, which can give rise to a high level of uncertainty in the equation.Richard Greenberg, Richard J. Greenberg Unmasking Europa: the search for life on Jupiter's ocean moon Paul Gilster Europa: Thin Ice and Contamination It has also been criticised because of the inherent assumption made of an end to the protection period and future human exploration. In the case of Europa, this would only protect it with reasonable probability for the duration of the period of exploration. Greenberg has suggested an alternative, to use the natural contamination standard - that our missions to Europa should not have a higher chance of contaminating it than the chance of contamination by meteorites from Earth.B. Randall Tufts, Richard Greenberg Infecting Other Worlds , American Scientist, July 2001Europa the Ocean Moon, Search for an Alien Biosphere, chapter 21.5.2 Standards and Risks Another approach for Europa is the use of binary decision trees which is favoured by the Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System under the auspices of the Space Studies Board.Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System - about the Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System This goes through a series of seven steps, leading to a final decision on whether to go ahead with the mission or not.Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System; Space Studies Board; Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences; National Research Council Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Spacecraft Missions to Icy Solar System Bodies ( 2012 ) / 2 Binary Decision Trees Containment and quarantine for restricted Category V sample return In the case of restricted Category V missions, Earth would be protected through quarantine of sample and astronauts in a yet to be built Biosafety level 4 facility.Preparing to receive and handle Martian samples when they arrive on Earth. Francis M. McCubbin, NASA. 2017. Accessed: 25 September 2018. In the case of a Mars sample return, missions would be designed so that no part of the capsule that encounters the Mars surface is exposed to the Earth environment. One way to do that is to enclose the sample container within a larger outer container from Earth, in the vacuum of space. The integrity of any seals is essential and the system must also be monitored to check for the possibility of micro-meteorite damage during return to Earth.Designing a Box to Return Samples From Mars Astrobio.net, 2013Office of Planetary Protection: Mars Sample Quarantine Protocol WorkshopMars sample return mission concept study (for decadal review 2010)Proof of concept of a Bio-Containment System for Mars Sample Return Mission The recommendation of the ESF report is that No restricted category V returns have been carried out. During the Apollo program, the sample-returns were regulated through the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law. This was rescinded in 1991, so new regulations would need to be enacted. The Apollo era quarantine procedures are of interest as the only attempt to date of a return to Earth of a sample that, at the time, was thought to have a remote possibility of including extraterrestrial life. Samples and astronauts were quarantined in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.Richard S. Johnston, John A. Mason, Bennie C. Wooley, Gary W. McCollum, Bernard J. Mieszkuc BIOMEDICAL RESULTS OF APOLLO, SECTION V, CHAPTER 1, THE LUNAR QUARANTINE PROGRAM The methods used would be considered inadequate for containment by modern standards.Nancy Atkinson How to Handle Moon Rocks and Lunar Bugs: A Personal History of Apollo’s Lunar Receiving Lab, Universe Today, July 2009. See quote from: McLane who lead the group that designed and built the Lunar Receiving Facility: Also the lunar receiving laboratory would be judged a failure by its own design criteria as the sample return didn't contain the lunar material, with two failure points during the Apollo 11 return mission, at the splashdown and at the facility itself. However the Lunar Receiving Laboratory was built quickly with only two years from start to finish, a time period now considered inadequate. Lessons learned from it can help with design of any Mars sample return receiving facility.The Quarantine and Certification of Martian Samples - Chapter 7: Lessons Learned from the Quarantine of Apollo Lunar Samples, Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration, Space Studies Board Design criteria for a proposed Mars Sample Return Facility, and for the return mission, have been developed by the American National Research Council, and the European Space Foundation.European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - strategic advice July, 2012, They concluded that it could be based on biohazard 4 containment but with more stringent requirements to contain unknown microorganisms possibly as small as or smaller than the smallest Earth microorganisms known, the ultramicrobacteria. The ESF study also recommended that it should be designed to contain the smaller gene transfer agents if possible, as these could potentially transfer DNA from martian microorganisms to terrestrial microorganisms if they have a shared evolutionary ancestry. It also needs to double as a clean room facility to protect the samples from terrestrial contamination that could confuse the sensitive life detection tests that would be used on the samples. Before a sample return, new quarantine laws would be required. Environmental assessment would also be required, and various other domestic and international laws not present during the Apollo era would need to be negotiated.M. S.

Space Res. vol 18 no 1/2 pp (1/2)345-(1/2)350 1996 Decontamination procedures For all spacecraft missions requiring decontamination, the starting point is clean room assembly in US federal standard class 100 cleanrooms. These are rooms with fewer than 100 particles of size 0.5 µm or larger per cubic foot. Engineers wear cleanroom suits with only their eyes exposed. Components are sterilized individually before assembly, as far as possible, and they clean surfaces frequently with alcohol wipes during assembly. Spores of Bacillus subtilis was chosen for not only its ability to readily generate spores, but its well-established use as a model species. It is a useful tracker of UV irradiation effects because of its high resilience to a variety of extreme conditions. As such it is an important indicator species for forward contamination in the context of planetary protection. For Category IVa missions (Mars landers that do not search for Martian life), the aim is to reduce the bioburden to 300,000 bacterial spores on any surface from which the spores could get into the Martian environment. Any heat tolerant components are heat sterilized to 114 °C. Sensitive electronics such as the core box of the rover including the computer, are sealed and vented through high-efficiency filters to keep any microbes inside.In-situ Exploration and Sample Return: Planetary Protection Technologies JPL - Mars Exploration Rovers For more sensitive missions such as Category IVc (to Mars special regions), a far higher level of sterilization is required. These need to be similar to levels implemented on the Viking landers, which were sterilized for a surface which, at the time, was thought to be potentially hospitable to life similar to special regions on Mars today. In microbiology, it is usually impossible to prove that there are no microorganisms left viable, since many microorganisms are either not yet studied, or not cultivable. Instead, sterilization is done using a series of tenfold reductions of the numbers of microorganisms present. After a sufficient number of tenfold reductions, the chance that there any microorganisms left will be extremely low. The two Viking Mars landers were sterilized using dry heat sterilization. After preliminary cleaning to reduce the bioburden to levels similar to present day Category IVa spacecraft, the Viking spacecraft were heat-treated for 30 hours at 112 °C, nominal 125 °C (five hours at 112 °C was considered enough to reduce the population tenfold even for enclosed parts of the spacecraft, so this was enough for a million- fold reduction of the originally low population). Modern materials however are often not designed to handle such temperatures, especially since modern spacecraft often use \\"commercial off the shelf\\" components. Problems encountered include nanoscale features only a few atoms thick, plastic packaging, and conductive epoxy attachment methods. Also many instrument sensors cannot be exposed to high temperature, and high temperature can interfere with critical alignments of instruments. As a result, new methods are needed to sterilize a modern spacecraft to the higher categories such as Category IVc for Mars, similar to Viking. Methods under evaluation, or already approved, include: * Vapour phase hydrogen peroxide - effective, but can affect finishes, lubricants and materials that use aromatic rings and sulfur bonds. This has been established, reviewed, and a NASA/ESA specification for use of VHP has been approved by the Planetary Protection Officer, but it has not yet been formally published.Fei Chen, Terri Mckay, James Andy Spry, Anthony Colozza, Salvador Distefano, Robert Cataldo Planetary Protection Concerns During Pre-Launch Radioisotope Power System Final Integration Activities - includes the draft specification of VHP sterilization and details of how it would be implemented. Proceedings of Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space 2013. Albuquerque, NM, February 25–28, 2013 Paper 6766 * Ethylene oxide - this is widely used in the medical industry, and can be used for materials not compatible with hydrogen peroxide. It is under consideration for missions such as ExoMars. * Gamma radiation and electron beams have been suggested as a method of sterilization, as they are used extensively in the medical industry. They need to be tested for compatibility with spacecraft materials and hardware geometries, and are not yet ready for review. Some other methods are of interest as they can sterilize the spacecraft after arrival on the planet. * Supercritical carbon dioxide snow (Mars) - is most effective against traces of organic compounds rather than whole microorganisms. Has the advantage though that it eliminates the organic traces - while other methods kill the microorganisms, they leave organic traces that can confuse life detection instruments. Is under study by JPL and ESA. * Passive sterilization through UV radiation (Mars). Highly effective against many microorganisms, but not all, as a Bacillus strain found in spacecraft assembly facilities is particularly resistant to UV radiation. Is also complicated by possible shadowing by dust and spacecraft hardware. * Passive sterilization through particle fluxes (Europa). Plans for missions to Europa take credit for reductions due to this. =Bioburden detection and assessment= The spore count is used as an indirect measure of the number of microorganisms present. Typically 99% of microorganisms by species will be non-spore forming and able to survive in dormant states, and so the actual number of viable dormant microorganisms remaining on the sterilized spacecraft is expected to be many times the number of spore-forming microorganisms. One new spore method approved is the \\"Rapid Spore Assay\\". This is based on commercial rapid assay systems, detects spores directly and not just viable microorganisms and gives results in 5 hours instead of 72 hours.Assessment of Planetary Protection and Contamination Control Technologies for Future Planetary Science Missions see Section 3.1.2 Bio-burden Detection and Assessment. January 24, JPL, 2011 =Challenges= It is also long been recognized that spacecraft cleaning rooms harbour polyextremophiles as the only microbes able to survive in them. For example, in a recent study, microbes from swabs of the Curiosity rover were subjected to desiccation, UV exposure, cold and pH extremes. Nearly 11% of the 377 strains survived more than one of these severe conditions. The genomes of resistant spore producing Bacillus sp. have been studied and genome level traits potentially linked to the resistance have been reported. This does not mean that these microbes have contaminated Mars. This is just the first stage of the process of bioburden reduction. To contaminate Mars they also have to survive the low temperature, vacuum, UV and ionizing radiation during the months long journey to Mars, and then have to encounter a habitat on Mars and start reproducing there. Whether this has happened or not is a matter of probability. The aim of planetary protection is to make this probability as low as possible. The currently accepted target probability of contamination per mission is to reduce it to less than 0.01%, though in the special case of Mars, scientists also rely on the hostile conditions on Mars to take the place of the final stage of heat treatment decimal reduction used for Viking. But with current technology scientists cannot reduce probabilities to zero. =New methods= Two recent molecular methods have been approved for assessment of microbial contamination on spacecraft surfaces. * Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection - this is a key element in cellular metabolism. This method is able to detect non cultivable organisms. It can also be triggered by non viable biological material so can give a \\"false positive\\". * Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay - detects lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This compound is only present in Gram- negative bacteria. The standard assay analyses spores from microbes that are primarily Gram-positive, making it difficult to relate the two methods. Impact prevention This particularly applies to orbital missions, Category III, as they are sterilized to a lower standard than missions to the surface. It is also relevant to landers, as an impact gives more opportunity for forward contamination, and impact could be on an unplanned target, such as a special region on Mars. The requirement for an orbital mission is that it needs to remain in orbit for at least 20 years after arrival at Mars with probability of at least 99% and for 50 years with probability at least 95%. This requirement can be dropped if the mission is sterilized to Viking sterilization standard.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 ) Page 27 (footnote to page 26) of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection In the Viking era (1970s), the requirement was given as a single figure, that any orbital mission should have a probability of less than 0.003% probability of impact during the current exploratory phase of exploration of Mars.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 ) Page 22 of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection For both landers and orbiters, the technique of trajectory biasing is used during approach to the target. The spacecraft trajectory is designed so that if communications are lost, it will miss the target. =Issues with impact prevention= Despite these measures there has been one notable failure of impact prevention. The Mars Climate Orbiter which was sterilized only to Category III, crashed on Mars in 1999 due to a mix-up of imperial and metric units. The office of planetary protection stated that it is likely that it burnt up in the atmosphere, but if it survived to the ground, then it could cause forward contamination.Mars Climate Orbiter page at Mars Observer is another Category III mission with potential planetary contamination. Communications were lost three days before its orbital insertion maneuver in 1993. It seems most likely it did not succeed in entering into orbit around Mars and simply continued past on a heliocentric orbit. If it did succeed in following its automatic programming, and attempted the manoeuvre, however, there is a chance it crashed on Mars. Three landers have had hard landings on Mars. These are Schiaparelli EDM lander, the Mars Polar Lander, and Deep Space 2. These were all sterilized for surface missions but not for special regions (Viking pre- sterilization only). Mars Polar Lander, and Deep Space 2 crashed into the polar regions which are now treated as special regions because of the possibility of forming liquid brines. ControversiesMeteorite argument= Alberto G. Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch published an article in Nature recommending that planetary protection measures need to be scaled down. They gave as their main reason for this, that exchange of meteorites between Earth and Mars means that any life on Earth that could survive on Mars has already got there and vice versa. Robert Zubrin used similar arguments in favour of his view that the back contamination risk has no scientific validity.Robert Zubrin \\"Contamination From Mars: No Threat\\", The Planetary Report July/Aug. 2000, P.4–5transcription of a tele-conference interview with Robert Zubrin conducted on March 30, 2001 by the class members of STS497 I, \\"Space Colonization\\"; Instructor: Dr. Chris Churchill =Rebuttal by NRC= The meteorite argument was examined by the NRC in the context of back contamination. It is thought that all the Martian meteorites originate in relatively few impacts every few million years on Mars. The impactors would be kilometers in diameter and the craters they form on Mars tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.O. Eugster, G. F. Herzog, K. Marti, M. W. Caffee Irradiation Records, Cosmic-Ray Exposure Ages, and Transfer Times of Meteorites, see section 4.5 Martian Meteorites LPI, 2006L.E. NYQUIST1, D.D. BOGARD1, C.-Y.

STÖFFLER AGES AND GEOLOGIC HISTORIES OF MARTIAN METEORITES 2001Tony Irving Martian Meteorites - has graphs of ejection ages - site maintained by Tony Irving for up to date information on Martian meteorites Earth receives a steady stream of meteorites from Mars, but they come from relatively few original impactors, and transfer was more likely in the early Solar System. Also some life forms viable on both Mars and on Earth might be unable to survive transfer on a meteorite, and there is so far no direct evidence of any transfer of life from Mars to Earth in this way. The NRC concluded that though transfer is possible, the evidence from meteorite exchange does not eliminate the need for back contamination protection methods. Impacts on Earth able to send microorganisms to Mars are also infrequent. Impactors of 10 km across or larger can send debris to Mars through the Earth's atmosphere but these occur rarely, and were more common in the early Solar System. = Proposal to end planetary protection for Mars = In their 2013 paper \\"The Over Protection of Mars\\", Alberto Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch suggested that we no longer need to protect Mars, essentially using Zubrin's meteorite transfer argument.The overprotection of Mars This was rebutted in a follow up article \\"Appropriate Protection of Mars\\", in Nature by the current and previous planetary protection officers Catharine Conley and John Rummel.Appropriate protection of Mars, Nature, Catherine Conley and John RummelThe Overprotection of Mars?, astrobio.net, Andrew Williams - Nov 18, 2013 - summarizes both papers on the subject, with links to originals =Critique of Category V containment measures = The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small.http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports/iMARS_FinalReport.pdf Preliminary Planning for an International Mars Sample Return Mission Report of the International Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group June 1, 2008European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements July, 2012, - see Back Planetary Protection section.

Task Group on Issues in Sample Return. National Academies Press, Washington, DC (1997). Nevertheless, returned samples from Mars will be treated as potentially biohazardous until scientists can determine that the returned samples are safe. The goal is to reduce the probability of release of a Mars particle to less than one in a million.  Policy proposals Non- biological contamination= A COSPAR workshop in 2010, looked at issues to do with protecting areas from non biological contamination.Rummel, J., Race, M., and Horneck, G. eds. 2011. COSPAR Workshop on Ethical Considerations for Planetary Protection in Space Exploration COSPAR, Paris, 51 pp. They recommended that COSPAR expand its remit to include such issues. Recommendations of the workshop include: Some ideas proposed include protected special regions, or \\"Planetary Parks\\"'Planetary Parks' Could Protect Space Wilderness by Leonard David, SPACE.com’s Space Insider Columnist, January 17, 2013 to keep regions of the Solar System pristine for future scientific investigation, and also for ethical reasons. =Proposed extensions= Astrobiologist Christopher McKay has argued that until we have better understanding of Mars, our explorations should be biologically reversible.Christopher P. McKay Planetary Ecosynthesis on Mars: Restoration Ecology and Environmental Ethics NASA Ames Research Center For instance if all the microorganisms introduced to Mars so far remain dormant within the spacecraft, they could in principle be removed in the future, leaving Mars completely free of contamination from modern Earth lifeforms. In the 2010 workshop one of the recommendations for future consideration was to extend the period for contamination prevention to the maximum viable lifetime of dormant microorganisms introduced to the planet. In the case of Europa, a similar idea has been suggested, that it is not enough to keep it free from contamination during our current exploration period. It might be that Europa is of sufficient scientific interest that the human race has a duty to keep it pristine for future generations to study as well. This was the majority view of the 2000 task force examining Europa, though there was a minority view of the same task force that such strong protection measures are not required. In July 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a Review and Assessment of Planetary Protection Policy Development Processes. In part, the report urges NASA to create a broad strategic plan that covers both forward and back contamination. The report also expresses concern about private industry missions, for which there is no governmental regulatory authority. = Protecting objects beyond the Solar System = The proposal by the German physicist Claudius Gros, that the technology of the Breakthrough Starshot project may be utilized to establish a biosphere of unicellular organisms on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets,Claudius Gros: Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project, Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 361, pp 1-14 (2016). has sparked a discussion,Jessica Boddy: Q&A;: Should we seed life on alien worlds?, Science, 9.

August 2016.Jan O'Neill: Genesis Project: Should We 'Gift' the Cosmos With Life?. Gros argues that the extended timescales of interstellar missions imply that planetary and exoplanetary protection have different ethical groundings.

Originally opened in 1839, the station is located on the former Croydon Canal, which is now a branch of the Brighton Main Line, often known as the Sydenham Corridor. Sydenham falls within Travelcard Zone 3 and is served by London Overground and Southern. The station is down the line from . History A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the Brighton Main Line between South Croydon and Selhurst / Forest Hill, as well as surrounding lines The Croydon Canal opened in 1809 linking the Grand Surrey Canal to Croydon, however the waterway was never successful, and in 1836, it was the first canal to be abandoned by an Act of Parliament. The alignment was purchased by the London and Croydon Railway, who drained the canal and re- opened as a railway on the 5 June 1839. In 1844, L&CR; was given authority to test the first atmospheric railway equipment between Dartmouth Arms (now Forest Hill) and West Croydon. In 1846, the railway became part of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and in the following year, the system was abandoned. The station was originally built south of Sydenham Road (A212) however, due to the construction of the branch to Crystal Palace in 1852, platform 2 was resited to its current position. Platform 1 and its station building remained south of the road bridge, until 1982 when British Rail decided to construct a replacement platform 90 meters north, parallel to Peak Hill Gardens due to the retaining wall beginning to collapse. The Big Four grouping led to Southern Railway (SR) management until nationalistation in 1948. Between 1948 and 1982 Sydenham was part of the Southern Region and following sectorisation, until privatisation, Sydenham became part of the Network SouthEast sector. Upon privatisation in May 1996, the station management passed to Connex South Central. Connex was stripped of the franchise due to poor financial management and in 2001, Govia South Central (Southern) took over the franchise and management of the station. Southern remained the sole train provider until 2010, when London Overground took over management of the station and began running trains as part of the East London Line extension. Sydenham was the first station to serve the area, however, there are, or have been, five other stations in the Sydenham: * on the Hayes Line * on the now closed Crystal Palace (High Level) line * , on the to Orpington line. Station layout Like all intermediate stations between New Cross Gate and Norwood Junction, Sydenham has two platforms, facing two (up and down slow) of the four tracks with the two fast tracks run between the two slow lines. There are three entrances - the ticket office on platform 2 from Sydenham Station Approach, entrance on platform 1 from Peak Hill Gardens and a gate on platform 2 which is not unlocked regularly. A locally owned small cafe named On The Hoof which also has locations at other stations on the line, is in the main station building. Services Services at Sydenham are operated by Southern and London Overground. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is: Southern * 4 tph to London Bridge * 2 tph to London Victoria via * 2 tph to via Southern services at Sydenham are operated using Class 377 and Class 455 EMUs. London Overground * 8 tph to Highbury & Islington via * 4 tph to West Croydon * 4 tph to London Overground services at Sydenham are operated using Class 378 EMUs. Connections London Buses routes 122, 176, 197, 202 and 450 serve the station. While routes 75 and 194 run close by.

Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music. Oxford: Clarendon Press. . also \\"tonality level\\", Gerhard Kubik's \\"tonal step,\\" \\"tonal block,\\" and John Blacking's \\"root progression,\\" is an important melodic and harmonic progression where melodic material shifts between a whole tone above and a whole tone below the tonal center. This shift can occur to both neighboring notes, in either direction, and from any point of departure. The steps above and below the tonic are often called contrasting steps. A new harmonic segment is created which then changes the tonality but not necessarily the key. Each level is based on one pitch, a foundation note. A melodic or harmonic-melodic third, triad (fifth) (such as in the song \\"Shallow Brown\\"), or seventh (such as in the song \\"Donald MacGillavry\\") may be built off this foundation. A \\"change\\" in levels is called a shift. We see this in double-tonic tunes such as \\"Donald MacGillavry\\" (notes: A to G in bar 4 below). Shifting is more emphatic than chord changes (chords: Am-G), but not as emphatic as modulations (keys: A minor to G major): \\"Donald MacGillavry\\" , last measure each line The foundation (root) is the most important note and accompanying chords are almost always built in root position. The fifth is next in importance, and consecutive fifths are most often emphasized. The third is less important and often blue, neutral, or changing from major to minor. This characteristic is common in the English virginalists music such as William Byrd's \\"The Woods so Wild\\" theme, which is an example of levels (F and G) being elaborated through cadence, melodic divergence from the accompaniment, and subsidiary chords, reaching a complete cadential phrase. Levels are commonly found in African folk music. It is believed that they originally arose out of this culture. They are often combined with unresolved harmonic progression that gives music a feeling of perpetual motion without any noticeable cadence. Runs and sequences often link new harmonic segments of the music to the previous ones. Each new harmonic sequence is often related to the previous through the melodic line. The music often ends suddenly without any musical preparation, even in the middle of a phrase. Sometimes the music descends to a \\"point of rest\\" in which the note below the tonal center gets extended to allow an ending. Tonal variety and melodic unification is often achieved by repeating similar phrases on different steps of a pentatonic mode. Semitonal and hemitonal root progressions can also be found. Tonality levels or \\"root progression\\" are the most important structural feature found in African folk music. The internal organization of this music demands occasional shifts between levels unless the music is based on a consistent drone. The tonality level often shifts several times making it very hard to find a piece of African folk music without tonality levels. Most often between three and five tonality levels can be found within a composition. Levels can also be found in Asian, Celtic folk musics, Arab, and in European Renaissance music. Eventually, levels and other musical traits found their way into American jazz harmony and blues tonality through spirituals. Levels can be compared to a traditional root progression in western music with a tonic - subdominant - dominant relationship. Levels give way to familiar classical chords and chord changes in Baroque music. The harmonic practices between these cultures are so similar that urban African composers often incorporate western root progression into their local harmonic practices. As this combination traveled to America, it helped create new genres such as jazz, big band, and blues. In the twentieth century, chords give way to levels in the blues, completed with the V-IV-I progression, which spread to all popular music.van der Merwe (1989), pp. 209–11. For instance, In the blues - influenced style, the boogie- woogie bass, levels occur in shifts from primary triads rather than neighboring tones. This can be directly tied to the tonality levels found in African folk music discussed earlier. A level, or \\"tonal step,\\" often coincides with cross-rhythms in the melody and entries in vocal melody. A new tonality level and harmonic shift is often very vague and hard to identify in a vocal texture. However, it is much easier to identify in thick instrumentation.

These drugs dilate the corpora cavernosa of the penis, facilitating erection with sexual stimulation, and are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Sildenafil was the first effective oral treatment available for ED. Because PDE5 is also present in the smooth muscle of the walls of the arterioles within the lungs, sildenafil and tadalafil dilates those vessels, and are FDA-approved for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Increasingly, the wider cardiovascular benefits of PDE5 inhibitors are being appreciated. Medical uses PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra) are clinically indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil and tadalafil are also indicated for the treatment of some subtypes of pulmonary hypertension, while tadalafil is also licensed for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Sildenafil, the prototypical PDE5 inhibitor, was originally discovered during the search of a novel treatment for angina. Studies in 2002 explored its potential for increasing neurogenesis after stroke, although clinical evidence for benefit in cerebrovascular diseases is currently lacking. Contraindications PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated within 24 hours (or 48 hours with tadalafil) of taking alpha-blockers, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, or nitrate medications such as isosorbide mononitrate or isosorbide dinitrate. Concurrent use of these medications can lead to life-threatening low blood pressure. PDE5 inhibitors are also contraindicated in patients with previous nonarteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and hereditary eye diseases. Despite initial concerns of adverse cardiovascular events in patients prescribed PDE5 inhibitors, several long-term studies have established the safety of the drugs in both healthy patients and patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Adverse effects All PDE5 inhibitors are generally well tolerated. The occurrence of side effects, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs), with PDE5 inhibitors depends on the dose and type of agent. Headache is a very common ADR, occurring in >10% of patients. Other common ADRs include: dizziness, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion or rhinitis.Rossi S, editor. Australian Medicines Handbook 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. Back pain and muscle aches are also more common in patients taking tadalafil. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that a warning about possible sudden hearing loss would be added to drug labels of PDE5 inhibitors. Since 2007 there has been evidence to suggest that PDE5 inhibitors can cause an anterior optic neuropathy, although the absolute risk increase is small. Finally, there are concerns that PDE5 inhibitors may increase the risk of neonatal mortality in pregnant patients, and trials investigating use of the drugs for fetal growth restriction have been suspended. Drug interactions PDE5 inhibitors are primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4. The potential exists for adverse drug interactions with other drugs which inhibit or induce CYP3A4, including HIV protease inhibitors, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, although coadministration has not been linked to changes in the safety or efficacy of either agent. Combination with nitrovasodilators such as nitroglycerin and PETN is contraindicated because potentially life-threatening hypotension may occur. PDE5 inhibitors do not interact synergistically with other antihypertensive drugs. Examples The PDE5 inhibitor story begins with the work of the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter who, in 1886, noticed that his asthma symptoms eased after drinking a strong cup of coffee. We now know that this was due to the bronchodilator properties of caffeine, a non-selective, albeit weak, PDE5 inhibitor. In 1986, Pfizer scientists at Sandwich, UK, started preclinical work on the development of a PDE5 inhibitor (later known as sildenafil citrate) for the treatment of angina. Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil and avanafil are the main agents marketed globally, although mirodenafil, udenafil and lodenafil are available in some countries. Other agents with weak PDE5 inhibitory properties include Zaprinast and icariin. Although all PDE5 inhibitors share the same mechanism of action, each agent has different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics which affect how quickly it acts, how long its effects last, and its side effects. Notably, although all PDE5 inhibitors preferentially inhibit PDE5, the degree to which they also inhibit other phosphodiesterases influences their side effect profile. For example, sildenafil also inhibits PDE6 which is present in the retina of the eye; this reaction is thought to be responsible for the temporary visual changes which some patients using sildenafil experience. Similarly tadalafil also inhibits PDE11 which is present in the prostate, although no effects on fertility have been reported. Although agents more selective for PDE5 were in development, these trials have been suspended, likely due to the saturation of the market with the introduction of agents with broad cardiovascular benefits, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists. Nevertheless, PDE5 inhibitors already marketed for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension are undergoing research in several conditions such as resistant hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, intermittent claudication, Raynaud's phenomenon, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus due to our greater appreciation of their broad physiological properties. Mechanism of action Part of the physiological process of vasodilatation involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) by vascular endothelial cells which then diffuses to nearby vascular smooth muscle cells. There, NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the main effector of the system. For example, in the penis, NO release at high levels from endothelial cells and penile nerves during sexual stimulation leads to relaxation of the smooth vasculature of the corpus cavernosum, causing vasocongestion and a sustained erection. PDE5 inhibitors prolong the action of cGMP by inhibiting its degradation by the enzyme PDE5, which is found throughout the body. In the penis, PDE5 inhibitors potentiate the effects of cGMP to prolong erections and increase sexual satisfaction. However, PDE5 inhibitors do not cause erections without sexual stimulation. As well as their haemodynamic effects, PDE5 inhibitors have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and metabolic properties in several experiments. However, larger and longer-term studies are needed to establish their effectiveness and safety compared to other medications in other diseases.

HistoryOrigins= Plusnet's origins go back to 1 February 1997, when Choice Peripherals, a PC computer-peripherals company launched Force9 Internet. Heavily involved in early Plusnet was founder of Choice Peripherals, Paul Cusack (chairman), who later went on to create the hardware retailer Ebuyer, and Lee Strafford (managing director), who later went on to lead Plusnet through most of its development up to the sale to BT in January 2007. Screenshot of the original Force9 webpage, from 1998 The first Force9 Internet products followed the dial-up internet model popularised by Demon Internet (monthly subscription, plus the cost of local phone calls), but offered at a lower cost to subscribers (£6 a month + VAT), and including more value-added features. By October 1997, Force9 had achieved the milestone of 5,000 subscribers, assisted by a marketing partnership with Yorkshire Cable (later to become part of Telewest), in which Yorkshire Cable customers were offered a reduced subscription on a Force9 account. In addition, software which used Force9 Internet as the default ISP was supplied with every modem ordered through Choice Peripherals. As the business grew, Force9 was split out as a separate operation from Choice Peripherals, with new premises and an umbrella company under which it would operate. This company, Plusnet Technologies Ltd, opened its doors at Internet House, Victoria Quays, Sheffield, in November 1997. Although the company was named Plusnet, the brand was first used for products by the business sales team at Force9, for leased line and server colocation services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In April 1998, Insight Enterprises, an American PC-peripherals company, made a move into the UK market by acquiring Choice Peripherals. However, Insight were principally interested in the online commerce side of the operation, and not in the internet service provider, Force9. Because of this, Insight largely left the ISP side of the business operating as it had been, with Lee Strafford remaining in charge of the operation. This coincided with the April 1999 launch of Force9's version of 'unmetered' dial up – which gave 0800 free call rate internet access during weekend hours. The website was re-branded as F9 in order to promote it. In June 2000, the Force9 brand was changed to Plusnet. This coincided with the introduction of the Surftime dialup internet products, the first real 24/7 unmetered dial-up service in the UK. Plusnet continued to see month on month growth in the dial-up market, and this growth was further augmented with the launch of a 512 kbit/s ADSL broadband internet service in August 2000. Plusnet launched their first broadband products on the same day that BT first made them available to the UK market. Plusnet continued to develop their product set over the next few years as new broadband speeds and technologies became available. The initial broadband product performed at a speed of 512 kbit/s, and required a BT Engineer to visit the customer premises to install the service. As time went on, the maximum speeds increased to 1 Mbit/s, 2 Mbit/s and, today, up to 16 Mbit/s. In January 2002, Plusnet launched a 'Self Install' broadband product that the end user was able to set up themselves without the need for a visit to the premises by a BT Engineer. In November 2005, Plusnet acquired Parbin Ltd and its consumer ISP MetroNet – which at that time provided a range of 'pay as you go' broadband packages. As part of the Parbin acquisition, Plusnet assumed ownership of several other brands; Pay as You Host, INUK and Port995. =Acquisition by BT= Burley, Leeds. On 16 November 2006, it was announced that BT were making an offer for all shares in Plusnet. The BT deal, worth approximately £67 million, was declared unconditional on 24 January 2007 (after Office of Fair Trading (OFT) approval was granted). On 5 March 2007, shortly after the BT acquisition, the Plusnet chief executive, Lee Strafford, and the finance director, Neil Comer, were dismissed by BT. Strafford was replaced as CEO by a former BT employee, Neil Laycock, who had been with Plusnet in various senior roles for the preceding three years. BT bought the Brightview Group in July 2007, and Brightview's subsidiary Madasafish became a trading name of Plusnet.BT buys Madasafish operator Broadband Finder. 6 July 2007 Services Plusnet currently provides asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) broadband and Fibre broadband internet products to residential and business customers. It also provides landline telephone products to the same customers. Plusnet offers two variants of router: it offers the Plusnet Hub Zero (Sagemcom 2704n) router with its ADSL packages, and the Plusnet Hub One (rebadged BT Hub 5) with its Fibre packages. Since 2015, Plusnet has also offered Plusnet TV via the YouView platform. In November 2016 Plusnet acquired mobile virtual network operator LIFE Mobile as part of BT's acquisition of EE. LIFE Mobile was subsequently re-branded as Plusnet Mobile. ISP servicesNetwork capacity= Plusnet was one of the first ISPs in the UK to use Network Quality of Service (QoS) techniques, which it introduced in November 2004, in order to control the finite data bandwidth available to them at peak times. This move was a reaction to the cost of bandwidth, £210 per Mbit/s per month in November 2006 for ISPs using the BT Wholesale network. Critics have suggested that the decision to employ QoS on the network was driven by Plusnet's focus on delivering to tight profit targets dictated by investors during the time when they were a public limited company (plc). Plusnet replaced its QoS technique with a Sustainable Usage Policy (SUP) in 2005. In 2007, around the time of acquisition by BT, an additional 930 Mbit/s of data bandwidth was made available by adding six BT IPStream segments to the network. This additional capacity has brought the Plusnet total broadband network capacity to 22 155 Mbit/s BT Central segments. This is delivered over five full 622 Mbit/s BT Centrals (four 155 Mbit/s in each BT Central) and two BT Centrals with one segment of 155 Mbit/s active in each. This services a total of just over 200,000 customers at October 2007. This total data bandwidth figure is only slightly higher than Plusnet's capacity in January 2005, before Plusnet used Network Quality of Service, when they had a total of seventeen segments (ten 155 Mbit/s Centrals and seven segments delivered over two 622 Mbit/s pipes) and 100,000 customers. At that time, there was an imbalance on their network as a result of issues that are caused from using a mixture of pipes. In February 2005, Plusnet reduced to a total of sixteen segments delivered over five 622 Mbit/s pipes (622s are slightly more efficient than 155 Meg segments, so this allowed for a similar amount of throughput). In August 2005, Plusnet was forced through contractual obligation to upgrade to seventeen segments, and in January 2006, moved to eighteen segments. Plusnet's acquisition of Parbin Ltd in November 2005; with 16,000 customers and three 155 Mbit/s segments gave Plusnet a total of twenty-one segments. However, Plusnet absorbed all of these new customers and decommissioned the three segments, bringing them back to eighteen segments. This was further reduced by two segments, bringing it to sixteen in total – at around the same time as nearly 20,000 customers were moved to the Tiscali local-loop unbundling (LLU) network in July 2006. There is controversy that the last two segments should not have been removed. Particularly as at that time, Plusnet increased allowances on all the residential packages. When this contradiction was exposed in December 2006, Plusnet defended their actions, but the explanation given was not positively received by the community at the time. Plusnet reported that the slowdown in the increase of capacity from January 2005 was due to two major reasons. The introduction of their lower cost, lower capacity allowance, broadband product; which many existing customers moved to, and the introduction of Network Quality of Service and the general network management policy to combat the spiralling usage of a small portion (around 1%) of the customer base. However, it was not fully explained how Plusnet expected to deliver the performance of their broadband packages to 180,000 customers on the same capacity as they had when they only had 100,000 customers. =Usage restrictions= Plusnet has, on a number of occasions, redefined their product usage guidelines in order to reflect changes in overall customer usage or in the costs they incur from their suppliers. This has resulted in customers being asked to restrict their usage, upgrade to a different product, or leave the company entirely. This practice has become common within the ISP market in the UK and is generally accepted, however Plusnet has sometimes made these changes without warning or notice to their customers. Plusnet has argued that the changes made didn't require any notice to be given because they don't consider them to form part of the legal contract with the consumer. Plusnet is one of the few UK ISPs to publish a full breakdown of its wholesale costs, as part of the Plusnet Broadband Blueprint document. =Deep packet inspection and bandwidth management= Plusnet used to make heavy use of traffic prioritisation (this ended in 2017) to maintain a stable service. Plusnet acknowledges on their website how network quality of service impacts individual protocols and as a result what experience they expect the end-user to receive. This broadband experience is subject to periodic changes without notice in order to preserve the quality of network performance for the protocols that demand extremely low latency. Customers are notified of changes by checking Plusnet's website, freephone telephone number or RSS feed. The use of Arbor Networks E30 Ellacoya platform to perform traffic fingerprinting using deep packet inspection and Juniper Networks ERX switches to perform protocol shaping has seen a situation where all protocols, including encrypted P2P traffic are identified and managed on their network. Plusnet's position is that this prioritisation is in place to ensure time-critical applications like VoIP, gaming, browsing and video streaming (from sites like YouTube) are prioritised above applications that would otherwise swamp their available network capacity to the detriment of other customers' broadband experience. File sharing applications and binary Usenet are the most heavily managed protocols on Plusnet's network, and are collectively treated as low priority on most of their consumer products. Plusnet announced that as of 29 July 2017, traffic prioritisation was to be removed from its residential customers. =Identification of traffic= Deliberate traffic shaping is deployed on the Plusnet network in order to ensure Quality of Service. Mistakes when this system was first implemented resulted in misclassification of some protocols, which made certain applications unusable at peak times. This was improved when the classification of unidentified traffic was raised in priority. Non- standard applications still remain susceptible to misclassification (e.g. running SSH on a non standard port other than 4500 or 10000 which are set aside by Plusnet for this purpose). Continual improvements in protocol identification along with a significant increase in available bandwidth mean that the implementation is generally considered to be working successfully. =IPv6 support= , Plusnet did not in general provide IPv6 connectivity to its customers, but were trialling IPv6 with selected customers. In December 2013, Plusnet started its \\"Next Phase\\" IPv6 trial. Participating in this trial required the participants to provide and reconfigure their own IPv6-compatible routers. The trial was active from December 2013, but is closed for new applicants. Plusnet had earlier run a small trial with real end-users for World IPv6 Day in June 2011, with both their website and broadband customers on IPv6 on that day. The first IPv6 broadband user \\"technical trial\\" ran until July 2012. YouView TV from Plusnet YouView TV from Plusnet uses the YouView set top box and the Freeview Digital television Free to Air service, but is supplemented by IPTV provision of premium bundles. Plusnet offers 2 types of YouView boxes, the YouView + box and a standard YouView box. The YouView + box has recording facilities whereas the standard box does not. Virtual ISPs Plusnet has operated a number of \\"Virtual ISP\\" brands, both for its own company and for others. These alternative brands use the existing Plusnet Network and Software infrastructure. Some of these \\"Virtual ISP\\" brands include: =In use= * BT One Enterprise connect – BT Global Services utilises their own Workplace platform within its Teleworker product, to deliver a remote broadband access solution for its major corporate customers * BT One Enterprise broadband – BT Global Services utilises their own Workplace platform within its BT Enterprise product, to deliver a remote broadband access solution for its major corporate customers. BT Enterprise offers ADSL, Telephone and Fibre optic services. * Madasafish, part of the Brightview Group, itself owned by BT, which includes FreeNetName, ic24, globalnet and others. Madasafish is no longer available to new customers. * John Lewis Broadband * Plusnet supports the legacy Vodafone@Home service, after around 8,000 Vodafone customers were migrated to the Plusnet brand on 7 February 2012. =Out of use= * Metronet – A brand acquired as part of the acquisition of Parbin Ltd in 2005. * Force9 – The original ISP brand used residentially by Plusnet – now merged into Plusnet as of September 2007 * www.plus.net.uk – Plusnet brand catering for business customers – now merged into Plusnet * Free-Online (FoL) – merged into Plusnet September 2007 * Charity Days – A brand created for Donate As You Surf Ltd, which donated money to charity. This business was purchased outright by Plusnet in 2006. Now discontinued. * Your Ideal – A brand created for Lloyds TSB * Dabs Online (Dabsol) – vISP created for computer retailer, dabs.com, also now owned by BT. * Pay As You Host – Technically a sister company of Plusnet, set up to administer the domains of legacy customers once the domain hosting service was removed for all new signups. The support team were nonetheless based in the same office as Plusnet, with the calls answered by the Business Support teams. This service was shut as of 21 August 2014. Marketing Plusnet's growth strategy is centred on its customers recommending people within their social circle to Plusnet. In the 10 years of its existence Plusnet has shown year on year growth in customer numbers, significantly attributable to existing customer referrals. By 2007 30% of Plusnet's new customers joined Plusnet as a result of a referral. In order to incentivise customer referrals, Plusnet pays the referring customer a recurring monthly fee for as long as the referred customer stays with Plusnet. This can prove extremely lucrative to those customers who refer many people. Plusnet's reliance on this strategy can have negative effects whenever the business suffers service problems. In October 2010 Plusnet launched an advertising campaign designed to increase brand awareness nationally which emphasised the company's Yorkshire roots, using the strapline \\"Good Honest Broadband from Yorkshire\\". The strapline was replaced in April 2012 by \\"We'll do you proud\\", but the new campaign remained heavily influenced by Northern stereotypes. From 2013, the company became sponsors of the Yorkshire Marathon, run in York. The spokesman in the adverts is Craig Murray. Plusnet are an active player in the UK's web community, playing an active role in web community events around the UK, especially in the north of England. Events like OpenCoffee and Geekup often see a Plusnet presence. Plusnet also work with local universities on graduate recruitment, internships and multimedia projects. In June 2005 Plusnet became the official shirt sponsors of Sheffield Wednesday, of the Football League Championship. The original deal ran for 2 years up to the end of the 2006–07 season. In November 2006 it was announced that the sponsorship would be extended to the end of the 2008–09 season. PlusNet also sponsored a local LAN gaming party \\"Sychosis 2\\", which was hosted in Doncaster Dome in July 2008, PlusNet offered prizes of a year's free broadband for the Call of Duty 4 winning team. Controversies In February 2001, the company asked 1,100 dial-up customers to leave the service after they had stayed connected to an \\"unmetered\\" (but contended) dial-up service for long periods of time. On 9 July 2006, Plusnet lost 700 GB of customer email data due to human error. During a routine maintenance upgrade to the email system, an engineer mistakenly reformatted a live disk pack instead of the intended backup disk pack. Plusnet provided updates on their investigation but did not reveal the size or cause of the problem until 10 July 2006 at 15:39. Plusnet explained that the engineer responsible had accessed both the live and backup disk packs from a single workstation. The engineer believed his reconfiguration was to the backup storage when it was actually connected to the live email disk pack. In the following days, Plusnet did recover some email data and explained that other data may have been lost to corruption during the recovery. The official Plusnet UserGroup launched an \\"Email Stability & Resiliency Campaign\\" to attempt to ensure Plusnet made suitable investments and put in place measures to prevent future issues. In March 2017 it was fined £880k by Ofcom for continuing to bill customers for cancelled services.

Named after King Abdulaziz Al Saud and inaugurated in 1981, the airport is the busiest airport of Saudi Arabia and the third-largest airport in the kingdom. The airport's Hajj Terminal was specially built for Muslim pilgrims going to Mecca annually on the Hajj. It is one of the largest in the world, and can handle 80,000 passengers at the same time. Description The airport occupies an area of .About KAIA on the GACA website Beside the airport proper, this includes a royal terminal, facilities of King Abdullah Air Base for the Royal Saudi Air Force, and housing for airport staff. Construction work on KAIA airport began in 1974, and was finalized in 1980. Finally, on 31 May 1981, the airport opened for service after being officially inaugurated in April 1981.  New Terminal 1  In 2019, the new Terminal 1 at King Abdulaziz International Airport had a soft opening with a number of domestic flights transferred to operate from it. With an floor area of 810,000 square meters, the new terminal is considered one of the largest airport terminal buildings of its kind in the world. Visitors and passengers will enjoy a number of facilities including new lounges, an 18,000 square meter central garden area and a transport center that links between the building and the car park and train station. Moreover, the terminal will have a huge aquarium with 10 meters in diameter and 14 meters in height as well as a capacity of million litres of water. Furthermore, a mosque with a capacity of 3,732 worshippers has been established in the airport. In August 2019, the airport started moving a number of international flights operated by Saudia to the new terminal , and on the 18th of November Etihad has become the first non-Saudi airline to move to the new facility. Facilities ٘North Terminal =Hajj Terminal= Because of Jeddah's proximity to the holy city of Mecca, the airport has a dedicated Hajj Terminal, built to handle pilgrims taking part in the rituals associated with the annual Hajj. It can accommodate 80,000 travelers at the same time. Designed by the Bangladeshi-American engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM), it is known for its tent-like roof structure, engineered by Horst Berger while part of Geiger Berger Associates. Ten modules, each consisting of 21 \\"tents\\" of white colored Teflon-coated fiberglass fabric suspended from pylons, are grouped together into two blocks of five modules and separated by a landscaped mall between the blocks. Only customs, baggage handling and similar facilities are located in an air-conditioned building. The vast majority of the complex, called \\"Terminal Support Area\\", is a flexible, open area, conceived to function like a village, complete with souk (market) and mosque. Not enclosed by walls, this area is sheltered from the intense sun while allowing for natural ventilation; because of this, some consider it to be a green, environmentally-friendly building.Cold air is poured into the space and allowed to escape into the desert. Aga Khan Awards, Project brief The Hajj Terminal received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1983. According to the jury, \\"the brilliant and imaginative design of the roofing system met the awesome challenge of covering this vast space with incomparable elegance and beauty.\\"Aga Khan Award for Architecture . =Other terminals= South Terminal North Terminal interior Hajj Terminal Jeddah-KAIA airport serves as a major hub for Saudia who originally had the exclusive use of the South Terminal. In 2007, however, the privately owned Saudi carriers Flynas and Sama Airlines were also given permission to use it. Due to the closure of Sama Airlines, the terminal was only used by Saudia and Flynas. The terminal is now also used by Flyadeal, Garuda Indonesia, Kenya Airways, and Korean Air. The North Terminal at Jeddah airport is used by all other foreign airlines. The South terminal, however, is reported as closed, with all flights having moved to the new Terminal 1. =Expansion project= The new King Abdulaziz International Airport three-stage development started in 2006, and is currently scheduled for an official opening in mid 2019. However, as of 2018 local flights have been landing at the airport. The project is designed to increase the airport's yearly capacity from 13 million to 80 million passengers. The expansion includes a brand-new passenger terminal building, a 136-meter tall air traffic control (ATC) tower (the largest in the world), airfield hard-standing and paved areas, lighting, fuel network systems, electronic passenger guidance system and a new storm water drainage network. There will also be a newly constructed support services building and upgrades to the existing runway and airfield systems. The three stages, according to GACA—the General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia, will be marked by staged capacity increase to 30 million, 60 million and 80 million passengers per year. The new airport will be accessed by the Haramain high- speed rail project network. Prince Majed Street will connect to the Al-Laith Highway, forming a fast north-south transit route.

It will happen.\\" He has also said: \\"If Allah says 100 strikes, 100 strikes it is. If Allah says cut off their hand, you cut off their hand. If Allah says stone them to death, through the Prophet Muhammad, then you stone them to death, because it’s the obedience of Allah and his messenger—nothing personal.\\" Personal life Wahhaj had eight children, aged 13 to 33 as of June 2005. In August 2018 three of Wahhaj's children were charged with terrorism and felony child abuse. Wahhaj indicated that the three had severed ties with the rest of their family in 2017 and added that it was a tip he himself provided to the police that led to their arrest.

Whilst never officially disbanding, they ceased recording and performing in 1979. In 2004, The Now recorded all of their original material and released as the Fuzztone Fizzadelic album in 2005 on the Damaged Goods record label. Career The Now, founded by Mike McGuire and Steve Rolls late in 1976, were Peterborough's first punk rock band. Mike and Steve were at the time performing with The Faderz, who had only existed for a few months, before they had hooked into the London Punk scene in 1976. Joe MacColl and Paul Wicks (aka The Dangerous Dip or occasionally The Mysterious Dip) were recruited immediately to form The Now. Early gigs were self organised affairs, notably at the Peterborough Marcus Garvey Club. A community club, mainly catering for the city's West Indian community. Such gigs were usually with local reggae artists such as The Legions, any punk band who would dare come out of London (or other major cities), such as 999, The Killjoys and Eater, as well as new local punk bands such as Heavy Manners. This was a great challenge for The Now since putting Punk Rock into an East Anglian provincial environment (where there already existed a time warp sensibility), caused a lot of friction at that time. During this time The Dangerous Dip was replaced on the bass guitar by Faz Farrow. The Now were managed by Allen Adams who later went on to form the band The Destructors and later Destructors 666. The Now were far removed from what is traditionally known as 123 ‘Punk’ thrash. With intelligent songs, political lyrics and a real sense of small town frustration and anger The Now were unique. This was real urban punk rock, devoid of big city trends, tolerance and fashion. The Now played many gigs, and could often be found playing those early, then famous, London venues such as Roxy Club and The Vortex clubs in London. The Now released two singles \\"Development Corporations\\" / \\"Why\\" on Ultimate Records in November 1977 and a deal with Lee Wood's Raw Records signed in mid 1978 produced two songs, \\"Into The 80's\\" and \\"9 'O' Clock\\" (actually recorded for Raw in late 1977) which were re-mixed and scheduled for 23 March release. This 7\\" single was delayed due to economic problems which would soon force the Cambridge-based label to close down. When it eventually emerged on 30 November, only 800 copies were pressed, with at least half of these being destroyed in a fire at Raw's warehouse. Both singles were, in the main, well received. The first single, \\"Development Corporations\\", reached number 4 in the Sounds alternative chart and number 2 in the Time Out chart in 1977. Around this time, The Now, went their own ways through mutual consent. In 2002 there was a great deal of interest around the original singles, particularly in Europe. As a result, a German record company, Last Years Youth, duly re-released both singles, containing a couple of previously unreleased versions of the original songs. It was a logical progression (albeit unusual) to use this exposure as an opportunity to record and release a definitive version of all of the early songs written by The Now. Fuzztone Fizzadelic was recorded during 2004 by the four original members of The Now, representing their original set list, as performed in 1977. In true punk rock style The Now rehearsed for three hours and had two days in the studio for recording and mixing. 27 years between writing and recording must be some sort of record. Fuzztone Fizzadelic was released in 2005. Mike McGuire and Steve Rolls went on to form 80's avant garde band Sudden Sway. Joe MacColl went on to join mod revivalists The Name. Faz Farrow went on to perform with numerous band as a journeyman bass guitarist including Swindon based Mod/Soul/Powerpop bands 'The Suspicions' and 'Peloton'. Steve Rolls joined The Destructors by Allen Adams in 2006 to Present.

After nearly completing the Russian conquest of Central Asia (Russian Turkestan) the Russians captured an Afghan border fort. Seeing a threat to India, Britain came close to threatening war but both sides backed down and the matter was settled by diplomacy. The effect was to stop further Russian expansion in Asia, except for the Pamir Mountains and to define the north-western border of Afghanistan. Background After the Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881 and the annexation of Merv in March 1884, Russia held most of what is now Turkmenistan. South of Merv, towards Herat in Afghanistan, the border was not clearly defined. The British were concerned because the line Merv–Herat–Kandahar–Quetta was a natural invasion route to India. The Russians had begun to build Trans-Caspian Railway which would allow them to bring men and supplies to Merv and beyond. Most of Turkmenistan is desert but irrigation supports a fairly dense population on the north slope of the Kopet Dag (Geok Tepe and Ashgabat). East of this are the oases of Tejend and Merv, one of the great cities of central Asia. Tejend was much smaller and to the south of Tejend and Merv is a grassy region sometimes called Badghis which is bounded by the Hari-Rud river on the west and the Murghab River to the east. The Hari-Rud flows north along the modern Iranian border, enters Turkmenistan and spreads out forming the Tejend oasis before drying up in the desert. The Murghab flows north through what is now Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, reaches Yoloten and spreads out, forming the Merv oasis. Where the Murghab crosses the current border, the irrigated area of Panjdeh (Five Villages) existed. Badghis was about wide and long from north to south, depending on where the boundaries are set. South of Badghis is the important Afghan city and border fort of Herat. At the time of the Panjdeh incident it was generally agreed that the northern frontier of Afghanistan started from the Persian border at Serakhs and ran about east-north-east to meet the Oxus at Khoja Sale, an old name for the point where the Oxus now leaves Afghanistan. This border had never been properly defined. Buildup In 1882 Britain and Russia began discussions about the Afghan boundary. In the summer of 1884 they agreed to form an Afghan Boundary Commission, the commissioners being Generals Zelenoi and Sir Peter Lumsden. They were to meet at Serakhs in October but both were delayed. The Russians tried to push the border as far to the south as possible before it became fixed. General Komarov, governor of the Transcaspian Oblast, went south to Serakhs and expelled a Persian garrison in the east side of the Hari-Rud. The Russians occupied Pul-i-Khatun south in Afghan territory. Later they occupied the pass or canyon at Zulfikar and a place called Ak Robat about to the east. On the east side, the Sarik Turkomans of Yoloten submitted in May 1884 but their kinsmen at Panjdeh refused, saying that they were subjects of the Amir of Kabul. The Afghans sent troops to Bala Murghab and in June began building a fort at the north end of Panjdeh at the mouth of the Kushk River, which they called Ak-Tepe (White Hill; probably the old fort visible from space at ). The Russians thought that the Afghans had done this with British connivance but the Afghans and British claimed that the people of Panjdeh had always paid tribute to the Afghans or whoever controlled Herat. The Russians claimed that Panjdeh had never been garrisoned and that its people were part of a tribe that had submitted to Russia. On 8 November, Lumsden arrived at Serakhs with 250 Sepoys and 200 Bengal Lancers, having crossed little-known country in Baluchistan. Komarov avoided meeting him, having more serious things to do. In mid-November, Komarov made a threatening movement up the Murghab toward Panjdeh and more Afghan troops were moved up. the Russians built an advanced post at Sanduk Kuchan (Sandykgachy?) on the Murghab. Alikhanov went to parley with the Ak Tepe commander but was driven away with threats. The Afghans sent a detachment to occupy Sary Yazy south of the Russian outpost. Russian attack For a few months there was a lull, then in February 1885 the Russians occupied a post south of Sary Yazy. Lumsden advised the Afghans to withdraw further south. Russia next built a fort at Kazyl Tepe (Red Hill) about south of Ak Tepe and a mile south of Pul-i-Khishty (Brick Bridge) across the Kushk. On 25 March, Komarov arrived at Kazyl Tepe with 1,500 men and two days later they advanced, apparently trying to provoke the Afghans into firing first. On 30 March 1885 the Russians captured Ak Tepe with a reported loss of 900 Afghans and 11 Russians.Kuropatkin, Zavoevanie Turkmenii, page 217 gives 42 Russians and 500 Afghans killed and wounded. The news reached England on 7 April and preparations for war began. On 27 April, Gladstone asked the Commons for a credit of £11 million (£4.5 million for Sudan and the rest for Russia). Alexander III of Russia suggested arbitration and negotiations, which the British accepted. The crisis was partly averted by the wisdom of Abdur Rahman Khan the Amir of Afghanistan, who was then at Rawalpindi talking to the British. Having no wish to see two foreign armies fighting in his country, when told of Panjdeh he pretended to see it as a mere border skirmish. In mid- summer Lord Salisbury replaced Gladstone, which may have made British threats more credible. By 10 September, it was roughly agreed that Russia would keep Panjdeh, give up Zulfikar and that the border would be approximately where it is now. The border commissioners started at Zulfikar on 10 November, reached the Murghab by Christmas and went into winter quarters. In 1886 the line was run from the Murghab to the Oxus. Some minor problems had to be re-esolved by diplomats and the final protocol was signed on 22 July 1887. Persia somehow retained the Atak country north-west of Serakhs into which Russian patrols had penetrated. Aftermath Britain did not aid Afghanistan, in violation of the Treaty of Gandamak. That led the Amir to believe that he could not rely on the British in the face of Russian aggression.Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia By Frank Clements. ABC-Clio, Santa Barbara, California 2003. p. 198 Tensions between Russia and Britain were eased when the Russian foreign minister Nikolay Girs and the ambassador to London Baron de Staal set up an agreement in 1887 which established a buffer zone in Central Asia. Russian diplomacy thereby won grudging British acceptance of its expansionism.Raymond Mohl, \\"Confrontation in Central Asia\\" History Today 19 (1969) 176–183 In 1890 Russia founded Kushka (Serhetabat) at the south end of the new territory and in 1901 connected it by rail to Merv. Kushka remained the southernmost settlement in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. The 1921 Afghan-Soviet Treaty of Friendship was the first international agreement made by the Soviet Union. Although \\"the Soviets agreed to return to Afghanistan, subject to plebiscites, territories in the Panjdeh area ceded under duress by Afghanistan to Russia or Bukhara in the nineteenth century\\", that was not done.Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation by J.

It states that at constant relative goods prices, a rise in the endowment of one factor will lead to a more than proportional expansion of the output in the sector which uses that factor intensively, and an absolute decline of the output of the other good. In the context of the Heckscher–Ohlin model of international trade, open trade between two regions often leads to changes in relative factor supplies between the regions. This can lead to an adjustment in the quantities and types of outputs between the two regions. The Rybczynski theorem explains the outcome from an increase in one of these factor's supply as well as the effect on the output of a good which depends on an opposing factor. Eventually, across both countries, market forces would return the system toward equality of production in regard to input prices such as wages (the state of factor price equalization). Relationship between endowments and outputs The Rybczynski theorem displays how changes in an endowment affects the outputs of the goods when full employment is sustained. The theorem is useful in analyzing the effects of capital investment, immigration and emigration within the context of a Heckscher-Ohlin model. Consider the diagram below, depicting a labour constraint in red and a capital constraint in blue. Suppose production occurs initially on the production possibility frontier (PPF) at point A. center Suppose there is an increase in the labour endowment. This will cause an outward shift in the labour constraint. The PPF and thus production will shift to point B. Production of clothing, the labour-intensive good, will rise from C1 to C2. Production of cars, the capital-intensive good, will fall from S1 to S2. If the endowment of capital rose the capital constraint would shift out causing an increase in car production and a decrease in clothing production. Since the labour constraint is steeper than the capital constraint, cars are capital-intensive and clothing is labor-intensive. In general, an increase in a country's endowment of a factor will cause an increase in output of the good which uses that factor intensively, and a decrease in the output of the other good.

This includes islet cell tumors that cannot be removed and leucine sensitivity. It can also be used in refractory cases of sulfonylurea toxicity. It is generally taken by mouth. Common side effects include high blood sugar, fluid retention, low blood platelets, a fast heart rate, increased hair growth, and nausea. Other severe side effects include pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. It is chemically similar to thiazide diuretics. It works by decreasing insulin release from the pancreas and increasing glucose release by the liver. Diazoxide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1973. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States as of 2019 it costs about US$1500 per month. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £59. Medical uses Diazoxide is used as a vasodilator in the treatment of acute hypertension or malignant hypertension. Diazoxide also inhibits the secretion of insulin by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channel of beta cells of the pancreas; thus, it is used to counter hypoglycemia in disease states such as insulinoma (a tumor producing insulin) or congenital hyperinsulinism. Diazoxide acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA and kainate receptors, suggesting potential application as a cognitive enhancer. Side effects Diazoxide interferes with insulin release through its action on potassium channels. Diazoxide is one of the most potent openers of the K+ ATP channels present on the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Opening these channels leads to hyperpolarization of cell membrane, a decrease in calcium influx, and a subsequently reduced release of insulin. This mechanism of action is the mirror opposite of that of sulfonylureas, a class of medications used to increase insulin release in Type 2 Diabetics. Therefore, this medicine is not given to non-insulin dependent diabetic patients. The Food and Drug Administration published a Safety Announcement in July 2015 highlighting the potential for development of pulmonary hypertension in newborns and infants treated with this drug.

In this patent the patentee acknowledges that the alumino-thermic reaction was well known and had been used previously for producing metals and alloys.' The thermite (or aluminothermic) reaction is one in which aluminum metal is oxidized by an oxide of another metal, usually iron oxide, producing great heat in the process. Goldschmidt was originally interested in producing very pure metals by avoiding the use of carbon in smelting, but he soon realized the value in welding, a process known as thermic welding. It is also used in incendiary devices. This process is sometimes called the \\"Goldschmidt reaction\\" or \\"Goldschmidt process\\", because he furthered its development and patented it in 1895.H.

It is sometimes referred to as a \\"clean vote.\\" Members vote yea or nay on the matter rather than voting on a related procedural maneuver. Depending upon the rules of order for that particular type of amendment or bill, the vote required for passage might be a 2/3 majority, a 3/5 majority, or a simple majority. The phrase is probably most often used by those who are frustrated by opponents in the House or Senate who delay a bill indefinitely by means of various tactics. The rules of the House and Senate allow a bill to be delayed, even permanently, by various means, such as by tabling the bill, recommitting it, or amending it in the second degree. By appealing for an \\"up or down vote,\\" an advocate of the bill tries to get it out of committee and past all other legislative hurdles and to a floor vote. In 2005, the phrase was heard most often from Republicans in the United States, who occupied 55 seats in the United States Senate and so lacked the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster maneuver by the Democratic senators. A united Democratic bloc was able to filibuster any objectionable bill, presidential appointment, or other matter before the Senate and to prevent its passage. If the Republicans were able to bring any particular matter to an \\"up or down vote,\\" they would be able to approve that measure if they were united. Many Republican-affiliated websites and political action committees had urged voters to demand of their Senators and Representatives an \\"up or down vote\\" on various issues. Constitutionally, however, the Senate is not obliged to give any matter an up or down vote. Since taking control of the Senate in 2006, Democrats have accused Republicans of filibustering almost every proposal so requiring 60 votes to pass any legislation (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act). (Republicans set a record for the most number of filibusters during the 111th congress.) However, the Republicans took back the Senate in 2014 and have controlled it since that time.

Grahamstown was traditionally the administrative capital, cultural centre and largest town of the Albany district. The area was previously known as the 'Zuurveld' by migrating Boer farmers in the late 18th century, and it lay near the boundary between the Cape Colony and the traditional Xhosa lands to the east. The 1820 Settlers were instrumental in settling and farming the district and giving it some of its distinctive local culture. The ANC government merged the Albany area with the large Xhosa township of Alice as the municipal area of 'Cacadu' . History 1820 settlers landing in Algoa Bay General Jacob Glen Cuyler, the Landdrost of the Uitenhage district, named the area between the Sundays and Fish rivers \\"Albany\\" after Albany in his native New York. Albany became the destination for the 1820 Settlers by the Cape Colony's new British masters. It accepted one of the largest waves of British immigrant settlers to South Africa, and the development of Albany was a milestone in the formation of the British diaspora. Grahamstown, Bathurst, and Port Alfred became important villages in Albany following the arrival of the 1820 Settlers. Geographical features The district forms part of the rural hinterland beyond Port Elizabeth. The Albany area is of extreme ecological importance because of its unique indigenous vegetation, composed of deep, lush \\"Albany thickets\\". Albany Thicket is an ecoregion and biodiversity hotspot of dense woodland, containing many endemic species. Ecologically it forms part of the greater Cape Floristic Region. The coastal belt is a temperate, winter rainfall area, with rains of 500 to 700 mm per annum and above. Further to the interior, the terrain is mostly dry Karoo and grasslands composed of large commercial farms and vast expanses. Despite the arid interior, the Sundays and Fish rivers support extensive irrigated farming. They are fed by water from the Orange River under the Fish River Transfer Scheme. Rhodes University campus Culture Grahamstown is still a major cultural centre. It is home to the National Arts Festival and Rhodes University (named after Cecil Rhodes, an important but controversial figure in South African history). The university is the authority on South African English. The city, formed by John Graham, was traditionally the capital of the Albany District Council.

It differs from a creole or pidgin language in that, whereas creoles/pidgins arise where speakers of many languages acquire a common language, a mixed language typically arises in a population that is fluent in both of the source languages. Because all languages show some degree of mixingZuckermann (2009) p. 48, citing Hjelmslev (1938) and Schuchardt (1884). by virtue of containing loanwords, it is a matter of controversy whether the concept of a mixed language can meaningfully be distinguished from the type of contact and borrowing seen in all languages.Arends et al. 1994 Scholars debate to what extent language mixture can be distinguished from other mechanisms such as code-switching, substrata, or lexical borrowing.According to Google n-gram, the German term is first attested in 1832, and attested in English since 1909. Definitions Other terms used in linguistics for the concept of a mixed language include hybrid language, contact language, and fusion language; in older usage, 'jargon' was sometimes used in this sense.\\"jargon, n.1.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2015. Web. 4 May 2015, sense 5. In some linguists' usage, creoles and pidgins are types of mixed languages, whereas in others' usage, creoles and pidgins are merely among the kinds of language that might become full-fledged mixed languages. Thomason (1995) classifies mixed languages into two categories: Category 1 languages exhibit \\"heavy influence from the dominant group's language in all aspects of structure and grammar as well as lexicon\\" (Winford 171). Category 2 languages show a \\"categorial specificity of the structural borrowing\\" or a uniform borrowing of specific categories (Winford). Mixed language and intertwined language are seemingly interchangeable terms for some researchers. Some use the term \\"intertwining\\" instead of \\"mixing\\" because the former implies \\"mixture of two systems which are not necessarily the same order\\" nor does it suggest \\"replacement of the either the lexicon or of the grammatical system\\", unlike relexification, massive grammatical replacement, and re- grammaticalization. The grammar of a mixed language typically comes from a language well known to first-generation speakers, which Arends claims is the language spoken by the mother. This is because of the close relationship between mother and child and the likelihood that the language is spoken by the community at large. Arends et al. classify an intertwined language as a language that \\"has lexical morphemes from one language and grammatical morphemes from another\\". This definition does not include Michif, which combines French lexical items in specific contexts, but still utilizes Cree lexical and grammatical items. Yaron Matras distinguishes between three types of models for mixed language: \\"language maintenance and language shift, unique and predetermined processes (\\"intertwining\\"), and conventionalisation of language mixing patterns\\". The first model involves the use of one language for heavy substitutions of entire grammatical paradigms or morphology of another language. This is because a speech community will not adopt a newer dominant language, and so adapt their language with grammatical material from the dominant language. Bakker (1997) argues that mixed languages result from mixed populations. Languages \\"intertwine\\", in that the morphosyntax (provided by female native speakers) mixes with the lexicon of another language (spoken by men, often in a colonialist context). This appears to have been the case with Michif, where European men and Cree, Nakota, and Ojibwe women had offspring who learned a mixture of French and Cree. The third model \\"assumes a gradual loss of the conversational function of language alternation as a means of expressing contrast\\". In other words, language no longer becomes a means of differentiation between two speech communities as a result of language mixing.Matras, Yaron, \\"Mixed Languages: a functional-communicative approach\\", \\"Bilingualism: Language and Cognition / Volume 3 / Issue 2 / August 2000 / p. 79 - 99 Lexical reorientation, according to Matras, is defined as \\"the conscious shifting of the linguistic field that is responsible for encoding meaning or conceptual representations away from the language in which linguistic interaction is normally managed, organised, and processed: speakers adopt in a sense one linguistic system to express lexical meaning (or symbols, in the Buhlerian sense of the term) and another to organize the relations among lexical symbols, as well as within sentences, utterances, and interaction. The result is a split, by source language, between lexicon and grammar.\\" Differentiation with other language mixtures A mixed language differs from pidgins, creoles and code-switching in very fundamental ways. In most cases, mixed language speakers are fluent, even native, speakers of both languages; however, speakers of Michif (a N-V mixed language) are unique in that many are not fluent in both of the sources languages. Pidgins, on the other hand, develop in a situation, usually in the context of trade, where speakers of two (or more) different languages come into contact and need to find some way to communicate with each other. Creoles develop when a pidgin language becomes a first language for young speakers. While creoles tend to have drastically simplified morphologies, mixed languages often retain the inflectional complexities of one, or both, of parent languages. For instance, Michif retains the complexities of its French nouns and its Cree verbs. It also differs from a language that has undergone heavy borrowing, such as Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese from Chinese (see Sino-Xenic), English from French, or Maltese from Sicilian/Italian. In these cases, despite the heavy borrowing, the grammar and basic words of the borrowing language remain relatively unchanged, with the borrowed words confined mainly to more abstract or foreign concepts. In the case of Maltese, for example, if verbs borrowed from Italian were inflected using Italian inflectional rules rather than Arabic-derived ones, then Maltese would be a candidate for being a mixed language. Finally, a mixed language differs from code-switching, such as Spanglish or Portuñol, in that, once it has developed, the fusion of the source languages is fixed in the grammar and vocabulary, and speakers do not need to know the source languages in order to speak it. But, linguists believe that mixed languages evolve from persistent code-switching, with younger generations picking up the code-switching, but not necessarily the source languages that generated it. Languages such as Franglais and Anglo-Romani are not mixed languages, or even examples of code-switching, but registers of a language (here French and English), characterized by large numbers of loanwords from a second language (here English and Romani). Middle English (the immediate fore-runner of Modern English) developed from such a situation, incorporating many Norman borrowings into Old English, but it is not considered a mixed language. Proposed examplesMichif= Michif derives nouns, numerals, definite/indefinite articles, possessive pronouns, some adverbs and adjectives from French, while it derives demonstratives (in/animate), question words, verbs (in/animacy agreement with the subject/object), and some adverbs/verb-like adjectives from Cree. The Cree components of Michif generally remain grammatically intact, while the French lexicon and grammar is restricted to noun phrases where nouns occur with a French possessive element or article (i.e. in/definite, masculine/feminine, singular/plural).Silva-Corvalán 1997Thomason 1997 Further, many speakers of Michif are able to identify the French and Cree components of a given sentence, likely from the phonological and morphological features of words. Although the phonological systems of both French and Cree are generally independent in Michif, there is convergence in 1) mid-vowel raising, 2) sibilant harmony, 3) vowel length (e.g. French vowel pairs [i]/[ɪ] and [a]/[ɑ] differ in length as in Cree), and 4) instances where the three nasal vowels /æ̃/, /ũ/, and /ĩ/ occur in the Cree components, although this last point of convergence may be due to Ojibwe influence. Scholars propose that, in the Métis multilingual community, Michif emerged as a need to symbolize a new social identity. The first unambiguous mention of Michif dates to the 1930s. The Métis of St. Laurent, a tribe of indigenous people in Canada, were made to feel their language was a sign of inferiority by nuns, priests, and other missionaries who insisted that the Metis switch to Standard Canadian French. Because missionaries stigmatized Michif French as an inferior, \\"bastardized\\" form of Canadian French, the Metis began to develop a sense of inferiority and shame which they associated with speaking Michif. Although Michif may have arisen as a way for Metis people to identify themselves, it became taboo to speak Michif inter-ethnically.Lavalle, Guy http://iportal.usask.ca/docs/Native_studies_review/v7/issue1/pp81-93.pdf In an attempt to make students unlearn Michif French, some nuns used a \\"token- system\\" in which each student was given ten tokens each week, and for every use of Michif French, a student would have to surrender a token. Students with the most tokens were rewarded with a prize. Overall, this system did not work. =Mednyj Aleut= Mednyj Aleut is identified as a mixed language composed of mostly intact systematic components from two typologically and genetically unrelated languages: Aleut and Russian. This mixed language's grammar and lexicon are both largely Aleut in origin, while the finite verb morphology, a whole grammatical subsystem, is primarily of Russian origin. Nonetheless, there are some syntactic patterns with Russian influence and some Aleut features in the finite verb complex such as, 1) a topic-number agreement pattern, 2) Aleut pronouns with unaccusatives, 3) the Aleut agglutinative tense + number + person/number pattern in one of two alternative past-tense forms. Scholars hypothesize that due to the elaborate Russian and Aleut components of Mednyj Aleut, the Aleut/Russian creoles in which the mixed language arose must have been fluent bilinguals of Aleut and Russian and, therefore, not a pidgin language—that is, \\"imperfect learning\\" is usually a feature in the emergence of a pidgin. Furthermore, some code-switching and deliberate decisions likely served as mechanisms for the development of Mednyj Aleut and it is possible that these were motivated by a need for a language that reflected the community's new group identity. =Ma'a= Ma’a has a Cushitic basic vocabulary and a primarily Bantu grammatical structure. The language also shares some phonological units with languages in the Cushitic phylum (e.g. the voiceless lateral fricative, the voiceless glottal stop, and the voiceless velar fricative that do not occur in Bantu), as well as syntactic structures, derivational processes, and a feature of inflectional morphology. However, few productive non-lexical structures in Ma’a appear derived from Cushitic. Sarah G. Thomason therefore argues for a classification of Ma’a as a mixed language since it does not have enough Cushitic grammar to be genetically related to the Cushitic language. By contrast, Ma’a has a productive set of inflectional structures derived from Bantu. Ma’a also demonstrates phonological structures derived from Bantu—for instance, the prenasalized voiced stops /mb ⁿd ⁿɟ ŋg/, phonemic tones, the absence of pharyngeal fricatives, labialized dorsal stops, ejective and retroflex stops, and final consonants— as well as noun classification, number category, and verb morphology patterns of Bantu. Syntactic and derivational patterns in Ma’a vary between Cushitic and Bantu origins—some Ma’a constructions used, such as genitive and copula constructions, are both from Cushitic and Bantu. These observations, in view of additional language contact cases like Asia Minor Greek, Anglo-Romani, and Mednyj Aleut, suggest that Ma'a arose as a product of massive interference from a Bantu language via intense cultural pressure on a Cushitic-speaking community.Thomason, Sarah Grey. GENETIC RELATIONSHIP AND THE CASE OF MA'A (MBUGU), Studies in African Linguistics. 14.2. University of Pittsburgh, 1983. Web. http://elanguage.net/journals/sal/article/view/1138/1154. =Media Lengua= Media Lengua, also known as Chaupi-shimi, Chaupi-lengua, Chaupi-Quichua, Quichuañol, Chapu-shimi or llanga-shimi,Llanga-shimi is typically a derogatory term used by speakers of Quichua to describe their language. However, it also appears to describe Media Lengua in the Imbabura Communities. It is believed that the term was introduced by Mestizo school teachers to further discredit the indigenous populationsPallares, A. (2002). From peasant struggles to Indian resistance: the Ecuadorian Andes in the late twentieth century. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. (roughly translated to \\"half language\\" or \\"in- between language\\") is a mixed language that consists of Spanish vocabulary and Ecuadorian Quichua grammar, most conspicuously in its morphology.

Contact languages: a wider perspective Amsterdam: John Benjamins (pp. 365-426)), including core vocabulary, are of Spanish origin and appear to conform to Quichua phonotactics. Media Lengua is one of the few widely acknowledged examples of a \\"bilingual mixed language\\" in both the conventional and narrow linguistic sense because of its split between roots and suffixes.Backus, Ad. 2003. Can a mixed language be conventionalised alternational codeswitching? in Matras & Bakker (eds) The Mixed Language Debate: theoretical and empirical advances Mouton de Gruyter Berlin: 237-/270.McConvell, Patrick, and Felicity Meakins. 2005. Gurindji Kriol: A Mixed Language Emerges from Code-switching. Quatro Fonologias Quechuas, 25(1), 9-30. Such extreme and systematic borrowing is only rarely attested, and Media Lengua is not typically described as a variety of either Quichua or Spanish. Arends et al. list two languages subsumed under the name Media Lengua: Salcedo Media Lengua and Media Lengua of Saraguro. The northern variety of Media Lengua, found in the province of Imbabura, is commonly referred to as Imbabura Media LenguaGómez-Rendón, J. A. (2008). Mestizaje lingüístico en los Andes: génesis y estructura de una lengua mixta (1era. ed.). Quito, Ecuador: Abya- Yala.Gómez-Rendón, J. (2005). La Media Lengua de Imbabura. Encuentros conflictos bilingüismo contacto de lenguas en el mundo andino (pp. 39-58). Madrid: Iberoamericana. and more specifically, the dialect varieties within the province are known as Pijal Media Lengua and Anglas Media Lengua. Scholars indicate that Media Lengua arose largely via relexification mechanisms.Matras & Bakker 2003 Pieter Muysken suggests that the social context in which the language emerged as an intralanguage involved a presence of \\"acculturated Indians\\" that neither identified with traditional, rural Quechua nor with urban Spanish cultures. This is an instance of a language developing from a need for \\"ethnic self-identification\\". =Light Warlpiri= Light Warlpiri, seen as a form of Warlpiri by speakers, derives verbs and verbal morphology largely from Australian Kriol, while nouns are largely from Warlpiri and English and nominal morphology from Warlpiri. Light Warlpiri likely developed as an intralanguage via code-mixing between Warlpiri and either Kriol or English. This code-mixing conventionalized into Light Warlpiri, which is now learned by Lajamanu children as a first language, along with Warlpiri, although Light Warlpiri is often produced first and used in daily interactions with younger speakers and adults within the Lajamanu community. Light Warlpiri is considered a new language for several reasons: 1) Light Warlpiri speakers use an auxiliary verb-system of that older Warlpiri speakers do not while code-mixing, 2) elements are distributed differently in Light Warlpiri than in code-mixing varieties of older Warlpiri speakers, 3) Light Warlpiri is a native language, which indicates stability of the language, and 4) grammatical structures and lexical items from each source language occur consistently in Light Warlpiri.O'Shannessy 2005 =Gurindji Kriol= Gurindji Kriol exhibits a structural split between the noun phrase and verb phrase, with Gurindji contributing the noun structure including case-marking, and the verb structure including TAM (tense-aspect-mood) auxiliaries coming from Kriol. In this respect, Gurindji Kriol is classified as a verb-noun (V-N) mixed language. Other examples of V-N mixed languages include Michif and Light Warlpiri. The maintenance of Gurindji within the mixed language can be seen as the perpetuation of Aboriginal identity under massive and continuing cultural incursion. =Asia Minor Greek and Cypriot Arabic= Both Cappadocian Greek and Cypriot Maronite-Arabic are cases of extreme borrowing—the former from Turkish and the latter from Greek. The remaining Greek dialects of Asia Minor display borrowing of vocabulary, function words, derivational morphology, and some borrowed nominal and verbal inflectional morphology from Turkish. Cypriot Arabic largely shows borrowing of vocabulary, and consequently Greek morphosyntax. Both Cappadocian Greek and Cypriot Arabic (as well as Ma'a) differ socially from Michif and Mednyj Aleut because they have evolved out of intense language contact, extensive bilingualism, and a strong pressure for speakers to shift to the dominant language. Nonetheless, neither language has an entire grammar and lexicon that is derived from a single historical source and in each case the linguistic group achieves fluent bilingualism. The social context in which they arose largely distinguishes them from pidgins and creoles and, for some scholars, identifies them closely with mixed languages. =Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mayan language= The Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language, also known as the Cauqué Mixed Language or Cauqué Mayan, is spoken in the aldea of Santa María Cauqué, Santiago Sacatepéquez, Department of Sacatepéquez in Guatemala. A 1998 study by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) estimated speaker population at 2,000.\\"Kaqchikel-K'iche' Mixed Language.\\" Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2016. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Nineteenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Web. https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ckz. While the language's grammatical base is from K'iche', its lexicon is supplied by Kaqchikel. =Other possible mixed languages= *Para-Romani languages such as Erromintxela, which derives most of its lexicon from Kalderash Romani but uses Basque grammar and syntax. *Bonin English, a mix of Japanese and English Creole *Gadal, or Tagdal, a Songhay base with a majority-Tuareg vocabulary, sometimes considered a mixed language *Língua Geral Amazônica and Língua Geral Paulista, important historical languages spoken in colonial Brazil, composed mainly of Amerindian (predominantly Tupi) lexicon and Portuguese structure. *Petuh, Danish grammar and semantics with German vocabulary. *Missingsch, Low Saxon grammar, pronunciation, pragmatics, loanwords and substrate and German vocabulary. *Makassar Malay, mixing Malay and Makassarese elementsWurm, Mühlhäusler, & Tryon, Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia and the Americas, 1996:682. *Bolze, a mixture of French and Swiss German spoken in the Basse-Ville district of Fribourg, Switzerland. = Possible mixed languages with a Chinese element = *Wutunhua, a mix of Chinese and Mongol *Dao, Chinese–Tibetan *E, a mix of one of the Zhuang languages and Pinghua Chinese *Lingling and Maojia, Mandarin–Miao *Tangwang, Mandarin–Santa *Waxiang, Hunanese–Miao *Hezhou, Uyghur–Mandarin Controversy In 1861, Max Müller denied \\"the possibility of a mixed language\\".Lectures on the Science of Language, 1st series, 6th edition, p. 86 In 1881, William D. Whitney wrote the following, expressing skepticism regarding the chances of a language being proven a mixed language. > Such a thing as the adoption on the part of one tongue, by a direct process, > of any part or parts of the formal structure of another tongue has, so fas > as is known, not come under the notice of linguistic students during the > recorded periods of language-history.

Cambridge, > MA, The MIT Press, pp. 179-180) Wilhelm Schmidt was an important proponent of the idea of mixed languages in the very late 19th and early 20th century.van Driem, George, 2001, Languages of the Himalayas.Vol I, p. 163. In the judgement of Thomas Sebeok, Schmidt produced \\"not a scrap of evidence\\" for his theory.Seboek, Thomas, 1942, \\"An examination of the Austroasiatic language family\\", Language 18.3, p. 215 Margaret Schlauch provides a summary of the various objections to Schmidt's theory of Sprachmischung,Schlauch, Margaret. 1936. \\"The Social Basis of Linguistics\\". Science and Society: A Marxian quarterly 1.1: 8-44, esp. pp. 36-37. by prominent linguistics such as Alfredo Trombetti, Antoine Meillet, and A. Kholodovich. Despite the old and broad consensus that rejected the idea of a 'mixed language', Thomason and Kaufman in 1988 proposed to revive the idea that some languages had shared genealogy.Thomason & Kaufman 1988 Meakins,Meakins 2013 who finds Thomason and Kaufman's account credible, suggests that a mixed language results from the fusion of usually two source languages, normally in situations of thorough bilingualism, so that it is not possible to classify the resulting language as belonging to either of the language families that were its sources. Despite these recent efforts to rehabilitate mixed languages as an idea, many linguists remained unconvinced. For example, van Driem rejects one by one each of Thomason and Kaufman's examples as well as those more recently proposed.van Driem, George, 2001, Languages of the Himalayas.Vol I, p. 163-175. Most recently, Versteegh rejects the notion of a mixed language, writing that at \\"no point is it necessary to posit a category of mixed languages.\\"Versteegh, Kees (2017).

DOI (Chapter): https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110565744-011 In the opinion of linguist Maarten Mous the notion of mixed languages have been rejected because; \\"Mixed languages pose a challenge to historical linguistics because these languages defy classification. One attitude towards mixed languages has been that they simply do not exist, and that the claims for mixed languages are instances of a naive use of the term. The inhibition to accept the existence of mixed languages is linked to the fact that it was inconceivable how they could emerge, and moreover their mere existence posited a threat to the validity of the comparative method and to genetic linguistics.\\" MATRAS, Yaron and BAKKER, Peter eds.: The Mixed Language Debate: Theoretical and Empirical Advances 2003. p. 209.

A light beam or beam of light is a directional projection of light energy radiating from a light source. Sunlight forms a light beam (a sunbeam) when filtered through media such as clouds, foliage, or windows. To artificially produce a light beam, a lamp and a parabolic reflector is used in many lighting devices such as spotlights, car headlights, PAR Cans, and LED housings. Light from certain types of laser has the smallest possible beam divergence. Visible light beams A natural lightbeam in the Majlis al-Jinn (literally 'Meeting place of the jinn') cave in Oman From the side, a beam of light is only visible if part of the light is scattered by objects: tiny particles like dust, water droplets (mist, fog, rain), hail, snow, or smoke, or larger objects such as birds. If there are many objects in the light path, then it appears as a continuous beam, but if there are only a few objects, then the light is visible as a few individual bright points. In any case, this scattering of light from a beam, and the resultant visibility of a light beam from the side, is known as the Tyndall effect. =Visibility from the side as side effect = * Flashlight (UK 'Torch'), beam directed by hand * Headlight, forward beam; the lamp is mounted in a vehicle, or on the forehead of a person, e.g. built into a helmet * Lighthouse, beam sweeping around horizontally * Searchlight, beam directed at something =Visibility from the side as purpose = For the purpose of visibility of light beams from the side, sometimes a haze machine or fog machine is used. The difference between the two is that the fog itself is also a visual effect.

Penge West station forms part of the new southbound route of the London Overground East London line that opened on 23 May 2010. Penge West station provides convenient access to The Dinosaur Park via the south gate of the Crystal Palace Park. History A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the Brighton main line between South Croydon and Selhurst / Forest Hill, as well as surrounding lines The original Penge station was opened by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839, probably more for logistical reasons than anything else: the railway crossed the nearby High Street by a level crossing, and the station would have provided a place for trains to wait while the crossing gates were opened for them. The population of Penge was only around 270 at this time, not enough to make the station commercially viable. It was closed in 1841, and the level crossing was converted to a bridge soon afterwards. The entrance to the station was actually on Penge High Street, and not its current position. Evidence of the original entrances can still be seen in the brickwork on either side of the bridge as the track passes over the road. By the early 1860s, Penge's population had risen to over 5,000 - more than eighteen times its level just twenty years earlier. There was also a demand for improved transport to the Crystal Palace nearby, so the station was reopened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on 1 July 1863.Howard Turner (1978)  p. 242. This was the same day that the London, Chatham and Dover Railway opened its own Penge Lane station on its line to London Victoria. The two stations were renamed Penge West, and Penge East by the Southern Railway on 9 July 1923. A large building on the down platform served as a ticket office and goods office and included the waiting room and Station Master's office. A wide road from the corner of Oakfield Road and Penge High Street provided access to these buildings and sidings which served a coal yard and timber yard on the site of the old brickfield.Camberwell: Divisions of the New Borough (Map) Ordnance Survey, 1885 The sidings were removed, the buildings demolished and the access road closed when the land was sold for the construction of a Homebase store. Since then access to the down platform has been via a footbridge from the up platform. Previously the only passenger access between the two platforms was via Penge High Street. The 1863 station building serving the Up platform remained in use until April 2005 when it was damaged in a fire set by arsonists. After a period of limited station facilities, reconstruction work commenced in the summer of 2006 and was completed in December that year.

Part of Tenney's Mill (red building) is visible behind the bridge; it was powered by water from a dam farther upstream. The foundations of Frey's Mill, which was powered by water from these falls, are just out of the frame on the right. The Saxtons River is a U.S. Geological Survey.

Etymology Looking east down Saxtons River, just west of the village of Saxtons River. The river is often reported to be named after a surveyor named Saxton who drowned (or almost drowned) in the river during the first survey of town lines along the river in 1736, but this does not appear to be the source of the name. \\"Saxton's\\" was apparently a variant spelling of \\"Sexton's,\\" which was the spelling used in the first written record of the river, by a scouting party from Fort Dummer in 1724. We do not know the source for the \\"Sexton's\\" name, however. Sexton appears to be more common as a surname than Saxton, since a sexton is a church or synagogue officer. Geography Gages Falls on the Saxtons River with ruin of Gages Mill on the right, North Westminster, VT. Twin Falls on the Saxtons River The Saxtons River rises to the east of Glebe Mountain, in the town of Windham. It continues on through the towns of Grafton and Rockingham, passing through the Rockingham village of Saxtons River (named for the river). It then continues into the town of Westminster before joining the Connecticut River at Westminster, just south of the Rockingham town line. Its watershed lies south of the Williams River watershed and north of the Westminster and Putney brook watersheds (most of Westminster and Putney are not drained by any rivers other than the Connecticut). The Saxtons River is crossed by two covered bridges. The Kidder Covered Bridge crosses the South Branch Saxtons River in Grafton, and the Hall Covered Bridge crosses the river in Rockingham. The former was built in about 1870, and the latter is a replacement built in 1982 for the original 1867 bridge, which was destroyed by an overweight truck in 1980. There are three notable waterfalls on the Saxtons River, listed from upriver to downriver: Saxtons River Falls in the village of Saxtons River, just below Centennial Bridge on Westminster St; Gages Falls in North Westminster, also called Gageville, just below the bridge on Covered Bridge Rd; and Twin Falls, a short distance downriver from Gages falls in North Westminster near Forest Rd.Around Bellows Falls: Rockingham, Westminster, and Saxtons River By Anne L. Collins, Virginia Lisai, and Louise Luring. Arcadia Publishing, 2002. Tributaries Lower end of the Saxtons River, where it flows into the Connecticut River.

Its latitude is 41.2833/41º16'60 N and its longitude is 1.36667/01º22'0 E. The population in 2003 is indicated by Municat as three and also as 27 people. This confusion is probably because the village falls under the jurisdiction of two municipalities: Vila-rodona and Montferri. The probable population today is about 10 people and the village covers an area of about 10,000m2. The elevation is 285 m above sea level. It is situated at the \\"T\\" junction to Montferri on the main road C51 between El Vendrell and Valls and at 2.5 km from exit 11 of the motorway AP2 from Barcelona to Lleida. The name (which translated means \\"burnt village\\") was first cited in 1009 as Villa Ardidam because of the fires lit by the Bishops from Barcelona at that time. The small church, Saint Mary of Vilardida, was built in the 18th century, although many of the village's buildings date back to the 15th century. The village lies in wine growing area on the edge of a small fertile flood plain, 400m from the River Gaià. This river flows all year round down into a large reservoir in the three municipalities: Renau, Vilabella and El Catllar and then out into the Mediterranean Sea at Altafulla, near Tamarit castle.

Shown on BBC2 on Thursday nights at 9, it combined sketch and sitcom elements. As with other shows launched in this timeslot, The Glam Metal Detectives attempted to innovate and combine genres, resulting in an off-the-wall mix of the sublime and the surreal which broke new ground with its 'multimedia' approach. The show consists of a single series of seven episodes. The series starred Gary Beadle, Phil Cornwell, Doon Mackichan (playing most of the female roles), Sara Stockbridge, George Yiasoumi, and Mark Caven. The scripts were written by the cast, director Peter Richardson, and Lloyd Stanton. The show was designed to appear as if the viewer was channel surfing through a multi- channel wasteland, happening upon spoof adverts, short sketches, and recurring show elements. Like other BBC content of the mid-1990s (such as KYTV), it often lampooned the low-budget quality of satellite television available in the UK at the time.  Content  Show segments included: *The Glam Metal Detectives themselves. A rock group charged with the mission of \\"saving the planet's ecology with your top-hit records\\", they would fight the evil media mogul Royston Brocade (Mac McDonald) in between gigs. This segment combined elements of the cultish, kitsch and televisual trash in an unpredictable manner. *Betty's Mad Dash - a 1930s-style adventure serial about two flappers, Betty and Maisie (Mackichan and Stockbridge), who are on the run from the police. Each episode involved hiding from the police in some period location and robbing people at gunpoint. *Bloodsports - a short segment portraying violent crimes such as ram raiding or a bailiff reposessing property as if they were recognised sports, complete with commentators using tortured metaphors who are taking the urban mayhem far too seriously. Often ended with the offenders messing up in some way and getting arrested. *Running From Death - an innovative attempt at self-parody, which saw the group running from the Grim Reaper. Each episode would include this sequence, which always bore a remarkable similarity to the chase sequence in the Betty's Mad Dash section, ending with the group robbing the Grim Reaper at gunpoint. The appearance of the Grim Reaper in the show is said to have been inspired by that of the director's friend Allan Yates. *The Big Me - a chat show parody featuring Morag (Mackichan), who was extremely self-obsessed and egomanaical, ignoring her guests and instead talking about herself, only to end up being replaced by her sycophantic chef Steve (Caven). *Colin Corleone - a nondescript Londoner (Yiasoumi) who believes himself to be a mafia godfather after watching The Godfather movies too many times, complete with henchmen (Beadle and Cornwell); for example, when his dole is cut off because he refuses to work in Do It All, he arranges a 'hit' on the DSS office worker, shooting him with a water pistol while he has his lunch. *Happy Hour - the revolting and chainsmoking bouncer and ticket seller of a strip club or clip joint stiff the customers. The bouncer fancies one of the acts, 'Vera' and has no idea that (s)he is a man in drag. *Once an episode, a large man played by Stephen Marcus would, following an explosion, say his cliché line in a variety of different voices: \\"you 'ad to get involved!\\" before firing his machine gun. *Various manipulative American talkshow hosts who would introduce items saying \\"We'll be: removing this woman's dignity / withholding oxygen from this man / breaking up this marriage ... right after this!\\" *Spoof adverts to fill in the gaps, often for everyday items such as keys or bath plugs, small-scale businesses, petty criminals, or share offers for public \\"services\\" like The Sea and The Sun, parodying the Thatcher and Major programme of privatisation. In other media The series' theme \\"Everybody Up!\\", by Trevor Horn and Lol Creme, was released as a CD single, with the main cast appearing in character on Top of the Pops. A soundtrack album was also released. A one-shot magazine special was published by Marvel UK to coincide with the launch of the show. It mirrored the channel hopping style of the show by featuring various magazine formats and comic book styles. The special was co-written by Peter Richardson, Robert Popper, the cast of the show and the magazine's editor, David Leach. It featured the artwork of - among others - Lew Stringer, David Leach and Art Wetherell. The magazine also used the same artwork for its cover that was used for the show's opening titles and subsequent video release. The special was intended to test the waters for a regular title should the show have been a success, but no more issues were made. The first three episodes of the series were later released on VHS video.

Bitten is a fantasy novel by Canadian writer Kelley Armstrong, published in 2001. It is the first book in the Women of the Otherworld series, and her first novel. Plot introduction Elena Michaels is the only known female werewolf, but she grows tired of spending her life pursuing rogue werewolves and trying to control her temper and violence. She decides to leave her Pack and live in Toronto as a human, but the Pack leader calls in a favor, which leads Elena to try to help quell an uprising.From \\"Bitten\\" website Plot summary The main character of Bitten is Elena Michaels, a woman who is the only known female werewolf in the world. She lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and writes for a popular newspaper. She struggles to deal with her other-ness and to assimilate to the human world. She also contends with her terrible childhood and with the man who bit her and turned her into a werewolf. Elena has settled into a somewhat normal existence, living with her architect boyfriend and ignoring her wolf side as much as possible. However, she learns that her Pack (the governing body of werewolves) is in trouble and comes to their aid, flying to Stonehaven, the country estate of the pack Alpha. It is in Bear Valley, a fictional city in up-state New York. When Elena arrives, she is greeted by her ex-lover, Clayton Danvers, who bit her and made her a werewolf (without her consent). Clayton is also the bodyguard and foster-son to Jeremy Danvers, the pack Alpha (leader). Elena learns that a local woman was found murdered on Stonehaven's land, savaged by what authorities thought to be a dog. However, the Pack has determined that she was murdered by a Mutt, a rogue werewolf. They find out he is a recently escaped killer who was recently turned into a werewolf. Clay and Elena chase him into a rave and after several of the partygoers are killed, the wolf is hit by an SUV. Soon, the rest of the Pack arrives to help with the problem: Antonio Sorrentino, his son Nicholas Sorrentino, Logan Jonsen, and Peter Myers. The werewolf Pack are the self- appointed governing body of the werewolf world. If they feel any non-Pack wolves (called \\"Mutts\\") become noticeable to humans, they kill them. In an ambush Peter is killed and Jeremy, the Alpha, is seriously wounded. Finally, the pack figures out that the \\"mutts\\", tired of being governed by the Pack, are trying to free themselves from their rule. To do this, one mutt, Daniel, has started turning human killers and other escaped convicts into werewolves to fight the pack. CharactersPack Werewolves= * Antonio Sorrentino – Hereditary werewolf and father of Nick. Once the Pack's top fighter, still strong. The best friend of the Alpha Wolf (Jeremy). * Clayton (Clay) Danvers – Bitten as a child, is seen as more wolf than human. He is Jeremy's foster-son- turned bodyguard and the werewolf who bit Elena. He is also Elena's ex-lover and is still in love with her. Bitten as a child, the story of which is told in Kelley's first online novella, Savage. * Elena Michaels – Journalist and the only known female werewolf. Bitten by then-lover, Clayton. Her parents died in a car crash while she was young, which sent her into many abusive foster families. Determined to leave that life behind, she focused on school and went to college, where she met Clayton. Used to live with the pack but attempted to leave at one point. Lives in Toronto with her boyfriend Philip. * Jeremy Danvers – Alpha werewolf and leader of the Pack. Possesses psychic abilities used to contact other Pack members.

Concept and creation Armstrong says Bitten was inspired by an X-Files episode on werewolves. She had the idea to portray werewolves as other than \\"bloodthirsty, ravening beasts\\" and quickly wrote a short story about a young woman who becomes a werewolf to present to her writing group. Eventually, Armstrong fleshed out the short story into a novel that became Bitten. Werewolf mythology In the Women of the Otherworld series, unlike many modern horror fiction stories, werewolves transform into full wolves in a painful transmogrification, while maintaining their hair colour and body mass, making them extremely large wolves. Although transformations have to occur regularly, Armstrong's werewolves are not affected by phases of the moon, can shape-shift at will and can learn to transform a single part of their body. Werewolves can be killed by anything that can kill a human and have no extra sensitivity to silver. They age slower than humans. For example, Antonio and his son Nick, despite an age gap of 17 years, pass themselves off as brothers in human company. In fact, Pack sons are raised referring to their fathers as 'uncle' while amidst humans, in order to avoid questions. While in human form, werewolves have wolf-like characteristics, better hearing, a keener sense of smell and a wolf's instinctive reactions, while in wolf form they maintain their intellect but cannot talk and are more driven by instinct. In both forms, they have greater strength and reflexes than a normal human or wolf and heal significantly faster. Hereditary werewolves acquire these enhanced abilities gradually, following puberty, and have their first change in their late teens or early 20s. Non-hereditary werewolves start changing shortly after they are bitten, and not all survive the process; the bitten mutts took around a month to recover. In the case of Clay, he could transform and had the enhanced abilities from when he was bitten at around age five.

Population figures: History Ragnita (from Old Prussian: ragas, \\"spur\\"), founded in 1288, was a settlement of the Baltic (Old Prussian) tribe of Skalvians. It was contested by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since its creation in the 13th century, and on April 23, 1289 it was conquered by the Teutonic Knights, who built a Gothic castle there, which later became the seat of a Komtur. The stronghold was called Landeshut, but the name did not become popular and the name Ragnit, after a local river, a tributary of the Memel (outside of Prussia called Neman), continued to be used. Although the settlement had an important castle not only guarding the Prussian lands of the State of the Teutonic Order from the north but also serving as a military base for the Knights' campaigns into adjacent Samogitia, it was living in the shadow of the nearby city of Tilsit (present-day Sovetsk). After the dissolution of the Order's State under its last Grand Master Albrecht von Hohenzollern, Ragnit on April 10, 1525 became a part of the Duchy of Prussia, which was ruled by the House of Hohenzollern as a fief of the Polish Crown until 1657. The duchy was inherited by the Hohenzollern margraves of Brandenburg in 1618, becoming an integral part of Brandenburg-Prussia, whereby remote Ragnit retained its status as a regional capital. Ragnit Castle and settlement, 1684 Ragnit was devastated by Tatars during the Second Northern War in 1656 and again by Swedish forces during the Scanian War in 1678, while the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg had achieved full sovereignty over his Prussian lands by the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau. His son and successor Elector Frederick III elevated himself to a King in Prussia in 1701. He granted Ragnit town privileges on April 6, 1722. It was again destroyed during the Seven Years' War, this time by Russian forces in 1757. Incorporated into the Province of East Prussia from 1815, Ragnit became a part of the German Empire upon the Prussian-led unification of Germany in 1871. On November 1, 1892, a railroad line linking the town with Tilsit (now Sovetsk) was opened. It was built to develop the wood industry in the area, but the development did not actually start and the area's economy remained dominated by food production. When Germany had to cede the Klaipėda Region north of the Neman River to the Conference of Ambassadors according to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Ragnit became a border town. In 1922, it lost its status as an administrative capital in favor of Tilsit. During World War II, on January 19, 1945, Ragnit was captured without a fight by the 3rd Belorussian Front of the Red Army in the course of the East Prussian Offensive. In accordance to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, the town became a part of Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR. It was renamed to Neman in 1946. Most of the local inhabitants who had not fled during the Soviet conquest of East Prussia were subsequently expelled to the western parts of Germany. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Neman serves as the administrative center of Nemansky District.Resolution #640 As an administrative division, it is, together with nineteen rural localities, incorporated within Nemansky District as the town of district significance of Neman. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Neman is incorporated within Nemansky Municipal District as Nemanskoye Urban Settlement.Law #257 Lithuanian minority Despite being a part of German- speaking states, for centuries Ragnit was an important center of Lithuanian culture. From 1549 to 1563, famous Lithuanian writer and translator (who wrote the first book in the Lithuanian language, \\"Catechismusa Prasty Szadei\\" (\\"The Simple Words of Catechism\\")) Martynas Mažvydas was priest and Archdiacon of Ragainė. While living in Ragainė he wrote \\"The Song of St. Ambrosy\\" (with a dedication in Lithuanian), translated \\"The Form of Baptism\\" from German into Lithuanian, published \\"The Prussian Agenda\\" into the prayer \\"Paraphrasis\\". One of his major works was \\"The Christian Songs\\" (Giesmės Krikščioniškos). In the 19th century, after the January Uprising when the Lithuanian language was banned from the office in all of Russian-ruled Lithuania, books in that language were printed in Ragnit and then smuggled to Russia by the Lithuanian book smugglers (knygnešiai). According to German data 17,500 Lithuanians lived in the Ragnit district in 1890 (32% of the population).http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/tilsit.html In 2010 Lithuanians composed 2.8% of the town population, being the third largest ethnic group after Russians and Belarusians.

The long title (properly, the title in some jurisdictions) is the formal title appearing at the head of a statute (such as an act of Parliament or of Congress) or other legislative instrument. The long title is intended to provide a summarised description of the purpose or scope of the instrument. Like other descriptive components of an act (such as the preamble, section headings, side notes, and short title), the long title seldom affects the operative provisions of an act, except where the operative provisions are unclear or ambiguous and the long title provides a clear statement of the legislature's intention The short title is the formal name by which legislation may by law be cited. It contrasts with the long title which, while usually being more fully descriptive of the legislation's purpose and effects, is generally too unwieldy for most uses. For example, the short title House of Lords Act 1999 contrasts with the long title An Act to restrict membership of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage; to make related provision about disqualifications for voting at elections to, and for membership of, the House of Commons; and for connected purposes. Significance of long titles In the United Kingdom, the long title is important since, under the procedures of Parliament, a bill cannot be amended to go outside the scope of its long title. For that reason, modern long titles tend to be rather vague, ending with the formulation \\"and for connected purposes\\". The long title of an older act is sometimes termed its rubric, because it was sometimes printed in red. Short titles for acts of Parliament were not introduced until the mid-19th century, and were not provided for every act passed until late in the century; as such, the long title was used to identify the act. Short titles were subsequently given to many unrepealed acts at later dates; for example, the Bill of Rights, an Act of 1689, was given that short title by the Short Titles Act 1896, having until then been formally referred to only by its long title, An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown. Similarly, in the US, the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was ruled unconstitutional in part by Marbury v. Madison (1803), was called \\"An Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States\\". The long title was traditionally followed by the preamble, an optional part of an act setting out a number of preliminary statements of facts similar to recitals, each starting Whereas...  Short titles  Unlike the long title, which precedes the preamble and enacting formula, and thus sits outside the main body of text, the short title for modern legislation is explicitly defined by a specific section, typically at the very end or very beginning of the main text. As with the above example, short titles are generally made up of just a few words that describe in broad terms the area of law being changed or the thing affected, followed by the word \\"Act\\" and then the year in which the legislation is formally enacted. A notable exception is Israel, in which this convention is reversed. The short title sits outside the main body of legislation, and the summary description of the law, which is made optional, is defined by a specific section if existing. For example, the Combating Iran's Nuclear Program Act, which under the usual convention would have begun with the long title and whose first section might have read actually begins with the short title and its first section reads The Australian state of Victoria follows a similar practice, having a title comparable to a short title outside the main body of the legislation and a purpose section establishing the purpose of the legislation. The titles of legislation enacted by the United States Congress, if they include a year, invariably add the preposition \\"of\\" between the word \\"Act\\" and the year. Compare the Australian Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (UK), and Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (USA). Even if no year was included in the official short title enacted by Congress, it is traditional always to precede the year with an \\"of\\" if it needs to be appended in prose after the short title. This convention is followed by most but not all U.S. states; for example, the Act of the Pennsylvania legislature that consolidated the governments of the city of Philadelphia and Philadelphia County is generally (though not formally) called the Act of Consolidation, 1854. The vast majority of acts passed by the Parliament of Canada do not include the year of enactment as part of the short title. In the Philippine Congress, titling of legislation primarily follows the U.S. convention. Since the early 20th century, it has become popular in the United States to include the names of key legislators in the short titles of the most important acts. This was at first done informally; that is, the names appeared in legal treatises and court opinions but were not part of the statute as enacted. Eventually members of Congress began to formally write their own names into short titles (thereby immortalizing themselves for posterity), as in the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In some states, like California, some short titles consist only of the names of the key legislators, as in the Lanterman–Petris–Short Act, the statutory basis of the \\"5150\\" involuntary psychiatric hold used for temporarily detaining psychiatric patients. Draft legislation (bills) also uses short titles, but substitutes the word \\"Bill\\" for \\"Act\\". UseUnited Kingdom= The wording after \\"An Act\\" varies somewhat between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the long title opens with the words \\"An Act to ...\\". For example, the short title of the House of Lords Act 1999 is House of Lords Act 1999, but its long title is An Act to restrict membership of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage; to make related provision about disqualifications for voting at elections to, and for membership of, the House of Commons; and for connected purposes. UK bills substitute the words \\"A Bill\\" for \\"An Act\\". Thus, before it passed, the long title of the House of Lords Bill 1999 was \\"A Bill to restrict membership...\\". Because of the way they are used to define the scope of bills, many British long titles are quite long. =United States= While the long titles of most acts of the US Congress read, \\"An Act to...\\", appropriations bills begin, \\"An Act making appropriations for...\\". Bills begin \\"A Bill for an Act...\\" Legislation in U.S. states also vary both in the exact wording and the level of detail of long titles. A typical long title in Illinois is, \\"AN ACT concerning safety\\", giving only a very broad characterization of the subject matter. On the other hand, a recent New Hampshire law carried the long title, \\"AN ACT relative to establishing a municipal bond rescission process, authorizing governing bodies to call a special meeting to consider reduction or rescission of appropriations, and clarifying special procedures enabling towns to respond appropriately to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\\" =Australia= Australian long titles are more like American than British ones in that they are short and broad: for example, \\"A Bill for an Act to provide for the establishment of the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and for related purposes\\". However, not all states use long titles and an Act may instead have an explicit \\"Purpose\\" section. =Ireland= An act may be cited in an enactment or other document by, amongst other things, the short title of the act.Interpretation Act 2005, Section 14(1) =New Zealand= Long and short titles were used in New Zealand up to and including 1999. From 1 January 2000 they were replaced by a single title. =South Africa= Long titles in South Africa omit the initial \\"An\\". Effect of repealUnited Kingdom= An act may continue to be cited by the short title authorised by any enactment notwithstanding the repeal of that enactment.The Interpretation Act 1978, section 19(2) =Ireland= Notwithstanding the repeal of an enactment giving a short title to an act, the act may, without prejudice to any other mode of citation, continue to be cited by that short title.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 3 Comma Originally short titles had a comma preceding the year. Whether this is retained or not depends on the country involved: it has been dropped in Ireland and the United Kingdom, but retained in Canada. =United Kingdom= It is actually not necessary to use the comma as, although normal punctuation is now used by draftsmen, and is included in Queen's Printer's copies of acts of Parliament, it is not part of an act of Parliament.Duke of Devonshire v. O'Connor (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 468 at p. 478, per Lord Esher, M.R. The comma preceding the calendar year in printed copies of acts is omitted on the authority of a note by Sir Noel Hutton QC, First Parliamentary Counsel, as to which see \\"The Citation of Statutes\\" 82 LQR 24-24. The validity of this note is questioned by Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Reissue, Volume 44(1), footnote 10 to paragraph 1268.

Third Edition. 2010. Paragraph 23.2.1 at page 243. Interpretation In Re Boaler, Buckley LJ said: In R v Wheatley, Bridge LJ said of the Explosives Act 1875 and the Explosive Substances Act 1883:  History  Since the second half of the nineteenth century, short titles have become the usual method of referencing earlier statute law within legislation itself. In the UK this replaced the earlier method of citing the long title together with the chapter number and the regnal year(s) of the parliamentary session in which it received Royal Assent. For example, modern legislation would simply refer to \\"the Evidence Act 1845\\", whereas in the past it would have been necessary to use wording such as \\"the Act passed in the eighth and ninth year of Her Majesty's reign chapter one hundred and thirteen intituled 'An Act to facilitate the Admission in Evidence of certain official and other Documents. Short titles were introduced because the titles of statutes (now commonly known as long titles) had become so long that they were no longer a useful means of citation. For example, the title of 19 Geo.2 c.26 (1745) (Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746) ran to 65 lines of King's Printer and to over 400 words.The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, Statute Law Revision: Fifteenth Report, Draft Statute Law Repeals Bill, Law Com 233, Scot Law Com 150, Part IV, para. 4.2, p. 76, footnote 2 BAILII Scottish Law Commission Short titles were first introduced for acts of Parliament in the 1840s.The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, Statute Law Revision: Fifteenth Report, Draft Statute Law Repeals Bill, Law Com 233, Scot Law Com 150, Part IV, para. 4.2, p. 76 Amending acts also began to take the opportunity to create short titles for earlier acts as well as for themselves. Eventually the Short Titles Act 1892 (55 & 56 Vict. c.10) was passed to create short titles for almost all remaining legislation. This statute was repealed and replaced by the Short Titles Act 1896, which conferred short titles on about 2,000 acts. The Short Titles Act (Northern Ireland) 1951 conferred short titles on 179 acts applying to Northern Ireland. The Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964 conferred short titles on 164 pre-union Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. Further short titles were given by the Statute Law Revision Act 1948, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1977 and the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1978. In Ireland, ex post facto short titles have been conferred by the Short Titles Act 1962, the Statute Law Revision Act 2007, the Statute Law Revision Act 2009 and the Statute Law Revision Act 2012.  Name changes  In a few cases, particular acts have had more than one short title given to them, for example because subsequent amendments to their contents have rendered the earlier name inaccurate. For example, when the 1992 version of Basic Law: the Government – the so-called \\"Direct Election law\\" – made the post of Prime Minister of Israel elected, it added provisions regarding the Prime Ministerial election to the Knesset Election Law, 1969, and renamed it as \\"Knesset and Prime Minister Elections Law, 1969\\". This change was reverted following the abolition of direct Prime Ministerial elections in 2001. British (and English) legislation that has been \\"inherited\\" by the legal systems of other countries has also sometimes ended up with a short title in one jurisdiction that differs from that used in another: for example, the act of Parliament that created Canada in 1867 is formally known in Canada as the Constitution Act, 1867, but is still known as the British North America Act 1867 in British law; note also the differing comma convention. Similarly, the Act \\"21 & 22 George III c.48\\" of the Parliament of Ireland is \\"Yelverton's Act (Ireland) 1781 [I]\\" in Northern Ireland and \\"Calendar Act, 1781\\" in the Republic of Ireland; the short titles were assigned respectively by Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Oireachtas. Alt URL  Examples  Most short titles include a descriptive phrase followed by the type of legislation and the year of enactment; for example, the Human Rights Act 1998 is an act of Parliament relating to human rights that received Royal Assent in 1998. Some exceptions exist, such as the Bill of Rights 1689, whose formal short title in the UK (as given by the Short Titles Act 1896) is simply \\"Bill of Rights\\", without a year, although it is not a bill but an act. More narrowly focused legislation may have a secondary phrase in parentheses, such as the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) Regulations 2002 (a statutory instrument). Laws that relate primarily to other laws, such as amendments, contain the short titles of those laws in their own short titles, for example the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 (Amendment) Act 2010. Subsequent enactments can lead to particularly lengthy short titles; for example, the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868, amended by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868 (Amendment) Act 1869, and itself amended by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act 1868 (Amendment) Act 1879 (Amendment) Act 1880. The more recent shorter convention is that an act amending \\"Foo Act yyy1\\" will have short title \\"Foo (Amendment) Act yyy2\\". If a law is passed with the same title as another law passed in the same year, an ordinal number will be added to distinguish it from the others; this is particularly common for Finance Acts (Finance (No. 3) Act 2010) and commencement orders that bring parts of an Act into force (Environment Act 1995 (Commencement No.13) (Scotland) Order 1998). However, for laws that amend other laws, this ordinal numbering does not reset every year (For example, even though only two amendments were made to the Israeli Criminal Procedure Law in 2018, these amendments are numbered No.81 and No.82 in their titles.) In Ireland, the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Act 2012 was enacted in 2015 rather than 2012. It was passed by both houses of the Oireachtas in 2012 but not signed into law by the President until 2015, after an intervening referendum and court challenge. Section 2(2) of the act, which assigns the short title, could not be amended between the houses' passing the bill and its being enacted (though it could still be amended by a subsequent act of the Oireachtas). This act's short title is longer than its long title (\\"An Act to Amend the Constitution\\", as required by the constitution).

Early life and education Binder was born on October 19, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1963 and MBA from Columbia University in 1967. At Dartmouth, he had his first show business experience as an improv comedian with the Dartmouth Players. One of Dartmouth's educational philosophies was a belief in community service, which Binder embraced with the Big Apple Circus' community programs.  Big Apple Circus  Binder became known in New York City for his juggling abilities, but he sought a larger audience. With this in mind, he set to tour around Europe, bringing in his performing instruments with him. Binder was a street artist when he and Michael Christensen decided to make circus performing their profession. At the time, they were in Kent, England. They made their living as street performers, traveling from London to Istanbul. Soon after, they finalized an accord to tour France with the Nouveau Cirque de Paris. Along with Christensen, Binder also participated in the famed Casino de Paris, as well as on French television shows. Binder founded the Big Apple Circus, with Christensen later being named co-founder, after they returned from Europe in 1977. Binder's dedication to circus life and the success of the Big Apple Circus have helped him garner a variety of awards and honors, many of which he shares with Christensen. Both men were elected to honorary memberships in the New York arts and literary organization The Lotos Club. In 2001, Binder was declared a \\"New York City Living Landmark\\" by the New York Landmarks Conservancy society. In October 2008, The New York Times reported that Binder would be retiring from his role as ringmaster and artistic director for the Big Apple Circus in 2009, although he continued to work behind the scenes as founder and founding artistic director. During that time, ABC News named Binder \\"Person of the Week\\". Binder published his memoir Never Quote the Weather to a Sea Lion and Other Uncommon Tales from the Founder of the Big Apple Circus in April 2013. It has a foreword by Glenn Close. In 2017, Binder and Christensen performed at the 50th annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival to \\"hand over the keys\\" to the circus' new leadership after it emerged from filing for bankruptcy the year before, which in the Big Apple Circus' case was a rubber chicken and a top hat. Other career After college, Binder moved to Boston, where he was hired by WGBH-TV as a Floor Manager for Julia Child's The French Chef, and he later worked in New York City and Los Angeles as Talent Coordinator with The Merv Griffin Show and Associate Producer of the original Jeopardy! That same year, Paul married Vivian Bachrach. Later on, Binder went to San Francisco, where he auditioned for and joined the San Francisco Mime Troupe, meeting Christensen, while performing with that company. In 2016, Binder performed in his cabaret THE TALL AND SHORT OF IT with co-star Dana Mierlak. In 2017, Binder performed in another cabaret P-P-P- Paul and K-K-K-Katie with co-star Katie Galuska. Recognition Binder has received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Dartmouth College, his alma mater.New York Magazine, Jan 2, 1989, Page 81 He was also honored by Long Island University (Doctor of Humane Letters), Pratt Institute, and Rhode Island College.  Personal life  Binder is the father of four adult children and also has five grandchildren.

It was released in limited numbers in December 2005 for the Christmas season, with full production starting in early 2006. The company introduced a lower-priced version, the Scooba 5800, in the second half of 2006. It introduced a new Scooba 450 at CES 2014 in January 2014. By 2016, the Scooba line of floor-scrubbers were phased out in favor of the Braava line of floor-mopping robots. Operation The Scooba used either a special non- bleach cleaning solution named \\"Scooba juice\\" (made by the Clorox Company) formulated to clean the floors while discouraging rust or wheel slippage, or the newer Scooba Natural Enzyme cleaning solution. The robot prepared the floor by vacuuming loose debris, squirted clean solution on the floor, scrubbed the floor, and then sucked up the dirty solution leaving a nearly dry floor behind. The robot was safe to use on sealed hardwood floors and most other hard household surfaces, but could not be used on rugs. Scooba avoided cleaning rugs and stairs, and could clean about on a single tank-load of solution. Some models of the Scooba included an iRobot Virtual Wall accessory, which projected a beam of infrared light, setting a boundary which the robot would not cross. The Scooba was the second major commercial product made by iRobot, which popularized vacuum robots with the Roomba. It was available in over 40 countries. Systems The Scooba used approximately of cleaning solution per cycle, mixed with of water to fill the cleaning solution tank. The Scooba came with four packets of the new \\"Natural Enzyme\\" cleaning solution, enough for about four washes. Additional Clorox cleaning solution comes in five- and nine-packs of bottles, which provided enough solution for about 16 washings per bottle. Polysorbate 20 and tetrapotassium EDTA were the primary ingredients. Some Scooba models could also use white vinegar or plain water in place of the proprietary solution.Bot generated title --> Recharge times were typically 3 hours. Models iRobot Scooba 230 floor washing robot =The original Scooba= Scooba 5900 was the first Scooba, it could be used with the Scooba Cleaning Solution, or other suitably conductive solutions, but was discontinued in favor of the Scooba 5800 version (basic floor washing model) which could also use plain water in its cleaning tank. iRobot shed several of the 5900's premium features to produce the lower-priced 5800 model. There were no changes to the basic floor cleaning machinery. The Scooba 5800 could clean about per battery charge. =Scooba 200 series= Introduced in 2011, the Scooba 230 was a smaller model, less than half the diameter but taller than the previous Scooba models. The reduced diameter allowed the robot to clean more areas in small bathrooms, kitchens, and other tight spaces. In order to reduce the size, the clean water and dirty water tanks were replaced with an internal clean water bladder in a sealed compartment that holds the dirty water, allowing the dirty water storage to expand as the clean water was used up. It worked the same way as the other scooba's, only there is no scrubbing brushes, but bristles. Only Scooba cleaning solution and water are recommended as vinegar and the original cleaning solution will damage the bladder. The initial vacuuming stage present in other Scooba models was also removed, requiring users to sweep up or vacuum loose debris ahead of time. The Scooba 230 could clean up to in one charge. =Scooba 300 series= The Scooba 300 series replaced the original 5000 series robots. They were similar in design and size to the original Scooba and used Scooba cleaning solution, vinegar solution, or plain water. The robots in this series were differentiated by the size of the area they could clean on a single charge, and the accessories supplied. :Scooba 330 (basic US version) could clean per battery charge. :Scooba 350 (intermediate floor washing model, US version) could clean about per battery charge. :Scooba 380 (premium floor washing model, US version) could clean per battery charge. It also included charging base, storage mat, and an extra Virtual Wall (for a total of two). :Scooba 385 (European version of US 380 model) doesn't include charging base, storage mat or extra Virtual Wall (only one included). :Scooba 390 (Longer battery life, new color scheme). =Scooba 450= The fourth generation Scooba 450 was introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014. It could mop tile, wood, linoleum, and more. It uses a three-stage cleaning process. First, it sweeps and pre-soaks the floor with cleaning solution, and then it scrubs the floor and squeegees the dirty solution.  Discontinuation  iRobot launched the Braava line of floor mopping robots in 2013, which eventually replaced the Scooba brand by 2016.

Lishman, who played as an inside forward, featured for clubs Walsall, Arsenal & Nottingham Forest throughout his career. Lishman is as well Arsenal's seventh highest goalscorer of all time. Career Born in Birmingham, Lishman first played as a centre forward for non-league Paget Rangers, before signing as a professional for Third Division South Walsall in August 1946. In two seasons with the Saddlers, Lishman scored 26 goals in 59 league appearances. He was signed by Arsenal in the summer of 1948 for £10,500, as backup for Reg Lewis, who was only 28 but becoming ever more frequently injured. Lishman made his debut against Sheffield United on 4 September 1948, but after a promising first season (scoring 13 goals in 25 appearances), Lishman's 1949–50 and 1950–51 seasons were marred by injury. Lishman was passed over for the 1950 FA Cup Final (which Arsenal won 2–0), in favour of Lewis and Peter Goring, and then just as he came back into the Arsenal first team, he broke his leg playing against Stoke City in December 1950. However, Lishman recovered to become Arsenal's top scorer in 1950–51, and the next season hit 30 goals, including three hat-tricks in three successive home matches; Arsenal finished third that season. The following 1951–52 season they reached the 1952 FA Cup Final, only to lose to Newcastle United; a series of injuries meant only eight fit players finished the match as no substitutes were allowed in those days. Lishman came close for Arsenal with a header, which clipped the crossbar, but Arsenal still lost the game 1–0. Lishman's disappointment was soon forgotten, as Arsenal won the League Championship in 1952–53. Lishman was again Arsenal's top scorer, this time with 22, and with every goal proving vital as Arsenal won the title on goal average above Preston North End. His form was good enough for him to be picked for an England B match against Scotland B in March 1953, although he was never capped for the full national side. Lishman was top scorer for another two seasons after that, making it five successive seasons as the club's top scorer in total. With younger men like Derek Tapscott and David Herd taking over goalscoring duties for Arsenal, however, Lishman was dropped from the first team in 1955–56. In all he scored 137 goals in 244 appearances, making him the club's seventh-highest goalscorer of all time. In March 1956 he was sold to Second Division Nottingham Forest. Whilst at Forest Lishman, scored a hat- trick in a 4–0 win over Sheffield United, a win that allowed for Forest to be promoted to Division One in 1956–57. Lishman eventually decided to retire as a footballer in the summer of 1957, leaving the game entirely. He joined his father-in law in the furniture retail business in Stoke-on-Trent, later taking over the business himself. He continued to live in Stoke-on-Trent until his death in 1994.

The screen-door effect (SDE) is a visual artifact of displays, where the fine lines separating pixels (or subpixels) become visible in the displayed image. This can be seen in digital projector images and regular displays under magnification or at close range, but the increases in display resolutions have made this much less significant. More recently, the screen door effect has been an issue with virtual reality headsets and other head-mounted displays, because these are viewed at a much closer distance, and stretch a single display across a much wider field of view.  SDE in projectors  In LCD and DLP projectors, SDE can be seen because projector optics typically have significantly lower pixel density than the size of the image they project, enlarging these fine lines, which are much smaller than the pixels themselves, to be seen. This results in an image that appears as if viewed through a fine screen or mesh such as those used on anti- insect screen doors. The screen door effect was noticed on the first digital projector: an LCD projector made in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff. To eliminate this artifact, Dolgoff invented depixelization, which used various optical methods to eliminate the visibility of the spaces between the pixels. The dominant method made use of a microlens array, wherein each micro-lens caused a slightly magnified image of the pixel behind it, filling in the previously- visible spaces between pixels. In addition, when making a projector with a single, full-color LCD panel, an additional appearance of pixelation was visible due to the noticeability of green pixels (appearing bright) adjacent to red and blue pixels (appearing dark), forming a noticeable repeating light and dark pattern. Use of a micro-lens array at a slightly greater distance created new pixel images, with each \\"new\\" pixel being a summation of six neighboring sub-pixels (made up of two full color pixels, one above the other). Since there were as many micro-lenses as there were original pixels, no resolution was lost, which was confirmed with modulation transfer function (MTF) measurements. The screen door effect on Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors can be mitigated by deliberately setting the projected image slightly out of focus, which blurs the boundaries of each pixel to its neighbor. This minimizes the effect by filling the black pixel perimeters with adjacent light. Some older LCD projectors have a more noticeable screen door effect than first generation DLP projectors. Newer DLP chip designs promise closer spacing of the mirror elements which would reduce this effect; however, some space is still required along one edge of the mirror to provide a control circuit pathway. Use of Dolgoff's depixelization method could also produce a DLP projector without noticeable pixelation.

Tondu lies on the A4063 from Bridgend to Maesteg, and was established in the late 18th century as a coal mining village servicing the Parc Slip Colliery. In later years, an iron works was also established, and in the 19th century, a brick works was constructed using the clay from the carboniferous coal measures to make a variety of bricks, mostly for engineering. The brick works was demolished in 1977. The association with the coal industry was also reflected in the large area office of the National Coal Board in the village and a centre for the Mines Rescue Service.  Railway connections  The village has several railway lines and provided access to collieries in Wern-Tarw and the Ogmore and Garw valleys, along with maintenance facilities. All were closed to passenger traffic in the 1960s. They were used extensively by coal trains until the mine closures in the 1980s. The Wern-Tarw line was disused and lifted first, followed by the Ogmore line sometime afterwards. The Garw line is disused, but still extant. During the early 1990s the Bridgend to Maesteg line was re-opened to passenger traffic and provides a service to Cardiff. Occasional steel trains run via the Margam to Tondu and Tondu to Bridgend branch lines. The Margam line is now used by the new Parc Slip opencast mine for coal. The village is served by Tondu railway station.  River Llynfi  The River Llynfi flows alongside Tondu on its way to its confluence with the River Ogmore. The Llynfi at this point has had a history of severe pollution. Historically, the pollution started with the coal industry. The coal seams in this part of the South Wales Valleys are quite wet and the coal itself is rich in pyrites and thus also rich in sulphur. Such mine waters have a very high burden of coal and rock solids and also contain heavy metals such as nickel, iron and copper in acidic solution. For many years the river also suffered from pollution from a paper mill at Maesteg  History  Sir Robert Price = Sir Robert Price took over leases around Tondu Farm previously granted to William Bryant, the liquidator of John Bedford’s business. Sir Robert had ambitions as an ironmaster and began to develop an ironworks alongside the Dyffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway at Tondu in the late 1830s. He traded as the Glamorgan Coal and Iron Company. Progress was initially slow due to a trade recession in the early 1840s, but there was a revival in 1843 and the first furnace at Tondu was blown-in in 1844. The year 1843 was significant for the Tondu district as extensive reserves of black-band ironstone were discovered six miles (10 km) to the north in the Maesteg area during that year. The discovery, and an unprecedented period of growth in the iron trade during the mid-1840s, prompted Sir Robert to develop his works at Tondu and open-up the Tywith coal and ironstone mine near present-day Nantyffyllon, Maesteg. Typically for the iron trade, prices fell sharply after the short-lived boom period and, as a result, the Tondu Works struggled to survive through the early 1850s and Sir Robert Price faced bankruptcy. However, because of the progress made during the years 1843-1847, the Tondu Ironworks and associated mines formed a significant pocket of production in mid-Glamorgan with some potential. That potential was recognised by the Lancashire firm of John Brogden and Sons who bought the Tondu property in 1854. .Higgins, LS, The Brogden Pioneers of the early industrial development in Mid-Glamorgan, National Library of Wales Journal, Vol XX, No. 3, Summer 1978, pp 240-252.Rees, Gwilym J, Tondu House – A History of Ownership and Tenants (1650-1963), published by the author (1997) = Brogdens = In February 1854 John Brogden sent his fourth son James, aged 22, to revive and run the business. In July 1854, John Brogden signed a new 99-year lease with Jane Nicholl. James rapidly reorganised and expanded the works. James rebuilt Tondu House between 1854 and 1857. In the 1861 census he said he was employing 900 men and farming with 20 men. In 1856 the Brogdens re-opened Price's coal and ore mine at Tywith, and, during the mid-1860s, developed collieries at Park Slip, Aberkenfig, Garth, Maesteg and Wyndham and Tynewydd in the Ogmore Valley - all managed from Tondu. In July 1863 Brogdens obtained an Act of Parliament to build a new standard gauge railway in the Ogmore Valley and to lay a third rail on the existing broad gauge Lynfi Railway to Porthcawl. In 1866 they obtained an Act to merge the two railway companies. In 1867 they opened a new dock in Porthcawl. All of these measures helped to promote the growth of industry in the area. = Brogdens give way to North's Navigation = In 1869, John Brogden died and his eldest son Alexander Brogden came to Tondu to take charge of the business. In 1872 Alexander formed a new joint- stock company, the Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company Limited which merged Brogdens’ Glamorgan business interests with those of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co. This moved was probably forced - Brogdens' Tywith mine had encroached on the other company's territory and the merger was in lieu of compensation. However the new company was short-lived. The Llynfi company was financed by debentures which could be withdrawn at short notice. A major debenture holder did withdraw making the merged company insolvent. It was wound up by creditors in 1878. The liquidator made a number of attempts to make the business viable until it was taken over by North’s Navigation Collieries (1889) Ltd.The Iron Industry in Maesteg, David Lewis, Swansea 2007 = Disastrous explosion = On the day of the annual St. Mary Hill Fair, 26 August 1892, a huge explosion shook the Parc Slip Colliery; 112 men and boys died with just 39 survivors: some remained trapped underground for a week before being rescued. Sixty women were widowed and 153 children left fatherless.David Owen (2002) South Wales Collieries, Volume 3, pages 36/7 provides much more detail. The mine closed in 1904. A memorial to the disaster still stands consisting of 112 stones - one for every death. Much later, the coal seams were re-worked as part of the Parc Slip opencast coal mine. = New manager = Also in 1892,Presumably following the explosion. Help needed here. John Boyd-Harvey was appointed General Manager and Managing Director. Boyd- Harvey was a Cornishman who had studied gas production in Swansea – under the circumstances a very useful thing. He had followed his elder brother Robert to South America. Robert had gone into partnership with Colonel North there and John also joined the business, managing the Iquique Gas Company on the border of Chile and Peru. He retired in 1913, at the early age of 52. After that North’s Navigation continued until the Nationalisation of Coal in 1947, although the iron works was closed. = Tondu House = The General Managers lived in Tondu House until 1940 when the house was commandeered by the Ministry of Supply for the Pyrotechnic Research Department (PRD), evacuated from London. The site was chosen because it was in an elevated and relatively isolated position, some distance from a built-up area and only four miles from ROF Bridgend. This involved Tondu with some very important war work, including the development of incendiary flares that were dropped on targets by Pathfinder aircraft. These aircraft, including the famous Mosquito, would fly ahead of the main bomber force and locate and mark the targets with the flares. PRD was relocated to Langhurst Sussex in 1957, where it merged with the former Flame Warfare Research Establishment. Today there is still evidence of the PRD's presence at Tondu Farm; a concrete viewing shelter in the woods close to the farm, from which the researchers could safely view and assess their experimental pyrotechnics. The Tondu House Mansion was demolished in 1963 by its owners Merthyr Mawr Estate, due to its poor and dangerous condition, leaving only one residential cottage standing amongst its outbuildings. It was then leased to a farmer until 2001.http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=33&coll;_id=2325&expand;= = The Old Pit Pony Hospital = On site is an old pit pony hospital where all the local pit ponies came for treatment and rest during their lives in the local pits. It was the only pit pony hospital in Mid Glamorgan. Governance At the local level Tondu is a community electoral ward to Ynysawdre Community Council, represented by up to six of the ten community councillors. The Ynysawdre county ward elects a councillor to Bridgend County Borough Council.

The first three verses are about the simple lifestyle he grew up with in Derry, while the final two deal with the Troubles, and lament how his placid hometown had become a major military outpost, plagued with violence. The final verse includes a message of hope for a \\"bright, brand new day\\", saying \\"They will not forget but their hearts are set / on tomorrow and peace once again\\". Stuart Bailie has described the song as one of the few \\"nuanced\\" songs during the Troubles that both Unionists and Republicans could sing. Background While Phil Coulter had written several Top 10 pop songs in the late 1960s (including Eurovision entries Puppet on a String and Congratulations), collaborations as a producer with The Dubliners and Luke Kelly, led to him writing a number of folk songs with more \\"grown-up\\" themes including those with a political aspect. The Town I Loved So Well was written against a backdrop of the Troubles in Derry, and released in 1973 on The Dubliners Plain and Simple album, which Coulter produced. Covers In addition to its long association with Luke Kelly, Paddy Reilly also had some success with the song, charting for a total of 18 weeks at different times during the 1970s. The song has also been covered by Dexys, The High Kings, The Irish Tenors, Johnny Logan (on his 2007 album The Irish Connection), and Nathan Carter (on his 2012 album The Live Show). The song has also been translated and covered in other languages, including by Tri Yann, a Breton band, under the title \\"La Ville que J'ai Tant Aimée\\" with lyrics in French. Dafydd Iwan recorded a translation in Welsh (\\"Y Dref a Gerais i Cyd\\", 'The Town I Loved So Long'), with Hannes Wader recording a German version (\\"Kleine Stadt\\"), and Lillebjørn Nilsen a Norwegian version (\\"Byen Jeg Kjente Som Min\\"). Notable performances An instrumental version of the song was played at the funeral of the Northern Ireland politician and Nobel laureate John Hume on 5 August 2020. Hume and Coulter were close friends, and the song was said to be a favourite of Hume's.

Since 2004 it has awarded over £9 billion to more than 130,000 projects in the UK. The Community Fund aims to support projects which help communities and people it considers most in need. Over 80 per cent of its funds go to voluntary and community organisations, it also makes grants to statutory bodies, local authorities and social enterprises. The fund makes grants to projects working in health, education and the environment and the charitable sector. It funds projects in line with objectives set by the government but does not fund services which other parts of government have a statutory responsibility to deliver.  \\"Additionality\\" principle  According to its Annual Report,Big Lottery Fund Annual Report and Accounts Big Lottery Fund uses the following definition of \\"additionality\\": \\"Lottery funding is distinct from Government funding and adds value. Although it does not substitute for Exchequer expenditure, where appropriate it complements Government and other programmes, policies and funding.\\"  Income  The income of all the Lottery distributors comes from the sale of National Lottery tickets. Of every £2 spent on a Lottery ticket 56 pence (28%) goes to the \\"good causes\\". The current operator of the National Lottery is Camelot. The Community Fund is the largest of the Lottery distributors, with an income of about £600 million a year. The Fund is responsible for distributing 40% of funds raised for \\"good causes\\" (roughly 23 pence of every £2 spent on a Lottery ticket).  Funding  Big Lottery Fund does not operate projects but allocates funds to organisations which operate projects. As part of the application process for funding, the Fund requires funded organisations to outline the difference that should come about as a result of its funding. The Fund uses several methods to distribute funding. Most of its grants go to voluntary and community organisations which apply within a range of funding programmes. However, in certain cases to meet a specific need, the Fund will also seek applications from organisations with recognised expertise or make a substantial grant to a partner to award funds on its behalf.  Creation  Big Lottery Fund came into being on 1 June 2004, with the merger of two Lottery distributors – the National Lottery Charities Board (whose operating name was Community Fund) and the New Opportunities Fund. Big Lottery Fund was formally established by the National Lottery Act 2006. The Act gave the new body the extra responsibility of managing projects funded by the Millennium Commission.  Accountability  The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has overall responsibility for the National Lottery, and Big Lottery Fund receives policy and financial directions from the Office for Civil Society (OCS) within DCMS, alongside the devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  Structure  The strategic direction of the Big Lottery Fund is decided by a Board made up of a Chair and nine Board members. The Fund's decision-making on grants is devolved to country committees for each of the four UK countries – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The chairs of these country committees sit on the main Board. Each of the four countries runs their own funding programmes, based on particular priorities and needs. The Big Lottery Fund Chair is Peter Ainsworth. The day-to-day running of Big Lottery Fund is under the responsibility of senior management team, made up of the Chief Executive, five directors and two deputy directors. The current CEO is Dawn Austwick.  Funding programmes  A list of the programmes that the Big Lottery Fund has funded can be found on the Big Lottery Fund website. Programmes funded include: = Wisdom Bank = £250,000 was given to the Wisdom Bank, a website project to \\"harness the experience and skills of people in the 45 to 65 age group for the wider benefit of the community of Torfaen\\". In two years the site only registered 340 users, before being taken over by Torfaen council. A member of the council's audit committee criticised the spending of further public money on the site and said that lottery funding should not have been given to a project with a flawed business plan and whose purpose could have been equally well served by using social media. = Forces in Mind = £35 million has been invested by the Big Lottery Fund on the Forces in Mind Trust (FIMT), a partnership of UK forces charities and mental health organisations, led by the Confederation of Service Charities (COBSEO). It has been given partnership support from the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry which will back the Trust with its own grants over a three-year programme as well as helping raise awareness of the issues facing veterans. Over the next 20 years, FIMT will provide UK-wide long-term support and advocacy for Service personnel and Veterans to make a successful transition to civilian life. The focus will be on addressing a range of problems that some ex-service personnel and their families can experience back in civilian life, such as poor mental health, family breakdown and alcohol-related problems. = Supporting Change and Impact = Supporting Change and Impact is an initiative helping the Fund's grant holders, helping them to plan future service delivery in a challenging funding environment. = Heroes Return2 = Heroes Return2 funds veterans, their families, spouses and carers to visit the places where they saw action in the Second World War or to take part in commemorative events in the UK. = Improving Futures = The Improving Futures programmes helps children from families who have complex and multiple needs. = Big Fund = The National Lottery Act 2006 gave Big Lottery Fund the powers to handle non- Lottery as well as Lottery funding. Big Lottery Fund has managed non-Lottery programmes on behalf of OCS, the Department for Education and the Welsh Assembly Government. The organisation's non-Lottery funding is branded distinctly and promoted independently from Lottery funding. = Big Potential = The Big Potential programme delivers grant funding to eligible charities and social enterprises with the aim of improving the sustainability, capacity and scale of organisations in order that they may deliver greater social impact. The programme is run by Social Investment Business and its £20m investment pool closed in 2017.

HyperZ was announced in November 2000 and was still available in the TeraScale-based Radeon HD 2000 Series and in current Graphics Core Next-based graphics products. On the Radeon R100-based cores, Radeon DDR through 7500, where HyperZ debuted, ATI claimed a 20% improvement in overall rendering efficiency. They stated that with HyperZ, Radeon could be said to offer 1.5 gigatexels per second fillrate performance instead of the card's apparent theoretical rate of 1.2 gigatexels. In testing it was shown that HyperZ did indeed offer a tangible performance improvement that allowed the less endowed Radeon to keep up with the less efficient GeForce 2 GTS. Functionality HyperZ consists of three mechanisms: ; Z compression: The Z-buffer is stored in a lossless compressed format to minimize the Z-Buffer bandwidth as Z read or writes are taking place. The compression scheme ATI used on Radeon 8500 operated 20% more effectively than on the original Radeon 256. ; Fast Z clear: Rather than writing zeros throughout the entire Z-buffer, and thus using the bandwidth of another Z-Buffer write, a Fast Z Clear technique is used that can tag entire blocks of the Z-Buffer as cleared, such that only each of these blocks need be tagged as cleared. On Radeon 8500, ATI claimed that this process could clear the Z-Buffer up to approximately 64 times faster than that of a card without fast Z clear. ; Hierarchical Z-buffer: This feature allows for the pixel being rendered to be checked against the z-buffer before the pixel actually arrives in the rendering pipelines. This allows useless pixels to be thrown out early (early Z reject), before the Radeon has to render them.

Gameplay The game starts with the players drawing a \\"ground\\" line (conventionally, but not necessarily, a horizontal line at the bottom of the paper or other playing area) and several line segments such that each line segment is connected to the ground, either directly at an endpoint, or indirectly, via a chain of other segments connected by endpoints. Any number of segments may meet at a point and thus there may be multiple paths to ground. On his turn, a player \\"cuts\\" (erases) any line segment of his choice. Every line segment no longer connected to the ground by any path \\"falls\\" (i.e., gets erased). According to the normal play convention of combinatorial game theory, the first player who is unable to move loses. Hackenbush boards can consist of finitely many (in the case of a \\"finite board\\") or infinitely many (in the case of an \\"infinite board\\") line segments. The existence of an infinite number of line segments does not violate the game theory assumption that the game can be finished in a finite amount of time, provided that there are only finitely many line segments directly \\"touching\\" the ground. On an infinite board, based on the layout of the board the game can continue on forever, assuming there are infinitely many points touching the ground. =Variants= A blue-red Hackenbush girl, introduced in the book Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays In the original folklore version of Hackenbush, any player is allowed to cut any edge: as this is an impartial game it is comparatively straightforward to give a complete analysis using the Sprague–Grundy theorem. Thus the versions of Hackenbush of interest in combinatorial game theory are more complex partisan games, meaning that the options (moves) available to one player would not necessarily be the ones available to the other player if it were his turn to move given the same position. This is achieved in one of two ways: * Original Hackenbush: All line segments are the same color and may be cut by either player. This means payoffs are symmetric and each player has the same operations based on position on board (in this case structure of drawing) *Blue-Red Hackenbush: Each line segment is colored either red or blue. One player (usually the first, or left, player) is only allowed to cut blue line segments, while the other player (usually the second, or right, player) is only allowed to cut red line segments. *Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush: Each line segment is colored red, blue, or green. The rules are the same as for Blue-Red Hackenbush, with the additional stipulation that green line segments can be cut by either player. Blue-Red Hackenbush is merely a special case of Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush, but it is worth noting separately, as its analysis is often much simpler. This is because Blue-Red Hackenbush is a so-called cold game, which means, essentially, that it can never be an advantage to have the first move. Analysis Hackenbush has often been used as an example game for demonstrating the definitions and concepts in combinatorial game theory, beginning with its use in the books On Numbers and Games and Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays by some of the founders of the field. In particular Blue-Red Hackenbush can be used to construct surreal numbers such as nimbers: finite Blue-Red Hackenbush boards can construct dyadic rational numbers, while the values of infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush boards account for real numbers, ordinals, and many more general values that are neither. Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush allows for the construction of additional games whose values are not real numbers, such as star and all other nimbers. Further analysis of the game can be made using graph theory by considering the board as a collection of vertices and edges and examining the paths to each vertex that lies on the ground (which should be considered as a distinguished vertex -- it does no harm to identify all the ground points together -- rather than as a line on the graph). In the impartial version of Hackenbush (the one without player specified colors), it can be thought of using nim heaps by breaking the game up into several cases: vertical, convergent, and divergent. Played exclusively with vertical stacks of line segments, also referred to as bamboo stalks, the game directly becomes Nim and can be directly analyzed as such. Divergent segments, or trees, add an additional wrinkle to the game and require use of the colon principle stating that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non-branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. This principle changes the representation of the game to the more basic version of the bamboo stalks. The last possible set of graphs that can be made are convergent ones, also known as arbitrarily rooted graphs. By using the fusion principle, we can state that all vertices on any cycle may be fused together without changing the value of the graph. Therefore, any convergent graph can also be interpreted as a simple bamboo stalk graph. By combining all three types of graphs we can add complexity to the game, without ever changing the nim sum of the game, thereby allowing the game to take the strategies of Nim. Proof of Colon Principle  The Colon Principle states that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non- branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. Consider a fixed but arbitrary graph, G, and select an arbitrary vertex, x, in G. Let H1 and H2 be arbitrary trees (or graphs) that have the same Sprague-Grundy value. Consider the two graphs G1 = Gx : H1 and G2 = Gx : H2, where Gx : Hi represents the graph constructed by attaching the tree Hi to the vertex x of the graph G. The colon principle states that the two graphs G1 and G2 have the same Sprague- Grundy value. Consider the sum of the two games as in figure 5.4. The claim that G1 and G2 have the same Sprague-Grundy value is equivalent to the claim that the sum of the two games has Sprague-Grundy value 0. In other words, we are to show that the sum G1 \\\\+ G2 is a P-position. A player is guaranteed to win if they are the second player to move in G1 \\\\+ G2. If the first player moves by chopping one of the edges in G in one of the games, then the second player chops the same edge in G in the other game. (Such a pair of moves may delete H1 and H2 from the games, but otherwise H1 and H2 are not disturbed.) If the first player moves by chopping an edge in H1 or H2, then the Sprague- Grundy values of H1 and H2 are no longer equal, so that there exists a move in H1 or H2 that keeps the Sprague-Grundy values the same. In this way you will always have a reply to every move he may make. This means you will make the last move and so win.

Its capital was the eponymous city of Nakhon Si Thammarat in what is now Southern Thailand.  Establishment and Sukhothai period  Most historians identify the Tambralinga kingdom (existing c. 10th to 13th century) with a precursor of Nakhon Si Thammarat. During the late-1st and early-2nd millennium BC, Tai peoples expanded in mainland Southeast Asia. By the 13th century, they made Nakhon Si Thammarat one of their mueang (city states). The exact circumstances of the Tai taking over the earlier Buddhist and Indianised kingdom at this location remain unclear. The Ramkhamhaeng stele of 1283 (or 1292) lists Nakhon Si Thammarat as the southernmost tributary kingdom of Sukhothai, probably ruled by a relative of King Ram Khamhaeng. Nakhon Si Thammarat's Buddhist Theravada tradition was a model for the whole Sukhothai kingdom. Exemplary for the Southeast Asian Mandala model, the dependency towards Sukhothai was only personal, not institutional. Therefore, after Ram Khaemhaeng's death, Nakhon Si Thammarat regained its independence and became the dominant Thai mueang on the Malay peninsula.  Naksat cities  The modern seal of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province refers to the circle of twelve Naksat cities According to the 16th-century Southern Thai Chronicles of Nakhon Si Thammarat and the Chronicles of Phra That Nakhon, Nakhon Si Thammarat was surrounded by a chain of twelve inter-linked cities, or Mueang, on the Malay Peninsula, called the Naksat cities ( ). According to these accounts, the cities acted as an outer shield, surrounding the capital Nakhon Si Thammarat (Ligor), and were connected by land so that help could be sent from one city to another in the event of surprise attacks. The Thai term naksat (from Sanskrit nakshatra) refers to the lunar calendar system with a duodenary cycle of years (Pi Naksat), based on the Chinese zodiac, with each year being associated with a particular animal. M.C. Chand Chirayu Rajani identified eleven of the twelve cities and their associated zodiac emblems with the following locations on the Malay peninsula: Narathiwat (Rat), Pattani (Ox), Kelantan (Tiger), Kedah (Dragon), Phattalung (Snake), Trang (Horse), Chumphon (Goat), Krabi (Monkey), Tha Chana (Rooster), Phuket (Dog), Kraburi (Pig). The exact location of Mueang Pahang, identified with the Rabbit, is unknown. However, there is no historic evidence that Nakhon Si Thammarat actually controlled these cities. Other reports from that period rarely describe Ligor as having any special role on the Malay peninsula. The account in the chronicles seems to reflect the Siamese (Thai) claims to suzerainty over the Malay regions of the south during the mid-Ayutthaya period.  Ayutthaya period  In the Old Javanese Desawarnana document of 1365, the Majapahit kingdom recognised Nakhon Si Thammarat as belonging to Siam. The Palatine law of King Trailok dated 1468, listed Nakhon Si Thammarat as one of eight \\"great cities\\" (phraya maha nakhon) belonging to the Ayutthaya kingdom. Nevertheless, it maintained its own dynasty and had vassal states of its own, which it mediated to Ayutthaya (again a typical feature of the Mandala model with its tiered levels of power). Under king Naresuan (r. 1590–1605) it became instead a \\"first class province\\" (mueang ek). However, the post of provincial governor was still quasi-hereditary and usually handed down from father to son within the old Nakhon Si Thammarat dynasty. It was the most important among Ayutthaya's southern provinces and enjoyed a primacy vis-à-vis the other provinces on the Malay Peninsula. Its role in overseas trade (involving Dutch and Portuguese merchants) resulted in the province's substantial wealth and contributed to a high level of confidence and claim of autonomy in relation to the central power. During the Ayutthayan succession conflict of 1629, Nakhon Si Thammarat rebelled against the new king Prasat Thong. The usurper sent the influential Japanese adventurer Yamada Nagamasa with his mercenary force to quell the rebellion and made him governor and lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat for a short time. Another insurrection of Nakhon Si Thammarat against the capital took place after the Siamese revolution of 1688 when the local ruler refused to accept the accession of usurper king Phetracha.  Thonburi and Rattanakosin periods  After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, Nakhon Si Thammarat again enjoyed a short period of independence, including its subordinate provinces on the Malay peninsula, but was subdued by Taksin in 1769 on his mission to reunite Siam. Under Rama I, the rank of the Lord of Nakhon Si Thammarat was demoted from a vassal ruler to a mere governor of a first-class province and his control over the Northern Malay sultanates (including Patani) was taken away, instead awarding them to the governor of Songkhla. Nakhon Si Thammarat was supervised by the Kalahom (Minister of the Southern provinces). In 1821 and 1831 however, kings Rama II and Rama III again tasked the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat to quell rebellions in the Malay sultanate of Kedah.  Integration into the Siamese central state  With the Thesaphiban reform of Prince Damrong Rajanubhab at the end of the 19th century the kingdom was finally fully absorbed into Siam. A new administrative entity named monthon (circle) was created, each supervising several provinces. Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat, established 1896, covered those areas on the east coast of the peninsula, i.e. the provinces Songkhla, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Phatthalung.

The device was introduced in 1564 during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and was last used in 1716. It long predates the use of the guillotine during the French Revolution. Manufactured in Edinburgh, the Maiden is built of oak, with a lead weight and iron blade. It is displayed at the National Museum of Scotland. History Beheading machines were not a new idea: a European example is shown in a 1539 illustration by Lucas Cranach the Elder. By 1563 the sword used for executions in Edinburgh was worn out, and in February of that year funds were used to pay for the loan of a sword for a beheading. After this, the Maiden was constructed to an order from the Provost and Magistrates of Edinburgh in 1564,Maxwell, H Edinburgh, A Historical Study, Williams and Norgate (1916), pp. 137, 299–303 . during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and the records of the construction of the Maiden survive.McCulloch, W.T., 'The Maiden', PSAS, (1866-7), 549. The accounts reveal that it was made by the carpenters Adam and Patrick Shang and George Tod. Andrew Gotterson added the lead weight to the blade. Patrick Shang was paid two pounds for his 'whole labours and devising of the timber work'.Adam, Robert, ed., City of Edinburgh Records, the Burgh accounts, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1899), pp. 486-487. Shang also made furniture in Edinburgh, including an oak bed for Queen Mary's half-brother, the Earl of Moray.HMC 6th Report and Appendix: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), p. 647, the bed was new in 1562. The first execution on record was that of Thomas Scott of Cambusmichael, on 3 April 1565.McCulloch, PSAS, (1866-7), p. 552. The accounts of the City Treasurer for this execution record payment for moving the components of the Maiden from Blackfriars to the town cross, assembling the machine and taking it down afterwards. The oak construction could be readily dismantled for storage, and moved to various locations: executions using it were carried out at the Mercat Cross, Edinburgh, (off the High Street), the Castlehill and the Grassmarket. The Maiden was lent to Leith in 1591 for the execution of William Gibsone, and the accounts show payment for \\"careing of the Maiden ther and hame agin\\". During the minority of King James VI, the Regent James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton was executed by the Maiden in 1581. David Hume of Godscroft's 1644 History of the House of Douglas said that Morton was responsible for its introduction, and had based the concept on the Halifax Gibbet: \\"the Maiden, which he himself had caused make after the patterne which he had seen in Halifax in Yorkshire\\". Although there was no other support for this claim, later writers repeated the legend. A 1789 history of Halifax embellished it with the story that Morton \\"carried a model of it to his own country, where it remained so long unused, that it acquired the name of the Maiden.\\" From 1564 to 1710 more than 150 people were executed on the Maiden, after which it was withdrawn from use. Notable victims included Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, in 1661, executed following the Restoration of Charles II, and his son Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, in 1685, executed for intending to lead a rebellion against James VII. These executions took place at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. The last execution that was performed upon the Maiden was that of John Hamilton on 30 June 1716, for the murder of a publican during a brawl. The Maiden was stored away, and when rediscovered was put on display at the Museum of Antiquities, now the National Museum of Scotland. Mechanism The person under sentence of death placed his head on a crossbar which is about four feet from the bottom. Lead weights weighing around 75 pounds (34 kg) were attached to the axe blade. The blade is guided by grooves cut within the inner edges of the frame. A peg, which is in turn attached to a cord, kept the blade in place. The executioner removed the peg by pulling sharply on the cord, and this caused the blade to fall and decapitate the condemned. If the condemned had been tried for stealing a horse, the cord was attached to the animal which, on being whipped, started away removing the peg, thereby becoming the executioner.

Founded with the official name of the Metropolitan Police College, the college is today officially called the Peel Centre, although its original name is still used frequently. Within the police service it is known simply as \\"Hendon\\". It is within walking distance of Colindale Underground station on the Northern line and Colindale police station. Cadet college (1934–1939) The college was opened on 31 May 1934 by the Prince of Wales,\\"The Police College\\", The Times, 20 March 1934 in the erstwhile buildings of Hendon Country Club, Hendon Aerodrome's club house (which had been used briefly as laboratories of the Standard Telephones and Cables company). The school was the brainchild of Lord Trenchard, who was Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis from 1931 to 1935. His experiences as second-in-command of the Royal Flying Corps' Central Flying School in 1913 and 1914 gave him a suitable background for the venture, whilst the location would have been known to him from his time as Chief of the Air Staff (1921-1929). The original concept for the college was a military-style cadet establishment to train officers to enter directly at senior rank, instead of the traditional entry at the lowest rank of constable for all personnel. Trenchard's idea was that in future almost all officers above the rank of inspector should be selected from college graduates, thus introducing a military-style officer corps. Candidates, of which there were to be about 30 every year, were selected by a competitive examination based on that for the Indian Police Service. Most of the candidates were already serving officers, although some were direct entrants from civilian life. Graduates were given the newly created rank of junior station inspector.\\"The London Police College: Examination of 150 Candidates\\", The Times, 21 February 1934 Cadets who were already serving police officers received an annual salary of £200 () and direct entrants received £170 (). New junior station inspectors were paid £300 (), rising to £320 (). The first commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Halland, previously Chief Constable of Lincolnshire, who was given the rank of deputy assistant commissioner. The assistant commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel Reggie Senior, seconded from the Indian Police Service with the rank of superintendent, and the chief instructor was Chief Inspector Carrick, an experienced instructor at the Metropolitan Police Training School,\\"Metropolitan Police College: The Instructors\\", The Times, 4 April 1934 who was replaced by Chief Inspector Hugh Young after his promotion to superintendent and posting back to division in January 1935.\\"Metropolitan Police Changes: Promotions in Uniformed Branch\\", The Times, 23 October 1934\\"Police Appointments\\", The Times, 4 January 1935 It was intended that the Metropolitan Police Training School for constables at Peel House in Westminster should also move to a site adjacent to the college,\\"Police College Opening at Hendon Next Spring\\", The Times, 28 November 1933 but in the end this did not happen until much later.

The graduates then spent four months working as ordinary police constables at police stations in West Central London, four months at the various specialist departments at Scotland Yard, two months as section sergeants and two months as station sergeants. Although they were officially junior station inspectors throughout this period, they wore the uniforms of the rank in which they were serving at the time and not until this twelve-month period was up were they entitled to wear inspector's uniform.\\"Student Policemen on the Beat\\", The Times, 21 August 1935 A junior station inspector was to wear one star over one bar on his epaulettes.\\"New Police Badges\\", The Times, 27 June 1936 The second intake of 29 cadets passed out in December 1935\\"Sir P.

Other graduates included Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Bliss (1936-1937), first National Co-ordinator of Regional Crime Squads of England and Wales, Michael Macoun (1938-1939), Inspector-General of Police of Uganda and later of British Dependent Territories, and the politician Sir Henry Calley (1938-1939). Police training centre After World War II, there was debate about whether to reopen the college. Many considered the police did not need an \\"officer class\\" and were best-served by continuing to promote from the ranks. Eventually it was decided not to reopen it as an exclusive cadet college, but as the Metropolitan Police Training School for all entrants. The new National Police College, however, shared many of the principles behind Hendon. When the Royal Air Force left Hendon in the 1960s, the Metropolitan Police decided to rebuild the college, and the new Peel Centre, named after Sir Robert Peel, was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 31 May 1974, 40 years to the day after her uncle opened the original Metropolitan Police College. The Queen has returned three times since then: in 1977 to open the new Hendon Gym, on 21 October 2001 she dedicated a memorial to Metropolitan Police officers and staff who lost their lives on duty, and on 3 January 2005 she visited the Casualty Bureau dealing with British nationals missing after the Asian tsunami. The last course at Hendon on the 17-week course finished on 6 July 2007. It was replaced with a 26-week course known as Initial Police Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP) scheme. In the summer of 2011, owing to budget restraints, IPLDP was replaced with a new, slimline, entrants course, bringing foundation training at the college in line with the national requirement as set by the Association of Chief of Police Officers, the NPIA and the Home Office. Redevelopment The Peel Centre was redeveloped between 2014 and 2016. The new Peel House sits on the site of the old Metropolitan Police swimming pool. Three tower blocks, where officers used to stay during initial training, the old Peel House and Simpson Hall were demolished and sold to housing developer Redrow. Current use The centre is run by the Director and Co-ordinator of Training, who is responsible for overseeing the training received by new recruits. Hendon is one of three regional training centres where new recruits attend to undertake a 13-week course (as paid trainees). In addition, all special constables begin their training at Hendon, completing the rest of their 23-day course (either as a weekdays intensive course or on 23 consecutive Saturdays or Sundays) at Hendon or another of the Metropolitan Police Service's 'Regional Training Centres'. The centre runs courses on many aspects of police work, from forensic and crime scene analysis, to radio operations and driving skills. Police officers can expect to return to the centre at various times during their career. The Metropolitan Police Book of Remembrance is displayed in its new home at the entrance of the new Peel House. It was moved from the old Simpson Hall in 2016 before its demolition. The memorial garden was also moved to its new home outside the new Peel House, the original rose bushes and silver beech trees were retained and replanted in the new location.

CareerConnections= Sir William's half-brother from his mother's liaison with the king was James Stewart, Earl of Moray, Regent of Scotland from 1567 until his assassination in January 1570. Sir William's cousin was another Regent of Scotland James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and was closely associated with him in his career, the two men being occasionally confused in the histories. William's father was killed at the battle of Pinkie in September 1547. William suffered from breathing difficulties all his life. His wife was Agnes Leslie, daughter of George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes, by whom he had eleven children. The Leslies were active in Scottish Reformation. =Lochleven's prisoner= Mary, Queen of Scots was a prisoner in the Glassin Tower at Lochleven Castle William Douglas was the owner of the island Loch Leven Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots had met John Knox in April 1563. Since 1546, he and his mother had built the \\"Newhouse of Lochleven\\" on the shore of Loch Leven where Kinross House now stands. The \\"Newhouse\\" eventually replaced the island castle as the centre of the estate. In June 1567, Queen Mary was imprisoned in the island castle following her surrender at the Battle of Carberry Hill. On 24 July she was forced to sign abdication papers at Lochleven in favor of her infant son James VI. William Douglas had a legal paper drawn up on 28 July 1567, which stated that he was not present when the Queen signed her \\"demission\\" of the crown and did not know of it, and that he offered to convey her to Stirling Castle for her son's coronation which was the following day, which offer she refused. Mary also signed that paper. However, in 1581 Mary wrote that William was one of her few remaining enemies in Scotland, and should have witnessed that she was compelled to assent to her resignation.CSP Scotland, vol.6 (1910), p.99 The Scottish government directed by his half-brother paid William Douglas £1,289-12d for keeping the Queen.Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, vol.20 (1899), p.lv William's wife, Lady Agnes Leslie, became the Queen's chief female companion during her ten and a half months of imprisonment, accompanying her throughout the day and often sleeping in her bedchamber. Queen Mary had an opportunity of greater liberty following the birth of Agnes's child when she was recovering from her pregnancy. She chose to escape on 2 May 1568 from Lochleven with the aid of Sir William's brother George and a young orphaned cousin named William Douglas who also lived at the castle and may or may not have been the earl's illegitimate son. When Sir William learned of his royal captive's escape, he was so distressed that he attempted to stab himself with his own dagger. In April 1570 John Wood, the former secretary of Regent Moray visited Lochleven. He found that that Sir William had left for Stirling, so he followed him and caught up with him after four miles. At Lochleven Castle, Wood spoke to Margret Erskine, Lady Lochleven. She was looking after the daughter of Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray. The child was \\"merry and very lusty\\". Her nurse was pregnant and wanted go home. In Edinburgh Sir William helped Wood check the coffers containing Agnes Keith's clothes at Holyrood Palace.HMC 6th Report: Moray (London, 1877), pp. 651-2. In October 1570 William Douglas was the keeper of the Earl of Northumberland at Lochleven castle and wrote to the English diplomat Thomas Randolph mentioning that Loch Leven was liable to freeze.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1569-1571, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 415. =Ruthven Raid and Earl of Morton= The title Earl of Morton was declared forfeit in 1581 when Regent Morton, the 4th earl, was attainted; and the title was granted to John Maxwell, 7th Lord Maxwell, a grandson of the 3rd earl. While Regent Morton was on trial in January 1581, William and other leading members of the family were not allowed to come to Edinburgh, and in March he was ordered to live north of Cromarty. A year later he joined in the Raid of Ruthven, and when this faction was defeated he was exiled in France at La Rochelle, returning in 1586. The 17th century historian David Hume of Godscroft relates that Agnes Leslie wrote to her husband saying she would prevent their son Robert from joining him at the Lords Enterprisers attempt to take Stirling Castle in 1584, saying it was a foolish work that would ruin them. William replied that their course was honourable, and intended for the good of the church, and he trusted in providence. Robert and their son-in-law Laurence Oliphant were banished to France despite their mother's efforts, and were lost at sea in a battle with \\"Hollanders\\" or pirates. cites: Register Privy Council, vol.3 (1880), p.348, 365, 664, 669 In 1586, the attainder on the Morton earldom was reversed and the title returned to the 4th earl's family. By the 4th earl's will, on the death of Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus in 1588, William Douglas succeeded to the earldom of Morton, which brought him additional lands and houses including Dalkeith Palace, Aberdour Castle, Auchterhouse and Drochil Castle. In May 1590 he hosted the Danish Admiral Peder Munk at the Newhouse of Lochleven. Munk had been at Falkland Palace to accept the property as part of the dowry of Anne of Denmark.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (John Donald: Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 57-8, 102-3. William wrote a short history of the Scottish reformation and reigns of Mary and James VI briefly mentioning the Siege of Leith, the Battle of Carberry Hill, the murder of David Rizzio, and the Ruthven Raid. Marriage and children On 26 November 1554 he married Lady Agnes Leslie, Countess of Morton (born after 1541-died ca. 1606), the daughter of George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes and as a direct descendant of King James II in her maternal line. The contract for their marriage was signed on 19 August 1554. The couple made their home at Lochleven Castle, which was a fortress situated on an island in the middle of the loch, and where his widowed mother also resided. Sir William and Agnes together had eleven children: * Christian Douglas, married firstly Laurence, Master of Oliphant, (lost at sea in March 1585) by whom she had issue; she married secondly Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home. * Robert Douglas, Master of Morton, (lost at sea in March 1585), married Jean Lyon of Glamis, by whom he had two sons, including William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. In 1585 it was rumoured that Laurence Oliphant and Robert had been killed by pirates or drowned.Joseph Bain, Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 179. Later it was thought they were slaves in Algiers.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 224-5. In 1601, Robert Oliphant went to Algiers to look for his kinsman, carrying a letter of introduction to Sultan Mehmed III written by Queen Elizabeth, who also recommended her ambassador John Wroth help the search.Marcus, Mueller, Rose, edd., Elizabeth I: Collected Works (University of Chicago, 2000), p. 400 no. 100. * James Douglas, Commendator of Melrose, who attended James VI in Denmark.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 121. He married firstly Mary Kerr, by whom he had issue; secondly Helen Scott, by whom he had issue; and thirdly Jean Anstruther, by whom he had issue. * Sir Archibald Douglas of Kilmour (died 1649), married Barbara Forbes (born 31 January 1560), by whom he had one son. * Sir George Douglas of Kirkness (died December 1609), married Margaret Forrester. * Euphemia Douglas, married Sir Thomas Lyon of Auldbar, Master of Glamis. * Agnes Douglas, Countess of Argyll (1574- 3 May 1607), on 24 July 1592 married as his first wife Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, the son of Colin Campbell, 6th Earl of Argyll and Agnes Keith, by whom she had one son and two daughters. * Elizabeth Douglas, married in 1590 Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, by whom she had issue. * Jean Douglas. * Mary Douglas, married Sir Walter Ogilvy, 1st Lord Ogilvy of Deskford, by whom she had issue. * Margaret Douglas, married Sir John Wemyss of Wemyss. Agnes's seven daughters were said to have been so beautiful that they were known as \\"the pearls of Lochleven\\". In 1586, the earldom of Morton which had been forfeited in 1581 following the execution and attainder of the 4th Earl of Morton for being one of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley's murderers, returned to the Douglas family. In 1588, upon the death of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Morton, Sir William became the 6th Earl of Morton. From that time onward Agnes was styled the Countess of Morton. Sir William received the charter for the earldom on 20 July 1589. William died sometime around the year 1606, which was the same year his wife died.

Smirting has been so successful that non-smokers try to mingle with the smirters. The non-smokers may then start to smoke too and so this is a health risk.

The Bogside is on the left. The earliest references to the history of Derry date to the 6th century when a monastery was founded there; however, archaeological sites and objects predating this have been found. The name Derry comes from the Old Irish word Daire (modern: Doire) meaning 'oak grove' or 'oak wood'.Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Adrian Room. (Google books) Retrieved 2008-03-28. Early history Gríanán of Aileach, Donegal In the 6th century, a Christian monastery was founded on the hill of Doire to the east of the River Foyle. The site was allegedly granted by a local king who had a fortress there. According to legend the monastery of Doire was established by Saint Colmcille/Columba. Colmcille founded many important monasteries in Ireland and Scotland, including Durrow Abbey in the Irish Midlands and Iona on an island off the west of Scotland. The claim that he founded a settlement at Doire is less certain, although that monastery belonged to the federation of Columban churches which looked to Colmcille as their spiritual founder and leader.According to local tradition the location of the first church was where St. Columba's Long Tower Church stands today. It is also the site of the medieval Templemore Cathedral, later wrecked and desecrated by an English expeditionary force in 1568. Nearby was a medieval Irish round tower. During the later Middle Ages the old monastery of Derry evolved into an Augustinian congregation. A small church of that monastery survived up to the 17th century on a site within the present walls of Derry and was used by the London colonists as their first place of worship when they came to build the walled city. Although the Vikings sailed up the loughs and rivers of this area, the monastery of Derry escaped the worst effects of their raids. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Derry and the surrounding area saw settlement by Norman colonists, culminating in the early 14th century with the Earl of Ulster, Richard de Burgh, acquiring Derry from its bishop, from which it was part of the Earldom of Ulster until its collapse.Connolly, S. J: Oxford Companion to Irish History, page 589. Oxford University Press, 2007. Duffy, Seán: Atlas of Irish History. Gill & Macmillan, 2000. Plantation of Ulster Map of Derry in 1622, showing the Bishop of Derry's residence in the northwest. After the collapse of the Earldom of Ulster in the 14th century, Ulster saw a Gaelic resurgence at the expense of the Norman colony. Throughout the second half of the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I's military leaders tried to conquer the province of Ulster, then outside English control. The English first came to Derry in 1566 but the garrison established there at that time lasted only a few years. A second, more successful garrison returned in 1600 during the Nine Years War against the Gaelic O'Neill and O'Donnell earls. On this occasion the English managed to hold on to Derry and, when the war came to an end in 1603, a small trading settlement was established and given the legal status of city. During the 1608 O'Doherty's Rebellion, this 'infant city' was attacked by Sir Cahir O'Doherty, Irish chieftain of Inishowen, and the settlement was virtually wiped out. This attack came about shortly after the Flight of the Earls when the O'Neill and O'Donnell chieftains, together with their principal supporters, fled to the continent, leaving Gaelic Ulster leaderless. The new king in London, James I, decided on a revolutionary plan designed once and for all to subordinate Ulster. The 'Plantation of Ulster' required the colonising of the area by loyal English and Scottish migrants who were to be Protestant in religion. One part of this colonisation was to be organised by the ancient and wealthy livery companies of the City of London. In 1623 the new county granted to the Londoners and its fortified city, built across the River Foyle from the recently destroyed settlement, were renamed Londonderry in honour of this association. At this point the city was granted a Royal Charter by King James I.Stroke City to remain Londonderry BBC News Online, 2001-01-25. Retrieved 2008-03-28. The usage of \\"Derry\\" versus \\"Londonderry\\" is still controversial. The City of Londonderry was the jewel in the crown of the Ulster Plantation. It was laid out according to the best contemporary principles of town planning, imported from the continent (the original street lay-out has survived to the present almost intact). More importantly, the city was enclosed by massive stone and earthen fortifications. It was the last walled city built in Ireland and the only city on the island whose ancient walls survive complete. Among the city's new buildings was St. Columb's Cathedral (1633). This is one of the most important 17th century buildings in the country and was the first specifically Protestant cathedral erected anywhere in the world following the Reformation. Civil wars and sieges Bishops Street Gate. The new city was slow to prosper. By the 1680s it still had only about 2,000 inhabitants; and yet it was, by far, the largest town in Ulster. Along with most parts of Britain and Ireland, the city suffered from the upheavals in the 1640s.Ireland Tom Downs(Google books) Retrieved 2008-03-28. This began with the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when the Gaelic Irish insurgents made a failed attack on the city. For the next ten years of war, Derry and its environs became a stronghold for the British Protestant settlers, who raised the \\"Lagan army\\" to defend themselves from the Irish Confederates. However, the Protestants were disunited about how to respond to the events of the English Civil War, with some of them supporting the King, some the English Parliament and some the Scottish Covenanters. The Covenanters initially supported the Parliamentarians, with their goal being to protect the local Protestant population from attacks by the Catholic rebel, however later switched to support the Royalists. Much of the Covenanter army was wiped out at the Battle of Benburb by the Irish Ulster Army under the command of general Eoghan Ruadh O'Néill (Anglisized: Owen Roe O Neill). The Covenanters managed to retreat to easter Ulster but were unable to have a major impact for the rest of the war. In 1649 the city and its garrison, which supported the republican Parliament in London, were besieged by Scottish Presbyterian (Covenanter) forces loyal to King Charles I. The Parliamentarians besieged in Derry were relieved by a strange alliance of Roundhead troops under George Monck and Owen O Neill, during a brief civil war within the Irish Confederacy. These temporary allies were soon fighting each other again, however, after the landing in Ireland of the New Model Army in 1649. The war in Ulster was finally brought to an end when the Parliamentarians crushed the Irish Catholic Ulster army at the battle of Scarrifholis in nearby Donegal in 1650. In 1688, Ireland became the battleground for the Glorious Revolution in England, when James II was deposed by William of Orange. Catholic Ireland strongly supported James, but many Protestants in Ulster secretly supported William. James II had his Catholic viceroy Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell take action to ensure that all strong points in Ireland were held by garrisons loyal to the Jacobite cause. By November 1688, only the walled city of Londonderry and nearby Enniskillen had a Protestant garrison. An army of around 1,200 men, mostly \\"Redshanks\\" (Highlanders), under Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim, was slowly organised (they set out on the week William of Orange landed in England). When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. On 18 April 1689, while his attempts to regain his throne in what became the Williamite war in Ireland with the Jacobites got under way, King James came to the city and summoned it to surrender. The King was rebuffed and actually fired at by some of the more determined defenders; tradition has the apprentice boys closing the gates and saving the city. As a policy of 'no surrender' was confirmed, the Jacobite forces outside the city began the famous Siege of Derry. For 105 days the city suffered appalling conditions as cannonballs and mortar-bombs rained down, and famine and disease took their terrible toll. Conditions for the besiegers were no better and many thousands of people died, both inside and outside the walls. The cannon used to defend the city can be seen on the walls and at other places around the city. Finally at the end of July, a relief ship broke the barricading 'boom' which had been stretched across the river, near where the new Foyle Bridge now stands. The Siege was over but it has left its mark on the traditions of the city to the present day (see Apprentice Boys of Derry). 18th and 19th centuries The city was rebuilt in the 18th century with many of its fine Georgian style houses still surviving. George Berkeley, Ireland's most important philosopher, was dean of Derry (1724–33), and another well-known and eccentric cleric, Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol, was Bishop of Derry (1768–1803). It was Hervey, the so-called Earl Bishop, who was responsible for building the city's first bridge across the River Foyle] in 1790. During the 18th and 19th centuries the port became an important embarkation point for Irish emigrants setting out for North America. Some of these founded the colony of Nutfield, later Londonderry, in the state of New Hampshire. By the middle of the 19th century a thriving shirt and collarmaking industry had been established here, giving the city many of its fine industrial buildings. Four separate railway networks emanated from the city, the interesting history of which can be examined at the Foyle Valley Railway Centre. The city became a university city when its Magee College was incorporated into the Royal University of Ireland in 1880. Magee College continues university scholarship today, as a campus of the University of Ulster. Partition Amelia Earhart Cottage The early 1920s in Ireland were marked by political violence over the issue of Irish independence. During the Irish War of Independence, Derry was rocked by sectarian violence, partly prompted by the guerrilla war raging between the Irish Republican Army and British Forces, but also influenced by economic and social pressures. In July 1920, several thousand unionist ex-British Army servicemen mobilised a pogrom of murder against the Catholic population which they regarded as rebellious. Severe rioting ensued when the loyalists murdered several Catholics and launched an assault on the neighbourhoods around the Long Tower and St Columb's College, now Lumen Christi. This pogrom was resisted by armed IRA members. Many lives were lost and in addition many Catholics and Protestants were expelled from their homes during the communal unrest. After a week's violence, the British Army intervened when local IRA and Catholic ex- servicemen began to dominate and an uneasy truce was negotiated by local politicians on either side. In 1921, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the partition of Ireland, Derry unexpectedly became a border city, with much of its natural economic hinterland in County Donegal cut off. Amelia Earhart gave the city a much needed boost when she landed here in 1932 becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. Her connection with the city is reflected in a display at the Amelia Earhart Cottage at Ballyarnett. During the Second World War the city played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic with a substantial presence from the Royal Navy and a large number of GIs disembarked here. At the end of the war, 19 U-boats from the German Kriegsmarine surrendered in the city's harbour. The Troubles Derry perceived itself as suffering under unionist government in Northern Ireland, both politically and economically. In the late 1960s the city became the flashpoint of disputes about institutional discrimination and gerrymandering. Despite having a nationalist majority the city was permanently controlled by unionists due to the partisan drawing of electoral boundaries. In addition the city had very high unemployment levels and very poor housing. Overcrowding in nationalist areas was widely blamed on the political agenda of the unionist government, who wanted to confine Catholics to a small number of electoral wards. Yet another contentious issue was the reluctance of the authorities to grant Derry the new University of Ulster, supported by a broad coalition led by the University for Derry Committee. The university was instead granted to the predominantly unionist town of Coleraine. Civil rights demonstrations were declared illegal and then violently suppressed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Ulster Special Constabulary, and Catholics were regularly attacked after loyalist parades. The events that followed the August 1969 Apprentice Boys parade resulted in the Battle of the Bogside, when Catholic rioters fought the police, leading to widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and is often dated as the starting point of the Troubles. The city is often regarded as \\"the cockpit of the Troubles\\". On Sunday 30 January 1972, 13 unarmed civilians were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights march in the Bogside area. Another 13 were wounded and one further man later died of his wounds. This event came to be known as Bloody Sunday. Because of these events, certain areas of Derry produced strong support for republican paramilitaries. Up to 1972, both the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Official IRA operated in the city. However, in 1972 the OIRA called a ceasefire following their unpopular killing a local 18-year-old who was on leave from the British Army. The PIRA, however, continued attacking security targets and bombing Derry's commercial centre. In the words of Eamonn McCann in his book, \\"War and an Irish Town\\", the city centre \\"looked as if it had been bombed from the air\\". Prominent among local Provisional IRA members was Martin McGuinness. After 1974, the smaller group, the Irish National Liberation Army also developed a presence in the city. In fact all three INLA prisoners that died in the 1981 Irish hunger strike were from Derry and County Londonderry. The violence in Derry eased towards the end of the Troubles in the 1990s, even though street riots were still frequent, the violence gradually moved to Belfast at that time. Irish journalist Ed Maloney claims in The Secret History of the IRA that republican leaders there negotiated a de facto ceasefire in the city as early as 1991. Whether this is true or not, the city did see less bloodshed by this time than Belfast or other localities. Derry has become known worldwide on account of the Troubles. Less well-known is its reputation voted by the Civic Trust in London as one of the ten best cities of its kind to live in, in the United Kingdom.History of Derry www.londonderrychamber.co.uk.

It was the ultimate development of work that had started as the Metrovick F.2 in 1940, evolving into an advanced axial flow design with an annular combustion chamber that developed over . It powered early versions of the Hawker Hunter and Handley Page Victor, and every Gloster Javelin. Production was also started under licence in the United States by Wright Aeronautical as the J65, powering a number of US designs. The Sapphire's primary competitor was the Rolls-Royce Avon. Design and development Design evolution of the Sapphire started at Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) in 1943 as an offshoot of the F.2 project. With the F.2 reaching flight quality at about , Metrovick turned to producing larger designs, both an enlarged F.2 known as the Beryl, as well as the much larger F.9 Sapphire. (The names were chosen after a decision to use gemstones for future engine names). The Beryl eventually developed 4,000 lbf (18 kN) thrust, but the only project to select it, the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1, was cancelled. The Ministry of Supply (MoS) designated the F.9 as the MVSa.1. In 1948https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200017.html Metrovick exited the jet engine industry.Depending on the sources, Metrovick either left the engine business on their own to concentrate on steam turbines, or were forced from the market by the Ministry of Supply in order to reduce the number of companies they had to deal with.Gunston 1989, p.102. Note: \\"...the firm had decided in 1947, under Ministry pressure, to get out of aviation\\" Armstrong Siddeley, who already had a turbine development of their own, the ASX, took over the MVSa.1, now renamed ASSa.1. After a redesign it emerged as the ASSa.2. In December 1949 the ASSa.2 completed an acceptance test at . Its competitor, the Avon Ra.3 had a design thrust of at that time.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%201780.html A number of companies expressed interest in the Sapphire, and it was considered as either the main or backup powerplant for most British designs of the late '40s and early '50s. The ASSa.5 with thrust was used only on the English Electric P.1A, prototype for the Lightning. A simple fixed-nozzle reheat was fitted to extend the performance boundary for stability and control testing from about Mach 1.1 to beyond Mach 1.5.\\"Testing Years\\" Roland Beamont, Ian Allan Ltd. Londondon, , p.93 Future versions of the Lightning were powered by the Avon. The ASSa.6, , was used on the Gloster Javelin FAW Mk.1, Hawker Hunter F.Mk.2 and F.Mk.5, and the prototype Sud Ouest SO 4050 Vautour. The higher thrust ASSa.7 at was the first British engine to be rated above and it powered the Gloster Javelin FAW Mk.7, Handley Page Victor B.Mk.1 and a prototype Swiss fighter-bomber, the FFA P-16. The Sapphire compressor operated well, free from surging,https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200018.html over its complete RPM range without the need for variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) or bleed. However, early compressor stages suffered from fatigue due to rotating stall at low RPM and various fixes, such as lacing wire, were incorporated. Curtiss-Wright introduced variable ramps on the Wright J65 at the entry to the compressorhttps://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200022.html to prevent the stalling and blade excitation. Armstrong-Siddeley tested a similar solution on the Sapphire but incorporated blade changes instead to reduce the blade response to the stalling.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201599.html CaygillJavelin From The Cockpit, Peter Caygill, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., states that one of the most serious problems encountered throughout the life of the Gloster Javelin was caused by \\"centre-line closure\\" on the Sapphire engine.

He was a prolific writer in Persian. Nafisi was born in Tehran, where he conducted numerous research projects on Iranian culture, literature and poetry. He first emerged as a serious thinker when he joined Mohammad-Taqi Bahar, Abbas Eqbal Ashtiani, Gholamreza Rashid-Yasemi and Abdolhossein Teymourtash to found one of the first literary magazines to be published in Iran, called Daneshkade, in 1918. He subsequently published many articles on Iran, Persian literary texts and Sufism and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages worldwide. He died in a Russian hospital in Tehran. Saeed Nafisi's relatives include Moadeb Naficy, the guardian and doctor of the Shah of Iran (Reza Pahlavi); and Moadeb's son Habib Nafisi (Naficy), a senior statesman, founder of Iran's labor laws, U.S.-Iran Attache, and founder of multiple technical universities in Tehran, Hamid Naficy, a noted scholar of Media and Cultural Studies, Siamak Naficy, an anthropologist, as well as acclaimed author, Azar Nafisi, a niece of his. Nafisi taught in Tehran University, Kabul University, Cairo University and San José State University.  Life  The son of Ali Akbar Nazem-ol-Atebba, who was a famous physician, Nafisi was born in 1895 in Tehran. He started his early education in a school founded by his own father, and finished high school in the Eliye school, the only high school at that time. Next, at the age of 15, he went to Switzerland and continued his education in the university of Paris. After his return to Iran, he started teaching French and working in the Ministry of Welfare. Later he also worked alongside Malek-o Shoara Bahar in a magazine. Later, as well as teaching French in high schools, he taught in other schools, such as political and economic schools, and he also taught in the Literature faculty and Law faculty of Tehran University since its foundation. He also taught outside Iran, in Beirut, Cairo, etc. He was a member of the Academy of Iran (Farhangestan-e Iran).  Personality  He was greatly fond of books, and he spent almost all his money on books, even depriving himself of some his other needs. He thought that books should be published and be available to people, so that people can read and learn. He used collect everything that had a connection to books and literature. In his last years, he collected Russian books about Iran. It is said he had a hard temper, but that he had a kind heart, and he would calm down quickly. He would write honestly which would sometimes disturb others.

It began with the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and ended with the onset of the Revolutions of 1848. Although the term itself derives from a literary reference from the period, it is used mostly to denote the artistic styles that flourished in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design. It has influenced later styles, especially those with origins in Vienna.https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/arts/design/01bied.html  Background  Emperor Francis I of Austria in his study at the Hofburg palace. The interior is in the Biedermeier style. The Concert of Europe, ensured by the Austrian chancellor and foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, enabled the period of peace in which Biedermeier sensibilities developed. The Biedermeier period does not refer to the era as a whole, but to a particular mood and set of trends that grew out of the unique underpinnings of the time in Central Europe. There were two driving forces for the development of the period. One was the growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class, which created a new kind of audience for the arts. The other was the political stability prevalent under Klemens von Metternich following the end of the Napoleonic WarsChristopher John Murray, Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850, Volume 1 p. 89, Taylor & Francis, 2004. and the Congress of Vienna. The effect was for artists and society in general to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. Writers, painters, and musicians began to stay in safer territory, and the emphasis on home life for the growing middle class meant a blossoming of furniture design and interior decorating. Literature The term \\"Biedermeier\\" appeared first in literary circles in the form of a pseudonym, Gottlieb Biedermaier, used by the country doctor Adolf Kussmaul and lawyer Ludwig Eichrodt in poems that the duo had published in the Munich satirical weekly Fliegende Blätter in 1850. The verses parodied the people of the era, namely Samuel Friedrich Sauter, a primary teacher and sort of amateurish poet, as depoliticized and petit-bourgeois.Ludwig Eichrodt 1827-1892 Renate Begemann Verlag der Badischen Landesbibliothek, 1992, p.115 The name was constructed from the titles of two poems—\\"Biedermanns Abendgemütlichkeit\\" (Biedermann's Evening Comfort) and \\"Bummelmaiers Klage\\" (Bummelmaier's Complaint)—which Joseph Victor von Scheffel had published in 1848 in the same magazine. As a label for the epoch, the term has been used since around 1900. Due to the strict control of publication and official censorship, Biedermeier writers primarily concerned themselves with non-political subjects, like historical fiction and country life. Political discussion was usually confined to the home, in the presence of close friends. Typical Biedermeier poets are Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, Adelbert von Chamisso, Friedrich Halm, Eduard Mörike, and Wilhelm Müller, the last two of whom have well-known musical settings by Hugo Wolf and Franz Schubert respectively. Adalbert Stifter was a novelist and short story writer whose work also reflected the concerns of the Biedermeier movement, particularly with his novel, Der Nachsommer. As historian Carl Emil Schorske put it, \\"To illustrate and propagate his concept of Bildung, compounded of Benedictine world piety, German humanism, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel Der Nachsommer\\". Furniture design and interior decorating Biedermeier room in the museum of Chrzanów, Poland Zimmerbild (chamber painting) of a Biedermeier interior in Berlin: fitted carpets, unified window, and pier-mirror draperies, and framed engravings in a restrained classicising style, , by Leopold Zielcke (1791–1861) Biedermeier was an influential German style of furniture design that evolved from 1815–1848. The period extended into Scandinavia, as disruptions due to numerous states that made up the German nation were not unified by rule from Berlin until 1871. These post-Biedermeier struggles, influenced by historicism, created their own styles. Throughout the period, emphasis was kept upon clean lines and minimal ornamentation consistent with basis of Biedermeier' in utilitarian principles. As the period progressed, however, the style moved from the early rebellion against Romantic-era fussiness to increasingly ornate commissions by a rising middle class, eager to show their newfound wealth. The idea of clean lines and utilitarian postures would resurface in the 20th century, continuing into the present day. Middle to late-Biedermeier furniture design represented a heralding towards historicism and revival eras long sought for. Social forces originating in France would change the artisan-patron system that achieved this period of design, first in the German states, and then into Scandinavia. The middle class growth originated in the Industrial Revolution in Britain and many Biedermeier designs owe their simplicity to Georgian lines of the 19th century, as the proliferation of design publications reached the loose German states and Austria-Hungary. The Biedermeier style was a simplified interpretation of the influential French Empire style of Napoleon I, which introduced the romance of ancient Roman Empire styles, adapting these to modern early 19th century households. Biedermeier furniture used locally available materials such as cherry, ash, and oak woods rather than the expensive timbers such as fully imported mahogany. Whilst this timber was available near trading ports such as Antwerp, Hamburg, and Stockholm, it was taxed heavily whenever it passed through another principality. This made mahogany very expensive to use and much local cherry and pearwood was stained to imitate the more expensive timbers. Stylistically, the furniture was simple and elegant. Its construction utilised the ideal of truth through material, something that later influenced the Bauhaus and Art Deco periods. Many unique designs were created in Vienna, primarily because a young apprentice was examined on his use of material, construction, originality of design, and quality of cabinet work, before being admitted to the league of approved master cabinetmakers. Furniture from the earlier period (1815–1830) was the most severe and neoclassical in inspiration. It also supplied the most fantastic forms which the second half of the period (1830–1848) lacked, being influenced by the many style publications from Britain. Biedermeier furniture was the first style in the world that emanated from the growing middle class. It preceded Victoriana and influenced mainly German-speaking countries. In Sweden, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, whom Napoleon appointed as ambassador to Sweden to sideline his ambitions, abandoned his support for Napoleon in a shrewd political move. Later, after being adopted by the King of Sweden (who was childless), he became Sweden's new king as Karl XIV Johan. The Swedish Karl Johan style, similar to Biedermeier, retained its elegant and blatantly Napoleonic style throughout the 19th century. Biedermeier furniture and lifestyle was a focus on exhibitions at the Vienna applied arts museum in 1896. The many visitors to this exhibition were so influenced by this fantasy style and its elegance that a new resurgence or revival period became popular amongst European cabinetmakers. This revival period lasted up until the Art Deco style was taken up. Biedermeier also influenced the various Bauhaus styles through their truth in material philosophy. The original Biedermeier period changed with the political unrests of 1845–1848 (its end date). With the revolutions in European historicism, furniture of the later years of the period took on a distinct Wilhelminian or Victorian style. The term Biedermeier is also used to refer to a style of clocks made in Vienna in the early 19th century. The clean and simple lines included a light and airy aesthetic, especially in Viennese regulators of the ' and Dachluhr styles.  Architecture The Geymüllerschlössel in Vienna was constructed in 1808, it houses today the Biedermeier collection of the Museum of Applied Arts Biedermeier architecture was marked by simplicity and elegance, exemplified by the paintings of Jakob Alt and Carl Spitzweg. Through the unity of simplicity and functionality, the Biedermeier neoclassical architecture created tendencies of crucial influence for the Jugendstil,Vienna: City of Modernity, 1890-1914 By Tag Gronberg. Page 124 Bauhaus, and 20th century architecture. The Geymüllerschlössel in Vienna was constructed in 1808, it houses today the Biedermeier collection of the Museum of Applied Arts. Visual arts Am Fronleichnamsmorgen, by Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller (1857) is an example of Biedermeier paintings evoking harmony, belief, and tradition. Austrian paintings during this era were characterized by the commitment to portray a sentimental and pious view of the world in a realistic way. Biedermeier themes reinforced feelings of security, Gemütlichkeit, traditional pieties, and simplicity, eschewing political and social commentary during the epoch.Biedermeier-era paintings in the Belvedere, Vienna Thus, the techniques, while classic in nature were of the utmost importance to reach a realistic rendering. Regarding the theme, the technique was seen not only as a narrative medium to tell the past in anecdotal vignettes, but also to represent the present. This formed an aesthetic unity most evidenced in the portraits (e.g., Portrait of the Arthaber Family, 1837, by Friedrich von Amerling), landscapes (e.g. see Waldmüller or Gauermann landscapes) and contemporary-reporting genre scenes (e.g., Controversy of the Coachmen, 1828, by Michael Neder). Clara Schumann, noted female composer, portrayed in 1838 by Andreas Staub Key painters of the Biedermeier movement were Carl Spitzweg (1808–1885), Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller (1795–1865), Henrik Weber (1818–1866), Josip Tominc (1780–1866), Friedrich von Amerling (1803–1887), Friedrich Gauermann (1807–1862), Johann Baptist Reiter (1813–1890), Peter Fendi (1796–1842), (1807–1882), Josef Danhauser (1805–1845), and Edmund Wodick (1806–1886) among others. The biggest collection of Viennese Biedermeier paintings in the world is currently hosted by the Belvedere Palace Museum in Vienna. In Denmark, the Biedermeier period corresponded with the Danish Golden Age, a time of creative production in the country which encompasses the paintings of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and his students, including Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand as well as the neoclassical sculpture inspired by the example set by Bertel Thorvaldsen. The period also saw the development of Danish architecture in the Neoclassical style. Copenhagen, in particular, acquired a new look, with buildings designed by Christian Frederik Hansen and Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll. Music Biedermeier in music was most evident in the numerous publications for in-home music making. Published arrangements of operatic excerpts, German Lieder, and some symphonic works that could be performed at the piano without professional musical training, illustrated the broadened reach of music in this period. Composers from this period include Beethoven, Schubert, Rossini, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schumann and Liszt. Czech lands The Biedermeier period coincided with the Czech National Revival movement in the Czech-speaking areas. The most famous writers of the period were Božena Němcová, Karel Hynek Mácha, František Ladislav Čelakovský, Václav Kliment Klicpera, and Josef Kajetán Tyl. Key painters of the Czech Biedermeier were Josef Navrátil, Antonín Machek, and Antonín Mánes. Landscapes, still lifes, courtyards, family scenes, and portraits were very popular. Václav Tomášek composed lyric piano pieces and songs to the patriotic lyrics of Czech authors. Biedermeier was also reflected in the applied arts: glass and porcelain, fashion, jewellery, and furniture.  Current usage  Terms like Bionade-Biedermeier or Generation Biedermeier have been coined to describe parallels between the historical Biedermeier and the German present. The underlying allusion is being used as well in related wordings like Bionade- Bourgeoisie. The 2010 Shell Jugendstudie used the term Generation Biedermeier for the mainstream of the younger generation in 2010. Security and private happiness then was more important than political engagement. ReferencesFurther reading * Ilsa Barea (1966, republished 1992), Vienna: legend and reality, London: Pimlico.

There are two variants: the global Milky Way bar, which is sold as 3 Musketeers in the US and Canada; and the US Milky Way bar, which is sold as the Mars bar worldwide (including Canada). Neither is sold as the Milky Way bar in Canada. American version The Milky Way bar's North American variant is made of nougat topped with caramel and covered with milk chocolate. It was created in 1923 by Frank C. Mars and originally manufactured in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the name and taste derived from a then-popular malted milk drink (milkshake) of the day, not after the astronomical galaxy. On March 10, 1925, the Milky Way trademark was registered in the US, claiming a first-use date of 1922. In 1924, the Milky Way bar was introduced nationally, with sales totalling $800,000 that year. The chocolate for the chocolate coating was supplied by Hershey's. By 1926, two variants were available: chocolate nougat with milk chocolate coating, and vanilla nougat with a dark chocolate coating, each selling for 5¢. In June 1932, the bar was marketed as a two-piece bar, and four years later, in 1936, the chocolate and vanilla were separated. The vanilla version, with a dark chocolate coating, was called \\"Forever Yours,\\" marketed until 1979.Brenner, Joël Glenn The Emperors of Chocolate: Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars p.174 Broadway Books, 04/01/2000 In 1989, Forever Yours was reintroduced and renamed \\"Milky Way Dark\\" and later \\"Milky Way Midnight\\". In 1935, Mars used the marketing slogan \\"The sweet you can eat between meals,\\" later using \\"At work, rest and play, you get three great tastes in a Milky Way.\\" By 2006, Mars used the slogan \\"Comfort in every bar\\" in the US and most recently \\"Life's better the Milky Way.\\" In 2010, the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar went on sale, a version with caramel covered in milk chocolate and without nougat. In 2011, Mars introduced a small size (marketed as fun size) Simply Caramel bar. In 2012, Milky Way Caramel Apple Minis went on sale as a limited offer for the Halloween season. In late summer of 2018, Milky Way Fudge, which substitutes the malt nougat with chocolate fudge nougat, was introduced nationwide. The American Milky Way bar has 240 calories in each 52.2 gram bar; the smaller Milky Way Midnight has 220 calories in each 50 gram bar; and the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar has 250 calories in each 54 gram bar. =Marketing= In November 2012, a new print and digital advertising campaign was launched in the US called \\"Sorry, I was eating a Milky Way\\". The campaign portrayed the comical aftermath of what happens after someone (off camera) is distracted due to eating a Milky Way bar. This campaign originated from the suggestion that eating a Milky Way bar may be a slow, involved process. Global version The US version (left) and global version (right) of Milky Way The US and global bars each feature different types of filling. The version of the bar sold outside the United States has no caramel topping, and consists of a nougat center that is considerably lighter than that of the Mars bar and the Milky Way European version. Due to this low density (0.88 g/cm3), it floats in milk, an attribute highlighted in an advertising campaign in Germany, France, Russia, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, the Netherlands, and the UK and Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland and many other European countries and many other countries. Originally available within Europe only in chocolate flavor, the center was revised to vanilla flavor around 1993, though the chocolate flavor still remains available in Australia. The bar is also available in banana, mango, and strawberry flavors. In the UK, Mars introduced the Flyte bar which was identical to the old-style chocolate flavored Milky Way, was marketed in twin packs and discontinued in 2015. Also available in Europe are Milky Way Crispy Rolls, chocolate-covered wafer rolls with milk- cream fillings. A variant of the Milky Way bar branded 'Milky Way Magic Stars' is marketed in the UK, with small aerated chocolate star shapes. Each star is engraved with a different smiley face, representing one of the magic star characters portrayed on the packaging and referenced in the advertising: Pop Star, Jess Star, Bright Star, Super Star, Twinkle Star, Falling Star, Happy Star, Sport Star, Clever Star and Baby Star. Subsequently, reference to the characters was dropped, the packaging since depicting blank stars, although the faces remain in the chocolates themselves. Calorie count varies. The British version of the Milky Way bar has 96 calories. =Marketing= Milky Way floating in milk A long-running advertising slogan for the product in the United Kingdom and Australia was, \\"The sweet you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite\\". In 1991, the Health Education Authority and anti-sugar lobbyists both complained, without success, to the Independent Television Commission that such advertising encouraged children to eat sweets between meals. The ITC agreed with Mars that its advertisements in fact encouraged restrained eating. Once marketed as a snack food that would not intrude on regular meals, modern marketing portrays the Milky Way as a snack reducing mealtime hunger and curbing the appetite between meals. A widely known advertisement was debuted in 1989, featuring a red 1951 Buick Roadmaster and a vehicle that resembles a blue 1959 Cadillac Series 62 (lacking its iconic fins or dual headlights) racing, with the former eating everything in sight and the latter eating a Milky Way. The advert ends with the now fat red car falling through a bridge and the blue car winning the race. The advert returned albiet edited in 2009, removing the claim that the Milky Way is not an appetite spoiler. Milky Way adverts in the 1990s emphasized the bar's lightness, depicting the bar floating in milk. The European variant will float in milk, while the denser US version will not.

History Troop photo, circa 1937 Scouting was first introduced in Singapore in 1908 but was officially founded on 2 July 1910. A young Scoutmaster named Frank Cooper Sands arrived from Nottingham in September 1910 and spent the next 40 years helping to create the Singapore Scout Association. He is often called the \\"Father of Malayan Scouting\\". Starting with a small troop of 30 boys, the movement has grown immensely over the last 90 years, surviving two world wars and producing countless leaders in every sphere of human endeavour. Scouting for local boys only started in 1919 by Captain N.M. Hashim and A.Z. Alsagoff. From 1922 schools in Singapore adopted the Scout Programme as an extra-curricular activity resulting in the formation of school-sponsored troops registered as 2nd Raffles Institution, 3rd Anglo-Chinese School and 4th St Joseph Institution. The 04 St Joseph's Pelandok Scout Group, formed in the 1911, became the oldest surviving Scout troop after the First Singapore Scout Troop disbanded. From 1963 to 1965 the SSA formed part of the Scout Association of Malaysia. Present Arrow Scout Group at Youth Rally, circa 1949 Today, there are 10,722 Scouts in Singapore serving in four mainstream Scout sections. Each section caters to the needs of Scouts in a specific age range through its different program focus. The Cub Scout section comprises youths between ages 7 and 12 (primary school) while the scout section is made up of youths from 12 to 16 (secondary school). In addition, there are the Venture Scout and Rover Scout sections which accept youths between the ages of 15 and 18 and young adults from 17 to 25 respectively. Besides the mainstream Scout sections, there is also the Sea Scout section, which comprises Sea Scouts, Sea Venture Scouts and Sea Rover Scouts, and the Extension Scouts which is open to all physically or mentally disadvantaged youths who enjoy Scouting. Previously, there was also the Air Scout section which was abolished. However, in 2011, the Air Scout programme has been restarted and the section has been renamed as Black Knights Air Scouts. On 24 March 2012, an investiture ceremony was held to officially welcome the latest batch of Air Scout Rovers. Some 20 students and two lecturers from ITE College Central's Black Knights Air Scouts, completed the airborne training conducted by the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) from 5 to 8 July 2012, during their Overseas Training Program 2012, in Bangkok, Thailand. Scouting in Singapore is not only available to schools but also to the general community. The Scout units based in community are usually open units. They often work hand in hand with their respective RCs with community projects while using these RCs as their Scout's \\"base\\". There are also several foreign Scout groups, mainly the international schools, in Singapore that actively participate in the Singapore National & Area Scouting events. The emblem uses the red and white from the Flag of Singapore, plus the 5 stars and crescent symbolizing unity of Scouts regardless of ethnic origin, religion or mother language. Singapore Scout Association The President of the Republic of Singapore is the Chief Scout. The Chief Scout holds the highest authority in the SSA and grants warrants and awards to uniformed adult leaders and commissioners who are recommended by the Association Headquarters. The Chief Scout also awards deserving and outstanding youth members who have attained the Standards of the Highest Award — the President's Scout Award. The Association Headquarters is led by the Scout Council, which comprises both the uniformed and lay officials who assist the Chief Scout in his functions. The Scout Council is responsible for finding funds to support the Association's activities and provides strategic direction and financial oversight on the Association while the Commissioners' Council formulates operational policies and directives in the respective fields and departments. The Area Council and the Districts implement the various National policies and directives to the grassroot units. Full-time professional staff provide day-to-day management of the Association Headquarters and provide support services to Commissioners' Council and Scout Council. The Scout Council is headed by an elected President of the Association, together with his Vice Presidents and Council members. There are several committees formed up to look into the various aspects of the Association including the Finance Committee, Uniform Committee, and Scout Shop Committee. The Commissioner's Council is the highest operational policy and directive body headed by Chief Commissioner. The Commissioner's Council structure as follows: *Chief Commissioner *Deputy Chief Commissioners *Assistant Chief Commissioners **National Training Commissioner **National Programme Commissioner **Area Commissioners **Membership Growth Commissioner **Partnership Commissioner **Adult Resource Commissioner **Programme Resource Commissioner *International/Relations Commissioner *District Commissioner The National Training Commissioner is the head of National Training Team whose role is to provide adult leader training towards Woodbadge. The National Program Commissioner is the head of National Program Council whose role is to provide Scouting Programs and updates for all youth members. The International/Relations Commissioner is the head of International/Relations Department that handles both relations within Singapore and internationally.

Normand Lester, Author. Le Livre noir du Canada Anglais (The Black Book of English Canada) is a series of three polemic books written by Quebec journalist Normand Lester. The first volume was published in 2001.https://voir.ca/societe/2001/11/22/normand-lester- chronique-dun-depart-annonce/ The essays relate what are, from the author's point of view while including many historian's citations, historical fabrications and injustices in Canada, notably those against the Quebecers, Jewish and aboriginal peoples. Its publication resulted in the suspension of Lester by the Société Radio-Canada.  Description  The books responded to perceived Quebec bashing in the English Canadian press following the airing of Heritage Minutes, the treatment of the 1995 Quebec referendum and the federalist advertising campaign that would later develop into the sponsorship scandal. According to Lester, the English Canadian media was quick to pick up on stories that were distorted or untruthful, such as the supposed singing of a Nazi anthem at an early sovereigntist rally, which was actually an unrelated song with a similar title. Generally, the books seek to disprove many of the claims of federalists, attempting to show that the Quebec sovereignty movement was not inherently fascist and anti-semitic, and that these prejudices were in plentiful supply in English Canada. Volume one accused former Canadian Prime Minister R. B. Bennett of funding fascist Adrien Arcand.

Another 6,000 blacks were left homeless and the burning and vandalism cost approximately $400,000 ($ in ) in property damage. The events took place in and near East St. Louis, Illinois, an industrial city on the east bank of the Mississippi River, directly opposite the city of St. Louis, Missouri. The July 1917 episode in particular was marked by white-led violence throughout the city. The multi-day massacre has been described as the \\"worst case of labor-related violence in 20th-century American history\\",Fitch, Solidarity for Sale, 2006, p. 120. and among the worst racial massacres in U.S. history. In the aftermath, the East St. Louis Chamber of Commerce called for the resignation of the local police chief because officers were told not to shoot white citizens and were unable to suppress the violence and destruction. At the end of July, some 10,000 black citizens marched in silent protest in New York City in condemnation of the massacre. A number of black people left the city permanently; black enrollment in public schools in the area had dropped by 35% by the time schools opened in the fall. Background In 1917, the United States had an active economy boosted by World War I. Many would-be workers were drafted or enlisted into military service, creating a shortage of labor for industrial employers in major cities, which had long been destinations for European immigrants. Concurrently African Americans began the Great Migration from the rural Southern United States to seek better work and education in the North, as well as to escape from lynchings and the discriminations of the Jim Crow era. Labor agencies recruited some workers for specific jobs, especially as strikebreakers, but labor demand was sufficient that migrants moved on their own, having heard about the new employment opportunities created by the wartime economy. The neighboring communities of St. Louis, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois, both became destinations for southern migrants. Blacks were arriving in St. Louis at the rate of 2,000 per week during the spring of 1917.\\"Speech by Marcus Garvey, July 8, 1917\\". Excerpts from Robert A. Hill, ed. The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers, Volume I, 1826 – August 1919. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1983, accessed 1 February 2009, PBS, American Experience. Major industries in East St. Louis included Aluminum Ore Co., American Steel Foundry, Republic Iron & Steel, Obear Nester Glass and Elliot Frog & Switch (a frog was part of a railroad switch), with many facilities located just outside the city limits to escape paying taxes. Nearby National City had stockyards and meatpacking plants, attracting more workers. It was a rough industrial city where saloons outnumbered schools and churches. Non-whites were initially a small minority: in 1910, approximately 6,000 African Americans lived in East St. Louis, out of a total population of 58,000; by 1917, the black population had increased to 10,000, or one-sixth of the total population of 60,000. The period was one of frequent labor violence in industrial cities across the United States: employers used force to try to suppress organized labor and strikes, while workers struggled to gain fair wages and working conditions. Many workers were immigrants from Europe. When industries became embroiled in labor strikes, the traditionally white unions often sought to strengthen their bargaining positions by hindering or excluding black workers. Conversely, industry owners hired blacks as replacements or strikebreakers, deepening existing segregation and inter-racial hostility.Winston James, Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia, New York: Verso, 1998, p. 95. Ethnicities competed economically to survive. White workers often resented black newcomers due to competition for jobs and housing and fear they would be undercut by black workers who were willing to accept lower wages. In East St. Louis, local politicians, company foremen, and labor union officials fanned the resentment; the approval of the local police and National Guard were later considered important in helping to escalate the rioting.Malcolm McLaughlin, \\"Reconsidering the East St Louis Race Riot of 1917.\\" International Review of Social History 47.2 (2002): 187–212. The Springfield race riot of 1908 in nearby Springfield, Illinois, was an expression of the simmering tensions in the region during the nadir of race relations. While in New Orleans on a lecture tour, Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who founded the UNIA in 1916, became aware that Louisiana planters and the city's Board of Trade were worried about losing their labor force, as he recounted in a speech the following year. He said that Mayor Mollman of East St. Louis was also visiting the city that week, and city leaders asked for his assistance to help discourage black migration to the North. In the summer of 1916, 2,500 white employees of the meatpacking industry near East St. Louis went on strike for higher wages, and the companies imported black workers to replace them. Ultimately the workers won a wage increase but the companies retained nearly 800 blacks, firing as many whites after the strike, according to the former president of the Central Trades and Labor Union of East St. Louis. This result only exacerbated the growing racial tension. In the spring of 1917, the mostly white workers of the Aluminum Ore Company in East St. Louis voted to strike. The company recruited hundreds of black workers to replace them. Tensions between the groups escalated. At a labor meeting held in City Hall on May 28 and made up mostly of white workers, rumors circulated of black men fraternizing with white women.Rudwick, Race Riot at East St. Louis, 1964.Leonard, \\"E. St. Louis Riot\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 13, 2004. Violence Following the May 28 meeting, some 1,000–3,000 white men marched into downtown East St. Louis and began attacking African Americans on the street and in streetcars and burning some buildings. Illinois Governor Frank Orren Lowden called in the National Guard to suppress the violence. Although rumors circulated that blacks were planning retaliatory attacks, conditions eased somewhat for a few weeks. Following the May disorder, the East St. Louis Central Labor Council requested an investigation by the State Council of Defense. Its report said that \\"southern negroes were misled by false advertisements and unscrupulous employment agents to come to East St. Louis in such numbers under false pretenses of secure jobs and decent living quarters\\".Richmond Times-Dispatch, July 6, 1917. The tensions between black workers and white workers quickly formed again as no solutions to their economic challenges were agreed upon. The massacre was precipitated by fatal errors. On July 1, a black Ford Model TDanny Wicentowski, \\"Remember the East St. Louis Race War\\", Riverfront Times, 28 June 2017; accessed 17 September 2018 occupied by white males drove through a black area of the city; passengers fired several shots into a group on the street. An hour later, a Ford containing four people, including a journalist and two police officers (Detective Sergeant Samuel Coppedge and Detective Frank Wadley), passed through the same area. Black residents, possibly assuming this car held the original attackers, opened fire on the car, killing one officer instantly and mortally wounding another.\\"Detective Sergeant Samuel Coppedge\\", Officer Down Memorial Page. The next day, thousands of white spectators gathered to view the detectives' bloodstained automobile. From there they rushed into the black sections of town, south and west of the city, and began rioting.Buescher, John. \\"East St. Louis Massacre.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed July 11, 2011. The mob beat and shot blacks on the street indiscriminately, including women and children. After cutting the water hoses of the fire department, white rioters burned entire sections of the city and shot black residents as they escaped the flames. Claiming that \\"Southern negros deserve[d] a genuine lynching\\", some whites hanged several blacks.Heaps, \\"Target of Prejudice: The Negro\\", in Riots, USA 1765–1970, p. 114. The following day on July 3, 1917, a reporter from Post-Dispatch of St. Louis wrote: \\"For an hour and a half last evening I saw the massacre of helpless negroes at Broadway and Fourth Street, in downtown East St. Louis, where black skin was death warrant.\\" =Police response= According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: > All the impartial witnesses agree that the police were either indifferent or > encouraged the barbarities, and that the major part of the National Guard > was indifferent or inactive.

Hundreds of blacks fled across the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi River to St. Louis to escape the violence, while 1,500 sought refuge in city buildings. St. Louis institutions worked to assist the refugees, including the St. Louis chapter of the Red Cross, the Provident Association, and the Jewish Education and Charitable Association, as well as related charities. The Red Cross Emergency Committee met daily with Acting Mayor Aloe, members of his administration, and representatives of the charities to discuss how to aid the refugees.Oscar Leonard, \\"The East St. Louis Pogrom\\", The Survey, Volume 38, Chicago: Survey Associates, 1917, pp. 331- 333 Governor Lowden ordered in the Illinois National Guard, who arrived on July 3. Numerous witnesses said that the Guard initially joined in the attacks on blacks rather than stopping the riot.Gibson, The Negro Holocaust: Lynching and Race Riots in the United States, 1880–1950, 1979.Patrick, \\"The Horror of the East St. Louis Massacre\\", Exodus, February 22, 2000. More whites joined in. The New York Times reported that \\"ten or fifteen young girls about 18 years old, chased a negro woman at the Relay Depot at about 5 o'clock. The girls were brandishing clubs and calling upon the men to kill the woman.\\"\\"Race Rioters Fire East St. Louis and Shoot or Hang Many Negroes\\", The New York Times, July 3, 1917. Few photographs exist of the events, as rioters attacked photographers and destroyed their cameras, and city police harassed journalists.Tim O'Neil, \\"Look Back 250: Worker struggles, racial hatred in East St. Louis explodes in white rioting\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 1, 2012. Accessed 16 September 2018. After the massacre, the St. Louis Argus said, \\"The entire country has been aroused to a sense of shame and pity by the magnitude of the national disgrace enacted by the blood-thirsty rioters in East St. Louis Monday, July 2.\\" AftermathDeath toll= After the massacre, varying estimates of the death toll circulated. The police chief estimated that 100 African Americans had been killed. The renowned journalist Ida B. Wells reported in The Chicago Defender that 40–150 African-American people were killed during the July massacre.Wells, Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B. Wells, rev. ed., 1991. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) estimated deaths at 100–200. Some 6,000 African Americans were left homeless after their neighborhoods were burned. A Congressional Investigating Committee, which met in the fall of that year, concluded that no precise death toll could be determined, but reported that at least 8 whites and 39 African Americans died.Congressional Edition, Volume 7444, House of Representatives 65th Congress 2nd Session document # 1231, 1918. While the local coroner had documented nine white deaths, the deaths of African-American victims were less clearly recorded. Activists who disputed the committee's conclusions about deaths argued that the true number of deaths would never be known because many black corpses were not recovered or did not pass through the hands of undertakers, who reported to the coroner.Elliott M. Rudwick, Race Riot at East St. Louis, July 2, 1917, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1964, p. 50. =Black community reaction= Photo of the Silent Parade protest march in New York City (July 28, 1917) The ferocious brutality of the attacks and the failure of authorities to protect innocent lives contributed to the radicalization of many blacks in St. Louis and the nation.James, Winston. (1998), Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: Caribbean Radicalism in Early Twentieth-century America, p. 96. Marcus Garvey, black nationalist leader of the UNIA from Jamaica, declared in a July 8 speech that the riot was \\"one of the bloodiest outrages against mankind\\" and a \\"wholesale massacre of our people\\", insisting that \\"This is no time for fine words, but a time to lift one's voice against the savagery of a people who claim to be the dispensers of democracy.\\"Herbert Shapiro, White Violence and Black Response: From Reconstruction to Montgomery, University of Massachusetts Press, 1988, p. 163. In New York City on July 28, ten thousand black people marched down Fifth Avenue in a Silent Parade, protesting the East St. Louis Massacre. They carried signs that highlighted protests about the massacre. The march was organized by the NAACP (then based in New York), leader W. E. B. Du Bois, and groups in Harlem. Women and children were dressed in white; the men were dressed in black. The NAACP had arranged for journalists to photograph the destruction in East St. Louis left behind after the massacre: houses, stores, churches, and brick warehouses were all left in ruins. These photographs were published in the November 1917 issue of The Crisis, the organization's magazine. =Business community reaction= On July 6, representatives of the East St. Louis Chamber of Commerce met with the mayor to demand the resignation of the Police Chief and Night Police Chief, or radical reform. They were outraged about the rioting and accused the mayor of having allowed a \\"reign of lawlessness.\\" In addition to the high death toll, the massacre had caused extensive property damage to city businesses and houses. The Southern Railway Company's warehouse was burned, with the loss of more than 100 car loads of merchandise, worth more than $525,000 to the company; some 44 freight cars, and 312 houses were also burned.Congressional Edition, Volume 7444, House of Representatives 65th Congress 2nd Session document # 1231, 1918, pp. 1, 6. A white-owned theatre, valued at more than $100,000, was also destroyed. Total property damage was estimated at $400,000 (nearly $8.5 million, in 2018 US Dollars). =Government reaction= In a mass meeting in Carnegie Hall on July 12 in New York City, Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor, tried to diminish the role in the massacre attributed to trade unions. He said that an investigation was needed in order to place blame. Theodore Roosevelt, former president of the United States, responded, \\"Mr. Gompers, why don't I accuse afterwards? I'll answer now, when murder is to be answered.\\" Roosevelt also was reported to say, \\"I will go to the extreme to bring justice to the laboring man, but when there is murder I will put him down.\\"Cresco Plain Dealer. (Cresco, Howard County, Iowa), July 13, 1917. Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers. Library of Congress. Congressman Leonidas C. Dyer (R-Mo.), a representative from a St. Louis urban district, asked for a federal investigation. President Woodrow Wilson wrote to him on July 28, saying that special agents of the Department of Justice could not find enough evidence to justify federal action in the matter. He said: \\"I am informed that the attorney general of the State of Illinois has gone to East St. Louis to add his efforts to those of the officials of the county and city in pressing prosecutions under the State laws. The representatives of the Department of Justice are so far as possible lending aid to the State authorities in their efforts to restore tranquility and guard against further outbreaks.\\" Hearings on the massacre before the Committee on Rules and the House of Representatives began on August 3, 1917. A federal investigation was eventually opened. In October the state tried 25 blacks and 10 whites on charges related to the massacre, including homicide and incitement to riot. Lena Cook survived an attack to testify against two white men, who had killed her husband, Ed Cook, and son, 14-year-old Lurizza Beard; they were convicted of murder. Included among the defendants was Dr. LeRoy Bundy, a black dentist and prominent leader in the East St. Louis black community. He was formally charged with inciting a riot. The trial was held in the county court of St. Clair County, Illinois. Bundy, along with 34 other defendants, of whom 10 were white, was convicted and sentenced to prison in connection with the riot.The Chicago Daily Tribune, March 29, 1918. Another source said that a total of nine whites and twelve blacks were convicted of serious crimes and sent to prison. ReferencesSources *Barnes, Harper.

It was unveiled in January 1995 at the Detroit Auto Show.  Design  The mid-engined GT90 is a spiritual successor to the Ford GT40, taking from it some styling cues, such as doors that cut into the roofline, but little else. In regard to angles and glass, the Ford GT90 was the first Ford to display the company's \\"New Edge\\" design philosophy. The GT90 was built around a honeycomb-section aluminum monocoque and its body panels were molded from carbon fiber.  Performance Data  The GT90's 48-valve V12 is constructed on an aluminium block and head, displaces 5.9-litres (5,927 cc), and produces an estimated and of torque. It has a redline of 6,300 rpm. It is equipped with a forced induction system that uses four Garrett T2 turbochargers. The engine architecture was based on the 90-degree Ford Modular engine family utilizing a layout similar to that of a paired set of 4.6-litre V8 engines, of which each had 2 cylinders removed. This yielded a 90-degree V12, with a bore and a stroke with the cylinders arranged in two banks in a single casting. The power produced by the engine is delivered to the rear-wheels through a 5-speed manual transmission developed jointly by FF Developments and Ricardo. The exhaust of the GT90 gets so hot that it would be enough to damage the body panels, and thus ceramic tiles, similar to those on the Space Shuttle, are used to keep the car from melting. The suspension is a double wishbone variant. The steering is a power-assisted rack-and-pinion. The brakes are ventilated discs. The GT90, according to Ford, was capable of accelerating from in 3.1 seconds, in 6.2 seconds, and had a quarter mile (400 m) time of 10.9 seconds at . Top speed was listed as .The GT90 has a very angular design. Notice all the triangles in its design.  Development  The GT90 was built as a secret project by a small engineering team in just over six months. It shared many components including the transmission and chassis from the Jaguar XJ220, as Jaguar was also owned by Ford at the time. The V12 engine, unique to the GT90, was developed by using a Lincoln Town Car as a test mule, in which they put the prototype engine in order to refine it. The GT90 was originally going to be the successor to the Ford GT40 and Ford GT70, and the predecessor to the Ford GT, but after the plan for production was cancelled, the chronology was changed, making the Ford GT the new successor to the GT40 and GT70.  Media  The Ford GT90 appeared in the video games Need for Speed II, Sega GT 2002, Sega GT Online, Ford Racing 2, Ford Racing 3, Gran Turismo 2, Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA, TOCA Race Driver 2, TOCA Race Driver 3, Top Drives, Project Gotham Racing 3 and Ford Street Racing. The car was featured on Top Gear in a 1995 issue tested by Jeremy Clarkson, while the car was still planned to enter production.

Howard, Dictionary of Rhetorical Terms, p. 115 The phrase wine, women and song is an example. If the units involved are not single words, and if they are not in any way synonyms but rather circumnavigate the one idea expressed, the figure may be described more correctly, precisely, and succinctly as a triad. A tripartite motto is the conventional English term for a motto, a slogan, or an advertising phrase in the form of a hendiatris. Some well-known examples are Julius Caesar's Veni, vidi, vici (an example of a tricolon) and the motto of the French Republic: Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité; the phrase Peace, Order and Good Government is used as a guiding principle in the parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations. In the ancient and classical world In rhetorical teaching, such triple iterations marked the classic rhythm of Ciceronian style, typified by the triple rhetorical questions of his first Oration Against Catiline: In ancient Greece and Rome, such abstractions as liberty and justice were theologized (cf. triple deity). Hence the earliest tripartite mottoes are lists of the names of goddesses: Eunomia, Dike, and Eirene. These late Greek goddesses, respectively Good Order, Justice, and Peace were collectively referred to by the Romans as the Horae. The Romans had Concordia, Salus, and Pax, collectively called the Fortunae. The names of these mean Harmony, Health, and Peace. In Shakespeare * \\"Cry God for Harry, England and St. George\\" (Henry V) * \\"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears\\" (Julius Caesar) * \\"Be bloody, bold, and resolute\\" (Macbeth) * \\"Love all, trust a few. Do wrong to none.\\" (All's well that ends well) * \\"Serve God, love me, and mend.\\" (Much Ado About Nothing) Since the Renaissance and the Enlightenment From the 18th century, the tripartite motto was primarily political. John Locke's Life, Liberty, and Property was adapted by Thomas Jefferson when he wrote the United States Declaration of Independence into Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, which has become the American equivalent of the French triad listed above. The initial Carlist motto was God, Country, King. The University of North Carolina's Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies maintain such tripartite mottos as well. The Philanthropic Society's motto is Virtus, Libertas, et Scientia \\"Virtue, Liberty, and Knowledge\\" and the Joint Senate motto is Ad Virtutem, Libertatem, Scientiamque \\"Toward Virtue, Liberty, and Knowledge\\". Modern usages A Canadian usage is Peace, order and good government, originally found in the 1867 Constitution of Canada. It has remained, to this day, an essential part of the Canadian identity. \\"Il nous faut de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!\\" 'We must be bold, and again bold, and forever bold!' Georges Danton. Lenin and the Bolsheviks adopted a tripartite motto for the Russian Revolution, During the New Deal, the projects of Franklin Delano Roosevelt were summed up as Relief, Recovery, and Reform. The form was used by fascist parties: Fascist Italy's Credere! Obbedire! Combattere! 'Believe! Obey! Fight!'; the Nazi Ein Volk! Ein Reich! Ein Führer! 'One people! One state! One leader!'; and the Fascist Spanish Una, Grande y Libre 'Unitary, Great, and Free'. The modern motto of Germany: \\"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\\" (Unity and Justice and Freedom) is inscribed on the side of German euro coins, as it was on Deutsche Mark coins. During the German occupation of France, the Vichy regime replaced the motto of the Republic by Travail, Famille, Patrie (Work, Family, Fatherland). Given by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, Faith, Unity, Discipline (Urdu: ایمان، اتحاد، نظم‎) is the national motto of Pakistan. Such mnemonics have also drawn suspicion from more nuanced thinkers; in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the novel's totalitarian regime used \\"War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength\\" to exhort the subjects of Oceania to fear any apparent opportunities for personal agency. The motto of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, a Japanese puppet regime, was \\"Peace, Anti-Communism, National Construction\\". The 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal aimed at three immediate goals: \\"Descolonização, Democratização, Desenvolvimento\\" 'decolonization, democratization, development'. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has an initialistic motto: \\"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity\\", while the United States Military Academy at West Point has \\"Duty, Honor, Country\\". This concept has been extended to the list of core values of the U.S. armed services, such as the Navy's \\"Honor, Courage, Commitment\\" and the Coast Guard's \\"Honor, Respect, Devotion to Duty\\". The University of Notre Dame has adopted \\"God, Country, Notre Dame\\" as an informal motto. The phrase first appeared on the First World War memorial located on the east portico of the basilica. Royal Military College of Canada gilt and red velvet Victorian- era pin (\\"Truth, Duty, Valour\\") The Royal Military College of Canada has followed the tripartite motto \\"Truth, Duty, Valour\\" since the founding of the College in 1876. This motto was expanded into the Canadian Forces' core values. Very often triple mottoes derive from a turn of oratory in a speech; for example Abraham Lincoln's \\"of the people, by the people, for the people\\" in his Gettysburg Address and \\"Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\\" in George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address. These are common throughout Western civilization, but also appear in other cultures. The Japanese said that during their boom years, illegal immigrants performed the work that was Kiken, Kitsui, Kitanai, or \\"Dangerous, Difficult, (and/or) Dirty\\". Dravidian parties in southern India use the motto \\"Duty, Dignity and Discipline\\" (in Tamil: ). The proponents of Manding social reformation and the N'Ko language education in West Africa use the hendiatris motto \\"to be savvy, to work, to be just\\" (, kà kólɔn, kà báara, kà télen). The form is so well known that it can be played upon, as in the three requisites of real estate (\\"Location, Location, Location\\"), and similarly with Tony Blair stating his priorities as a political leader to be \\"education, education and education\\". In German society, the tripartite motto Kinder, Küche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church) was first a late-19th-century slogan, and today is used sarcastically by young women to express their disdain for their traditional role in society. One of the unofficial mottoes of Yale University is \\"For God, for country, and for Yale\\", which appears as the last line of the university's alma mater, Bright College Years. Yale historian George W. Pierson has also described Yale as \\"at once a tradition, a company of scholars, a society of friends\\". A commonly used patriotic slogan in Poland is Bóg, Honor, Ojczyzna (lit. “God, Honour, Fatherland”). The motto of the Afghan National Army is خدا، وطن، وظیفه (lit. \\"God, Homeland, Duty\\") . Featured in the 2004 American cult classic film, 13 Going on 30, starring Jennifer Garner, \\"Thirty, flirty, and thriving\\", is used to express the idea of optimistic prosperity, in the wake of commonplace insecurities faced by many young adults, in their teens and twenties. In the Kendrick Lamar song \\"The Recipe,\\" the hendiatris of \\"women, weed, and weather\\" describes \\"what represents L.A.,\\" according to Dr. Dre, who appears on the song. http://www.mtv.com/news/1682243/kendrick-lamar- dr-dre-the-recipe/ Examples *\\"Wine, women and song\\", a phrase of Johann Heinrich Voss (1751–1826), and its modern variant \\"Sex, drugs and rock and roll\\" *\\"Rum, sodomy and the lash\\", a characterization of Royal Navy tradition attributed (probably falsely) to Winston Churchill One old variant, Rum, bum and concertina, parallels Wine, women and song. *\\"Truth, justice, and the American way\\", the causes for which Superman fights, according to the opening of the television series Adventures of Superman *\\"God, mother, and apple pie\\" *\\"Lock, stock, and barrel\\" (this is also a merism, denoting a thing by enumerating its parts) *\\"Every Tom, Dick and Harry\\" *\\"Reduce, reuse, recycle\\" *\\"Virtue, liberty, and independence\\" *\\"Citius, Altius, Fortius\\" (\\"Faster, higher, stronger\\") is the official Olympic motto *\\"Gold, frankincense and myrrh\\", the Biblical gifts of the Magi *\\"In no way, shape, or form\\" *\\"Metro, boulot, dodo\\" (subway/underground, work, sleep), a French expression popularly used to describe the dreary daily routine of working Parisians, and the source of many imitative expressions. *Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things, the famous book of cognitive linguist George Lakoff on categorization and metaphor See also *Rule of three (writing) *The three Rs *Four-character idiom =Related terms= * Hendiadys, one through two has one of the parts subordinate to the other * Tricolon, isocolon of three parts, with the parts equivalent in structure, length and rhythm * Merism, denoting a whole by an enumeration of its parts * Triad (disambiguation) References Category:Figures of speech Category:Mottos Category:Rhetorical techniques ","title":"Hendiatris"},{"id":"1613219","text":"The Perceptual Signal Processing Lab, or PSPLab, is an audio research lab of National Chiao Tung University.

The size of this segment is determined by the size of the values in the program's source code, and does not change at run time. The data segment is read/write, since the values of variables can be altered at run time. This is in contrast to the read-only data segment ( segment or .rodata), which contains static constants rather than variables; it also contrasts to the code segment, also known as the text segment, which is read-only on many architectures. Uninitialized data, both variables and constants, is instead in the BSS segment. Historically, to be able to support memory address spaces larger than the native size of the internal address register would allow, early CPUs implemented a system of segmentation whereby they would store a small set of indexes to use as offsets to certain areas. The Intel 8086 family of CPUs provided four segments: the code segment, the data segment, the stack segment and the extra segment. Each segment was placed at a specific location in memory by the software being executed and all instructions that operated on the data within those segments were performed relative to the start of that segment. This allowed a 16-bit address register, which would normally be able to access 64 KB of memory space, to access 1 MB of memory space. This segmenting of the memory space into discrete blocks with specific tasks carried over into the programming languages of the day and the concept is still widely in use within modern programming languages. Program memory A computer program memory can be largely categorized into two sections: read- only and read/write. This distinction grew from early systems holding their main program in read-only memory such as Mask ROM, PROM or EEPROM. As systems became more complex and programs were loaded from other media into RAM instead of executing from ROM, the idea that some portions of the program's memory should not be modified was retained. These became the .text and .rodata segments of the program, and the remainder which could be written to divided into a number of other segments for specific tasks. =Text= The code segment, also known as a text segment or simply as text, is where a portion of an object file or the corresponding section of the program's address space that contains executable instructions is stored and is generally read-only and fixed size. =Data= This shows the typical layout of a simple computer's program memory with the text, various data, and stack and heap sections. The .data segment contains any global or static variables which have a pre-defined value and can be modified. That is any variables that are not defined within a function (and thus can be accessed from anywhere) or are defined in a function but are defined as static so they retain their address across subsequent calls. Examples, in C, include: int val = 3; char string[] = \\"Hello World\\"; The values for these variables are initially stored within the read-only memory (typically within .text) and are copied into the .data segment during the start-up routine of the program. Note that in the above example, if these variables had been declared from within a function, they would default to being stored in the local stack frame. =BSS= The BSS segment, also known as uninitialized data, is usually adjacent to the data segment. The BSS segment contains all global variables and static variables that are initialized to zero or do not have explicit initialization in source code. For instance, a variable defined as \`static int i;\` would be contained in the BSS segment. =Heap= The heap area commonly begins at the end of the .bss and .data segments and grows to larger addresses from there. The heap area is managed by malloc, calloc, realloc, and free, which may use the brk and sbrk system calls to adjust its size (note that the use of brk/sbrk and a single \\"heap area\\" is not required to fulfill the contract of malloc/calloc/realloc/free; they may also be implemented using mmap/munmap to reserve/unreserve potentially non-contiguous regions of virtual memory into the process' virtual address space). The heap area is shared by all threads, shared libraries, and dynamically loaded modules in a process. =Stack= The stack area contains the program stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory. A \\"stack pointer\\" register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each time a value is \\"pushed\\" onto the stack. The set of values pushed for one function call is termed a \\"stack frame\\". A stack frame consists at minimum of a return address. Automatic variables are also allocated on the stack. The stack area traditionally adjoined the heap area and they grew towards each other; when the stack pointer met the heap pointer, free memory was exhausted. With large address spaces and virtual memory techniques they tend to be placed more freely, but they still typically grow in a converging direction. On the standard PC x86 architecture the stack grows toward address zero, meaning that more recent items, deeper in the call chain, are at numerically lower addresses and closer to the heap. On some other architectures it grows the opposite direction. Interpreted languages Some interpreted languages offer a similar facility to the data segment, notably Perlperldata: Special Literals and Ruby.Ruby: Object: __END__ In these languages, including the line \`__DATA__\` (Perl) or \`__END__\` (Ruby, old Perl) marks the end of the code segment and the start of the data segment.

It was originally released as a Stiff Records single, with \\"Razzle in My Pocket\\" as the B-side, on 26 August 1977.Catalog number \\"BUY 17\\". The song was released under the single name \\"Ian Dury\\", but three members of the Blockheads appear on the record – the song's co-writer and guitarist Chaz Jankel, Norman Watt- Roy on bass and drummer Charlie Charles. History The song was written by Ian Dury and Chaz Jankel in Dury's flat in Oval Mansions, London (nicknamed \\"Catshit mansions\\" by Dury) that overlooked The Oval cricket ground. The pattern of work adopted by the pair involved Dury presenting Jankel with his hand-typed lyric sheets. According to Jankel in Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll: The Life of Ian Dury he would be repeatedly given the lyric for \\"Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll\\" but Jankel kept rejecting the song, only for it to be at the top of the pile again the next time, only to be rejected again. This went on until Dury sung the song's guitar riff to Jankel and sang the song's title in time with Jankel's riff. Later, Jankel heard the Ornette Coleman tune \\"Ramblin\\" (from his 1959 album Change of the Century, which included also Charlie Haden and Don Cherry) and heard exactly the same bass riff being played by Haden. Dury once apologised to Coleman for lifting the riff but, as Coleman explained, he (or possibly Haden) had lifted it himself from a Kentucky folk tune called \\"Old Joe Clark\\". An alternative version to this story exists: as Dury explained when he guested on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he had apologised at Ronnie Scott's Club for the riff lift to Haden, who responded by saying there was no need for an apology as he had lifted it from an old Cajun tune. The single did not chart, selling around 19,000 copies (a small amount for a single in 1977) but won critical acclaim. The original single was deleted after only two months. \\"That was the company's policy at the time: to go for fast sales on every single and then to delete it,\\" Jankel recalled. \\"So we didn't get much chance to climb up the main chart.\\"Dome, Malcolm: \\"The stories behind the songs\\"; Classic Rock #148, August 2010, p32 Released as it was in the height of the popularity of punk rock, the song was misinterpreted (as it often is to this day) as a song about excess as its title and chorus would suggest. Although the single was banned by the BBC, a number of Radio 1 disc jockeys, including Annie Nightingale and John Peel, continued to promote the record by playing the mildly salacious B-side \\"Razzle in My Pocket\\". Dury himself, however, maintained that the song was not a punk anthem and said he was trying to suggest that there was more to life than a 9-to-5 existence (such as in his track-by-track comments in the sleeve-notes of Repertoire Records' Reasons to Be Cheerful: The Best of Ian Dury & the Blockheads compilation). The verses themselves are at times somewhat riddle- like, although always suggestive of an alternative lifestyle: > Here's a little bit of advice, you're quite welcome, it is free Don't do > nothing that is cut-price, you'll know what they'll make you be They will > try their tricky device, trap you with the ordinary Get your teeth into a > small slice, the cake of liberty Although the song made the phrase \\"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\\" more popular, it has been around at least since the late 60s and early 70s. The title of the song was later used in many other song lyrics. =Re-releases= The song has become a staple on punk rock, new wave and Ian Dury compilations but initially the song was not available in the abundance it is today. In keeping with Dury's own policy of not including his singles on his albums, the track was not officially included on his debut album New Boots and Panties!!, though a 12-inch version of the single was released in France in November 1977, with both tracks from his next single \\"Sweet Gene Vincent\\"/\\"You're More Than Fair\\" replacing \\"Razzle in My Pocket\\" as the B-side, and again in December as a free give-a-way to guests at the NME's Christmas party that year (of which only 1,000 were pressed). This time \\"Razzle in My Pocket\\" was replaced by \\"England's Glory\\" and \\"Two Steep Hills\\", two tracks recorded live by Ian Dury & The Kilburns, the final phase of Dury's pub-rock band Kilburn & The Highroads. Five hundred more copies of the NME's version of the single were re-pressed for a competition the magazine ran but following this it was not available until Juke Box Dury, an Ian Dury singles collection released in 1981 by Stiff Records. Since then it has appeared on every Ian Dury compilation. =Versions= Stiff Records organised a joint tour for Nick Lowe, Ian Dury, Wreckless Eric, Larry Wallis, and Elvis Costello, five of their biggest acts at the time, with the intention of having the bands alternating as the headlining act. Ian Dury and the newly formed Blockheads soon became the stars of the tour (it was surmised that Elvis Costello would be the main attraction, having had chart success) and the nightly encore became \\"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\\". A version can be heard on the Live Stiffs Live (1978) compilation live LP released after the tour called \\"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll & Chaos\\", credited to Ian Dury and Stiff Stars. It features four drummers and four keyboard players, plus vocals by Wallis, Wreckless Eric, Edmunds, Lowe, and Dury, and by the end (at 5 minutes and 22 seconds). Another live version can be found on the Ian Dury & the Blockheads live album Straight from the Desk (2001), though much of it is not the song but Ian Dury introducing the band and their respective solos, with only the first half of the song and a repetition of the title at the song's climax included. When Edsel Records re- released the New Boots and Panties!! (1977) album as part of a series of Ian Dury re-issues recording in Alvic Studios, London, the track was included on the bonus disc included with the album. It features two later Blockheads members, Norman Watt-Roy and Charley Charles. Samples The song was sampled in the 2007 single \\"Sex & Drugs\\" by dance act Slyde. The video features footage of Dury singing the lyrics.

Wildstein rose to nationwide prominence in Poland in January and February 2005, after he smuggled files on informers and victims of the former communist secret police (Służba Bezpieczeństwa) from the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) and distributed them to fellow journalists. The files are commonly referred to as \\"Wildstein's list\\" (lista Wildsteina). Life Wildstein was born in Olsztyn. His father Szymon Wildstein was a Jewish military doctor and communist in the Second Republic of Poland.Rafał Kalukin: Bronisław niezłomny His mother Genowefa Wildstein was an anticommunist peasant and member of the Home Army (the Polish underground army acting against Poland's World War II German and Soviet occupiers). When he was five years old he contracted tuberculosis, and his family moved to Przemyśl for the healthier climate. From 1971 through 1980, Wildstein studied Polish literature at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. In the 1970s, he joined the oppositional Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnikow), an influential highbrow forerunner to the Solidarity movement that was established in 1980; and in 1977 he co-founded the Student Committee of Solidarity (Studencki Komitet Solidarności). From 1980 he lived in France, where he worked as a journalist for the Polish monthly Kontakt and for Radio Free Europe. After the fall of communism, he returned to Poland. From 1994 until 1996, he worked for the Polish daily newspaper Życie Warszawy (Warsaw Life), before its transformation into the more conservative Życie (Life). Most recently, he was a salaried employee of the prestigious, moderately- conservative-to-centrist daily, Rzeczpospolita (The Republic), which dropped him as a salaried employee in the wake of the public controversy over \\"Wildstein's List\\" (though he continues to contribute as a freelance writer). Currently Wildstein publishes essays for the weekly newsmagazine, Do Rzeczy.  \\"Wildstein's List\\" controversy Background = In his books and essays, Wildstein has strongly argued for a thorough review of the communist past not only of politicians, but of all of Polish society. However, a comprehensive vetting of public figures regarding contacts with the oppressive former communist apparatus has, after delays, been carried out only to a limited extent and with rather inconsequential results. Ever since the fall of communism, the question of vetting (lustracja) has been a bone of contention among political camps that emerged from the former anticommunist opposition. One side – prominently represented by Adam Michnik and his Gazeta Wyborcza, the country's largest daily – calls for a comprehensive reconciliation between former operatives and opponents of the Polish People's Republic by symbolically drawing a \\"thick line\\" (gruba kreska) demarcating the communist period from the present period, without seeking retribution. Opponents of this approach criticize it as too propitiatory and call for a morally rigorous approach, with thorough vetting of all persons in leading positions in politics, business, and the media who were born before 1972. In the vetting controversy, Wildstein has denounced the \\"thick-line\\" proposal and has uncompromisingly advocated for screening, even at the expense of social peace. Wildstein has helped uncover a prominent secret-police informer: Lesław Maleszka, a journalist with the anti-vetting liberal daily, Gazeta Wyborcza, and a former schoolmate and close friend of Wildstein's who had reported on the oppositional Student Solidarity Committee (see above) which he had co- founded with Wildstein. Maleszka has been implicated in the mysterious death of Stanisław Pyjas. = Wildstein's List = In early 2005, the vetting debate reached a peak after Wildstein had abstracted an inventory of the files stored at the Institute for National Remembrance (IPN) which also manages the files of the former secret police, colloquially known as teczki in Polish. The list contained nothing but the names of roughly 240,000 persons on which such a file exists. Wildstein burned this inventory to CD-ROMs and took it to the offices of his employer, the daily Rzeczpospolita, from where he distributed it among colleagues. Soon afterwards, the list was made available on several anonymous websites, which soon attracted a lot of traffic. Until then, access to files for the general public had been restricted. Public debate began when Rzeczpospolita's rival, the anti-vetting Gazeta Wyborcza reported that Wildstein had copied and distributed the inventory. One cause for irritation was the fact that the list contained only names of persons with no information on whether they were informers or victims; not to mention the fact that the practice of totalitarian regimes often renders it difficult or impossible to distinguish collaborators from victims. Also, coincidental identity of names occurs frequently, making the list even more difficult to judge. Wildstein himself claimed to have copied and passed on the list as a tool for investigative journalists. In the meantime it is assumed that he acted with tacit approval or was even actively assisted by at least one IPN employee; an internal inquiry as well as preliminary legal proceedings are underway to investigate the circumstances. While critics claim that Wildstein's disclosure of the list has created a climate of suspicion and irresponsibly endangered social peace, others regard it as a courageous act of civil disobedience. According to them, Wildstein created a fait accompli and thus helped to initiate an overdue review of the past, which had so far been protracted by ex-communist old boys' networks in politics and business and opinion-making relativist intellectuals. On January 31, 2005 - two days after Gazeta Wyborcza had denounced his manoeuvre - Rzeczpospolita's editor-in-chief dismissed him as a salaried employee, although he continues to contribute freelance articles. With this move, the paper apparently tried to distance itself from the radical advocates of lustracja and remove itself from the focus. On February 1, the popular weekly Wprost offered Wildstein a job and declared it would also publish the list if \\"technically possible\\". Also, numerous journalists and public figures, including Józef Glemp, declared their solidarity with Wildstein.

The BDF was established 15 August 1979, and has responsibility for the territorial defence and internal security of the island. The headquarters for the Barbados Defence Force is located at St. Ann's Fort base at The Garrison, Saint Michael. The Barbados Defence Force is headquartered at St. Anns Fort, where the administrative and logistical support for the entire Defence force is made. Organization There are three main components of the BDF: *The Barbados Regiment – This branch is commanded by the Commanding Officer of the Barbados Regiment Lieutenant Colonel Carlos Lovell and is based at St Anns Fort and Paragon Base. This is the main land force component, and encompasses both regular and reserve units. *Barbados Coast Guard – This branch is commanded by the Commanding Officer of the Barbados Coast Guard Commander Mark Peterson and is based at HMBS Pelican. This is the maritime element, with responsibility for patrolling Barbados' territorial waters as well as drug interdiction and humanitarian and life- saving exercises. It too encompasses both regular and reserve units. *Barbados Air Wing – This branch was formed in 1971, it operated 1 Beech Queen Air. In 1981 A Cessna 402C was acquired. Since 1985 all aircraft have been retired and the air wing ceased to exist but the BDF is looking to re-establish an air wing. Identification of Barbados's aircraft =Other formations=Barbados Cadet Corps This branch is commanded by the Commanding Officer of the Barbados Cadet Corps Lieutenant Colonel Errol Brathwaite. This is the military youth organisation of the Defence Force. Includes Infantry and Sea Cadets. This organisation was started in 1904. The first females joined the cadet corps in the 1970s to 1980s. The Cadet Corps has a pledge and also a song. It started with 3 normal units but today has expanded to 22. These units are grouped into zones. There are also a band, sea cadet, and medical units along with a shooting programme. BDF Sports Program The Barbados Defence Force Sports Program is the sporting arm of the BDF, specializing in the recruitment and training of athletes in five sports; football, cricket, table tennis, athletics and boxing. Barbados Legion Similarly to its American, British and Canadian counterparts, the BDF has a voluntary veteran's organization known as the Barbados Legion. It was founded in 1957, nine years prior to independence. Being a registered charity, it receives assistance from the Barbados Poppy League and the national government.https://barbadostoday.bb/2019/07/14/barbados-legion-still-marching- on/https://www.bdfbarbados.com/barbados-legion/ Bands The Zouave Band is the premier musical unit in the BDF. It is also one of two uniformed military bands on the island, with the other being its police band counterpart, the Royal Barbados Police Band. It traces its own history back to the Band of the West India Regiment, which is considered to be the precursor to most Caribbean military bands formerly under British control. As a result, the band also has a shared lineage with the Jamaica Military Band. The BCC maintains a marching band known as the National Cadet Band and performs on national occasions with the BCC and the BDF. It is composed of students from public and private schools in the area. They performs in two modes configurations: a marching band and a concert band. The band of dates back to the early 1920s when the local cadet corps maintained a fife and drum corps. Between 1950 and 2006, individual school units had drum corps which catered to the activities of the unit and school. In 1973, the Combermere Cadet Band was formed and for 22 years it was the only brass and reef cadet band among other secondary schools on the island. Its last performance was at the Independence Day Parade of 1995 when the National Cadet Band was formed. As part of the centennial anniversary celebrations of the BCC in 2004, the Band became a permanent full-time unit, performing at an Independence Day Parade that year and again the following year.https://www.cadets.bdfbarbados.com/band/ Traditions and ceremonyUniform= In 1856, a French Zouave uniform was adopted and was first paraded in Barbados in 1858. It was subsequently adopted by the Barbados Defence Force Band as a symbolic tribute to the old Band of the West India Regiment. The uniform is also worn by the Jamaica Military Band. It consists of a red fez wound together by a white turban and a scarlet sleeveless jacket. It survives as the full dress uniform and is where the band's nickname; the Zouave Band; derives from. It is commonly believed that Queen Victoria saw the uniform worn by the colonial Zouaoua tribe in French Algeria. She was immediately struck with the style of the uniform and the British Army to adopt the uniform for one of its regiments, with the honour being conferred onto the West India Regiment. =Changing of the Sentry= The Changing of the Sentry is an event performed by the BDF that takes place in front of the 1804 Main Guard or Clock Tower. The guardsmen from the BDF are known commonly as The Main Guard. The sentries are drawn by members of the Barbados Legion, other retired personnel, and the Barbados Regiment. During the ceremony, a Corps of Drums provides musical accompaniment.

The line branches off from the Dovre Line at Hamar Station and runs a more easterly route to Støren Station, where the two lines meet again. The Røros Line also intersects with the Solør Line at Elverum Station. The single track, standard gauge line lacks electrification and only has centralized traffic control south of Røros Station. The Norwegian State Railways (Vy) operate regional passenger trains. In addition the line is used by freight trains hauling lumber and wood chippings. The first parts of the line was the Hamar–Grundset Line and the Trondhjem–Støren Line, which opened on 23 June 1862 and 5 August 1964, respectively. To save costs, the lines were built with narrow gauge, thus making it the first locomotive-hauled line in the world. The Grundset–Aamot Line extension to Rena Station was opened on 19 October 1871. The connecting line onwards to Støren opened on 13 October 1877. The 1880 completion of the Dovre Line to Hamar allowed a continuous train service linking Oslo and Trondheim, albeit with a break-of-gauge in Hamar. The line remained the main north–south link in Norway until the 1921 completion of the Dovre Line. Since then, the Røros Line has been relegated to regional passenger and freight trains, losing most of the through traffic. Gauge conversion started with dual gauge on parts of the line in 1917. South of Koppang Station standard gauge was taken into use from 1931, north of there from 1941. There are plans to electrify and install European Train Control System during the early 2020s, which would allow the Røros Line to act as a reserve for the Dovre Line. Route The site of the now closed Roset Station The Røros Line runs between Støren Station and Hamar Station, both located on the Dovre Line. The line runs through the district of Gauldalen in the county of Sør-Trøndelag from Støren to Røros before crossing the border to the county of Hedmark. It continues southwards through the district and valley of Østerdalen until Elverum, after which is crosses over to the district of Hedmarken. Through Gauldalen the line largely follows the river Gaula, a section which is hilly with many curves and limited speed. Through Østerdalen the landscape is more level, allowing for a straighter and faster line. Until Elverum the line largely follows the river Glomma. The Røros Line branches off from the Dovre Line at Hamar Station, situated from Oslo Central Station at an elevation of . At Elverum Station, from Hamar, the line intersects with the Solør Line.Bjerke & Holom: 100 The Røros Line reaches its highest elevation, of , is located just north of the closed Harborg Station in Røros.Bjerke & Holom: 106 Støren Station is situated from Oslo, at an elevation of .Bjerke & Holom: 108 The Røros Line has limited capacity compared to other longer lines in Norway due to few and short passing loops.The line has single track and standard gauge, but is not electrified. It has a simplified centralized traffic control and automatic train control between Hamar and Røros, but lacks this north of the latter. It is equipped with GSM-R train radio. The railway line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. HistoryTrondhjem–Støren and Hamar–Grundset= Støren Station during the 1880s Following the successful construction of the Trunk Line from Oslo and Eidsvoll in 1854, proposals were made for other projects, even a line to connect the capital with Trondheim. The start of the Røros Line would, however, be tied to two smaller railway projects which instead would serve regional needs. Both had their basis in the need for hauling lumber along difficult terrain. After local initiatives, the Ministry of the Interior gave Carl Abraham Pihl the task of preliminary surveys of two routes. In Sør- Trøndelag a route from Trondheim to Støren was considered,Bjerke & Stenersen: 15 while in Hedmark the a route was proposed which would link Østerdalen to Hamar, where cargo and passengers could be transshipped and freighted by ship down the lake of Mjøsa to Eidsvoll.Bjerke & Stenersen: 16 These two lines were planned by the ministry along with the Kongsvinger Line. The Trunk Line had been built by and was owned by an English company, and the government was not satisfied with the private arrangement. They therefore recommended that the three lines be built as state railways. The government would borrow money, build and operate the lines, covering any deficits. However, local municipalities, counties and private individuals and companies were required to participate in the funding through the issuing of shares in the individual lines. This model of financing would remain for decades. Parliament approved the three lines on 3 September 1857.Bjerke & Holom: 98 The original Ilseng Station is on display at the Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar In order to cut costs, Pihl recommended that the line be built using narrow gauge. This would allow for smaller curve radii and cheaper construction. A major drawback was that the lines would not be compatible with Swedish lines and the Trunk Line. Aiding in his cause, it was at the time not believed that the lines would ever connect, as lakes and rivers were seen as complementary to railways. Pihl opted for the 1067 mm gauge, for which the Hamar–Grundset Line became the first locomotive-hauled system. It would soon become the most used narrow gauge in the world.Bjerke & Stenersen: 10 Originally the Hamar Line was approved to Elverum, with a terminus on the east side of Glomma. A group of forest owners petitioned that a branch be built on the west shore in order to negotiate a difficult part of the river. A channel was initially proposed and would have been slightly cheaper, but on 7 October 1859 Parliament approved that the line be extended to Grundset and that Elverum Station would be placed on the west shore. Construction began in September 1858.Bjerke & Stenersen: 17 Groundwork had progressed sufficiently that the first of tracks were laid in 1860. Two locomotives were delivered in August and could aid in construction. The following year the stations were built and the telegraph service from Hamar to Elverum opened on 1 March.Bjerke & Stenersen: 18 The line initially received 18 kilograms per meter (37 lb/ft) rails. Revenue service from Hamar to Løten commenced on 1 July. By 3 September trains were running to Midtskog, by 22 October to Elverum and by 4 November 1861.Bjerke & Stenersen: 19 The official opening took place on 23 June 1862.Bjerke & Stenersen: 21 Detailed surveying of the Trondhjem–Støren Line started in September 1858. Groundwork started in August 1859, initially near Trondheim were the plans were clear. Work on the three southerly sections commenced the following year, after the routes had been finalized.Bjerke & Stenersen: 23 By 1861 the number of construction workers had risen to 900.Bjerke & Stenersen: 24 The most challenging part was between Lundamo and Hovin, where the route had to be cut into hilly terrain. Compared to other contemporary Norwegian railways, the line had many large bridges, built of wood.Bjerke & Stenersen: 26 There were several fatal accidents during the work. The first two locomotives were delivered in 1862, allowing ballast to be hauled by rail.Bjerke & Stenersen: 25 Construction ended at 2.86 million kroner, just under budget.Bjerke & Stenersen: 31 The first revenue freight train ran on 23 January 1864.Bjerke & Stenersen: 27 Revenue passenger trains started running on 1 April. The line initially received three locomotives, sixty freight cars and ten passenger cars.Bjerke & Stenersen: 29 The official opening took place on 5 August.Bjerke & Stenersen: 30 =Construction Grundset–Støren= The line through Tynset sometime between 1907 and 1912 Proposals for an extension from Grundset to Åmot was made in 1864, which would allow the railway to connect to the steamships operating on Storsjøen, by placing the end station at Rena where the river Renaelva empties into Glomma.Østvedt: 237 This part of the line was less controversial than later parts and was approved by Parliament with 80 against 21 votes.Østvedt: 239 The segment was initially named the Grundset–Aamot Line. Construction started soon after the parliamentary decision and was easy due to the flat valley the line was built through. Grundset Station was dismantled and the station building moved to Rena Station, the new terminus.Bjerke & Stenersen: 36 The depot and turntable were moved to Elverum Station, which received an upgrade. The line was operational in September 1871 and officially opened on 19 October.Bjerke & Stenersen: 37 Proposals for a railway connecting Støren and Røros were proposed by the Governor of Sør-Trøndelag in 1864. The government approved preliminary surveys the following year. These included extensions southwards through Østerdalen. There were two route proposals—one running via Røros and one via Kvikne.Bjerke & Stenersen: 33 The latter would have lower peak altitude and would be shorter. However, it would involve a branch line from Tynset to Røros.Bjerke & Stenersen: 35 The Kvikne and Røros alternatives were part of the discussion to the very end. Parliament approved the line via Røros with 67 against 44 votes on 3 May 1872. The gauge may have changed, but the original Alvdal Station still stands—with an annex. Construction between Rena and Støren commenced during the fall of 1872, and by the following summer of 1873 there were 900 people working on the line. the most demanding part was through Ålen where a large amount of blasting was needed. A challenge was that during the fall harvest many people returned to the farms, with only half the men left for construction work. By March 1874 the workforce peaked at 2,100 men. That year there was a short strike, following demands for higher wages, which had been set at 1.75 kroner per day.Bjerke & Stenersen: 39 Construction problems were the most severe in Gauldalen and Drøyliene; at the latter the Tamlaget Tunnel had to be built. Another challenge was the reliable sourcing of lumber; forest owners were often not willing to sign contracts and the railway often had to cut its own timber.Bjerke & Stenersen: 41 The section from Rena to Koppang was taken into use on 14 December 1875. It was followed by the section from Støren to Singsås on 4 January 1876, although temporary freight traffic had been conducted since 12 February 1875. Temporary traffic between Trondheim and Røros commenced on 17 November 1876 and was taken into ordinary use on 16 January 1877, following the completion of the from Singsås to Røros. Regular service on the final segment, the from Røros to Koppang, commenced on 17 October. The official opening of the entire line between Rena and Støren took place on 13 October. =Narrow-gauge operations= Glåmos Station has been listed as a heritage site. Operations on the Hamar Line initially consisted of a single daily round trip, increasing to two on weekdays from 1867.Bjerke & Stenersen: 53 The cargo load was asymmetrical, with five times as much being freighted westwards as eastwards.Bjerke & Stenersen: 54 The railway initially had three locomotives.Bjerke & Stenersen: 55 Also between Trondheim and Støren there was initially only a single daily round trip, increasing to two from 1870.Bjerke & Stenersen: 59 Traffic was above prognosis, soon resulting in the ordering of additional rolling stock.Bjerke & Stenersen: 58 There was more than twice as much cargo heading southwards as northwards. A daily through train between Hamar and Trondheim was introduced with the opening of the line in 1877. It connected with a morning train and steamship departure from Oslo, and required an overnight stay in Koppang. The train stopped the following day at Røros for dinner, with arrival in Trondheim that evening.Bjerke & Stenersen: 73 Parliament approved the first stage of the Dovre Line in 1875, opening between Eidsvoll and Hamar on 8 November 1880.Bjerke & Holom: 74 This allowed a significant cut in travel time and from 1881 direct services were introduced, with travel times from Oslo to Trondheim at 24 hours and 15 minutes. At first this ran only during the summer, but from 1885 it ran all year. The cheaper trains with an overnight in Koppang continued to be run.Bjerke & Stenersen: 75 A section through Holtålen in 1877 The Meråker Line from Trondheim to Sweden opened in 1882. Built with standard gauge, it received a new station at Brattøra. The old station at Kalvskinnet and the section of track from there to Selsbakk was thereby closed and replaced with a new line to the new, common station. The Selsbakk Line opened on 24 June 1884.Bjerke & Stenersen: 63 Herring and other fish produce was sent to Eastern Norway from 1888, and increased dramatically throughout the 1890s. Toll barriers on exports to Sweden from 1897 shifted farm produce to be sent from Trøndelag to Eastern Norway.Bjerke & Stenersen: 85 Hurtigruten started as a coastal steamer service on 2 July 1893, connecting Trondheim to Tromsø in 34. By sailing during the night it was possible to reduce travel time down from four to five days. The ships corresponded with the express trains in Trondheim. The timing was not well-suited for local passengers, and from 1899 NSB operated an extra express train which corresponded with Hurtigruten.Bjerke & Stenersen: 79 NSB started local transport from Trondheim to Selsbakk and Heimdal during the summers from 15 May 1907.Bjerke & Stenersen: 87 =Gauge conversion= Elverum Station in 1913. The narrow-gauge train is using the narrow-gauge tracks to the left, while a standard-gauge train is waiting on the other tracks. Hamar Station developed into a major center for transshipment of goods between narrow and standard gauge rolling stock. By 1912 there was 91,725 tonnes of cargo which was transshipped, all of it for hand. The cost and time restraints on this caused proposals for the Røros Line to receive gauge conversion, mentioned for the first time in parliamentary discussions in 1890.Bjerke & Stenersen: 99 The 1898 decision to build the Bergen Line in standard gauge marked the end of narrow gauge as an acceptable standard.Bjerke & Stenersen: 12 The Solør Line opened in 1910, connecting to the Røros Line at Elverum, resulting in both Hamar, Elverum and Trondheim having split two-gauge stations and major transshipment operations. The first plans for conversion were developed in 1903 and eight years later the first money grants were issued.Bjerke & Stenersen: 100 The first step was establishing dual gauge from Hamar to Elverum. Work commenced in 1914 and involved elevating the track at places and moving buildings further from the line. Elverum received a new station facility in 1913.Bjerke & Stenersen: 101 The work between Hamar and Elverum was delayed and instead the section from Elverum to Rena opened with dual gauge first, on 7 November 1917.Bjerke & Stenersen: 105 The dual gauge was completed to Hamar on 29 November 1919. The conversion cost 1.4 million kroner, but would save NSB about 400,000 kroner per year. Twenty freight cars would be freed up. Passenger trains operating between Hamar and Elverum were standard gauge, while narrow gauge was used for through trains.Bjerke & Stenersen: 106 Standard gauge trains, and not just freight cars, could operate to Rena from 1926.Bjerke & Stenersen: 107 Class 26c standard-gauge steam locomotive at Hamar Station The standard gauge line from Oslo to Hamar was extended to Otta by 1896. Parliament approved the Dovre Line in 1908, which would see this line extended across Dovrefjell to Støren and onward to Trondheim. The Dovre Line would become the new main train line from Oslo to Trondheim and relegating the Røros Line to a secondary service. Meeting in Støren, the Trondhjem–Støren Line would therefore need to be upgraded to meet the higher standard. This involved a major upgrade to Trondheim Central Station, and installing dual gauge to Støren.Bjerke & Stenersen: 109 The latter was taken into use on 3 September 1919 and remained in place to 14 September 1921, after which it only had standard gauge operations. The section became part of the Dovre Line with its opening on 17 September.Bjerke & Stenersen: 121 Traffic on the line peaked in the financial year 1919–20, when the line transported 1,739,262 passengers, and in 1917–18 when 655,102 tonnes of cargo were hauled. The Røros Line was relegated with all through traffic being sent via Dovre from 1921. The line received a through service, which corresponded with express trains on the Dovre LineBjerke & Stenersen: 122 From 1928 Cmb Class 1 gasoline railcars were introduced on the line. This allowed a new kind of service, where the railcars would call at small halt established at road intersections. Between 1928 and 1931 there were built 26 such stops between Tynset and Støren.Bjerke & Stenersen: 124 Train at Røros Station during the winter of 1949 By the 1920s it seem evident that the three remaining narrow-gauge mainlines, the Røros, Vestfold and Jæren Lines would be gauge converted. Røros Copper Works shut down production in 1926, citing high transport costs caused by transshipment at Støren as one reason.Bjerke & Stenersen: 135 The next stage of gauge conversion took place in 1931, when the section between Rena and Koppang, which opened on 7 October. By November the dual gauge between Rena and Hamar had been removed.Bjerke & Stenersen: 127 A unison Parliament passed legislation on 3 June 1935 to gauge convert the line. The upgrade was planned to reduce the minimum curve radius to . Four new tunnels were planned to bypass otherwise narrow sections, but in the end only the Drøyli Tunnel was built. The other major works was to replace the branch line which Røros Station was built on with a semi-circular loop through the town. Following the German occupation in April 1940, work on converting the remaining of the line was accelerated.Bjerke & Stenersen: 138 A major flood in Gaula started on 24 August that year, washing away parts of the line several places through Gauldalen and station at Rognes was washed away.Bjerke & Stenersen: 139 The line was improved and placed on a new right-of-way several places.Bjerke & Stenersen: 142 By May 1941 there were 1,723 men working on the line improvements.Bjerke & Stenersen: 144 The conversion itself took place two stations at a time, an dwas completed on 3 August.Bjerke & Stenersen: 145 The river took away part of the line past Rognes Station in 1940 =Standard-gauge operations= Throughout the Second World War the services on the line remained limited. A through express train was not reintroduced until 3 October 1949. By the following year travel time had been reduced to 15 hours between Oslo and Trondheim, following the many infrastructure improvements.Bjerke & Stenersen: 151 The line was gradually modernized after the war. From the 1950s many of the older bridges were replaced or modernized.Bjerke & Stenersen: 170 New 35 kilogram per meter (70 lb/ft) rails were gradually installed, allowing an axle load of 16 tonnes from 1964. Many passing loops were lengthened to the norm of .Bjerke & Stenersen: 169 Simplified interlocking systems started being installed at stations from 1959.Bjerke & Stenersen: 171 Steam locomotives were from 1951 partially replaced with Class 86 diesel multiple units, cutting travel time from Hamar to Røros to six hours.Bjerke & Stenersen: 155 The remaining locomotive-hauled trains received the stronger Class 26c engines from 1956. Several weak points on the line were upgraded in 1964, allowing the even stronger Class 30 and 31 trains to be used, as well as Di 3 diesel locomotives.Bjerke & Stenersen: 156 Regular use of Di 3s started on 30 May 1965, coinciding with the reintroduction of night trains on the line, running all the way from Oslo to Trondheim.Bjerke & Stenersen: 159 The express trains were from 22 May 1966 until 31 October 1970 operated with Class 88 diesel multiple units.Bjerke & Stenersen: 160 The last revenue service with steam locomotives ran on 5 July 1968. Southbound NSB Class 92 just before Atna Station Cargo handling was reorganized in 1973, after which fewer stations handled cargo and more was transported the last kilometers by truck through Linjegods. Lumber became an increasingly important cargo from that decade, when the log floating was terminated.Bjerke & Stenersen: 161 Throughout the 1970s and 1970s many stations became unmanned.Bjerke & Stenersen: 162 NSB introduced their Class 92 diesel multiple units in 1984. Combined with the closing of many smaller halts, they allowed travel time between Hamar and Røros to be cut by an hour. From 1 June 1986 all local trains running between Hamar and Elverum were terminated. Class 86 remained in irregular service until 1996. In a deal to retain passenger traffic on the Solør Line, the day and night expresses to Oslo were run via Kongsvinger instead of Hamar, until 1989 for the day trains and 1991 for the night trains. General freight trains north of Koppang were terminated from 1995. Bjerke & Stenersen: 163 The freight service was gradually reduced and from 2002 no wagon-load cargo trains were being operated on the line. Bjerke & Stenersen: 164 Complete interlocking systems were installed at the larger stations between 1989 and 1993. A simplified centralized traffic control was installed between 1990 and 1994 between Hamar and Røros, operated from the central in Hamar. Unlike most other lines, this did not include automatic train stop (ATS). The rails were replaced during the 1990s with one of 49 kg/m (98 lb/ft),Bjerke & Stenersen: 172 allowing an axle load of 22.5 tonnes.Bjerke & Stenersen: 173 The Åsta Accident on 4 January 2000 killed 16 people when two trains collided head-on, making it the deadliest train accident in Norway since 1975. Insufficient procedures combined with the lack of ATS was found to be a contributing cause of the accident.Bjerke & Stenersen: 174 This caused ATS to be installed and operational on the line from 30 June 2001. Class 93 diesel multiple unit at Hamar Station. These have been used on the Røros Line since their introduction in 2000 Operations As the Røros Line lacks electrification, all trains operating on the line use diesel traction. This means that both express passenger and freight trains between Oslo and Trondheim use the Dovre Line. The main use of the Røros Line are regional passenger trains, operated using Class 92 and Class 93 diesel multiple units operated by the Norwegian State Railways. As of 2015 there are two through trains which run from Trondheim to Hamar, with a travel time of 6 hours. There is one additional train which runs once between Trondheim and Røros, taking 2 hours and 30 minutes, and four trains which run between Røros and Hamar, taking 3 hours and 20 minutes. Large parts of the day there are therefore a two-hour headway between Hamar and Røros. The density of forest in Hedmark along both the Solør and Røros Lines is among the most productive in the country, and these lines see an unprecedented amount of lumber trains compared to elsewhere in the country.Gillebo & Lein: 23 Most cargo traffic on the line are lumber trains. These operate out of lumber terminals at Auma, Koppang, Hovdmoen and Vestmoen. Most of this traffic operates southwards, continuing onward along the Solør Line to Sweden. In 2015 there were about 40 lumber trains per week. Train operators include Hector Rail, TX Logistik and Tågåkeriet i Bergslagen. The largest customer is Stora Enso, which mostly imports the lumber for use at its plant in Karlstad, Sweden. Lesser quantities are transported to Gävle and Sundsvall. There is also one train per week with northbound to Norske Skog Skogn.Civita: 14 In addition, there are some smaller freight trains which run from Hamar to Elverum, about ten per week. Due to the lack of electrification, no intermodal and container trains operate along the Røros Line. Architecture Trondhjem Kalvskinnet Station now serves as Trondheim Synagogue The stations between Hamar and Grundset, and Trondheim and Støre were designed by Georg Andreas Bull as his railway-architectural debut. They were designed in Swiss chalet style, all in wood.Hartmann: 29 Compared to the contemporary Trunk and Kongsvinger Lines, the narrow gauge railways were to be low-cost projects, which included scaling down the size of stations. The stations in the south were somewhat more decorated. On the northern line the stations were made even smaller.Hartmann: 48 Few of these stations remain. Hamar received a new station designed by Balthazar Lange in 1880, and again by Paul Due in histroiricism in 1897.Hartmann: 116 The only original stone station was Throndhjem Kalvskinnet. Elverum Station is also in stone, but with a less marked style than many other of Due's stations.Hartmann: 151 Tynset Station stands in contrast with the postmodern town hall. Between Grundset and Støren the spending on stations increased, as it became evident that the railway would be connecting two regions together. Stations were designed both by Bull and Peter Andreas Blix. The architecture drew more from national inspiration, with Bull creating simple, often rectangular structures and Blix designing more creative stations. The line had relatively many small guard houses, although few of these have been preserved. On the other hand, few of the station buildings were expanded and are therefore largely intact from the time of construction. Five stations were replaced between 1935 and 1964 due to fires or other causes.Hartmann: 128 Future A chilly start for a NSB Class 92 at Røros Station on 2 January 2013. Two major developments have been proposed for the Røros Line – electrification and installation of centralized traffic control. The latter is scheduled to take place as part of nationwide implementation of European Train Control System, which is scheduled to be completed within 2021. The National Rail Administration is considering the possibilities of electrifying the Røros Line along with all its other diesel lines. If a go-head were given, it would probably be in conjunction with the electrification of the Solør Line. A 2015 report recommended that the Røros and Solør Lines be given priority after the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer and the Meråker Line, but before the rest of the Nordland Line and the Rauma Line. The primary impact of electrification would be a severe cut in operating costs of the railway companies, and thus better margins for forest owners, who could increase their export. A secondary impact would allow the Rorøs Line to also handle intermodule transport. Cargo trains could run directly from Gothenburg to Trondheim, via the Norway/Vänern, Värmland, Solør and Røros Lines, bypassing the congested cargo lines through Oslo. Intermodule cargo trains operate from Oslo to Trondheim via the Dovre Line, despite its higher elevation, because of the electric traction. If the Solør and Røros Lines were electrified, they could act as a reserve for the Dovre Line. This is not a possibility today because the train companies lack diesel locomotives. Further traffic increase could be handled through operating northbound trains along the Solør/Røros Line and southbound via the Dovre Line.Civitas: 20–22 ReferencesBibliography   Category:Railway lines in Innlandet Category:Railway lines in Trøndelag Category:Railway lines opened in 1862 Category:Railway lines opened in 1877 Category:1862 establishments in Norway Category:1877 establishments in Norway ","title":"Røros Line"},{"id":"1613270","text":"Qualification for the 2004 African Cup of Nations.

It is co-owned by six Class I railroads -- BNSF Railway, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway (the BRC's north-south main line's northern terminus is, like the Indiana Harbor Belt, the Milwaukee District West Line in Chicago's Cragin neighborhood) CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad -- each of which uses the switching and interchange facilities of the BRC. Owner lines and other railroads bring their trains to the Belt Railway to be separated, classified, and re-blocked into new trains for departure. The BRC also provides rail terminal services to approximately 100 local manufacturing industries. The company employs about 440 people, including its own police force and fire department. Its president is currently Michael J. Grace. BRC trackage The BRC has 28 miles (45 km) of mainline route with interchanges to each of its owner railroads, and over 300 miles (500 km) of switching tracks. The vast majority of the latter are located in the Clearing Yard. Clearing Yard Looking toward the west yard of clearing yard, 1943. The Clearing Yard, located on the boundary between Chicago and Bedford Park, Illinois, just south of Chicago Midway International Airport, is one of the largest hump classification facilities in the United States. Some 5.5 miles in length and covering 786 acres (3.2 km²), the yard supports more than 250 miles (400 km) of track. It has six main subdivisions; one arrival, classification, and departure yard in the eastbound and westbound directions. At the heart of the yard is the wicket-shaped tower which straddles the hump and from which are controlled the switches and retarders of both east- and westbound classification yards to either side of it. Using computer controls, the hump tower efficiently dispatches more than 8,400 rail cars per day. Operating around the clock, employees are able to classify between 40 and 50 miles of consists daily.  Locomotives  The BRC was noted for a fleet of Alco-built locomotives, even though Alco did not build locomotives in the United States after 1970. Specifically, the BRC owned six 2400HP C424's numbered 600-605. All six locomotives were removed from BRC's roster and sold. 600 and 601 have been scrapped. BRC currently operates rebuilt Electro-Motive Diesel locomotives, such as the SD38, SD40, GP38, and 1500-series switchers. As is popular in large hump yards, slugs are used in Clearing Yard to shove the hump.  Awards and recognition  The Belt Railway Company of Chicago has been honored several times with E. H. Harriman Awards, in the switching and terminal railways category, for employee safety, including a gold award for 1999.

Peabody and Stearns also designed various additions to the mansion in the several following years, probably in 1906. After George Lauder Carnegie died, his widow, Margaret Copley Thaw, remarried and moved to Africa. Most of the original furnishings were sold, and furniture from Dungeness was brought in to furnish the house.

Uekusa joined Nomura Research Institute in April 1983 after graduating from University of Tokyo in March 1983. He obtained positions as a researcher of Fiscal and Monetary Policy Institute at the Ministry of Finance in July 1985, an assistant professor at the Economic Research Institute at Kyoto University in June 1991, an honorary fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in October 1993, a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute in April 2002, and became a professor at the graduate school in Waseda University from April 2003, until he was dismissed in April 2004. Afterwards, he established the Three-Nations Research Institute, and became a chairman of the company on April 1, 2005. In April 2006, he made a career comeback in an academic position as a visiting professor at Nagoya University of Commerce & Business graduate school in Nagoya.

Immediately after the arrest, Uekusa admitted his guilt, and he apologized. He was dismissed from being a professor on May 7, 2004 because of the arrest, despite denying the charges. His trial opened at the Tokyo District Court on March 23, 2005, and the Chief Justice fined him 500,000 yen and confiscated his hand mirror. He insisted that it was an \\"unfair judgement\\" and intended to appeal. The ruling was established however as he did not make the appeal by the deadline on April 6, 2005. Uekusa was arrested again at Keikyū Kamata Station for molesting a girl in a Keikyu train on September 13, 2006, at around 10:10 p.m. On September 27, 2006, Nagoya University of Commerce & Business announced that they had dismissed him from his duties as a visiting professor. Uekusa claimed to be innocent, saying that he was drunk when he was arrested, so he does not remember what happened that night. He was indicted for chikan on October 4, 2006. On January 22, 2007, Uekusa was released from the Tokyo Detention Center on bail of 6 million yen. On October 16, 2007, Uekusa was sentenced to four months in prison by Presiding Judge Sho Kamisaka of the Tokyo District Court. He repeated his earlier denials, but fabric traces on his suit in addition to witness testimony were enough to convince the court that he had groped under the victim's skirt. In handing down the sentence, Kamisaka noted that \\"The court cannot anticipate that the accused will be rehabilitated\\" on his own recognizance. Uekusa vowed to appeal, in a statement saying \\"the truth will always prevail.\\" On April 16, 2008, The Tokyo High Court upheld a four-month prison term for Uekusa. On June 25, 2009, The Supreme Court turned down Uekusa's final appeal.

It is an allocation of shares in a public company not through a public offering in a stock exchange. PIPE deals are part of the primary market. In the U.S., a PIPE offering may be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a registration statement or may be completed as an unregistered private placement. PIPE market The attractiveness of PIPE transactions has waxed and waned since the late 1990s. For private equity investors, PIPEs tend to become increasingly attractive in markets where control investments are harder to execute. Generally, companies are forced to pursue PIPEs when capital markets are unwilling to provide financing and traditional equity market alternatives do not exist for that particular issuer. According to market research in the US, 980 transactions have closed totaling $88.3 billion in gross proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2008, putting the market on pace for yet another record year.”PlacementTracker Publishes PIPE Market League Tables. This compares with 1,106 such deals in 2000, raising $24.3 billion and 1,301 PIPE deals in the U.S. raising a total of $20 billion in 2005. In recent years, top Wall Street investment banks have become increasingly involved in the PIPE market as placement agents. Through the acceleration of the credit crisis in September 2008, PIPE transactions provided quick access to capital at a reasonable transaction cost for companies that might otherwise have been unable to access the public equity markets. Recently, many hedge funds have turned away from investing into restricted illiquid investments. Some investors, including Warren Buffett found PIPEs attractive because they could purchase shares or equity-linked securities at a discount to the public market price and because it had provided an investor the opportunity to acquire a sizable position at a fixed or variable price rather than pushing the price of a stock higher through its own open market purchases. Existing investors tend to have mixed reactions to PIPE offerings as the PIPE is often highly dilutive and destructive to the existing shareholder base. Depending upon the terms of the transaction, a PIPE may dilute existing shareholders' equity ownership, particularly if the seller has agreed to provide the investors with downside protections against market price declines (a death spiral), which can lead to issuance of more shares to the PIPE investors for no more money. The SEC has pursued certain PIPE investments (primarily involving hedge-funds) as violating U.S. federal securities laws. The controversy has largely involved hedge funds that use PIPE securities to cover shares that the fund shorted in anticipation of the PIPE offering. In these instances, the SEC has shown that the fund knew about the upcoming offering (in which it would be involved) prior to shorting shares.SEC v. Langley Partners, L.P., et al., Civil Action No. 1:06CV00467 (JDB) (D.D.C.) PIPEs and mergers and acquisitions Many reverse mergers are accompanied by a simultaneous PIPE transaction, which is typically undertaken by smaller public companies. Shares are sold at a slight discount to the public market price, and the company typically agrees to use its best efforts to register the resale of those same securities for the benefit of the purchaser. Regulation The regulatory environment in certain countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom are accommodating for PIPE transactions, however in certain areas there are stated preferences for rights issues, which allow existing shareholders an opportunity to invest before the company seeks outside capital. In these jurisdictions, once a company has completed a rights offering, it may pursue a PIPE transaction.

Its main tasks are the defence of Barbados from external threats, internal security and assisting the local police in maintaining law and order. The regiment also provides Barbados' contribution to international peacekeeping and other missions. In its present form, the regiment was formed in 1979 along with the BDF, replacing the old Barbados Regiment. The Barbados Regiment is affiliated to the Royal Anglian Regiment. History The Barbados RegimentHartland, Major Michael. A Concise & Illustrated Military History of Barbados 1627–2007. Edgehill, St. Thomas, Barbados: Miller Publishing Company, 2007 (.) was founded in 1902 as the Barbados Volunteer Force, a volunteer unit raised to provide for the local defense of the island following the withdrawal of the British garrison. Soldiers of the BVF were involved in both the First and Second World Wars as part of both the South Caribbean Force and the Caribbean Regiment. In 1948, the BVF was re-established and renamed the Barbados Regiment. The regiment received its first stand of colours in 1953. These colours were later changed after the country gained Independence. Between 1959 and 1962, Barbados was part of the Federation of the West Indies, and thus contributed to the 3rd Battalion, West India Regiment. On the break- up of the Federation, Barbados regained its independence and saw the Barbados Regiment returned to service. Although the regiment's primary role is to defend Barbados, it also provides the country's commitment to UN peacekeeping forces, predominantly in the Caribbean region. The regiment also participated, along with the Jamaica Regiment and the Rifle Company, Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, in the United States-led invasion of Grenada in 1983. Current organization The Barbados Regiment is stationed as part of the BDF headquarters at The Garrison. The regiment today is divided into regular and reserve forces, essentially making up two 'battalions', though they are not described as such: =Regular= The regular force consists of three companies: *Headquarters Company: This provides the logistic and administrative support for the entire regiment. *Technical Support Company: This provides the engineering and mechanical support. *Special Operations Company: This is the main fighting unit. Its primary task is to provide a quick reaction force, but it also works closely with both the Royal Barbados Police Force, and the Maritime arm, The Barbados Coast Guard, in anti-drug missions. =Reserve= It is the reserve element of the BDF that maintains the traditions of the old Barbados Regiment, and is responsible for the regiment's colours. The reserve element also consists of three companies: *Headquarters Company (which includes the Band of the Barbados Regiment) *2 Rifle Companies *Coast Guard Reserve =Air Wing= * Fairchild C-26 Metroliner (2) * Beechcraft King Air (1) * Cessna 402C (1) Colours The Regimental Colour of the Barbados Regiment is carried on all ceremonial parades while the Queen’s Colour is carried only when a guard is mounted by the Queen of Barbados, the Barbadian Royal Family and the Governor General of Barbados. Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood presented the regiment with its first stand of Colours on 23 February 1953. The Queen’s Colour was paraded in a Trooping of the Colour for the first time on 19 February 1975 in the presence of the Queen. It was also trooped on 21 November 1987 to mark the 21st anniversary of Barbadian Independence and on 4 June 2012 during the parade in honor of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.https://www.bdfbarbados.com/the-colours/ Equipment * M16 rifle * Lee–Enfield No 4 Mk I – used by cadets as Drill purpose rifle * Landrover * Sterling submachine gun * FN MAG 7.62mm General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) * Bren light machine gun Alliances * – The Royal Anglian Regiment See also *The Jamaica Regiment *West India Regiment  References  Category:Military of Barbados Category:Regiments of Caribbean nations Category:Military units and formations established in 1902 Category:British colonial regiments Category:Military units and formations of Barbados in World War II ","title":"Barbados Regiment"},{"id":"1613314","text":"A rights issue or rights offer is a dividend of subscription rights to buy additional securities in a company made to the company's existing security holders. When the rights are for equity securities, such as shares, in a public company, it is a non-dilutive(can be dilutive) pro rata way to raise capital. Rights issues are typically sold via a prospectus or prospectus supplement. With the issued rights, existing security-holders have the privilege to buy a specified number of new securities from the issuer at a specified price within a subscription period. In a public company, a rights issue is a form of public offering (different from most other types of public offering, where shares are issued to the general public). Sometimes Right issue can give privileges to people like director, employees those are having some ownership in company to buy the issues. Rights issues may be particularly useful for all publicly traded companies as opposed to other more dilutive financing options. As equity issues are generally preferable to debt issues from the company's viewpoint, companies usually opt for a rights issue in order to minimize dilution and maximize the useful life of tax loss carryforwards. Since in a rights offering there is no change of control and a \\"no-sale theory\\" applies, companies are able to preserve tax loss carry- forwards better than via either follow-on offerings or other more dilutive financings. It's one of the types in modes of issue of securities both in public and private companies. How it works A rights issue is directly distributed as a tax free dividend to all shareholders of record or through broker dealers of record and may be exercised in full or partially. Subscription rights may be transferable, allowing the subscription- rightsholder to sell them on the open market. A rights issue to shareholders is generally made as a tax-free dividend on a ratio basis (e.g. a dividend of three subscription rights for two shares of common stock issued and outstanding). Because the company receives shareholders' money in exchange for shares, a rights issue is a source of capital. =Considerations= In rights issue, the financial manager has to consider: *Engaging a dealer-manager or broker-dealer to manage the offering process *Selling group and broker-dealer participation *Subscription price per new share *Number of new shares to be sold *The value of rights vs. trading price of the subscription rights *The effect of rights on the value of the current share *The effect of rights to shareholders of record and new shareholders and rightsholders =Underwriting= Rights issues may be underwritten. The role of the underwriter is to guarantee that the funds sought by the company will be raised. The agreement between the underwriter and the company is set out in a formal underwriting agreement. Typical terms of an underwriting require the underwriter to subscribe for any shares offered but not taken up by shareholders. The underwriting agreement will normally enable the underwriter to terminate its obligations in defined circumstances. A sub-underwriter in turn sub-underwrites some or all of the obligations of the main underwriter; the underwriter passes its risk to the sub-underwriter by requiring the sub- underwriter to subscribe for or purchase a portion of the shares for which the underwriter is obliged to subscribe in the event of a shortfall. Underwriters and sub-underwriters may be financial institutions, stock-brokers, major shareholders of the company or other related or unrelated parties. =Over‐subscription privilege= Some rights issues include an \\"over‐subscription privilege\\", allowing investors to buy additional shares beyond the number offered with the basic subscription privilege, if those additional shares are available. Typically the number of over‐subscription shares that can be purchased by an investor is capped as no more than the amount of his/her basic subscription. If not all the over-subscription rights can be filled, they will be partially filled on a pro rata basis. Basic example An investor: Mr. A had 100 shares of company X at a total investment of $40,000, assuming that he purchased the shares at $400 per share and that the stock price did not change between the purchase date and the date at which the rights were issued. Assuming a 1:1 subscription rights issue at an offer price of $200, Mr. A will be notified by a broker-dealer that he has the option to subscribe for an additional 100 shares of common stock of the company at the offer price. Now, if he exercises his option, he would have to pay an additional $20,000 in order to acquire the shares, thus effectively bringing his average cost of acquisition for the 200 shares to $300 per share ((40,000+20,000)/200=300). Although the price on the stock markets should reflect a new price of $300 (see below), the investor is actually not making any profit nor any loss. In many cases, the stock purchase right (which acts as an option) can be traded at an exchange. In this example, the price of the right would adjust itself to $100 (ideally). The company: Company X has 100 million outstanding shares. The share price currently quoted on the stock exchanges is $400 thus the market capitalization of the stock would be $40 billion (outstanding shares times share price). If all the shareholders of the company choose to exercise their stock option, the company's outstanding shares would increase by 100 million. The market capitalization of the stock would increase to $60 billion (previous market capitalization + cash received from owners of rights converting their rights to shares), implying a share price of $300 ($60 billion / 200 million shares). If the company were to do nothing with the raised money, its earnings per share (EPS) would be reduced by half. However, if the equity raised by the company is reinvested (e.g. to acquire another company), the EPS may be impacted depending upon the outcome of the reinvestment. Stock dilution Rights offerings offset the dilutive effect of issuing more shares. For this reason, stock-exchange rules don't require that shareholders approve rights offerings if the company offers at least 20% of outstanding shares at a discount. Because rights offerings are unpopular, companies typically choose them as a last resort, perhaps due to insufficient investor demand. Tax treatment in the United States If rights are exercised, they aren't taxed. Like with an ordinary security purchase, taxation happens when the security is sold. The cost basis of the shares is \\"the subscription price plus the tax basis for the exercised rights\\". The holding period begins at the time of exercise.IRS Pub. 550 If rights are let to expire, they don't count as a deductible loss, as they have no tax basis in this case.

The long-staple Sea Island cotton was first grown here by a local family, the Millers, who helped Eli Whitney develop the cotton gin. With its unusual range of wildlife, the island has been declared a National Park and a National Seashore. Little Cumberland Island is connected to the main island by a marsh. John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were married in the First African Baptist Church on Cumberland Island in 1996. Geography Cumberland Island forms part of Camden County, Georgia (30°51′N, 81°27′W). Cumberland Island constitutes the westernmost point of shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean in the United States. The island is long, with an area of 36,415 acres (147.37 km2 or 56.25 square miles), including of marsh, mudflats, and tidal creeks. There is no bridge to the island; it is reached by the Cumberland Ferry from St. Marys. Ecology Marsh on Cumberland Island The island has three major ecosystem regions. Along the western edge of the island there are large areas of salt marshes. One will also see gnarled live oak trees covered with Spanish moss and the palmetto plants at the edge of Cumberland's dense maritime forest. Cumberland Island's most famous ecosystem is its beach, which stretches over . The island is home to many native interesting animals, as well as non-native species. There are white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, nine-banded armadillos, wild boars, feral hogs, American alligators, as well as many marshland inhabitants. It is also famous for its feral horses roaming free on the island. HistoryNative American settlement= The first inhabitants were indigenous peoples who settled there as early as 4,000 years ago. Later inhabitants participated in the Savannah archaeological culture and spoke the Timucua language. Its inhabitants were part of the Mocama, a Timucua group who spoke the Mocama dialect. In the 17th century the island and the adjacent coast were controlled by the Tacatacuru chiefdom. The main village, known as Tacatacuru, was located towards the southern end of the island; during the time of European colonization, the Spanish recorded the names of at least six more villages on the island, and eleven more were located on the mainland. =Colonial settlement= During the 16th and 17th centuries, Cumberland Island was part of the Mocama missionary province of Spanish Florida. When the Spanish arrived in the 1550s, they named the island San Pedro. They built a garrison and mission, San Pedro de Mocama, in 1603. It was one of the main mission centers, situated at a major Mocama site. Another Spanish mission on Cumberland was Puturiba, which operated from 1595–1597. An additional mission, San Phelipe, was relocated from the North Newport River to the northern end of Cumberland from 1670–1684. Historical records indicate that until 1681, there were approximately 300 natives and several Spanish missionary priests living on Cumberland Island. In 1683, French pirates attacked Cumberland Island, looting and burning many of the buildings. Many of the natives and the Spanish missionaries fled the island. An attack in 1684 by the Spanish pirate Thomas Jingle led to the final abandonment of the island. Survivors retreated to St. Augustine to the south. During the colonial years, many had died of exposure to European infectious diseases, to which they had no natural immunity. The Tacatacuru relocated closer to St. Augustine, and Cumberland Island was thereafter occupied by the Yamasee. By then most of the Mocama had converted to Roman Catholicism as taught to them by the Spanish priests before the island was abandoned. English General James Oglethorpe arrived at the Georgia coast in 1733. The name of Cumberland Island was given the following year by a young Yamacraw named Toonahowi (the nephew of Chief Tomochichi who visited England with Oglethorpe.) He suggested the island be named for William Augustus, the 13-year-old Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II. Oglethorpe established a hunting lodge called Dungeness, named after a headland in Kent, England. A fort was erected at the southern point of the island called Fort William. At the northern end of the island, Oglethorpe built Fort St. Andrews. For a decade the small village of Berrimacke existed near the fort. The forts were built to defend English settlements to the north from the Spanish in Florida. After the English defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742, the need for the forts ended. They abandoned the forts and eventually the village disappeared. No trace remains today of Fort William, and most signs of Fort St. Andrews have been washed away. In the 1760s, the island was divided into royal grants but saw little activity. When naturalist William Bartram visited the island in 1774, the island was mostly uninhabited.  The plantation era The Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene founded most of southern Cumberland Island as a result of a business deal used to finance the army. Greene died in 1786. His wife, Catharine Littlefield Greene, remarried Phineas Miller ten years later; and they built a huge, four-story tabby mansion on top of a Native American shell mound. She named it Dungeness, after Oglethorpe's hunting lodge. The mansion featured thick walls at the base, four chimneys and 16 fireplaces, and was surrounded by of gardens. Dungeness was the site of many special social galas, where statesmen and military leaders enjoyed the Millers' hospitality. When the island was briefly occupied during the War of 1812, the British used Dungeness as their headquarters. They also freed the American slaves on the island.Taylor, Alan, The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832, (New York: Norton, 2013), pp. 327-332. The Millers' Dungeness burned down in 1866. The Millers were the first major planters of Sea Island cotton on Cumberland. They held a total of 210 slaves to work the plantation. Catharine and Phineas Miller helped Eli Whitney develop the cotton gin, debuted in 1793. While Sea Island cotton was by far the largest and most valuable commercial crop, other documented agricultural products such as indigo, rice, and food crops were also grown. Rice sloughs are still visible on the island through satellite imagery. According to national oral history, live oak wood from the island was used to build the USS Constitution, \\"Old Ironsides,\\" in the 1790s. In 1818, an ill General \\"Lighthorse\\" Harry Lee, a Revolutionary War hero and old friend of Catharine Greene, was returning from the West Indies when he asked to be taken to Dungeness. After a month of illness, he died on March 25 and was buried on the island. His son, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, had a tombstone placed over the grave and visited his father's final resting place several times. In 1913, the body of Harry Lee was reinterred at Lexington, Virginia, to lie beside his famous son, but his gravestone was left on Cumberland Island. By the time of the Civil War, Robert Stafford had become the major planter and landowner on Cumberland Island and one of the largest planters in Camden County. His grave is on the main road of the island. = The Carnegie Family Era = Dungeness Mansion prior to 1959 fire on Cumberland Island National Seashore In the 1880s Thomas M. Carnegie, brother of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and his wife Lucy bought land on Cumberland for a winter retreat. In 1884, they began building a mansion on the site of Dungeness, though Carnegie never lived to see its completion. Lucy and their nine children continued to live on the island, naming their mansion Dungeness after that of Greene. Dungeness was designed as a 59-room Scottish castle. They also built pools, a golf course, and 40 smaller buildings to house the 200 servants who worked at the mansion. The last time Dungeness was used was for the 1929 wedding of a Carnegie daughter. After the Crash and the Great Depression, the family left the island and kept the mansion vacant. It burned in a 1959 fire, believed to have been started by a poacher who had been shot in the leg by a caretaker weeks before. Today, the ruins of the mansion remain on the southern end of the island. The Carnegie family owned 90% of the island. Lucy Carnegie had additional estates built on the island for her children. These include: * Greyfield, built in 1900, now a private inn owned by the Carnegie family. * Plum Orchard, donated to the National Park Service in 1972, which maintains it and gives daily tours. * Stafford Plantation, privately owned by members of the Carnegie family. The caretaker of the estate (nearby homes and an air-strip) and his family live in the residence. = The north end = In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, small farmers settled on the north end of the island. Other island residents at this time worked as innkeepers and pilots for St. Andrews Sound. One of these pilots, James Clubb, directed the Wanderer (the last ship to bring slaves from Africa to the United States) to nearby Jekyll Island in 1858. These north end families owned some slaves, and during the Civil War, most of these people moved to the mainland when Union forces occupied the island. Former slaves and their descendants continued to live on the island after the Civil War. According to historian Mary Bullard, one community existed in the Brick Hill area of the island between 1862–1891. Many of these freedmen were farmers. In the 1880s, another community formed at what is now called \\"The Settlement\\". It was a residential area for black workers, as Georgia had passed laws requiring racial segregation of housing and public facilities. The First African Baptist Church, established in The Settlement in 1893, was rebuilt in the 1930s. It is one of the few remaining structures of this community. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, innkeeping was the primary business on the north end. The most prosperous hotel was located in the High Point area and attracted guests who belonged to the rising middle class. Visitors arrived on steamboats and enjoyed activities such as fishing, hunting, and going to the beach. At the height of the innkeeping era in the 1890s, guests numbered around 750. Black residents of the north end staffed the hotel: they served as waiters, cooks, laundresses, and drivers of the horse-drawn trolleys that transported guests. Hotel Cumberland at High Point was sold in 1918 and became a private club. The Candler family of Atlanta, associated with Coca-Cola, owned part of the north end. John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were married on Cumberland Island in 1996, in the First African Baptist Church with their reception taking place at the historic Greyfield Inn. While they filled the church's eight pews with friends and family, no media were permitted at the event.http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&sid;=c416235c-1e96-4478-9cea-4a1e7cf5d481%40sessionmgr111&hid;=118&bdata;=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN;=9609308008 = Present-day conservation = In 1954 some of the members of the Carnegie family invited the National Park Service to the island to assess its suitability as a National Seashore. In 1955 the National Park Service named Cumberland Island as one of the most significant natural areas in the United States and plans got underway to secure it. Simultaneously, the State of Georgia was working on plans to secure the island as a state park. Plans to create a National Seashore were complicated when, in October 1968, Carnegie descendants sold three thousand acres of the island to the real estate developer Charles Fraser, who had developed part of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Fraser met with conservationist and then Sierra Club executive director, David Brower, on the island to discuss how to develop the area. This meeting and discussions between Fraser and Brower was documented in one of the three parts of the book Encounters with the Archdruid by John McPhee who traveled with Fraser and Brower as they toured Cumberland Island. Brower pushed for a 90/10 split, with 90% of the land to remain undeveloped. However, the thought of any additional development on the island beyond the structures already erected by the Carnegies and Sam Candler, who also owned part of the island, caused activists, politicians, members of the Carnegie and Candler families, and a number of organizations, including the Georgia Conservancy and the Sierra Club, to band together and push Fraser to sell to the National Park Foundation. They, along with others, also helped push a bill through the US Congress that established Cumberland Island as a national seashore. The bill was signed by President Richard Nixon on October 23, 1972. The Carnegie family sold the island to the federal government. With donations from the Mellon Foundation, Cumberland Island became a national park. Current land ownership Cumberland Island is really two islands—the island proper and Little Cumberland Island—connected by a marsh. While sometimes confused to be a part of Cumberland Island, Little Cumberland is a separate island and is not a part of Cumberland Island. As are the private properties on Cumberland Island, for over 60 years Little Cumberland Island has been maintained with a nature and conservation mission. Historically, portions of Cumberland Island remain in private hands. Large areas were deeded to the National Parks Foundation by members or heirs of the Carnegie family in 1971. Other lands in private ownership were purchased with funds provided by the Mellon Foundation and Congress, and in 1972 Cumberland Island was designated a national seashore. A small number of property owners, principally property owners who preserved the island and protected it from massive commercial development, still own their homes and other fee simple private property on the southern, western and northern regions of the island. Some, however, have sold their property to the National Park Service (NPS), with an agreement that retains their ownership and full property rights during their lifetime. Eventually, their property will be owned by the National Park Service. Local Issues in the Cumberland Island Seashore Since the national seashore was established, a Navy nuclear submarine base has been built on the mainland opposite, which requires frequent dredging to the river so that it will be deep enough. There is also a proposed spaceport on the mainland where rockets could malfunction while traveling out over the island, and Navy exercises and oil exploration that may bring loud blasting noise into waters offshore. This area hosts endangered right whales as well as many other forms of sea life, including sea turtles and dolphins.

As the People's Liberation Army advanced through Fujian Province in the late 1940s, the U.S.-supported Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang retreated to China’s offshore Islands. On 20 January 1955, the PLA's conquest of Yijiangshan led to the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. The Formosa Resolution of 1955 passed in Congress nine days later in the United States, leading to the orderly evacuation (Operation Pullback) of the Dachen Islands by the United States Navy in February.http://www.britishpathe.com/video/formosa-crisis At the time, they served as the temporary capital of the Chekiang Province in exile. The U.S. Seventh Fleet used 132 boats and 400 aircraft to move 14,500 civilians, 10,000 Republic of China servicemen and 4,000 guerrilla fighters, along with 40,000 tons of military equipment and supplies from the island. Three days after the evacuation, the islands were taken by the People’s Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek grudgingly allowed the island to fall to the Communists so that the other offshore island groups, Kinmen and Matsu, could be successfully defended. The civilian population of the islands was resettled in mostly Yilan County, Taiwan, but also in other urban areas in Taiwan. Many of those evacuated to Taiwan later moved to the United States as they lacked strong social networks and access to opportunity in Taiwan. Chefs from the Dachen Islands had a strong influence on American Chinese food.  Geography  The islands are located in the Gulf of Taizhou, off the coast of Zhejiang, the People's Republic of China. The archipelago is sandwiched between Zhoushan in the north and the Nanjishan Liedao (南麂山列岛, literally Southern Muntjac Archipelago) in the south, and it is located from Jiaojiang District, which it administratively belongs to. Dachen Archipelago consists of a total of 29 islands, islets, and rocks, totaling . Fishing industry had long been the backbone of the local economy and the region was one of the largest of the Chinese class II fisheries. However, after decades of over fishing, the natural resources were depleted and as a result, most of the local population was forced to migrate to the mainland in the late-1980s and the local populace experienced a drastic decrease to a fraction of what it once was. To compensate for the depletion of natural resources, aquaculture has become prosperous and the archipelago is currently one of the largest aquaculture bases in the region. However, due to the adaptation of advanced technology which significantly reduced the need of manual labor, the local population has not recovered to its peak level despite the income generated has already been higher than that of the traditional fishery peak in the past, and in fact, the current local population was not much higher than the lowest point in the late-1980s. To diversify the local economy, tourism had become another major source of income. The annual average temperature is , and the climate is typical subtropical climate. The forest coverage rate is greater than 56% and it is the provincial level forest park. Due to the forces of nature such as that of tides and winds, there are many spectacular sceneries and the archipelago is called the Chinese Number One Oceanic Penjing (Zhong-Guo Di-Yi Hai-Shang Penjing, 中国第一海上盆景). Another tourist attraction was the military fortifications left behind by the nationalists during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era, because the archipelago was the site of the Battle of Dachen Archipelago in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis.

It is one of several species used for the production of sago, as well as an ornamental plant. Names Cycads' only relation to the true palms (Arecaceae) is that both are seed plants. The Latin specific epithet revoluta means \\"curled back\\", in reference to the leaves. This is also called kungi (comb) palm in Urdu speaking areas.  Description  This very symmetrical plant supports a crown of shiny, dark green leaves on a thick shaggy trunk that is typically about in diameter, sometimes wider. The trunk is very low to subterranean in young plants, but lengthens above ground with age. It can grow into very old specimens with 6–7 m (over 20 feet) of trunk; however, the plant is very slow- growing and requires about 50–100 years to achieve this height. Trunks can branch several times, thus producing multiple heads of leaves.Thunberg, Carl Peter. 1782. Verhandelingen uitgegeeven door de hollandse maatschappy der weetenschappen, te Haarlem 20(2): 424, 426–427. left The leaves are a deep semiglossy green and about long when the plants are of a reproductive age. They grow out into a feather-like rosette to in diameter. The crowded, stiff, narrow leaflets are long and have strongly recurved or revolute edges. The basal leaflets become more like spines. The petiole or stems of the sago cycad are long and have small protective barbs. Roots are called coralloid with an Anabaena symbiosis allowing nitrogen fixation.Ultrastructure and phenolic histochemistry of the Cycas revoluta-Anabaena symbiosis. M. Obukowicz, M. Schaller and G.S. Kennedy, New Phytologist, April 1981, Volume 87, Issue 4, pages 751–759, Tannins-rich cells are found on either side of the algal layer to resist the algal invasion. As with other cycads, it is dioecious, with the males bearing pollen cones (strobilus) and the females bearing groups of megasporophylls. Pollination can be done naturally by insects or artificially.  Cultivation and uses  Propagation of Cycas revoluta is either by seed or clonally by removal of basal offsets. It is one of the most widely cultivated cycads, grown outdoors in warm temperate and subtropical regions, or under glass in colder areas. It grows best in sandy, well-drained soil, preferably with some organic matter. It needs good drainage or it will rot. It is fairly drought-tolerant and grows well in full sun or outdoor shade, but needs bright light when grown indoors. The leaves can bleach somewhat if moved from indoors to full sun outdoors. Plant covered with snow. Of all the cycads, C. revoluta is the most popular in cultivation. It is seen in almost all botanical gardens, in both temperate and tropical locations. In many areas of the world, it is heavily promoted commercially as a landscape plant. It is also quite popular as a bonsai plant. First described in the late 18th century, it is tolerant of mild to somewhat cold temperatures, provided the ground is dry. Frost damage can occur at temperatures below −10 °C (14 °F). Healthy specimens have been grown with little protection as far north as St. Louis, Missouri, and New York, New York, both in USDA zone 7b. C. revoluta usually defoliates in winter in this temperate climate, but will usually flush (grow) several new leaves by spring. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). =Sago= The pith contains edible starch, and is used for making sago. Before use, the starch must be carefully washed to leach out toxins contained in the pith. Extracting edible starch from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used for many of the same purposes as palm sago. Sago is extracted from the sago cycad by cutting the pith from the stem, root and seeds of the cycads, grinding the pith to a coarse flour and then washing it carefully and repeatedly to leach out the natural toxins. The starchy residue is then dried and cooked, producing a starch similar to palm sago/sabudana. The cycad seed contains cycasin toxin and should not be eaten as it is possible for cycasin toxin to survive the most vigorous of repeated washings. Cycasin toxin can cause ALS, Parkinson's, prostate cancer and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Aulacaspis yasumatsui is a scale insect feeding on C. revoluta, and unchecked is able to destroy the plant.Aulacaspis yasumatsui (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Diaspididae), a Scale Insect Pest of Cycads Recently Introduced into Florida.

All parts of the plant are toxic; however, the seeds contain the highest level of the toxin cycasin. Cycasin causes gastrointestinal irritation, and in high enough doses, leads to liver failure.Selected poisonous plant concerns small animals, Knight MW, Dorman DC  Vet Med  1997  92(3):260-272 Other toxins include Beta-methylamino L-alanine, a neurotoxic amino acid, and an unidentified toxin which has been observed to cause hindlimb paralysis in cattle.Toxicology Brief: Cycad toxicosis in dogs, Hany Youssef Veterinary Medicine  May 1, 2008  Sago palm in Mohali  Gallery  Image:Cycas revoluta female cone01.jpgFemale reproductive structure Image:Cycas revoluta01.jpg Image:Cycas revoluta02.jpg Image:Cycas revoluta004.jpg Image:Cycas revoluta new leafs.JPGNew leaves Image:Sago Palm.jpg Image:Cyca- revoluta.jpg Image:Cycas revoluta1328A.JPG Image:Cycas Sago.palm.arp.750pix.jpgYoung plant Image:Cycas revoluta seeds.jpgSeeds Image:Cycas_revoluta_seedling.jpgSeedling Image:CYUS PALM.JPG Image:Funchal Botanical garden - Cycas revoluta.JPG Image:Funchal, Monte - Cycas revoluta IMG 1970.JPG Image:Funchal, Monte - Cycas revoluta IMG 1907.JPG Image:KG Cycas revoluta.jpg Image:Branching Cycas revoluta.jpgA sixteen-year-old two- branched specimen Cycas revoluta MHNT.BOT.2018.28.17.jpg MHNT  References  * The Cycad Pages: Cycas revoluta * Sago Palm: University of Arizona Pima County Cooperative Extension * The Sago Palm, Cycas revoluta by Phil Bergman * Cycads: their evolution, toxins, herbivores and insect pollinators.

covered by the snow in Faraya Oyoun el Siman in Faraya Mzaar Kfardebian ( — formerly Faraya Mzaar) is a ski area in Lebanon and the largest ski resort in the Middle East. It is located one hour away from Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. It is also referred to as Ouyoune el Simane. History In 1960, Sami Geammal, Emile Riachi and a group of pioneers installed the first ski lift imported from Switzerland, on the \\"refuge\\" hill and built the first four chalets in the region. One year later, they bought of property from Prosper Gay-Para in order to expand the resort area. In 1963, the Faraya Mzaar - Tourism and Winter Sports Company was launched with Sheikh Salim El-Khazen as the principal shareholder and financed by banker Joseph Abdo Khoury, who later became the company chairman and general manager. The company acquired the concession to build and operate ski lifts on lands belonging to the Kesrouan district municipalities. In 1965, the Mzaar Hotel opened its doors, and the company installed the first chairlift on the Jabal Dib Hills. The junction between \\"Refuge\\" and \\"Jabal Dib\\" was achieved in 1968 through the installation of the resort's third lift which was named \\"Jonction\\". In the 1980s, during the civil war, the Mzaar Company was taken over by the Saudi Group al Mabani led by Fouad Rizk and Nehme Tohme. In 1993, after the Lebanese civil war ended, the new group started the expansion of the resort when a three-seat chairlift was installed reaching the Mzaar peak, the highest peak of the area, and more chairlifts were to follow. In 2012, the resort's number of lifts reached 20 (including 7 lifts installed in the \\"Wardeh\\" area created in 1999) with around of slopes. Name controversy \\"Mzaar\\" is the Arabic word for sanctuary. The highest mountain in Ouyoune el Simane was called \\"jabal el mzaar\\" (mountain of the sanctuary) after a small Roman temple built on its top. It is believed that the Romans were using fire as signals to communicate between the coastal area and Baalbeck, or Heliopolis, through Faqra and the Mzaar peak. The temple was totally destroyed during the civil war (1975-1990) and its stones were stolen. The real name of the area is Ouyoune el Simane (Meaning Simane springs) and it is administratively under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Kfardebian, which is also the case for the Faqra area, although the resort is commonly but inaccurately referred to as \\"Faraya-Mzaar\\" or \\"Faraya\\". Skiing area Ski season usually stretches from early December to early April.carter, T., dunston, L., & thomas, A. (2004). Syria and lebanon. (p. 424). Lonely Planet. Today, the ski resort is constituted of 42 hills that extend on . Skiing ranges between heights of at Mzaar-Kfardebian, to on the peak above Mzaar. On the top of Mzaar slope, upon exiting the chairlift, there is a view over the Bekaa Valley, Mount Hermon of the Anti-Lebanon and other peaks like Zaarour, Laqlouq and the Cedars. Coastal towns and the capital Beirut can be seen on clear days. The peaks of the Mzaar-Kfardebian mountain range vary between heights of .

It was produced by Helen Ainsworth, directed by William Asher, and stars Gene Barry, Valerie French, George Voskovec, and Arnold Moss. The screenplay by John Mantley is based on his 1956 original science fiction novel of the same name. Plot Englishwoman Evelyn Wingate, American reporter Jonathan Clark, Chinese peasant Su Tan, German physicist Klaus Bechner, and Soviet soldier Ivan Godofsky are randomly transported to an alien spacecraft in Earth orbit. There, they are met by a humanoid referring to himself only as \\"The Alien\\" (Arnold Moss), who explains that he is the representative of a world orbiting a sun about to go nova. Needing a new world to inhabit within the next 35 days, yet prohibited by their moral code from killing intelligent life, The Alien provides each of the five with sets of three capsules in a clear, round, hand-held case. Each capsule is capable of destroying all human life within a 3,000-mile diameter, with the expectation that humanity will use all the capsules, obliterating itself, leaving the Earth free for alien colonization. The capsules' clear containers can only be opened by the thought waves of the person to whom they were given. Once out in the open, the capsules inside can then be used by anyone, but only during the next 27 days, after which they become inert. The Alien promises that if Earth does not destroy itself, then the Alien's race will not invade Earth, but perish. The alien also explains that if one of the five Earthlings die, their capsule will self destruct and be rendered harmless. Returned to Earth, Eve (Valerie French) throws her capsules into the English Channel and then books a flight to Los Angeles. Su Tan (Marie Tsien) chooses to commit suicide, causing her capsules to self-destruct. The others go about their daily tasks undisturbed until the next day, when The Alien commandeers all electronic communications and reveals to the world the existence and power of the capsules. Overhearing the broadcast while on a trip to the U.S., Bechner (George Voskovec) is hit by a car while crossing the street and is taken to the hospital, while Pvt. Godofsky (Azemat Janti) is detained by his superiors. Arriving in Los Angeles, Eve is met by a now-disguised Clark (Gene Barry), who takes her to a closed race track where they can hide, undetected. Godofsky is interviewed by a Soviet general (Stefan Schnabel) who, dissatisfied with his vague story, orders him subjected to intense interrogation. Panic over the Alien's crisis grows in the days that follow. Repeated beatings leave Godofsky in shock, while a recovering Bechner refuses to reveal the details of The Alien's plan. After two Communist agents nearly succeed in assassinating Bechner, and an innocent man who looked like Clark is killed by a mob, Clark and Eve reveal themselves and are taken into U.S. government custody. Through the application of sodium pentothal to Godofsky, the Soviets discover The Alien's plan and gain access to his capsules. Their resulting announcement fuels global anxiety, prompting the other two (Su Tan's suicide early on neutralized her capsules) to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Confronted with an ultimatum for all U.S. military forces to withdraw throughout the world, the government tests one of Bechner's capsules to verify the Soviet threat: a dying volunteer is left on a raft far out in the ocean. After opening a capsule, he reads his exact coordinates out loud and is instantaneously vaporized. The U.S. begins withdrawing its forces worldwide. On board a U.S. Navy destroyer at sea somewhere distant, as a deterrent against the Soviet capsules being launched against America, Bechner, Clark, and Eve discuss their concerns that the Soviets will use them at the last minute, avoiding retaliation. Determined to find another way, Bechner studies the remaining capsules closely and discovers an imprinted mathematical code on them. As the Soviet general prepares to launch the capsules from a balcony, Godofsky rushes him, and the capsules fall to the ground two stories below. At the very same moment, Bechner simultaneously launches his remaining capsules and the ones from Clark's container. He has deciphered the hidden code and discovered that the capsules can be programmed. The world is then blanketed with a high- pitched sonic wave that kills every \\"known enemy of human freedom\\". In the aftermath, at an undisclosed later time, a now united humanity under the United Nations extends an invitation to The Alien and his people to coexist peacefully on Earth. It turns out that the preceding events had actually been a test of character, a way for The Alien to judge mankind's true nature. The Alien accepts, and a new day like no other dawns for humanity.

The introit Requiem aeternam, from which the Requiem Mass gets its name, is in Hypolydian mode (Mode 6). The Hypolydian mode, literally meaning \\"below Lydian\\", is the common name for the sixth of the eight church modes of medieval music theory . The name is taken from Ptolemy of Alexandria's term for one of his seven tonoi, or transposition keys . This mode is the plagal counterpart of the authentic fifth mode. In medieval theory the Hypolydian mode was described either as (1) the diatonic octave species from C to the C an octave higher, divided at the final F (C–D–E–F + F–G–A–B–C) or (2) a mode with F as final and an ambitus from the C below the final to the D above it. The third above the final, A—corresponding to the reciting tone or \\"tenor\\" of the sixth psalm tone—was regarded as having an important melodic function in this mode. The sequence of intervals was therefore divided by the final into a lower tetrachord of tone-tone-semitone, and an upper pentachord of tone-tone-tone- semitone. However, from as early as the time of Hucbald the Hypolydian mode—even more than the corresponding authentic mode, the Lydian—was characterized by the predominance of B instead of B as the fourth degree above the final . The melodic centering on F and A, as well as the use of B instead of B, is illustrated in the accompanying example from the Requiem Mass introit, \\"Requiem aeternam\\". Finer distinctions among the scale degree are sometimes made, with the D below the final called the \\"mediant\\", the lowest note, C, the \\"participant\\" (a tone functioning as an auxiliary to the mediant), the G, B, and B the \\"conceded modulations\\" (subsidiary degrees), and the lowest C, the final, F, and (rarely) the D the \\"absolute initials\\" .

It lies within the London Borough of Barnet, although the western side of Colindale's main shopping street on the A5 (including Colindale Business Park) falls within the boundaries of Brent. Colindale is an area of suburban character, and in recent years has emerged as a hotspot for new build apartments amid a large regeneration scheme. It is situated about eight miles (12.9 km) north west of Charing Cross, to the south of Edgware and east of Queensbury. History Formerly in the borough and ancient parish of Hendon, the area was essentially the dale between Mill Hill and The Burroughs. By the middle of the 20th century, it had come to include that part of the Edgware Road between The Hyde and Burnt Oak. The area is named after a 16th-century family of the same name. Until the 20th century, Colindale was without any buildings save for a large house called Colindale Lodge, Colindale Farm and a few cottages. A spelling with two Ls, 'Collindale', has been used, as on this printed in 1873. All of these properties were on Colindeep Lane which had in the medieval period been an alternative route out of London (via Hampstead, Golders Green and Hendon) to the Edgware Road. By the end of the 16th century it was not often used as a main road and by the middle part of the 19th century was called Ancient Street. By the end of the 19th century, cheap land prices made Colindale attractive to developers. Colindale Hospital was opened in 1898 as an asylum for the long-term sick of central London, and in 1907 The Government Lymph Establishment for making vaccines was built. By 1996 the majority of the hospital was closed, and by 2009 was mostly derelict. The site is now a housing development, consisting primarily of apartment blocks. Only the Grade II Listed administration buildings at the centre of the hospital site remain. In 1902, the British Library built a new depository for newspapers and periodicals on Colindale Avenue. Initially, material was merely stored at Colindale and transported into central London for consultation. However, the newspaper library reading room moved to Colindale in 1934. Shops on Edgware Road, on the west side of Colindale Colindale Tube Station Hendon Tram Depot (site now occupied by Merit House, opposite Oriental City) was in 1910 the scene of the first trials in Britain of a trolleybus. This location eventually became Colindale Trolleybus Depot, from which route 645 operated until January 1962, when the depot was closed down and eventually demolished. Land behind the depot was used from 1959 to 1962 by the George Cohen 600 Group for scrapping the vast majority of London's fleet of 1891 trolleybuses. =Manufacturing= Garston's Ltd established a trunk factory in 1901, as well as a row of cottages called Leatherville. As such it is the first manufacturer 'in the Colindale'. By 1914 there was already housing between Colindale Avenue and Annesley Avenue, mostly to house the workers of such endeavours. During the First World War Colindale became an important centre of aircraft production. The Airco factory was, at the time, the largest aircraft manufacturing company in the world. Immediately after the First World War demand for aircraft declined, but a number of other manufacturing companies came to Colindale. General Motors took over some of the Airco buildings. Franco Illuminated Signs opened on Aerodrome Road in 1922, having made the lights for the Franco British Exhibition of 1908 (it was later abbreviated to 'Franco'). It was best known for the neon signs found in Piccadilly from the 1920s to the 1970s. Frigidaire started in a wooden shack in Aerodrome Road, employing 11 people in 1923, and selling the first automatic household fridges in England. The reason why many of these and other companies chose Colindale was that there was land available for expansion. However, by 1923, when the tube railway reached Colindale, land prices had increased and factory expansion was not so easy, so some industries looked elsewhere for premises. In 1931, Frigidaire, for example, decided to build a new manufacturing plant to the west, on the A5 Edgware Road, and had moved its entire operations there by 1946. =Suburban expansion= After the tube station opened, development as a London suburb was rapid, and by 1939 much of the western side was semi- detached housing. Typical was the Colin Park Estate, built by F. H. Stucke & Co. around Colindeep Lane in 1927. Some of the houses on this estate are by the architect E. G. Trobridge. St Matthias started as a mission church in 1905. Its permanent building was opened in 1934, and rebuilt between 1971 and 1973. Colindale Primary School opened in Colindeep Lane in 1921, with a new building constructed in Woodfield Avenue in 1933. In 2011 the design and build for a new three form entry school was completed by The Kier Group and Sprunt Architects. In September 1940, Colindale tube station and the Newspaper Library (rebuilt 1957) were bombed, and the site was visited by George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen Mother. A V-1 flying bomb hit Colindale Hospital on 1 July 1944, killing four members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. =Today= Colindale houses many of North London's largest institutions, including the Royal Air Force Museum, Public Health England's Centre for Infections, the Colindale Campus of Barnet and Southgate College (opened August 2016) and the Peel Centre (better known as Hendon Police College). The British Library's newspaper depository was also in Colindale until it was closed in 2013 (to be replaced by a new depository in Boston Spa, Yorkshire, in 2015). Also located here is the Grahame Park Estate, built on the former Hendon Aerodrome. Many of the London Borough of Barnet’s council services moved to Barnet House in Colindale in 2018. Development Parts of Colindale have been designated by the Mayor of London in his London Plan as a 'proposed area of intensification'. As a result, Barnet Council designated a 'Colindale Area Action Plan' (AAP) and carried out public consultation events.Colindale Area Action Plan Search on this web site for other web pages as well The Council has finalised its preferred plan in mid-2009, and it will be examined at a public hearing by the Planning Inspectorate, for anticipated approval by the Council in 2010. As of the 2010s, a major regeneration scheme has been underway, one of the largest regeneration schemes in North London. Demography The 2011 census showed that Colindale was the most ethnically diverse area of Barnet, with 59.9% of the population belonging to a minority background. In Colindale ward as of the 2011 census, 23% of the population was White British, 15% Other White, 14% Black African, 11% Other Asian and 10% Indian. The most spoken foreign language was Romanian. Out of 6290 households, 2283 property tenures are owned, 2157 socially rented, and 1635 privately rented.

The act was passed during the first ministry of William Ewart Gladstone and came into force on 1 January 1871. It was strongly opposed by Conservatives in both houses of Parliament. The act meant the Church of Ireland was no longer entitled to collect tithes from the people of Ireland. It also ceased to send representative bishops as Lords Spiritual to the House of Lords in Westminster. Existing clergy of the church received a life annuity in lieu of the revenues to which they were no longer entitled: tithes, rentcharge, ministers' money, stipends and augmentations, and certain marriage and burial fees. The passage of the Bill through Parliament caused acrimony between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Queen Victoria personally intervened to mediate. While the Lords extorted from the Commons more compensation to alleviate the disestablished churchmen, in the end, the will of the Commons prevailed.McKechnie, The reform of the House of Lords p.49 The Irish Church Act was a key move in dismantling the Protestant Ascendancy which had dominated Ireland for several centuries previously.

Prosser authored several editions of Prosser on Torts, universally recognized as the leading work on the subject of tort law for a generation. It is still widely used today, now known as Prosser and Keeton on Torts, 5th edition. Furthermore, in the 1950s, Dean Prosser became Reporter for the Second Restatement of Torts. Biography After spending his first year at Harvard Law School, Prosser transferred to and received his Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota Law School. After a brief time in private practice at Dorsey, Colman, Barker, Scott & Barber (the modern-day Dorsey & Whitney), he became a professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School, where he wrote Prosser on Torts. He taught there from 1931 until 1940, when he resigned to become the Minnesota counsel for the Roosevelt Administration's Office of Price Administration. In 1943, he returned to private practice for another four years. In 1947, Prosser returned to Harvard Law School as a professor. The following year, Prosser became Dean of the School of Jurisprudence at UC Berkeley. Available through HeinOnline.Jessica Thompson, Minnesota's Legal Hall of Fame, Law & Politics, Accessed November 28, 2010. The unusual name of Berkeley's law school was a leftover from its beginnings as an undergraduate department, but had not been changed because of existing statutory language designating the Hastings College of Law as UC's \\"law department.\\"California Education Code Section 92201. After Prosser learned that UCLA had been able to get legislative approval for its own \\"school of law\\" (notwithstanding the Hastings statutory language), he decided that Berkeley could also get away with having its own school of law and set about getting the school renamed. In 1961, Prosser left Berkeley to teach at Hastings, where he remained until his death in 1972. In a small exhibit about the Levering Act loyalty oath in the ground level of the Campanile at UC Berkeley, Prosser is quoted as saying, \\"If the authority exists to discharge a professor because he will not sign this oath on demand, then it exists to fire him because he will not sign an oath that he is not a Catholic, not a Mason, not a consumer of beer... there is no place to stop.\\"  Prosser and strict products liability  Prosser became closely associated with the doctrine of strict liability for products injuries. His first edition of Prosser on Torts in 1941 argued that strict products liability was developing in American law, and predicted that it would be the law of the future. By the time his influential article The Assault on the Citadel (Strict Liability to the Consumer) was published in 1960, the New Jersey Supreme Court fulfilled his prediction, holding in Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors that manufacturers implicitly warrantied their products against personal injury to all users. As Reporter for the Second Restatement of Torts, he helped codify strict products liability in the Restatement's Section 402A. In the early 1940s, Prosser prepared the Comments and Notes to the predecessor of the Uniform Commercial Code: Commercial Code, Tentative Draft No. 1 – Article III. His work was limited to sections 1–51 of Article III, which focused primarily on commercial paper.Commercial Code Comments and Notes to Tentative Draft No. 1 – Article III, Introductory Note on p.5 (The American Law Institute, 1946) References Category:1898 births Category:1972 deaths Category:American legal writers Category:American legal scholars Category:Law school deans Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Scholars of tort law Category:California lawyers Category:Minnesota lawyers Category:University of Minnesota Law School alumni Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Minnesota Law School faculty Category:University of Minnesota faculty Category:UC Berkeley School of Law faculty Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:People from New Albany, Indiana Category:McCarthyism ","title":"William Lloyd Prosser"},{"id":"1613417","title":"Naga people"},{"id":"1613422","text":"Stephen Manes (born January 8, 1949) is the author of the 2011 nonfiction book Where Snowflakes Dance and Swear: Inside the Land of Ballet.

Retrieved on September 29, 2008. From 1977 through 1981, Muraco shuttled several more times between Florida, San Francisco and his native Hawaii. In Florida, he was involved in two high-profile angles. In 1979, a masked villain called \\"The Magnificent M\\" appeared in the territory. Though it came as little surprise when he was eventually unmasked as Muraco, his bald head shocked the audience.KayFabe Memories p2. Retrieved on September 29, 2008. Then, in 1980, he feuded with Barry Windham, in which the bigger and more experienced Muraco piledrove the rookie on the concrete floor. Windham eventually got his revenge, in the process becoming a credible wrestler in the eyes of the fans.CWF Archives - 25 Greatest Angles. Retrieved on September 29, 2008. =World Wrestling Federation (1981–1984, 1985–1988)=Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1981–1984) Muraco debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in Allentown, Pennsylvania defeating Steve King on February 24, 1981. Managed by The Grand Wizard, he captured the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 1981, from Pedro Morales. He lost it to Morales on November 23 in a Texas Death match, capping a bloody feud. That year, Muraco wrestled then WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund several times, including a 60-minute draw on October 24. He split 1982 between Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (where he partnered with Roddy Piper for a time), Georgia Championship Wrestling (where he also wrestled under a mask as Dr. X) and New Japan Pro Wrestling (where he wrestled in the annual MSG League tournament), before returning to the WWF that fall. Now managed by Captain Lou Albano, Muraco regained the Intercontinental title from Morales on January 22, 1983. That year, Muraco feuded with Albano's former protégé, Jimmy Snuka. The feud culminated on October 17, in a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden. Snuka lost the match, but afterward dragged Muraco back into the ring and hit his finisher, the Superfly Splash, from the top of the 15-foot cage. In the crowd at the Garden for this match was future WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley. During his two Intercontinental title reigns, Muraco had bloody feuds with Bob Backlund, Tony Atlas and Rocky Johnson. He portrayed an arrogant villain who angrily demanded respect, while engaging in disrespectful behavior himself; in one match, he brought a submarine sandwich to the ring and ate it while dominating his outmatched opponent. Later, he would preface his matches by dedicating his impending finishing move, the piledriver, to either the heel commentator or whomever he was feuding with at the time. Audiences regularly mocked Muraco and his Hawaiian origins with derisive chants of \\"beach bum\\". On February 11, 1984, Muraco lost the Intercontinental title to Tito Santana. After a series of unsuccessful rematches, Muraco took a hiatus from WWF in August 1984. He went to NWA Polynesian for a short stint. Alliance with Mr. Fuji (1985–1987) Muraco returned to the WWF in 1985, managed by Mr. Fuji. After not wrestling on the card of the first WrestleMania, Muraco headlined three consecutive Madison Square Garden cards against WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, climaxing in a bloody steel cage match on June 21, which Hogan won. On July 8, Muraco won the first King of the Ring tournament when he pinned The Iron Sheik in the Final. Before defeating the Sheik, Muraco had defeated the Junkyard Dog, Les Thornton and Pedro Morales to reach the Final. In addition to feuding with Ricky Steamboat for much of the remainder of the year which included hanging Steamboat from the top rope with Steamboat's own karate belt on an episode of WWF Championship Wrestling, Fuji and Muraco debuted Fuji Vice, a series of skits parodying Miami Vice, on Tuesday Night Titans (Fuji General, a parody of the ABC soap General Hospital, followed soon after). In 1986, Muraco allied with Adrian Adonis and Bob Orton, Jr. in their feud with Roddy Piper. This led to Orton and Muraco becoming a regular tag team. In March 1987 they lost to the Can-Am Connection (Tom Zenk and Rick Martel) in the opening match of Wrestlemania III in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome. July 1987, a falling out between Muraco and Orton led to a feud between them and a face turn for Muraco. Muraco won almost every match in the feud, on TV and at house shows, until Orton left the WWF that year. \\"The Rock\\" (1987–1988) In a TV taping aired in November 1987, Muraco solidified his face status by saving Superstar Billy Graham from a three-on-one beating by Butch Reed, One Man Gang and Slick, and taking Graham as his new manager. Muraco adopted Graham's tie-dye attire and changed his nickname from \\"Magnificent Muraco\\" to \\"The Rock\\" (although announcer Gorilla Monsoon continued to refer to Muraco by his previous nickname). Muraco replaced Graham on the team led by his former rival Hulk Hogan at the first Survivor Series, and had a good showing at the first Royal Rumble, where he eliminated three wrestlers (tied for second most with \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan) and was one of the final four competitors. He later reached the quarterfinals of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV. In his final months with the WWF, he feuded with Greg Valentine and lost to Dino Bravo at the inaugural SummerSlam. Muraco had his last match in the WWF against Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine on November 13, 1988 in Spokane, Washington. =Various promotions (1988–1995)= After leaving the WWF, Muraco split his time between Stampede Wrestling (where he defeated Makhan Singh to win the North American Heavyweight title), the AWA (where he wrestled AWA World Heavyweight Champion Larry Zbyszko to a double disqualification), All Japan Pro Wrestling, and Herb Abrams' UWF (where he feuded with Cactus Jack). On May 23, 1993 he made an appearance at World Championship Wrestling where he teamed with Dick Murdoch and Jimmy Snuka against Wahoo McDaniel, Jim Brunzell and Blackjack Mulligan at Slamboree 1993: A Legends' Reunion. =Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992–1993)= Before the promotion was renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling, Muraco rekindled old feuds there with Jimmy Snuka and Tito Santana. He defeated Snuka on September 30, 1992, for the ECW Championship, dropping it to The Sandman on November 16. On April 3, 1993, he regained it in a rematch, finally losing it to Santana on August 8. =Wrestle Association R (1994)= Muraco, as Aka Oni, debuted for Wrestle Association R (WAR) on August 25, 1994, defeating Takashi Ishikawa. He had twelve more matches with the promotion, culminating in a tag loss (with Ai Oni) to Animal Hamaguchi and Ryuma Go on December 4, at WAR Mega Power in Sumo Hall. =Retirement (1995–present)= After retiring from the ring in 1995, Muraco returned to Hawaii. In 2003, he co-founded Hawai'i Championship Wrestling with local TV producer Linda Bade, which ran from 2003 to 2008. He was the storyline commissioner of Hawai'i Championship Wrestling until 2006. He also worked as a longshoreman.SLAM! Wrestling - Muraco, Santana, Proud to be honoured Retrieved on September 29, 2008. On May 22, 1998, he return to wrestling for one night where he lost to The Honky Tonk Man at Northern Wrestling States Wrestler Alliance. Also he returned to wrestling in Hawaii where he defeated the Kodiak Bear at Hawaiian Islands Wrestling Federation on January 9, 1999. In 2004, Muraco was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004 by Mick Foley, who, like Tommy Dreamer, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley, credits the 1983 steel cage match between Muraco and Snuka at Madison Square Garden (which he attended) as his inspiration for becoming a wrestler. He managed his son, Joe, in WXW. On August 27, 2005, he teamed with Joe to defeat another father and son team, Bob and Brad Armstrong, at WrestleReunion 2. In 2007, Muraco inducted his former manager, Mr. Fuji, into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2007. Muraco currently resides in Hawaii with his wife Sharon. He has three children.

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos on located in the Downtown Summerlin neighborhood. It is Station Casinos' flagship property, and the company's corporate headquarters is located on the property. The project was announced in July 2002 and is named after the nearby Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The project initially was to include a 23-story, 300-foot hotel tower with 1,000 rooms, as well as timeshare buildings that would be added in a future phase. In October 2003, the project received opposition from people who believed that it would harm the quality of life for Summerlin residents and that it would destroy the views of Red Rock Canyon. A compromise was ultimately reached in January 2004, reducing the hotel tower to 198 feet while removing the timeshare aspect entirely. Groundbreaking began in April 2004, and the resort was topped off in March 2005, before opening on April 18, 2006, as the second casino in Summerlin. Red Rock Resort was Station Casinos' most expensive property, built at a cost of $925 million, including a hotel expansion that opened in 2007. A separate $65 million expansion also occurred during 2006, and included a $31 million bowling alley, the most expensive in the world. A six-month, $35 million expansion was announced in 2014, and included the addition of several new restaurants. The resort includes a casino, a 796-room hotel, a pool area, a spa, of meeting space, and a 16-screen movie theater. The hotel tower is the second tallest building in Summerlin after One Queensridge Place. History In July 2002, Station Casinos and Howard Hughes Corporation made a deal that gave Station Casinos the option to purchase a (later 67.6 acres) site in Summerlin, Nevada, at the southeast corner of the Las Vegas Beltway and west Charleston Boulevard. That month, Station Casinos announced plans to build a then-unnamed hotel-casino on the property. The company had until October 2002 to purchase the property for a total of $65 million. Station Casinos expected to complete its purchase of the land by June 2003, with construction scheduled to begin late that year or in early 2004. Construction was expected to take approximately 15 months, with a cost of more than $300 million. It would be Station Casinos' largest and most expensive resort, and would compete against the nearby Suncoast and Rampart casinos. The site was chosen over other locations that Station Casinos owned – also along the beltway in the west Las Vegas Valley – because of its location within the planned village of Summerlin Centre. Station Casinos tentatively referred to the project as Charleston Station. By April 2003, the project had been named \\"Red Rock Station\\", after the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, located approximately three miles away. Like its recent Green Valley Ranch resort, Station Casinos planned for the Red Rock Station to target upscale tourists and local residents as its primary clientele. =Opposition= The project initially was to include a 23-story, hotel tower with 1,000 rooms in its first phase, while future phases would add two 23-story, timeshare condominium towers with 250 rooms each, for an ultimate total of 1,500 rooms. The project would require an exemption from county officials, as the land was only zoned for towers up to . In October 2003, the project received opposition from people who believed that it would harm the quality of life for Summerlin residents and that it would destroy the views of Red Rock Canyon. Opponents also believed that the 1,500-room count was too much for the nearby residential area. Because of the opposition, Station Casinos delayed its request for approval from the Clark County Planning Commission, giving the company time to pitch the project to opponents. Station Casinos, which had been surprised by the opposition, noted that the property had been zoned for gaming for more than a decade prior. Nearby homeowners had also been informed upon purchasing their houses that the land was zoned for a potential casino project. The Culinary Workers Union, along with environmental organizations Sierra Club and The Conservation Fund, joined opponents of the project, stating that the tower would ruin the nearby views. At a cost of approximately $4,000, Culinary and the Sierra Club mailed fliers to more than 10,000 residents, urging them to tell the Clark County Commission to reject the 300-foot tower. It was the first time that the union had teamed up with an environmental group to become involved in an environmental issue. At the time, Culinary had been involved in an ongoing effort to unionize Station Casinos' 11,000 employees. Station Casinos stated that Culinary only opposed the Red Rock Station because of the company's non- union status, a claim that was denied by the union. In late October 2003, Station Casinos held an event to educate residents about the project and to answer questions. Nearly 250 people attended the event, which received a mixed reaction of opposition and support. Several days later, the Clark County Planning Commission approved the 300-foot tower. Residents continued to oppose the tower, and opponents worked to gather support in an effort to derail the project. Opposition groups sent recorded phone messages to more than 200,000 southern Nevada residents urging against the project, and rallies supporting and opposing the project were held in November 2003. By December 2003, a county voice mailbox had received 591 recorded messages since September, with 494 of the messages from opponents of the project or its tower; 97 of the messages were from supporters. The county had also received over 3,200 emails and letters, with approximately 100 of them in support of the project. That month, the Clark County Commission delayed a vote on the project until January 2004, while telling opponents and supporters to work on a compromise ahead of the vote. Station Casinos stated that a 300-foot tower was necessary to ensure that guests would have unobstructed views of the Las Vegas Strip in the event that previously approved office towers would be built nearby the project. In subsequent negotiations, Station Casinos was willing to decrease the 300-foot tower to , while opponents would support nothing above . Station Casinos agreed to reduce its timeshare towers to 100 feet, removing 250 rooms from the project. After weeks of negotiations, Station Casinos and Summerlin residents compromised on a hotel tower and the complete removal of the timeshare buildings. The redesigned project was unanimously approved by the Clark County Commission in January 2004, with approval to build up to 1,000 rooms. Station Casinos stated that the redesign would increase the project's $400 million cost, with a price between $450 million and $475 million. =Construction= East side of the resort during construction, July 2005 The Red Rock resort was built in what would eventually become Downtown Summerlin. A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the resort on April 15, 2004, with an opening scheduled for early 2006. Perini Building Company was the general contractor for the project, which was designed by Portland-based Architropolis, Las Vegas-based The Friedmutter Group, and SADI. In May 2004, the Red Rock Station passed the Clark County Commission's design review without opposition. In December 2004, despite residential opposition, the Clark County Commission approved two signs for the future resort: an 80-foot high sign with a video screen, to be built on the east side of the Las Vegas Beltway; and a 50-foot high sign, also with a video screen, to be built on West Charleston Boulevard. As of January 2005, the resort was expected to cost $475 million. On March 15, 2005, Station Casinos announced plans to begin expanding the Red Rock Station before its opening, including an increase in hotel rooms from 400 to 850. The expansion was scheduled to begin in late 2005, with completion expected by late 2006. The expansion and rising construction costs increased the project's estimated cost to $800 million, which would make it the most expensive locals casino ever built in Las Vegas. The project was topped off on March 24, 2005, at which point it was known as Red Rock Resort Spa Casino. \\"Resort\\" was added to the name instead of the usual \\"Station\\" name used with the company's other properties, in order to denote the Red Rock property's luxury image. By July 2005, the project's cost had increased to $925 million as a result of increased construction costs and design changes. An opening date of March 2006 was expected. For customer convenience, the resort was built with six entrances, two parking garages, two parking lots, and two valets. Station Casinos planned to hire 2,600 people for the Red Rock Resort, with approximately half of them expected to be transferred employees from the company's other local properties. More than 100,000 people applied for jobs at the resort during 2005. A survey prior to the opening showed only minimal neighborhood opposition to the resort. Selected audiences were allowed to tour the resort in March and April 2006, prior to its opening. Employees underwent six weeks of pre-opening training to ensure preparedness for the public opening. Restaurants were operated and each hotel room was occupied three different times during the six-week period. A total of 4,000 people spent time at the resort during the final week before the public opening, and a total of 100,000 meals had been served during the six-week pre-opening period. =Opening and operation= Station Casinos hosted 3,800 special guests at the resort on the night of April 18, 2006, prior to the public unveiling at midnight. Former Nevada governor and U.S. senator Richard Bryan attended the opening, as did Andre Agassi and officials from rival casino companies. Singer Sting held a one-hour concert at the resort's pool area as part of the grand opening celebration, which also included a six-minute fireworks show. Built at a cost of $925 million, the Red Rock Resort was Station Casinos' most expensive property. Approximately 80 percent of revenue was expected to come from local residents. Within six months of its opening, the Red Rock Resort had made $44 million in profit. The resort opened with 415 hotel rooms, approximately half of its final room count. The remaining rooms, part of an expansion to the hotel tower, were expected to be open by December 2006. The Red Rock Resort was only the second casino to open in Summerlin, after the Rampart. The casino featured 62 gaming tables, including a 20-table poker room. The casino included nearly 3,200 slot machines, with slightly more than half of them being video poker. The casino also included a bingo room, while its sportsbook contained 213 seats and five VIP booths, with its signature attraction being three jumbo screens, measuring 18 feet by 32 feet. The sportsbook included bar service, as well as food service from the adjacent Turf Grill. The resort also featured of meeting space, and a luxury spa. The pool area was located in the center of the resort property, surrounded by several restaurants, clubs, and the spa. A 16-screen movie theater, operated by Regal Cinemas, opened on April 21, 2006. Overview of the Red Rock facilities in 2006 As of July 2006, groundbreaking had begun on a 72-lane bowling alley, while the hotel expansion opened in January 2007. The bowling alley and an additional 1,000 spaces to a parking garage were part of a $65 million expansion, while the additional hotel rooms were included in the resort's original $925 million cost. An expansion to the resort's spa was also planned to open in early 2007, along with the new hotel rooms. The $31 million bowling alley, the most expensive in the world, opened in 2007, and included various amenities including a bar. In 2007, U.S. presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani held a campaign fundraiser at the resort. After winning the 2010 Nevada gubernatorial election, Brian Sandoval celebrated his victory at the Red Rock Resort. During late 2011, the Red Rock Resort was the only casino in Nevada to offer the \\"Bonus Box,\\" the name used for cylindrical containers attached to slot machines that dispense prizes to gamblers. At the resort, the cylinders each contained $500 and were attached to 10 different slot machines as part of a field test, which was viewed favorably by customers. After winning the 2012 Nevada caucus, U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney held a victory party and speech at the resort. Also during 2012, a 79-year-old woman bowled a perfect 300-score game at the resort's bowling alley, becoming the oldest woman in Nevada history to score a perfect game and the second-oldest woman in U.S. history to do so. In April 2014, plans were announced for a six- month, $35 million expansion that was scheduled to be complete by October 2014. The upcoming opening of the nearby Downtown Summerlin mall prompted the resort's renovation project. The project would include the addition of a \\"restaurant row\\" along the resort building's entrance facing West Charleston Boulevard. Also planned was a new parking and drop-off area across from the mall, as well as an enhanced entrance accessible by mall shoppers. The implementation of easy customer access was inspired by two restaurants at the resort, the Yard House and Lucille's Smokehouse, which both used the same concept of easy access. There were also plans to renovate the spa, as well as 26 hotel suites. By the time of the announced expansion, the hotel lobby and the resort's Lucky Bar had already been remodeled. In August 2015, the sportsbook removed a handful of projectors, used since the 2006 opening, and replaced them with an LED video wall measuring 18 feet high and 96 feet long. Features Lucky Bar chandelier The casino is , while the hotel contains 796 rooms. The resort has a modern design with a desert-themed influence. The resort's design includes blown glass, polished sandstone, and of multicolored onyx imported from India and Italy. The resort also features numerous chandeliers in various shapes and sizes, containing three million pieces of crystal. Station Casinos executives Frank Fertitta III and his brother Lorenzo Fertitta chose to include the chandeliers, having been inspired by older Las Vegas resorts such as the Desert Inn and the Sands Hotel and Casino. The chandeliers cost over $6 million. The Lucky Bar features a chandelier with more than 1.6 million crystals. =Restaurants= The Red Rock opened with a total of nine restaurants, including T-Bones Chophouse and the Feast Buffet. The resort also included a seven-tenant food court. A Japanese sushi restaurant, Hachi, opened at the resort in 2007. The Yard House opened at the resort in 2010, and its primary entrance was accessible from the resort's parking lot, while a second entrance was located inside the casino. Lucille's Smokehouse opened at the resort in 2013, and it also provided easy customer access similar to the Yard House restaurant. In February 2014, the resort's Hachi restaurant was closed as part of a routine refreshing of dining options. The resort's LBS: A Burger Joint restaurant also closed that month, after five years of operations. The resort's 2014 expansion was the reason for the closings. Planned as part of the new restaurant row was the Hearthstone Kitchen & Cellar, to be operated by The Light Group in the space formerly occupied by Hachi. Also planned was the renovation of T-Bones Chophouse. Salute, a Italian restaurant, opened in the restaurant row in September 2015. It closed in December 2017, when it was announced that Scott Conant would open a new restaurant, Masso Osteria, in its place with a scheduled opening in February 2018. =Musical entertainment= When the resort opened, it featured Rande Gerber's Cherry Nightclub, which included a seven-foot sculpture of red cherries created by Takashi Murakami. The resort also included the Rocks Lounge, which offered singing entertainment; the 250-seat Lucky Bar, which offered nightly DJ music; and the pool area's Sand Bar, which offered concert acts. Pool party at the resort's Cherry Pool, July 2009 In 2007, Station Casinos took over operations at the Cherry nightclub, after parting ways with Gerber. The Cherry nightclub reopened in June 2009, after a remodeling that included the addition of a stage. At that time, Cherry consisted of , including an outdoor area with a pool, known as Cherry Pool during the summer. Cherry also included a DJ, and was meant to appeal to local residents through promotions. Cherry closed in January 2010, and Station Casinos began evaluating better uses for the space that would bring in more profits. It was ultimately converted into event space, and the Cherry Pool reopened in May 2010, as the Red Rock Cabana Club, a 275-person pool area separate from the main pool where guests could have pool parties. In May 2011, work was underway on a temporary, outdoor amphitheater near the resort's pool. The 8,800-seat venue would host six concerts that year, from June to October, before being dismantled. During 2012, the resort's outdoor amphitheater had grown to nearly 10,000 seats, becoming one of the largest concert venues in Las Vegas. The Red Rock Amphitheater hosted its final concert in October 2012. In 2013, the Academy of Country Music named Red Rock Resort as the Casino of the Year for hosting many country singers during 2012. In March 2014, the resort announced a concert series planned for the summer, to be held at the Sandbar pool area. In 2015, the resort began offering Rock Shot Bingo, a version of bingo featuring alcohol and a DJ, to appeal to younger customers. Zowie Bowie, a cover band, performed at the Rocks Lounge for nearly 10 years, from the resort's opening until January 2016. A dance show titled Alice: A Steampunk Concert Fantasy, based on the books Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, began at the Rocks Lounge in July 2017. Film history The second season of Hell's Kitchen, aired in 2006, offered the winner the executive chef position at T-Bones Chophouse. The winner of the contest was a 25-year-old sous chef from New York named Heather West, but Red Rock management instead decided to give her a position suitable to her skills: senior chef at Terra Rossa, the resort's Italian restaurant. Portions of the show were filmed at the resort. By August 2008, the resort had been the filming location for segments of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and episodes of The Real Housewives of Orange County, as well as Rock of Love with Bret Michaels. Rapper Nelly's music video for \\"Body on Me\\" was also shot at the resort in 2008. Some scenes were also shot at the resort for the 2008 film 21. Canceled condominium towers In July 2005, Station Casinos announced that it was partnering with developers Stephen Cloobeck and Steven Molasky to build two condominium high-rise towers on of property next to the Red Rock Resort. The towers would be under 190 feet and would include 300 units each for a total of 600. They would be 80-percent owned by Station Casinos, while Cloobeck Molasky Partners I LLC would own the remainder. Sales were expected to begin in spring 2006. By March 2006, Station Casinos was planning two 227-foot condominium towers with a total of 392 units. According to a Clark County commissioner, the previously approved 198-foot limit only applied to the adjacent hotel. Despite the increased height, the towers would be built on land that was 29 feet lower in elevation from the hotel tower, making them no taller than the hotel's rooftop. In April 2006, the Clark County Commission unanimously granted zoning approval to Charleston Station LLC – mostly owned by Station Casinos – to build the condominium project, despite some citizens' opposition to its height. A sales center for the project was opened inside the Red Rock Resort. The project was known as Red Rock Residences and The Residences at Red Rock. Station Casinos dissolved the partnership with Cloobeck and Molasky in June 2006, and planned to develop the project on its own, with completion expected by 2008. Cloobeck Molasky requested arbitration on the matter in July 2006, as well as damages from Station Casinos. Cloobeck accused Station Casinos of attempting to \\"hijack\\" the project. In September 2006, Station Casinos announced that it was considering alternative possibilities for the land. A condominium on the property was still in consideration, as Station Casinos believed it to be a viable concept; approximately 3,000 people had previously expressed interest in the project at its preview center. The condominium project had been scheduled for groundbreaking around October 2006, but was ultimately cancelled.

The defeat convinced the Dutch \\"that the Portuguese were formidable opponents, something which they had hitherto refused to concede.\\"Charles R. Boxer, The Dutch in Brazil, 1624-1654.

Dutra, \\"Dutch in Colonial Brazil\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 2, p. 419. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. History Though the Dutch West India Company fielded a larger, better equipped force, they suffered morale problems as most of their army was made up of mercenaries from Europe (primarily Germany) who felt no real passion for the war in Brazil, as opposed to the Natives and Portuguese settlers who considered Brazil to be their home and were fighting for a patriotic cause. The Dutch force was also unused to fighting in the dense jungle and humid conditions of the country, wearing thick, brightly coloured European clothing and heavy metal armour which inhibited their dexterity. Contemporary accounts describe Dutch troops at the battle as \\"pale and sickly\\". The Dutch army at Guararapes were armed with pikes, cannon and an assortment of bladed weapons. It is thought by historians that the use of short blades by the Dutch was an attempt to imitate previously successful Portuguese weaponry and tactics. The Portuguese force was made up of an assortment of natives, blacks and whites who knew, and had experience fighting in, the difficult Brazilian terrain. They weakened Dutch troops with fusillades of musketfire from behind trees, and then charge with mêlée weapons. The Dutch had expected the enemy to march down the well established coastal roads, and thus formed a line of defence covering these roads. However, the Portuguese force used a series of minor trails to reach Pernambuco, appearing out of the wetlands to the west and Guararapes Hills (from which the battle derived its name) and flanking the Dutch. After several hours of fighting, the Dutch retreated northwards to Recife, leaving their artillery behind. Following the Dutch retreat, the Portuguese army marched into Pernambuco. An eyewitness account of the Dutch defeat by Michiel van Goch written a few days after the battle notes > The enemy's men [the Portuguese forces] are naturally agile and surefooted, > able to advance or retreat speedily. They are also formidable from their > natural ferocity, consisting as they do of Brazilians, Tapuyas, Negroes, > Mamelucos, etc., all natives of this country; as also Portuguese and > Italians, whose constitution enables them to adapt themselves very readily > to the terrain, so that they can range the woods, cross the swamps, and > climb or descend the hills (all of which natural obstacles are very numerous > here), and that with remarkable speed and agility. Our [Dutch] men, on the > contrary, fight ranged in serried ranks, after the manner of the fatherland, > and they are sluggish and flabby, unsuited to this kind of country.quoted in > Boxer, Dutch in Brazil, pp. 215-16. With the defeats of the Dutch in the two battles, albeit narrow ones, opinion in Amsterdam considered that \\"Dutch Brazil by now no longer had a future worth fighting for,\\" which \\"effectively sealed the fate of the colony.\\"Michiel van Groesen, Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil.

Life She joined, soon after its formation, the company at the Theatre Royal, subsequently known as Drury Lane, and was accordingly one of the first women to appear on the English stage. Her earliest recorded appearance took place presumably in 1663 or 1664, as Estifania in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife. She joined the King's Company about 1670 and played many important roles in the 1670s, including Benzayda in John Dryden's The Conquest of Granada (December 1670 and January 1671), and probably Rosalinda in Nathaniel Lee's Sophonisba (3 April 1675). She \\"created\\" among other characters, Melantha in Dryden's Marriage à la mode (c. April 1672), Margery Pinchwife in William Wycherley's The Country Wife (12 January 1675), Cleopatra in Dryden's All for Love, and Mrs. Termagant in Shadwell's The Squire of Alsatia. Cibber somewhat curiously omits from his Apology all mention of her name. Her most famous role was the loving and trustful Queen Statira in The Rival Queens (17 March 1677). She formed a notable acting partnership with Rebecca Marshall in a series of fashionable \\"women in conflict\\" plays, in which Boutell played the virtuous heroine to Marshall's darker antagonist.Howe, pp. 152-3. Boutell specialized in breeches roles, such as Fidelia in Wycherley's The Plain Dealer (11 December 1676). Edmund Curll described Boutell in The History of the English Stage (1741), a work supposedly based on the notes of the famous actor Thomas Betterton, who was the King's Company's de facto manager in the 1670s: > A very considerable Actress; she was low of Stature, had very agreeable > Features, a good Complexion, but a Childish Look. Her Voice was weak, tho' > very mellow; she generally acted the young, innocent Lady whom all the > Heroes are mad in Love with; she was a Favourite of the Town. A well-known story holds that, having for the character of Statira obtained from the property-man a veil to which Mrs. Barry, who played Roxana, thought herself entitled, an argument ensued between the two actresses, and Mrs. Barry dealt so forcible a blow with a dagger as to pierce through Mrs. Boutel's stays, and inflict a wound a quarter of an inch in length. During her active and busy career in the 1670s, she was according to the Biographical Dictionary of Actors generally considered a \\"very talented, popular, beautiful, and promiscuous young woman\\". Davies, in his 'Dramatic Miscellanies,' (vol. ii. p. 404), speaks of Mrs. Boutel as 'celebrated for the gentler parts in tragedy such as Aspatia in the \\"Maid's Tragedy.\\" ' No roles are recorded for her between March 1678 and April 1688. Her husband Barnaby Boutell had a lieutenant's commission from 1681, and the Biographical Dictionary of Actors speculates that she may have followed him to the Continent in the 1680s. Her last recorded role was with Thomas Betterton's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1696, where she played Thomyris in Cyrus the Great. In 1697 she left for Holland with her husband. She appears to have lived in comfort for some years subsequently. She made a will in 1714, which was proved the following year.

He was nominated to be a commissioner by President George W. Bush on April 30, 2001, and was confirmed on May 25, 2001. On March 16, 2005, President Bush designated him as FCC chairman, to replace Michael K. Powell. President Bush renominated Martin to a new five-year term on the Commission on April 25, 2006, and he was reconfirmed by the U.S. Senate on November 17, 2006. In January 2009, Martin announced that he would step down from the FCC and join the Aspen Institute, as a senior fellow in the think tank's Communications and Society Program.\\"FCC Chairman Kevin Martin to join Aspen Institute,\\" Associated Press, January 15, 2009. He since became a partner with the law firm Squire Patton Boggs LLP, and was hired as Facebook's head of U.S. Public Policy. Education Martin went to Charlotte Catholic High School. He earned a B.A. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (where he was elected student body president), an M.P.P. from Duke University, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School. He is a member of the Florida Bar, District of Columbia Bar and the Federal Communications Bar Association. Martin married Catherine Jurgensmeyer ; the couple reside in Washington, D.C. Prior offices Upon graduation from law school, Martin served as a judicial clerk for Judge William M. Hoeveler of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami. Before becoming a commissioner, Martin was a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. He served as the Deputy General Counsel to Bush-Cheney 2000, on the Bush-Cheney recount team in Florida, and on the presidential transition team. Before joining Bush-Cheney 2000, Martin served as legal advisor to FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, in the Office of the Independent Counsel, and as an associate of Wiley Rein LLP. Allegations of misconduct On December 10, 2008, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee released a 110-page report of a year-long investigation of the actions of Kevin Martin during his tenure as Chairman of the FCC. In January 2008, the Committee launched a bipartisan investigation after allegations of mismanagement from past FCC employees, representatives of the Telecommunications industry as well as from other FCC commissioners. The report was issued in lieu of hearings due to the fact that key witnesses were unwilling to testify or be identified by name. The report concluded that Martin did not violate any law, and did not show clear evidence of wrongdoing, although it criticized Martin for leading the commission with a \\"heavy-handed, opaque, and non-collegial management style [that] has created distrust, suspicion and turmoil among the five current commissioners.\\" It also stated that the Martin routinely violated travel rules by renting \\"premium class vehicles\\" and charging per diem work fees for days he was not working. The report further stated that on becoming the FCC Chairman in 2005, Martin manipulated information given to other Commissioners and to Congress. A specific example given was that Martin ordered FCC staff to reverse a study finding which initially stated \\"a la carte\\" cable programming would not benefit consumers. He also demoted the Media Bureau chief, who had been in charge of the study. According to the report, some of Martin's actions had led to price jumps for consumers of Telecommunications services. It said that Martin mismanaged a fund for telecommunications relay services which allow people with speech or hearing disabilities to communicate with hearing people. Accordingly, consumers were overcharged and providers were overcompensated more than $100 million a year. The fund, which is paid for by companies who then relay the charges to their consumers had grown to more than $800 million. The largest TRS provider, Sorenson Communications, Inc., handled roughly 80% of these services, thus stood to gain the most from this lack of oversight. A previous attempt by the FCC to audit Sorenson by a contractor was denied when Sorenson prevented access to staff and systems necessary to conduct the audit. A probe was later launched, and in May 2013 Sorenson settled the probe and was ordered to pay $15.75 million. The settlement followed a similar settlement by AT&T; that month where the company agreed to pay $18.25 million for similar overbilling. Legacy On January 15, 2009, Martin announced his resignation as the new Administration takes over. In a statement, he said his philosophy during his tenure at the FCC \\"has been to pursue deregulation while paying close attention to its impact on consumers and the particulars of a given market, to balance deregulation with consumer protection.\\" The statement notes what Martin accomplished during his tenure, including one promoting broadband, and specifically wireless broadband, and protecting consumers from harm, by issuing $150 million in fines, or more than any other chairman.http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-fcc-chairman-kevin-martin-to- resign-jan.-20/ Subsequent career Beginning in September 2009, Martin began serving on the Board of Directors of the telecommunications hardware company, Xtera Communications. In 2013, Martin was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/28/the-pro-freedom- republicans-are-coming-131-sign-gay-marriage-brief.html In 2018, Facebook hired Martin to be the interim head of its U.S. Public Policy team in Washington D.C.

Known as \\"The Father of the Port of Los Angeles,\\" he was one of the founders of the town of Wilmington, in Los Angeles County, California, which was named for his birthplace. His drive and ambition laid the foundations for what would become one of the busiest ports in the world. Besides operating a freighting business, Banning operated a stage coach line between San Pedro and Wilmington, and later between Banning, California, which was named in his honor, and Yuma, Arizona. During the Civil War, he ceded land to the Union Army to build a fort at Wilmington, the Drum Barracks. He was appointed a brigadier general of the First Brigade of the militia, and used the title of general for the rest of his life. Early life Banning was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the seventh of 11 children to John Alford Banning (1790–1851) and Elizabeth Lowber (1792–1861). At age 13, he moved to Philadelphia to work in his oldest brother's law firm. By his late teens, Banning was working on the dockyards of Philadelphia. At the age of 20, he signed up to work a passage to a then-exotic destination--Southern California.Krythe, M. (1957). Port admiral: Phineas Banning. San Francisco: California Historical Society. California and enterprise Banning's Landing, Wilmington, 1870 Banning arrived in San Pedro, California, in 1851, after a long land and sea journey that included crossing the isthmus of Panama before taking another ship to California. The 21-year-old was ambitious and worked in the fishing village of San Pedro, initially as a store clerk, and later as a stagecoach driver on the line that connected the hamlet with the pueblo of Los Angeles, a town of less than 2,000 people 20 miles (30 km) to the north.Queenan, C. (1986). Long Beach and Los Angeles: A tale of two ports. Northridge: Windsor Publications. Banning was elected to a one-year term on the Los Angeles Common Council, the governing body of that city, beginning May 10, 1858, and ending May 9, 1859.[ Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" Banning began his own staging and shipping company. By the 1860s, Banning stagecoach wagons were traveling to Salt Lake City, the Kern River gold fields, the new military installation at Yuma, Arizona, the Mormon settlement at San Bernardino, and in an arc around the Southern California region.Krythe, M. (1957). Port admiral: Phineas Banning. San Francisco: California Historical Society. Banning was not content to consolidate business interests in staging. He also began expanding the harbor and docks at San Pedro from their beginnings as illegal exchange sites for mission contraband during the Spanish and Mexican eras, and made them efficient enterprises. In the late 1850s Banning and a group of Southern California investors purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) of land adjacent to San Pedro for port expansion. The land purchase was incorporated as Wilmington, after Banning's Delaware birthplace, and his facility became known as Banning's Landing. Banning invested the profits from his trade networks into the development of a more sophisticated port complex and for the creation of roads, telegraphs, and other connections to Los Angeles. In 1859, the first ocean-going vessel anchored in Los Angeles-Wilmington harbor, and the 1860s saw the beginning of small-scale maritime trade between San Pedro and ships anchored in the deeper parts of the harbor. After government-funded dredging made a deep water harbor and breakwater a reality, the port continued to grow.Queenan, C. (1986). Long Beach and Los Angeles: A tale of two ports. Northridge: Windsor Publications. Family life In 1856, Banning married Rebecca Sanford (1837–1868), the younger sister of his first California employer. Phineas and Rebecca had eight children, of which three survived into adulthood--William Banning (1857–1946), Joseph Brent Banning (1862–1920), and Hancock Banning (1866–1925). Family life was relatively stable in the Banning household, and Phineas was a doting, if distant father to his three boys, who grew up around the expanding docks in San Pedro. Rebecca Banning died in childbirth in 1868, and the infant, Vincent Banning, died as well. Mary E. Hollister Banning In 1870, Banning married Mary Hollister (1846–1919), a wealthy heiress whose family lent their name to the city of Hollister, California. Phineas and Mary had three children, two of which survived to adulthood--Mary Hollister Banning (1871–1953) and Lucy Tichenor Banning (1873–1929). Southern California development: 1860–1880Civil War California= Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, several Southern states broke away to form the Confederate States of America, which marked the beginning of the American Civil War (1861–1865). The effects of the war were felt in California, and particularly in Los Angeles, which had many Southern sympathizers, an alarming development for the new territory. An astute businessman and a vocal patriot, Banning and fellow Californian politician Benjamin Wilson donated adjacent plots of land in Wilmington for a military base. The outpost, named Drum Barracks, or Camp Drum (1861–1871), served as headquarters for the Union's Southwestern command for the state of California and territory of Arizona. The move brought Union troops to Wilmington, further enriching Banning. He was nearly killed, along with his first wife Rebecca, when the boiler exploded on one of his packet steamers, the SS Ada Hancock, in 1863. After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Drum Barracks was decommissioned, but the port and harbor continued to grow. Banning was an avowed Unionist and was friends with Winfield Scott Hancock when Hancock was stationed in Los Angeles. Phineas' son Hancock was named after the general. The American government presented Banning with an honorary title, that of Brigadier General of the California First Brigade. The title was purely honorary, with no basis in military service, yet Banning insisted on being referred to as \\"General Banning\\" for the remainder of his life. =1870s: Railroads, industries, and breakwaters= Banning in 1883 Between 1868 and 1869 he organized the construction of Southern California's first railroad, the Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad which he sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1873. Banning spent the 1870s in a frenzy of activity. As a California state senator, he campaigned for greater transportation connections to the city of Los Angeles and the growing port, his personal project. Banning eventually pushed through a plan for a small railroad linking Wilmington/San Pedro with the main city of Los Angeles, effectively halving the time necessary for the trip, but the plan was short-lived. The Southern Pacific Railroad began building track to connect Southern California to the greater national railroad lines, and demanded much of Los Angeles' prime real estate, an enormous sum of money, and Banning's small connector line railroad in exchange for adding Los Angeles as a terminus on the railroad. Realizing that Los Angeles would wither into nothingness if the company bypassed it, the city complied and Banning surrendered his hard-earned railroad.Krythe, M. (1957). Port admiral: Phineas Banning. San Francisco: California Historical Society. Several personal successes marked the decade for Banning. The first breakwater was built for the nascent port in 1873, and Banning began to work for the Southern Pacific as a railroad agent. Final years By 1880, Banning had moved to Wilmington and managed several smaller business interests. He was in poor health for two years prior to his death, suffering from liver and kidney problems. His disease was aggravated by an accident in San Francisco, where he was knocked down and run over by an express wagon.Los Angeles Times, March 10, 1885, \\"Gen. Phineas Banning – Death of a Pioneer of Los Angeles County,\\" p. 1 Banning died at age 54 at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco.Ibid. He is interred in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles.Notable Interments & Their Families , Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Retrieved December 12, 2011 Legacy Banning's legacies lived on, and his dreams were realized with the federal approval of the Port of Los Angeles in the early 20th century, and the completion of a full breakwater in 1914, creating one of the world's busiest harbors. Banning's chief residence, constructed in Wilmington in 1864, is open to the public as a museum devoted to the Victorian era in California. See also *Banning House *SS Ada Hancock *David W.

The first geocoins were developed by Jon Stanley (aka moun10bike) as a signature item to be placed in caches. Many of these are made to be trackable on various websites to be able to show the movement around the world and visitors to be able to leave comments when they find the coin. Each coin has a unique tracking ID, which can also be used when logging it to a designated website. A geocoin typically has a diameter of to and a thickness between and . Coins with the size of are called microcoins, because they fit into microcaches (e.g. film canister). The smallest geocoins with a diameter of are called nanocoins, and have been sold since 2009. If the diameter is larger than the geocoin is called macrocoin, and contains the saying of \\"that's not a coin it's an anchor\\". Signature items A wooden geocoin Personal geocoins are a personal signature item that normally bears the geocacher's handle and personal design. For example, it was Jon Stanley's (aka moun10bike) original manufacture of a coin that started the hobby in the geocaching game. It has a stylized mountain bike and his caching handle, and on the back the geocaching logo. Geocoins are often minted by caching organizations and companies. Though not specifically a personal signature item they are a form of signature item for the organization that developed them. However, most are custom-made for geocachers, usually in batches of 100 pieces or less. Reviewer/Moderator/Lackey Coins are another form of signature items over the years these have their own following. Many of them have taken the time to create their own signature item. In the first few years the number of coins that were a signature item for a geocaching group, or individuals far outnumbered the coins that were made to sell. However now they tend to be smaller percentage as the industry has a number of coins manufacturers that develop coins for events, holidays, or special coins. The cost to make a personal coin is fairly high. Tracking websites When a cache listed at geocaching.com contains a geocoin, an icon (often unique to the type of the coin) is shown on the cache page's \\"Inventory\\" section. This icon will also appear in the inventory of any cacher holding one as well as in each cacher's historical trackable item listing. Icons will also remain in the inventory of cachers who log the 'discovery' of a geocoin's number without physically removing it from a cache. \\"Icon collecting\\" – the act of having these icons listed in one's trackables listing – is an associated hobby. Many people bring geocoins with unique icons to geocaching events so that others may see the coins and use the tracking number to collect the icons online, and it is not uncommon for collectors to activate some or all of the coins in their collections in order to have a matching online collection of icons associated with their geocaching.com accounts. Other websites for trackable coins have included the 2002Canadian geocoin, Utah geocoin, Oregon State coin, and sigitem.com. Free tracking service for coins and other items is available from Geokrety, with full service for geocaching sites such as opencaching.us, and partial service for other geocaching sites. An owner of geocoins can also set up his own website to monitor these moving mementos. Theft It is not uncommon for activated, released geocoins to go missing, whether because a cacher is unfamiliar with the logging and tracking process or due to outright theft. Some geocoin owners will purposefully attempt to destroy the resale value of the coin by drilling and tagging it with an extra tag, marker, or other item that is intended to underscore the fact that the geocoin is meant to travel, not to be kept. Another somewhat controversial anti-theft measure is to create a copy of the geocoin, releasing the copy and keeping the original. In 2012, a geocoin helped authorities return stolen items to a geocaching enthusiast in Seattle, who marked the coins as missing online. The goods were found in a storage unit during a raid and the geocoins became instrumental in connecting the burglars to their crime. History *September 30, 2001: The first trackable geocoin released was the Moun10Bike Version 1 Geocoin #002. The Moun10Bike Version 1 Geocoins are sought-after geocoins. They are all displayed on geocaching.com as owned by Moun10Bike and he has strictly forbidden their sale. * March 2002: The first geocoin that was produced and sold to the public to collect and release was the Canadian geocoin. * 2003: The first USAGeocoin was released for sale, making it one of the first geocoins that one can buy, release, and track online without minting an exclusive personal design. The proposed 2002 design was never made. * 2005: Geocaching.com permitted any geocaching.com user to purchase tracking numbers for approved designs, fueling a sudden surge in number of coins. Minimum purchase was initially set at 1000 tracking numbers. * Fall 2006: Groundspeak reduced the minimum purchase of tracking numbers, and the minimum number of coins minted to obtain a unique icon, to 250. The drop in the cost to create a geocoin with a unique icon fueled a 'geocoin craze' with hundreds of new personal, group and increasingly purely commercial designs minted. * February 17, 2007: The First Annual Geocoinfest was held in Temecula, California, USA. This event brought hundreds of geocoin collectors together for the first time in a mass event, with many exclusive coins being given away or traded. * Fall 2007: Geokrety.org began a free tracking service, Geokrety, for coins and other items, with full support for geocaching sites such as Opencaching.us and partial support for other geocaching sites. * March 4, 2009: Geocaching.com further reduced the minimum number of codes for purchase to 50, and the minimum number of coins eligible for a custom icon to 50. =Notable Geocoins= The second largest geocoin in the world *First Geocoin: Moun10Bike Coin, September 30, 2001 *First Geocoin for sale to public: Canada Geocoin Spring 2002 *Largest Geocoin (production run): Generic Coin Ø5\\" (~120mm) *Smallest Geocoin (production run, trackable): Europe Nano, 2009, Ø0.5\\" (~12mm), 1mm thick *Largest Single Coin (not a production run, trackable): It was handcrafted for the 2011 Geocaching mega event Geofarm in Switzerland.

It is one of the most important and highly regarded educational facilities in northwestern Germany and specialises in interdisciplinary and sustainable development studies and renewable energy studies with focus on solar and wind energy. German pronunciation  History  The first teachers training was held in Oldenburg as early as 1793, launched by Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig. A garden seminar for teachers training was created in 1882. During the Weimar Republic, the establishment of the Pedagogical Academy (Pädagogische Akademie) in Oldenburg in 1929 enabled the vocational training of teachers. On 1 October 1945 the institution reopened in postwar Germany. In 1948 it was renamed the Pedagogical College Oldenburg (Pädagogische Hochschule Oldenburg). The first step towards the university was taken on 23 February 1959 with the decision of the city council to launch a university project, which was followed in 1970 with the Memorandum establishing the University of Oldenburg from the Minister of Culture of Lower Saxony. The university was finally founded in 1973. Enrollment and teaching started in the summer semester of 1974, with an education curriculum for 2,400 students. In 1991, the university was officially named after pacifist, writer and Nobel laureate Carl von Ossietzky, having been denied to take on his name by previous (both left-leaning and right-leaning) state governments.WEST GERMAN UNIVERSITIES: WHAT TO CALL THEM? by John Vinocur, The New York Times, March 31, 1982 That same year, the number of students passed the mark of 10,000. The eleven departments of the university were reorganized into five faculties in 2002. By the end of 2011, there were about 11,325 students. In 2012, the university founded the faculty of medicine and health sciences, introducing a 12-semester course in human medicine, which leads up to the German state examination, Staatsexamen, a prerequisite to practice as a physician. The new faculty is part of the European Medical School Oldenburg-Groningen (EMS), a cooperation between the University of Oldenburg, the University of Groningen (Netherlands), and local hospitals.  University Profile  The main building of Uhlhornsweg campus The main building of Wechloy campus, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science The university offers 95 courses of study. Due to the Bologna Process, in 2004 Oldenburg adopted Bachelor and Masters degrees in place of the former Diplom and Magister. One main focus of the university is the schooling of teachers, which was established during the 1970s and remains a strong profile, with master's degrees for teaching offered in all faculties. The PhD program Didactical reconstruction is especially renowned, as is the research in sustainable development, encompassing several academic disciplines. The university is also allowed to confer Doctorates and oversee Habilitations. The campus is split into two locations, the major one being Uhlhornsweg, where the main library, the mensa and the administration along with most of the departments is housed. Having used the buildings of the former teaching college during the first years, the main buildings of the university were inaugurated in 1982, with ongoing extensions since then, including the main lecture hall in 2001. The Wechloy campus, also first opened in 1982, is home to the studies of natural sciences as well as the library of natural sciences. As part of the Universities Excellence Initiative, the university was awarded a Cluster of Excellence for its initiative Hearing4all. The cluster deals with research into the improvement of speech understanding in background noise and has a funding of €34 million.

UNICUM includes theatrical groups from the university as well as freelancers. The group Gegenlicht runs a cinema in the Old Aula and on campus during the summer, while the programme zwergWERK is focused on the presentation of short films. As in other German universities, the AStA is the most important organ of student representation. It administers the public transport tickets for the student body, offers several forms of student loans and organizes festivities. In addition, the AStA is continually involved in campaigns concerning university policy and social activism.  Canteens  The Studentenwerk Oldenburg operates canteens both the Uhlhornsweg and the Wechloy campus. These are certified by the BIO seal since January 2004. In the main cafeteria at Uhlhornsweg, four different dishes are available every day, as well as side dishes. In addition, different pasta is served daily, and a selection of high quality, self-composable, courts, at slightly higher prices, is available at the Culinarium. In 2001, the cafeteria at Uhlhornsweg took first place in the taste category and ended up in second place overall at the German-wide canteen ranking done by UNICUM magazine. The following years, it steadily dropped, but in 2008, it managed to return to second place overall, and again become first ranked in the taste category. In addition to the canteens, the Studentenwerk operates a large cafeteria on Uhlhornsweg campus. In Wechloy, canteen and cafeteria are combined in the same area.  International Partnerships  The first major cross-border cooperation was started in 1980 with the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. It has since then resulted in an especially far-reaching partnership, with several majors jointly offered by the two universities. The university participates in the ERASMUS programme, a partnership for student exchanges in Europe. It maintains cooperation agreements with 105 universities in 44 countries.  Awards  * The annual Klaus-von-Klitzing Award is jointly awarded by the university and the EWE-Foundation for special commitment in the teaching of natural sciences. Out of the 15.000 Euro prize money, 10.000 have to be invested into a teaching project. It is named for the German Nobel laureate Klaus von Klitzing. * Also annually during each Tag der Chemie (Chemistry Day), the Angelus-Sala Award is award to the high school students of the region who excelled n chemistry class. It is named for the physician and natural scientist Angelus Sala.

Brothers to the Rescue () is a Miami-based activist nonprofit right wing organization headed by José Basulto. Formed by Cuban exiles, the group is widely known for its opposition to the Cuban government and its former leader Fidel Castro. The group describes itself as a humanitarian organization aiming to assist and rescue raft refugees emigrating from Cuba and to \\"support the efforts of the Cuban people to free themselves from dictatorship through the use of active non-violence\\".Website of Brothers to the Rescue - Background and information Brothers to the Rescue, Inc., was founded in May 1991 \\"after several pilots were touched by the death of\\" fifteen-year-old Gregorio Perez Ricardo, who \\"fleeing Castro's Cuba on a raft, perished of severe dehydration in the hands of U.S. Coast Guard officers who were attempting to save his life.\\" The Cuban government accuses them of involvement in terrorist acts,Annex to the letter dated 29 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.

In 1996, two Brothers to the Rescue planes were shot down by the Cuban Air Force in international airspace. The incident was condemned internationally, including by the UN Security Council while the Cuban government defended the decision claiming the planes were there to destabilize Cuban government. The Castro-approved mission against Brothers to the Rescue was codenamed \\"Operation Scorpion.\\" HistoryHumanitarian missions= Sample political leaflet dropped by Brothers to the Rescue on Cuba in 1996. In its early years, the group actively rescued rafters from Cuba and claims to have saved thousands of Cubans, who were emigrating from the country. Eventually, the group's focus shifted after changes in US immigration policy meant that rafters would be sent back to Cuba. The group's founder has stated that after August 1995, it stopped seeing rafters in the water. Heavily dependent on funding for rafting activities, the group's funding rapidly dropped to $320,455 in 1995, down from $1.5 million the year before. As a result, the group focused more on civil disobedience against the Cuban government. At least once, the group's founder dropped leaflets on Cuba.Court testimony from the Cuban spy trial, referred in The Miami Herald March 13, 2001 at \\"Basulto testifies\\". Latin American Studies. =Roque and Wasp Network= One of the group's pilots, Cuban Juan Pablo Roque, a former major in the Cuban air force, unexpectedly left on February 23, 1996, the day before the two planes were shot down, and he turned up in Havana where he condemned the group. Roque had left Cuba four years earlier and was shortly after recruited by Brothers, where he flew several missions. Despite being dismissed as a Cuban agent by US officials, Roque denied working for the Cuban government and claimed to have returned home after being disillusioned with the Brothers. He claimed that they had plans to carry out attacks on military bases in Cuba and to disrupt its defence communications. Roque appeared on Cuban television on February 26, 1996, where he denounced the Brothers as an illegal and anti-Cuban organization the fundamental purpose of which is to provoke incidents that aggravated relations between Cuba and United States. In an interview with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), he stated that the group had planned to introduce anti- personnel weapons into Cuba and blow up high tension pylons to interrupt the energy supply.\\"Report on the shooting down of two U.S.-registered private civil aircraft by Cuban military aircraft on 24 February 1996\\", C-WP/10441, June 20, 1996, United Nations Security Council document, S/1996/509, July 1, 1996. While in Miami, Roque had contacts with and was paid by the FBI. His claims brought questions about the role of agencies such as the FBI and CIA in the activities of the exile community. However, White House spokesperson David Johnson said that \\"there does not exist, nor has there existed, any tie between the North American intelligence services and Hermanos al Rescate,\\" adding that the organization is \\"not a front\\" for those services, nor is it financed by them.\\"U.S. TIGHTENS SANCTIONS AGAINST CUBA AFTER DOWNING OF TWO EXILE PLANES OFF CUBAN COAST\\".

Rene Gonzalez, another Wasp Network spy, also infiltrated Brothers to the Rescue and regularly sabotaged aircraft and reported on its activities until his subsequent arrest. =1996 shootdown incident= On February 24, 1996, two of the Brothers to the Rescue Cessna Skymasters involved in releasing leaflets to fall on Cuba, were shot down by a Cuban Air Force MiG-29UB. Four people were killed. They were pilots Carlos Costa; Armando Alejandre, Jr.;Mario de la Peña; and Pablo Morales. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel after the shoot down, Roque has lived in a government- provided Havana home with security since the incident. In an interview with The Miami Herald in 2012, he expressed remorse for the shootdown. \\"If I could travel in a time machine,\\" he said, \\"I'd get those boys off the planes that were shot down.\\" In 1999, he was indicted on federal charges of defrauding the FBI and failing to register as a foreign agent. However, Cuba has refused to extradite him. To this day, the Cuban exile community in South Florida considers Roque a traitor.

It is present in about 89 countries.Bazelon, Emily. Edwina Froehlich, b. 1915. Founding Mothers. New York Times, December 28, 2008. Retrieved September 2, 2009. The aim of the charity is to provide mother to mother support and recognises the importance of mothering through breastfeeding, especially in a social culture where motherhood and breastfeeding are often not valued. This of course includes a mixture of modern family set ups and feeding options, and major efforts have been made in recent years by the charity to improve diversity and equality so it is accessible to all who seek support with their breastfeeding goals. History The organization was founded in 1956 by Marian Tompson, Mary White, Mary Ann Cahill, Edwina Froehlich, Mary Ann Kerwin, Viola Lennon, and Betty Wagner. Later, other professionals joined and supported the group - Dr. Herbert Ratner and Dr. Gregory White.Medicine: An Interview by Donald McDonald with Herbert Ratner, M.D. One of a Series of Interviews on the American Character. Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Comment by Scott Buchanan. Santa Barbara, California: Fund for the Republic, May 1962. Herbert Ratner was influential in expanding the organization's philosophy beyond breastfeeding. At the time, most women bottle-fed their babies. At the time the organization was founded, only 20% of babies were breastfeeding in the United States. The first formal La Leche League meeting was held on October 17, 1956 in Illinois. The seven Leaders originally held meetings in private homes; more recently, hospitals, parenting centers, and other public venues have provided meeting spaces. In 1957, Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, considered the father of the natural childbirth movement, also came to speak with them. The first La Leche League Group outside of the United States formed in 1960 in Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada. The La Leche League became La Leche League International, Inc. (LLLI) in 1964 with groups in Canada, Mexico and New Zealand. In 1964 the first international conference was held in Chicago with 425 adults and 100 babies in attendance. In 1981 LLLI was granted consultative status with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In 1985 LLLI served on the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners, established to develop and administer a voluntary certification program for lactation consultants. The first IBLCE exam was administered in July 1985. The name \\"La Leche\\" comes from the Spanish word leche [pronounced leh-cheh] meaning milk. It was inspired by a shrine in St. Augustine, Florida, dedicated to \\"Nuestra Señora de la Leche y Buen Parto\\", meaning \\"Our Lady of Happy Delivery and Plentiful Milk\\". Group meetings were held by a Leader, someone approved by LLLI to run the meetings and moderate the discussion that would take place. LLLI grew from a local, to a national, and then an international organization that has been helping thousands of mothers and babies all over the world for more than 60 years. Philosophy and mission The mission of LLLI is \\"to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education, and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother.\\" The following are statements of LLLI's philosophy: * Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby. * Mother and baby need to be together early and often to establish a satisfying relationship and an adequate milk supply. * In the early years the baby has an intense need to be with his mother, which is as basic as its need for food. * Human milk is the natural food for babies, uniquely meeting their changing needs. * For the healthy, full-term baby, breast milk is the only food necessary until the baby shows signs of needing solids, about the middle of the first year after birth. * Ideally the breastfeeding relationship will continue until the baby outgrows the need. * Alert and active participation by the mother in childbirth is a help in getting breastfeeding off to a good start. * Breastfeeding is enhanced and the nursing couple sustained by the loving support, help, and companionship of the baby's father. A father's unique relationship with his baby is an important element in the child's development from early infancy. * Good nutrition means eating a well-balanced and varied diet of foods in as close to their natural state as possible. * From infancy on, children need loving guidance which reflects acceptance of their capabilities and sensitivity to their feelings.  Services  The primary purpose of LLLI is to encourage, inform, and support mothers primarily via meetings, telephone help, Skype, Facebook, W app, helpforms and e-mail. Some Leaders also do home and/or hospital visits. LLLI leaders are accredited volunteers who have breastfed their own babies and have been specially trained to help mothers with breastfeeding. Leaders keep up-to-date through continued training and study of the most current medical research on breastfeeding. Leaders organize group meetings, where mothers are encouraged to share their own experiences with other mothers. A common theme repeated by Leaders at a LLLI meeting is \\"take what you like and leave the rest,\\" acknowledging that every mother-baby dyad is unique and each mother knows her own baby best. In most countries with a LLL-presence, Leaders also offer telephone help, online meetings, Facebook groups, email help and several types of personal help. In some locales, there is a centralized phone number (for an entire country or a US state, for example) where mothers can either receive help directly or be referred to a Leader in her area. In other areas, these Leaders directly publicize their telephone numbers, and sometimes e-mail addresses, via the LLLI website, FB groups, telephone directories, and posters in parenting centres, libraries, physicians' and midwives' offices, health centres and other places where pregnant women and new parents might seek information. Mothers may also submit questions or concerns through online Help Forms available on the LLLI website. The last LLLI International Conference took place July 2007 in Chicago, and included a seminar for health care professionals. Currently emphasis is on Area parenting and nursing conferences, held in many parts of the world every year. Some Areas offer continuing education seminars for health care professionals in addition to ongoing training for Leaders. Currently LLLI publishes a bimonthly nursing and parenting journal, Breastfeeding Today, available online and by link to members worldwide. LLLI's core publications are The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding (now in its 8th edition), \\"Feed Yourself Feed Your Family\\" and \\"Sweet Sleep\\". =International= La Leche League International is a core partner starting the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA). =Argentina= Liga de La Leche Argentina was founded in 1978. =Austria= La Leche League Österreich was founded in 1979. =Belgium/Flanders= La Leche League Vlaanderen was founded in 2011. =Belarus= Olga Prominski founded La Leche League of Belarus in 2011 =Bulgaria= Tanya Ruseva became the first La Leche League Leader in Bulgaria in 2005.http://blog.gorichka.bg/?p=127 This is the official birth year of La Leche League Bulgaria.

The first group in GB was started in Leicester in 1973 by an American Leader, Anne Harrison, who was living in Britain. Toward the end of the 1970s, it was suggested that LLLGB become an autonomous organization. It would remain affiliated to LLLI and would be identical or very similar in structure with the same commitments to the same mothering philosophy. The philosophy would remain intact, along with the structure of meetings, and Leader support.http://www.lalecheleague.org.uk During 1980 discussions continued and a meeting in April decided that La Leche League could best meet the needs of mothers and babies in Britain as a fully autonomous organisation with a democratically elected Board of Directors, ideally affiliated with LLLI. There were approximately 70 Leaders at this time and this was the majority view with a minority feeling few changes were necessary. Some Leaders had gone ahead with a decision to set up a separate organisation and on July 2, 1980 the inaugural meeting was held of the Association of Nursing Mothers which then formed a break-away group. LLL GB maintains links with LLL Europe, including Future Areas in Europe, LLL International Division (ID) and the other Affiliates as well as LLL International.

She was also known for her contributions to nursing in her home state of Georgia and as a Peace Corps volunteer in India as well as writing two books during the Carter presidency. Nurse and mother Carter was born Bessie Lillian Gordy on August 15, 1898 in Richland, Georgia, to James Jackson Gordy (1863–1948) and Mary Ida Nicholson Gordy (1871–1951). She was the niece of Berry Gordy I, who was the paternal half-brother of James Jackson Gordy and the grandfather of Motown Records founder Berry Gordy. She volunteered to serve as a nurse with the U.S. Army in 1917 but the program was cancelled. Instead, she worked for the US Post Office at Richland before moving to Plains, Georgia in 1920 where she was accepted as a trainee at the Wise Sanitarium before completing her nursing degree at the Grady Memorial Hospital School of Nursing in Atlanta, Georgia in 1923. Lillian's family initially disapproved of her choice of a career in nursing, but she continued her training and became very successful, earning the respect of both the black and white communities. \\"Miss Lillian\\", as she was often known, allowed black people to enter her home through the front door, rather than through the back door as was the social norm, and would often have them in her living room for casual conversation just as she would a white neighbor. These conversations would even continue after her husband Earl was to arrive home expecting the guests to depart. Lillian Carter said that the strongest influence on her liberal views was her father. James Jackson Gordy, \\"Jim Jack\\" operated a Post Office in Lillian's hometown of Richland and was always cordial and often dined with the black workers. This was very unusual in the early 20th century but Lillian decided that she would follow her father's example. She met businessman James Earl Carter and married him immediately after her graduation. The couple had four children: Jimmy (born in 1924), Gloria (1926–1990), Ruth (1929–1983), and Billy (1937–1988). While she theoretically retired from nursing in 1925, in reality she worked as what was then called a nurse practitioner both for the hundreds of employees back in her husband's businesses and for the members of Plains community. While a religious woman, Carter was not a regular attender of church services. After some sisters at the local church organized a mission trip to Africa, Carter became upset saying that there was plenty to be done in the US before traveling to another country. She coordinated her own Bible study at home on Sunday mornings while the rest of the family attended church. After the death of her husband from pancreatic cancer, Lillian Carter left for Auburn University where she worked for several years as a dormitory housemother. A year after completing her service at Auburn, Carter managed a nursing home in Blakely, Georgia. Carter later became a social activist, working for desegregation and providing medical care to African-Americans in Plains, Georgia. Peace Corps volunteer In 1966, at the age of 68, Carter applied for the Peace Corps. After completing a psychiatric evaluation, she received three months of training and was sent to India where she worked at the Godrej Colony from Mumbai. Lillian worked in the Godrej Colony for 21 months, during which she aided patients afflicted by leprosy. Emory University established the Lillian Carter Center for International Nursing in honor of the work she did in India. The Atlanta Regional Office of the Peace Corps has named an award in her honor for volunteers over 50 who make the biggest contribution. =Presidential mother= With Jimmy Carter, 1977 When Jimmy Carter decided to run for president, his mother was one of the first people he told. He was initially regarded as a dark horse candidate for the Democratic Party nomination. Lillian Carter was well known as \\"Miss Lillian\\" and she published two books during his presidency: Miss Lillian and Friends and Away from Home: Letters to my Family, both published in 1977. The latter book was a collection of letters to her family sent when she was in India for the Peace Corps. \\"Miss Lillian\\" was a favorite of the press for her Southern charm and down-to-earth manner. For reporters and interrogators alike, she always had a warm, sassy response for every question. One biographer recalls a story about an encounter between Carter and a reporter from New York who flew to Plains to meet her during her son's 1976 campaign to become the U.S. president: In 1977, Lillian Carter appeared in a cameo as herself in the made-for-TV movie Lucy Calls the President starring Lucille Ball. When son Billy's beer business had its ribbon-cutting ceremony, a friend questioned Carter on whether or not she would attend. She remarked: \\"I attended Jimmy's inauguration didn't I?\\" Together with vice-president Walter Mondale, Lilian Carter was head of the U.S. delegation to the funeral of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. Final years and death Shortly after her eldest son left office in January 1981, Carter was diagnosed with breast cancer. While her cancer was in remission in April 1983, her younger daughter, Ruth Stapleton, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died on September 26, 1983, at 54. Carter herself succumbed to breast, bone and pancreatic cancers a month later on October 30, 1983, at age 85 in Americus, Georgia. Her three surviving children were by her side at her death. Carter was buried in a simple six-minute ceremony at Lebanon Church Cemetery, on November 1, 1983, next to her husband, who died 30 years before her. In addition to her husband, three of her children, Gloria Carter Spann, Billy Carter, and Ruth Carter Stapleton, also died from pancreatic cancer. The former president was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, at the age of 90. In 2010, he had a severe stomach ache which was mistaken as that disease. He has been a fund-raiser and booster for research into a cure for the disease. In 2001, a major nursing center was dedicated in her honor in Plains by Jimmy Carter in recognition of her first years of service to the community as a nurse. In 2011 she was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement.
