Her work is located at the intersection of photography, film, sculpture, contemporary dance and theatre. Bettina Hoffmann creates video tableaux and performances to facilitate the examination of the underlying mechanisms of social relations, conflicts and communication. Her work is centred on people and the human body; movements, subtle gestures, body language, distance and proximity, with an interest in ambiguous movements and actions that shift between violence and sensuality. She is developing her work through experimentation and in the process introduces rules that impose or limit a participant’s use of specific body parts, which leads towards unusual, sometimes unsettling movements and situations. She is recognized for the use of unfamiliar camera perspectives and slow and steady camera movements.

It makes as-is cash offers to property sellers through an online process, improves and repairs the properties it purchases, and relists them for sale.  Business Model  Property owners bid to sell their properties on the online platform. When a bid is accepted, Opendoor purchases the property as-is, charging a fee slightly above the commissions real estate agents collect in return for the convenience of closing a sale quickly. Opendoor then makes improvements to the property and makes any necessary repairs before relisting the property. The process is known in the real-estate market as \\"iBuyer\\", or Instant Buyer. Through this process, Opendoor carries an inventory of homes, though it aims to limit the number of homes it owns at any given time. In 2019, the company reported that the average time a property is held by the company is 90 days. The company has considered renting properties to make use of excess inventory.  History  The company was founded in March 2014 by serial entrepreneurs Keith Rabois, Eric Wu, who previously founded Movity, a real-estate startup acquired by Trulia, and Justin Ross a general partner at Atomic. After raising a $9.95m venture capital round led by Khosla Ventures in May 2014, the company began operations. In 2018, Opendoor raised $400m in funding from the SoftBank Group Vision Fund. In 2019, Opendoor raised $300m in a funding round led by General Atlantic. At the time, the enterprise valuation was $3.8b. In 2020, Opendoor laid off 600 employees, which makes up 35% of its team, partially due to business impact from the COVID-19 shutdown. In March, Opendoor announced they would suspend home buying during the COVID-19 pandemic out of concerns for the safety of their customers. Opendoor resumed their iBuyer program in Phoenix, AZ on May 4th & Raleigh-Durham, NC on May 11th. Opendoor has since resumed purchasing in multiple cities.

Despite being mentioned by medieval Arabic chroniclers, awareness about this ancestral identity has gradually vanished over the ages and is not not very well known or shared among contemporary Berbers. The Barānis are, according to Ibn Khaldun, further divided into following main groups: Awraba, ʿAd̲j̲īsa, Azdād̲j̲a, Maṣmūda-G̲h̲umāra. Belonging of another three groups, such as Kutāma-Zawāwa, Ṣanhāja, Hawwāra is controversial. The name Barānis is a plural form of their eponymous forefather, Burnus, who is described as son of Māzīgh b. Can‘ān, a legendary Berber ancestor. The place of origin of the Baranis is unknown, the first area, where the groups of Baranis are historically located, is the massif of Awrās in today’s Eastern Algeria, from where they started to migrate across North Africa at the time of Arab conquest in the 7th century. Ibn Khaldun considered the Baranis as sedentary people and the ancestors of sedentary Berbers, while the other group, the Butr, were considered the ancestors of nomadic Berbers.  History of Baranis' sub-groups  The Awraba migrated from Awrās to northern parts of today’s Morocco, where they supported the foundation of Idrisid rule. The Ghumara settled in the Rif mountains, where they live to these days. The Azdadja have settled north of Tlemcen in today’s western Algeria and their chiefs controlled the area around the port of Wahran/Oran before the city was founded in the early 10th century. The Ṣanhāja were a large group, the sedentary part of them is later known to live in the area of today's north-eastern Algeria. From among them came the Zirid dynasty, which ruled as governors of Ifrikiya for Fatimid caliphs, after the Fatimids moved their capital to Egypt. Another well-known dynasty of this branch of the Sanhaja were the Hammadids, who established their power as Zirid emirs, first in 987 in Ashir, and from 1007/1008 around Qalaat Beni Hammad. The Kutāma also lived in north-eastern Algeria and were the principal pillar of Fatimid military power, especially in the beginnings of their caliphate. During medieval period the awareness or claims of Baranis ancestry diminished and were . In 1595-6, the Baranis are mentioned to revolt against the Saadi Sultan of Morocco Ahmad al-Mansūr, but were mercilessly crushed Religiously, some of the Baranis were said to be Christian during the Arab conquest of North Africa, but by the 10th century they converted to Islam.

The Act received the Royal Assent on 7 February 1957 and Ghana came into being on 6 March 1957. Independence within the British Commonwealth could not be attained by a dependent territory like Gold Coast without legislation passed at Westminster. The main provisions of the Act closely follow the Statute of Westminster and the Ceylon Independence Act 1947. The grant of independence to the Gold Coast was achieved by two separate legislative operations, namely, the passing of the Act and the making of the Ghana (Constitution) Order in Council 1957. A matter that complicated the legislation was that what was to become Ghana was not a single, constitutional unit but rather four distinct areas: The Gold Coast Colony which was a Crown Colony and therefore part of Her Majesty's dominions; the Ashanti Colony which was likewise a Crown Colony and part of Her Majesty's dominions; the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast which was a British Protectorate and not part of Her Majesty's dominions; and British Togoland which was a United Nations trust territory and not part of Her Majesty's dominions. With respect to the Northern Territories, the legislation terminated the agreements with the native Chiefs on which the protectorate status was based. With respect to British Togoland, a referendum was held to determine the consent of its people to being united with the rest of what would become Ghana. With effect from when the Act entered into force all of what became Ghana became part of Her Majesty's dominions as a single, unified dominion. The independence legislation began to take shape following the return of the Convention People's Party to power at the Gold Coast general election of 1954. The party won 79 out of 104 seats. The Gold Coast government expressed its hope of achieving independence within the lifetime of the new assembly. A dispute within the Gold Coast about the form of Constitution after independence was still unresolved as late as 1956. The same year the United Kingdom government publicly stated that provided it had the support of a \\"reasonable majority\\", the United Kingdom was prepared to legislate for the Gold Coast to have independence within the British Commonwealth. The Secretary of State for the Colonies added that \\"[f]ull membership of the Commonwealth is, of course, a different question and is a matter for consultation between all existing members of the Commonwealth.\\" This distinction reflected the view that full Commonwealth membership required the consent of all Commonwealth members. Ultimately, the attainment by Ghana of full Commonwealth membership was consented to unanimously by all of the Commonwealth's members. This Commonwealth's agreement to this was announced by the United Kingdom prime minister on 21 February 1956. Letters patent constituting the office of the Governor-General of Ghana and royal instructions to the Governor General were issued on 23 February 1956 and became effective on 6 March 1956. An Order in Council provided Ghana with its first constitution. The 6 March independence date was chosen for its historical significance: On 6 March 1844, a group of chiefs in Ghana had signed a treaty with the then British governor. That treaty, which became known as the Bond, came to symbolise the sovereignty of the local government of indigenous authorities.

She treats him abominably, and is at the end of the book unmasked as an imposter and murderer who has used Bohun as a stepping stone to better things.

This he considered to be untenable for a variety of reasons including the lack of any possible resemblance between Mercer's first wife and the villain, the lack of similarity of events, and the fact that the author was very happily remarried by the time he wrote the book and would hardly have waited years to reopen any old wound.

While many remain in the present day, large numbers were demolished and redeveloped during the slum clearances of the 1960s and 1970s and of those that survived, many have since been refurbished. Georgian eraEarly housing= Facade of 10 Hockenhall Alley, in a derelict state, November 2018 One of the earliest surviving houses in Liverpool is believed to be 10 Hockenhall Alley, a three-storey house originally forming part of a short terraced row. Built some time around the late 18th century, the house was Grade II listed in December 2008 due to its rarity and retention of some original features, such as narrow timber winder stair and lath and plaster ceilings. The alley was laid out off Dale Street some time between 1765 and 1785, as one of Liverpool's seven medieval streets. The surrounding houses were demolished during the 1880s, following which the house saw use as a pharmacy and clock workshop. Plans were submitted in 2015 to convert a nearby warehouse into a hostel, using number 10 Hockenall Alley as its reception. =Back-to-back courts= The first back-to-back houses built in Liverpool are believed to be around the 1780s. Typically built with limited space requirements, a typical house measured with a cellar, ground floor kitchen and bedrooms above. The size variations can be seen on old maps, such as from the early 20th century, showing back-to-back court houses on Hampton Street next to newer Victorian terraces on Upper Stanhope Street. Early in the Victorian era, the Select Committee on the Health of Towns reported in 1840 that Liverpool's court housing were unventilated, had minimal sanitary provisions and were filthy. Water was from a single communal pipe that could be cut-off if the landlord fell into debt. From 1861, Liverpool banned the construction of back-to-back houses. The last surviving back-to-back court houses are in Pembroke Place, then known as Watkinson Terrace, with just two surviving houses in a former court of eight, now used as a rear shop extension. Historic maps show how the arrangement used to be, compared to the present day. The houses, coupled with the shops they are attached to, were given listed building status in September 2009. Originally with basements, they were later infilled with interiors described as sparse with little decorative detail and are likely among the last constructed. Victorian era OS first edition map of Pembroke Place, Liverpool in 1850 In the early 1800s, around 40% of the population lived in cellar dwellings, known even at that time to be of poor living quality. Construction of court housing expanded between 1820–1840, responding to the rapid population growth of largely poor and unskilled workers. By 1840, around 86,000 people lived in court housing, believed to be the largest area in England of purpose-built housing for the working-class. By 1850, there were over 20,000 Welsh builders working in Liverpool who required housing. Land in Toxteth was leased for housing development, with many streets, such as the current day Welsh Streets and Granby Streets, designed by Richard Owens and built by David Roberts, Son and Co. Owens came into contact with Roberts' company around 1867, who were land surveyors and subsequently they became dominant in Liverpool's housebuilding industry. Through his collaboration with David Roberts, Owens designed over 10,000 terraced houses around the city of Liverpool. By the mid 1800s, many people working in the city were employed on a casual basis with no fixed or guaranteed income, meaning a higher likelihood of experiencing poverty. Liverpool was notorious during this time for squalor and was the first city in the country to build public housing, starting in 1869 with St Martin's Cottages, which were four- storey, self-contained tenemants although considered bleak in appearance. The development, which technically breached housing bye-laws, renewed public interest in the problems Liverpool faced with housing, both quantity and quality as well as encouraging councils in other parts of the country to follow a similar example with their own house building schemes. The 1891 census reported that outside of London, Liverpool had the highest number of dwellings and among the highest levels of overcrowding in major cities. 20th centuryInter-war period= In 1919, Liverpool contained some of the worst slum housing in the country, with severe overcrowding that meant 11,000 families, representing 6.4% of the population, resided in single-room dwellings. Liverpool had consistently ranked the highest of major cities where families lived in a single room throughout the first 30 years of the 20th century. Housing stock owned by the council was less than 3000 dwellings. During the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, housing construction in Liverpool resulted in over 33,000 council houses being built, accommodating 140,000 local residents, roughly 15% of the total population. The city is recognised as being the first in the country to build council houses following World War I, typically sized between , although had above national average figures for families living more than 2 people per room, at nearly 1-in-8 in 1921. Many people were not fortunate enough to reside in the new homes and by 1933, around 30,000 people still lived in condemned court and cellar dwellings. =Post war housing construction= Following World War II, the city saw many prefabricated houses built, intended to house people displaced after bombing destroyed many homes. Construction of prefabricated high-rise flats began during the mid 1950s, particularly as there was a shortage of land available for housing. The first tall high-rise was Logan Towers, built in 1966 in Kirkdale and was the tallest of its kind in the world. The tower block was named after local MP David Logan and was supported by the Logan family, as it meant residents were able to remain close to where their homes had been demolished through slum clearance, as opposed to being resettled further out in areas such as Kirkby. =Economic decline= Following the slum clearances of the 1950s and 1960s, the succeeding two decades became a period of economic decline, as industries collapsed and public funding was cut. Unemployment in Liverpool was high and people left the city to find work, while remaining residents saw conditions in their housing estates decline through poor management and funding. In 1986, Member of Parliament for Liverpool Riverside Robert Parry asserted that Liverpool's housing expenditure declined in the late 20th century, suggesting every £1 spent in 1979 prior to the Conservatives winning the 1979 general election had fallen to 26p in the pound by 1985. The expenses claim was disputed by Sir George Young, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, who declared that government expenditure in Liverpool had risen to just over £1 billion, from £718 million since 1979, although accepted that Liverpool's housing problems were \\"among the worst in the country\\". In 1985, Liverpool bid for £132 million () to help address its urgent housing problems, yet received just £31 million (). Liverpool suffered with a large number of vacant properties during the 1980s, with 2,178 houses, representing 3.35% of the total, being vacant in 1984. An opportunity arose through the Housing Act 1988 which supported the possibility of establishing a Housing action trust for Liverpool that would receive funds directly for housing stock, rather than via the council. A ballot was held in each of the 71 tower blocks, requiring a majority decision to leave control of the council; 67 tower blocks and 83% of the total amount balloted voted to leave council control and in October 1993, the Liverpool Housing Action Trust was founded. A 1996 study concluded that the cost to refurbish the tower blocks would be around £300 million, a decision which was rejected following tenant consultation resulting in 54 blocks being demolished, while 13 were retained and refurbished. 21st century Demolition of high-rise flats in Croxteth, pictured in 2007 After funding was withdrawn from the Housing Market Renewal Initiative following the formation of the coalition government in 2010, demolition and renewal schemes were abandoned, leaving some only partly finished and neighbourhoods half demolished. Houses in some areas, such as the Granby Streets, were acquired by Liverpool City Council and left to fall further into disrepair. Refurbishment work of numerous derelict structures has occurred since 2010. A derelict army barracks on Everton Road was proposed to be refurbished into office space and residential accommodation of 50 new homes, with the council considering a proposal from One Vision Housing to provide affordable homes for rental and purchase for key workers, army veterans and local people. In June 2019, it was announced that the council would begin building council houses for the first time in over 30 years, with Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson pledging to build 10,000 in total, of which a proportion would include social housing for rent. The council stated they needed to develop 30,000 new houses by 2030.

Bloomington architect Arthur L.

The building's design includes a large, detailed Gothic arched main entrance with towering piers at each side, large windows with limestone surrounds, and projecting piers at the front corners and side entrances. In 1936-37, an addition funded by the Works Progress Administration was added to the building; the addition was designed by Schaeffer & Hooten, a descendant of Pillsbury's firm, and matched the style of the original building. The building served as Bloomington's main high school until a new building opened in 1959. It then became a junior high school and remained so until it closed in 1990.

World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, Gryaznov was released from the academy and appointed officer for errands under the Western Front commander- in-chief, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko. He became commander of the 64th Rifle Division on 15 July, which he led as part of the 44th Rifle Corps in fighting near Yartsevo during the Battle of Smolensk. For its \\"courage in battle,\\" the division became the 7th Guards Rifle Division, and Gryaznov commanded the latter in the Battle of Moscow as part of the 49th and 16th Armies of the front. Serving as commander of the 1st Guards Rifle Corps from 2 January 1942, he was promoted to major general eight days later. Gryaznov led the corps in the Demyansk Offensive against the German troops in the Demyansk Pocket as part of the Northwestern Front, but was relieved of command on 22 May 1942 after his corps failed to destroy the encircled forces. After a month awaiting assignment, Gryaznov became commander of the 14th Guards Rifle Division on 23 June. Between August and October 1942 he led the division as part of the 63rd Army in the defensive phase of the Battle of Stalingrad. The division subsequently fought in Operation Uranus and Operation Little Saturn as part of the 21st Army and the 1st and 3rd Guards Armies of the Southwestern Front during late 1942 and early 1943. After serving temporarily commanding the 14th Rifle Corps from 24 December, Gryaznov was appointed commander of the 15th Rifle Corps on 15 January 1943. He led it as part of the 6th Army of the Southwestern Front in Operation Gallop, during which it captured Kupyansk and Balakleya. Injured in a car accident on 28 March, he was evacuated to a hospital in Moscow. After recovering from his injuries, Gryaznov was appointed commander of the 47th Rifle Corps on 25 June 1943. He led it as part of the 40th Army of the Voronezh Front in the Battle of Kursk and the Belgorod–Kharkov Offensive. Hospitalized due to illness between 18 September and 9 November, Gryaznov was placed at the disposal of the Personnel Directorate after recovering. He became commander of the 99th Rifle Corps, part of the 21st Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, on 20 December. In April, the corps was sent to the Leningrad Front with the army, and on the 15th of that month Gryaznov was transferred to command the 110th Rifle Corps, which he commanded for the rest of the war. The corps fought in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, the Baltic Offensive, and the blockade of the Courland Pocket. He was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, for his leadership of the corps in the Riga Offensive. In the recommendation for the award, his superior, 42nd Army commander Vladimir Sviridov, wrote that Gryaznov \\"fulfilled the assigned objectives with few casualties\\".  Postwar  After the end of the war, Gryaznov continued to command the corps, which was relocated to the Odessa Military District in August 1945. In October he became commander of the 82nd Rifle Corps of the district, and in May 1946 was appointed a senior professor at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy (the former Military Academy of the General Staff). This would be his last post, as he was transferred to the reserve on 11 January 1954. Gryaznov lived in Moscow, where he died on 11 September 1969.

Plot  The book deals with the history of a noble family from about the time of Victoria's Diamond Jubilee until after the Second World War, much of it related by the governess, Miss Carson.  Background  Mercer was very much not in sympathy with the new post-war order, and having received many letters from readers asking him to write again of the ‘old days’ he once again returned to his preferred period with this novel. He wrote to a correspondent, “What we used to call the nobility and gentry of England have been so monstrously misaligned and misrepresented for so long that I felt it was only right that some author of standing should present a true picture of them and their habits and manners before it was too late\\".  Critical reception  Mercer’s autobiographer AJ Smithers acknowledged “Mercer's mild obsession with the kind of people whom he ranked only a little lower than the angels.” He noted that the author’s ideas had been formed well before 1914 and they were never mitigated. By the time Mercer was thirty he “had seen a good cross-section of the gentry of England and ... he preserved it like a fly in amber.” The book was not a great success, appearing to a new generation of post-war readers to be a caricature completely divorced from present reality.

He played college football for the University of Houston. Early years Carr played tailback for The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas. Wearing jersey #1, Carr was a four-year letterer and a three-year starter for the Highlanders football team. During his career, he rushed for 5,202 yards and 51 touchdowns, breaking the previous school record made by future NFL player Daniel Lasco. He received multiple honors, including All-County Sophomore MVP, second-team all- state, District Most Valuable Player, and first-team all-district at some point in his high school career. Carr was ranked the 93rd best player in the nation and was listed as a 3-star recruit by the end of his senior season. He committed to the University of Colorado over offers from Arkansas, Arizona State, Iowa, Kentucky, Oregon, Texas A&M;, Texas Tech, TCU, and Wake Forest. Carr also played football alongside fellow NFL player Antoine Winfield Jr., who played safety for The Woodlands. He was also a four-year letterer in track, where he received state honors in the 100-meter dash, the 4x100 relay race, the 4x200 relay race, and the field event long jump. Carr additionally lettered in soccer as a freshman but left the team before the end of the season to focus on other sports. College career Carr played in all 12 games as a true freshman for the Colorado Buffaloes and had 272 rushing yards on 66 carries with four touchdowns. Carr finished the season being named Colorado’s freshman player of the year and was on the all-NCAA 2nd team freshman roster. However, Carr transferred to the University Of Houston following a family incident that left him wanting to return to his hometown. After sitting out a season due to NCAA transfer regulations, Carr played sparingly as a reserve tailback for the Houston Cougars, rushing 26 yards on 4 carries in his sophomore year. He was bumped to a shared starting position with Mulbah Car as a junior, seeing time in all games and leading his team in rushing yards with 868 yards for 5 touchdowns on 151 carries, averaging 5.7 yards per carry. He reclaimed his starting role at the beginning of his senior year, but ended up missing most of the season due to injury and was only able to start three games. Regardless, he recorded 380 yards and 5 touchdowns on 67 carries, again averaging 5.7 yards per carry. He was also a selection for the 2017-2018 All-American academic team. He finished his career with 1,546 yards for 13 touchdowns on 227 carries, averaging 6.0 yards per carry. Professional career Although Carr ultimately went undrafted, he agreed to sign with the Seattle Seahawks hours following the 2020 NFL Draft. He officially signed with the team on May 4, 2020. He was waived on July 26, 2020, but was re-signed on August 14, 2020. He was waived/injured on August 31, 2020, and subsequently reverted to the team's injured reserve list the next day.

An expert in candle making, he is noted for being a candlemaker to the British royal family for over 30 years and for British and Hollywood films and television. Constable is also a well-known educator in the art of candlemaking and has authored several books which have been translated into 10 languages. Early life and career Constable was born in London in 1939. At the age of 17 he went to live in Germany for several years where he became fascinated by the variety of candles being made there. Returning to London in the early 1960s he found an absence of candle shops and began making his own candles as a hobby. He began candlemaking as a professional in 1969 with his wife Julie, setting up a shop initially in Moor Park Road and then Beaconsfield Terrace Road, and then Blythe Road in West Kensington in 1976, just behind the Olympia Exhibition Hall. By this time he was contributing to artistic magazines such as The Artist. He began making appearances on TV shows such as Pebble Mill, The Generation Game, where he was the guest expert on three occasions, Vision On, and many others. In 1980, Constable collaborated with Lesley Judd to make a film about candlemaking, which was aired several times on BBC. In 1989, he was commissioned by the British Epilepsy Association to make a giant candle measuring 30 feet by 3ft 6, weighing over seven tonnes. It took four winter months for the wax to fully set. In 1991, by royal warrant he became the official candlemaker to Prince Charles and a regular candlemaker for royal residences including Highgrove and St. James Palace and various royal events. In 1993, Constable set up shop in Gelligroes Mill, Blackwood, Caerphilly, Wales, and also runs a shop on Shepherds Bush Road in London. He has made candles for the Harry Potter film series, the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, First Knight, Interview with a Vampire, Cinderella, The Huntsman, Gosford Park, Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey, and Merlin.

The complex includes the council chamber, the Westminster Register Office and an educational facility known as the Sammy Ofer Centre. It is a Grade II listed building. History The building was commissioned to replace the old courthouse at the south end of Marylebone Lane which dated back in part to the 18th century.Wright, Thomas. (1837) The history and antiquities of London, Westminster, Southwark, and parts adjacent. Vol. V. London: George Virtue. p. 345. After the area became a metropolitan borough in 1900, civic leaders decided that the old courthouse was inadequate for their needs and decided to procure a new town hall: the site selected for the new facility in Marylebone Road had been occupied by a row of residential properties. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the Princess Royal on 8 July 1914. The new building was designed by Sir Edwin Cooper in the Edwardian Graeco-Roman classicist style and built by Messrs John Greenwood. After a pause in construction caused by the First World War, it was officially opened by Prince Albert on 27 March 1920. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 13 bays facing onto Marylebone Road; the central section of five bays featured a two-storey tetrastyle portico with full height Corinthian order columns; the doorway was flanked by windows on the ground floor; there were further windows on the first floor and smaller windows on the second floor; a colonnaded tower was erected on the roof. A public library, which was also designed by Cooper, was built to the west of the town hall in 1939. The council chamber was badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War. The town hall, which had served as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone for much of the 20th century, ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged City of Westminster was formed in 1965. The damaged council chamber was restored, to a design by T. P. Bennett and Sons, in 1968 to allow it to continue to be used as a meeting place by Westminster City Council. The building, which continued to accommodate the Westminster Register Office, hosted the marriage of Cilla Black to Bobby Willis in January 1969, Sir Paul McCartney to Linda Eastman in March 1969 and Ringo Starr to Barbara Bach in April 1981 as well as that of Melanie Griffith to Antonio Banderas in May 1996 and Liam Gallagher to Patsy Kensit in April 1997. Since the turn of the millennium, it has been the venue of the marriage of Claudia Winkleman to Kris Thykier in June 2000, Liam Gallagher to Nicole Appleton in February 2008 and Sean Bean to Georgina Sutcliffe also in February 2008 as well as that of Sir Paul McCartney to Nancy Shevell in October 2011. The London Business School acquired the town hall in November 2012 and, with financial support from the Ofer family, spent £60 million on refurbishing and improving it. The improvements, which were designed by Sheppard Robson, included a new glass and steel link structure between the town hall and the library allowing access to the new education facility known as the \\"Sammy Ofer Centre\\". The improvements also allowed continued access to the council chamber and the Westminster Register Office using the civic steps. The facility re-opened again in January 2018.

She is known for the study of the biology of the cochineal (Dactylopius coccus), an insect species used to create the red dye carmine. She was also a renowned butterfly researcher, contributing the first butterfly section to the Encyclopedia of Mexico and describing 39 new species to science throughout her career. She started teaching in the Faculty of Science at UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) in 1943, where she was a distinguished researcher in the university's Institute of Biology for over 50 years.  Education  Leonila Vázquez García was born on January 17, 1914, in the city of Jiménez in the northern state of Chihuahua, Mexico. She moved to Mexico City with her family at a young age and completed her primary and secondary education in the city's public school system. Dr. Vázquez went to high school at the National Preparatory School (Escuela Nacional Preparatoria) and completed her undergraduate degree in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of UNAM. On October 3, 1936, she received a master's degree in biological sciences by completing a thesis entitled, Harmful insects of the 'tepozanes' (Budleia) of Central Mexico. She went on to receive her doctorate in Biological Sciences from the UNAM Faculty of Sciences in 1945 with a dissertation entitled: Monographic study of the Psychidae (Lepidoptera) of Mexico. Over the course of her life, she contributed heavily to UNAM as a professor, researcher, and cultural leader.  Biological research  Vázquez dedicated her career to academia and research. Upon the death of her mentor, Carlos C. Hoffman, in 1942, she took over the third-year Zoology course in the UNAM Faculty of Sciences, which covered the large and complex group of animals known as arthropods, and led this course until 1990. She also taught numerous doctorate courses on entomology and insect ecology from 1950 to 1967, where she mentored and taught over 1800 students, including José Sarukhán Kermez. She supervised 36 theses on biological sciences throughout her tenure at UNAM. As a researcher, she studied various aspects of butterfly (Lepidoptera) biology, and described several new species to science. Within her research, she worked with Papilionidae, Pieridae, Nymphalidae, Satumiidae, Sphingidae and Psychidae, among others, contributing to over 50 scientific publications. Throughout her butterfly research, she worked closely with butterfly specialist, Dr. Carlos R. Beutelspacher. She was particularly interested in studying and describing the relationship between butterflies and trophic vegetation, as well as how these species impact their habitat. She also wrote the first section on butterflies for the Encyclopedia of Mexico. In 1952, she began collaborating with the Indigenous Institute (Instituto Indigenista) on a study of the traditional cultivation of the cochineal (Dactylopius coccus Costa) and the aje (Llaveia axin). Cochineal are used to create the red dye carmine, while aje are used to create lacquers. These insects were once of significant economic importance to certain regions of Mexico during the colonial period. In 1958, Vázquez participated in the first UNAM scientific expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands, a volcanic archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico.

She was joined on this expedition by renowned Mexican scientists Bernardo Villa, Faustino Miranda, Teófilo Herrera, Alejandro Villalobos, Gonzalo Pérez Higareda, and Héctor Pérez. She also collaborated with Alejandro Villalobos to write the textbook Zoology of the Phylum Arthropoda, a central text to studying zoology at UNAM.  Conservation efforts  Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Vázquez participated in numerous studies in Southern Mexico in the Puebla and Oaxaca regions, where she helped repair the flow of the Papaloapan River alongside the Papaloapan Commission. In 1957, she worked with the Laboratory of Hydrobiology of the Institute of Biology and Parasitology of the Faculty of Medicine at UNAM on a project to eradicate onchocerciasis, or river blindness. In 1984, she worked with the Institute of Biology and the Secretary of Urban Development and Ecology to create programs for the protection and study of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexiblus L.). To learn more about organizing entomology collections, she planned a research trip to the Museum of Natural History in New York, the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., the Field Museum in Chicago, and several museums in Los Angeles and San Diego, California.  Honors and awards  Throughout her career, Vázquez participated in numerous societies including the Entomological Society of America (1932–1982), the Mexican Society of Natural History (1946), The Lepidopterist's Society (where she was vice president twice, in 1958 and 1969), the Society for the Study of Evolution (1961–1982), and the Association for Tropical Biology (1968–1982). She was also an honorary member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1977 as honorary consultant to the Survival Service Commission of the IUCN as a member of the Lepidoptera Special Group. From 1952 to 1977, she was a founding member of the Mexican Society of Entomology, the Academy of Scientific Research, the Mexican Society of Genetics, and the Mexican Society of Zoology. In 1971, Vázquez received the medal of Entomological Merit from the Mexican Society of Entomology. She also received honorary degrees from the Mexican Society of Zoology and the Faculty of Biological Sciences of the University of Veracruz. Vázquez described 39 species of plants and animals, including butterflies, mites, crustaceans, nematodes, and plants. The Fouquieria leonila, a plant endemic to the state of Guerrero, Mexico, was named after her. She served in many leadership positions at UNAM throughout the 1970s, including as a member of the internal consulting committee, president of the college of investigators, adviser to the biology stations of the university, and a member of the editorial committee of the journal Serie Zoológica. She also served as the head of the department of zoology from 1976 to 1979.

In 1967, she became the first woman to be elected to the city council in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Her legacy is of challenging “political, social, and racial obstacles with her status as a white, female Republican” in the South. During the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968 she became a prominent local figure. Early life and education Gwendolyn Van Court Robinson was born on September 25, 1915, in Marshall, Michigan to parents Catherine VanCourt (Pritchartt) Robinson and Carl Arnold Robinson. Her father was a lawyer and served as a Democrat in the Michigan state legislature for 15 years. The family moved to Chicago and then to North Florida during the depths of the Great Depression, before settling in Memphis in 1930 when she was at the age of 15. She graduated from St. Mary's Episcopal School in 1932, but was initially unable to attend college due to the family's financial difficulties. She eventually studied chemistry at Southwestern College (later renamed Rhodes College) and obtained a degree in 1937. Political career Awsumb's interest in politics stemmed from her father’s career in Michigan. In 1956, she ran a failed campaign as a Republican candidate for the Tennessee General Assembly. In 1967, Awsumb became the first woman to be elected to the Memphis City Council. After two months into her first term, Awsumb became a prominent figure in the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968. Awsumb had the unenviable position as the council’s liaison to Mayor Henry Loeb, who she accused of impeding the council’s progress on resolving the strike. Awsumb did not support municipal labor unions in concept and opposed the strike. However, she understood that the strike exacerbated economic inequality for black Americans and she sought compromise in resolving it, such as an immediate wage raise, with her views shifting further to the strikers as police brutality escalated throughout the crisis. The council elected her as chair in 1970—a position she held until 1975. In addition to the sanitation strike, her tumultuous tenure on the council also featured the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., tension over racial integration of the city, and increasing participation of women in politics. Awsumb accepted an appointment as the first director of the city’s Housing and Community Development in 1975, and served in the position until 1981. Reflecting on her political career, she described herself as a “middle of the roader” who represented all people, and she was proud that she won majorities of all electoral precincts—including those in predominately white and black locations of the town. Personal life Gwen Robinson married Wells Awsumb, son of the prominent Norwegian-American architect George Awsumb, in 1937. They had three children together, George, Carl, and Helen Catherine. Gwen Awsumb died in Memphis, Tennessee on January 16, 2003. Legacy A feature column in The Daily Memphian celebrating the city's bicentennial included Awsumb in its list of 200 key historical figures that \\"you don't know but should.\\" St. Mary’s Episcopal School named her a recipient of its Distinguished Alumnae Award in 1996. A collection of her papers and historic records are preserved in the Memphis Public Library, declaring that she left behind \\"a legacy of awsumbness\\" in Memphis. After her death in 2003, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a resolution honoring her contributions to the city of Memphis and tenure as a council member and chair.

He is the president of the Democratic Party of Serbia, and a docent at the Faculty of Law, University of Belgrade.  Early life and education  He was born on 19 August 1976 in Belgrade. He received his high school education at the Fifth Belgrade Gymnasium. He graduated from the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne in 1999 at the Sorbonne Law School, and in 2000 from the Department of Political Science at the Sorbonne. At the same university, he completed his master's degree in international relations in 2001 with a paper on the topic: La reconnaissance internationale des indépendances slovène et croate (\\"International Recognition of Slovenian and Croatian Independence\\"). His mentor was the professor Charles Zorgbibe. He defended his doctoral dissertation in December 2010 on the topic: Légitimité et légitimation du recours à la force dans l’après-guerre froide. Étude de cas: l’intervention militaire de l’OTAN contre la République fédérale de Yougoslavie (1999), (\\"Justification and justification of the use of force in the post-Cold War period. Case study: NATO military intervention against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999\\"). Again, his mentor was the professor Charles Zorgbibe. During his studies, he learned English and French.  Work  From 2001 to 2005, he was in charge of conducting exercises in Constitutional Law and Political Institutions, as well as Comparative Political Systems at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris and the Pantheon-Sorbonne. From 2006 to 2011, he worked at the Institute for International Politics and Economics in Belgrade as a research associate. In October 2011, he was elected assistant professor, in February 2014, assistant professor, and in March 2019, associate professor of Introduction to European Integration Law and International Relations at the Faculty of Law, University of Belgrade, where he continues to teach. He was a member of the Management Board of the Slobodan Jovanović Fund. Some of the members of the board are: Matija Bećković (president), Kosta Čavoški, Slobodan Rakitić, Vladeta Janković, Vojislav Koštunica and Slobodan Samardžić.  Politics  Since July 2007, he has been the advisor to the Minister for Kosovo and Metohija, Slobodan Samardžić for international legal issues, and he was a member of the Serbian delegation in the negotiation process on the future status of Kosovo and Metohija under the auspices of the international mediators. In February 2008, he was appointed one of the two coordinators of the legal team of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. He was the temporary vice president of the Democratic Party of Serbia city board in Belgrade and the political advisor to the president of the Democratic Party of Serbia, Vojislav Koštunica, and after that the vice president of the party. After the 2012 Serbian parliamentary elections, he became a member of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. He was a member of the Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Home Affairs. On 9 October 2013, he returned the mandate to the Democratic Party of Serbia, but remained the party's vice president. Shortly after, he resigned from all positions in the party, because he believed that the party leadership was not doing everything necessary to preserve Kosovo and Metohija as a part of Serbia, and that the attitude of the party towards the government was too mild. Above all, he believed that it was necessary to gather all patriotic forces into one coalition, which would consist of both political organizations and intellectuals and prominent public figures, and which would be a necessary opposition to the Serbian political system within which, with the Serbian Progressive Party coming to power, consensus was reached on the surrender of Kosovo and Metohija. He has written and spoken about it in public since the very signing of the Brussels Agreement, in April 2013. He is the president of the Democratic Party of Serbia since 28 May 2017. Jovanović ran for mayor at the 2018 Belgrade City Assembly election, and received 1.12% of the votes. In November 2019, Jovanović announced a new coalition for the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election called \\"Broom 2020\\", along with the group of small political movements like the Human Shield, Movement for the Indigenous of Kraljevo, Team for Life, and with the president of the Military Syndicate of Serbia, Novica Antić. The party only won 2.2% of the votes failing to pass the census to enter the parliament. On 21 July 2020, Jovanović announced a possible change of the name of the party.  Political position  Jovanović is a self described right wing politician, and a eurosceptic. He claims that the European Union is a dead project, and that there should be an open debate in Serbia about the country joining the European Union. He is against the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia, and claims that the best possible solution is keeping the status quo between Serbia and it's breakaway province. In an interview for Danas in May 2020, Jovanović talked about the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election campaign, and the Yugoslav Wars. When commenting on the conflicts, he stated:  Trivia  Jovanović during his time in the 63rd Parachute Brigade He served in the Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro as a member of the 63rd Parachute Brigade and participated in the International Parachuting All-Around Competition in 2006.

With only 110 men, she managed to take out over 200 Japanese soldiers during the occupation. The Imperial Japanese Army posted a reward of 10,000 pesos on her head in the hopes of capturing her but to no avail.31 Days of Revolutionary Women, #27: Nieves Fernandez, South Seattle Emerald, 26 March 2016 Prior to Revolution Fernandez owned a wholesale business of her own until the Japanese conquered the country and seized whatever they wanted. Many men who disagreed with authorities were tortured and faced boiling-hot and ice-cold baths alternately; without any rest, food, and water, except from the soapsuds. This would go on until they give in. Fernandez, who was a teacher, became more worried as her students were threatened to be taken away by the Japanese soldiers. Many women also became vulnerable targets to sexual assaults. One of their biggest fears was to be forcibly used as comfort women by the Imperial Japanese army. Eventually, Fernandez has had enough and decided to revolt against the government. Guerilla Fernandez gathered native men and plotted how to fight against the reigning Japanese forces. She trained these men on combat skills, how to use knives, how to make shotguns from gas pipe that were also loaded with gunpowder and old nails, and how to make grenades. Sometimes, they were able to obtain Japanese weapons. She became the first and only female guerilla commander in the Philippines. Captain Fernandez would wear a black dress and fight barefoot as she committed silent killings with a bolo knife. Under her command, at the South of Tacloban, 110 native men were able to kill more than 200 Japanese men. It took two years and a half of ambushes until the Japanese offered a bounty of 10,000 for her head. She was never captured, but she was wounded once and had a bullet scar on her right forearm. Saving the Comfort Women Remedio Fallas, a former comfort woman, revealed in her book The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl taken by the Japanese Military how the guerillas saved many young women that were being raped and about to be raped by the Japanese army. She vividly recounted how the guerillas wiped out Japanese troops on various villages. Silent Killer Captain Fernadez was reportedly a skilled marksman and bolo fighter. Because it was accessible, she utilized the bolo even though it was primarily used for trail blazing and agricultural purpose such as clearing vegetation. Fernandez was the famous silent killer. The trick is to stab the carotid artery and internal jugular, leading to the brain and causing immediate unconsciousness. It is the spot behind/below the ear lobe. Once the blade is stabbed to about two inches, it must be thrusted and twisted upward in ninety degrees. If correctly performed, the victim might try to scream and gasp for air but it will not be possible. The only sound will be the victim's physical struggle, which was already taken care of if the assailant attacked from behind.

He specialised in luxury apartment buildings in Beaux-Arts and later Art Deco styles.  Biography  Antoine Varlet was, with Michel Polak [fr] and Sta Jasinski [fr], one of the pioneers of apartment building construction in Brussels. His name appeared for the first time in the Brussels landscape in 1923 for an industrial complex at 42, rue de la Gare in Etterbeek, in collaboration with his brother, architect W. Varlet.This architect W. Varlet was also active in Liège where he built a house at n° 99, boulevard Émile de Laveleye. Still in 1923, they renovated a neoclassical together at 27, rue de l'Est. In 1927, he signs his first apartment building at 110, avenue de Tervueren. He was follower, like his colleague Pierre De Groef [fr], of the Beaux-Arts style in the middle of the Art Deco era. However, he quickly turned from 1929 onwards to an Art Deco style mixed with elements of Beaux-Arts style. As he died young and did not participate after the war in the blossoming of apartment buildings, his work, which marks the Brussels landscape, has not yet been the subject of an in-depth study. His specialty was makings buildings at street corners which give a wider perspective. A practice which has served as a precedent for many architects in Brussels since then.Isabelle Douillet and Cécile Schaack, « L’avenue Franklin Roosevelt et le quartier du Solbosch : Considérations historiques, urbanistiques et architecturales », Inventaire du Patrimoine architectural, Bruxelles- Extensions Sud, 2006-2007.

File:1 Avenue de la Renaissance, Brussels by Antoine Varlet 09.jpgBuilding on avenue de la Renaissance.  Beaux-Arts era  Starting in 1929, his style becomes influenced by the then dominant Art Deco style, while still keeping many Beaux-Arts elements in his works : red or orange brick facades, bordered with white stones, forged iron doors, decorative low and high reliefs, which help mitigate a coldness that is sometimes found in Art Deco buildings.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 13 May 2020.  Gameplay  The game's objective is to traverse an island. New areas can be unlocked by spending in-game coins. These coins are obtained by cleaning up litter, cleaning up goop and in turn saving the bankimals—animals that can balloon up with coins like a piggy bank. As the game progresses, the player learns about the fundamentals of using a bank account, in addition to related topics such as the concept of paying taxes. Two downloadable expansions are available with the proceeds going towards the charities SpecialEffect and Young Money.  Development  NatWest aimed to create an educational video game to teach children about managing money responsibly.  Reception  The game received a positive review from TheXBoxHub, with a 3.5/5 rating, and the reviewer commented \\"it plays well, looks all cute and cuddly, teaches kids about money and it’s free to download.\\" Gamespew praised the educational elements of the game, \\"How exactly does Island Saver teach children about money? Well, every action you complete has a clear reward. [...] It’s about balancing your earning vs spending, and not going too mad on those non-essential purchases.\\" Gamepitt gave the game a 9/10 rating and was also positive with regards to the graphics and educational elements. Other reviews were critical of the game; Evan Norris of VGChartz wrote \\"Island Saver is not a good game but, considering its raison d'être, it could be worse.\\" He criticised the platforming and combat features of the game, describing the latter as a 'chore' and the controls as 'clumsy'. Jonjo Cosgrove also criticised the gameplay and called it 'tedious' and closed with the comment \\"[Island Saver is a] thoughtful game with little to no staying value beyond an initial play.\\" A review on TheXboxHub lamented the game's lack of a two-player option and said that the game \\"does get repetitive after a while\\".

In some country, like Switzerland, the cost of insurance is high and continue to grow, leading part of the population to be under- insured.In 170'000 non pagano l'assicurazione sanitaria Another criticism is that since institutions are paid by performance some isolated localities may have little hospital coverage.

The Chiswick Empire was a theatre in Chiswick in London that opened in 1912 and closed and was demolished in 1959. A venue for touring artists, some of the greatest names in drama, variety and music hall performed there including George Formby, Laurel and Hardy, Chico Marx, Peter Sellers and Liberace. Early history The architect Frank Matcham 1900 In 1910 the theatre owner and manager Oswald Stoll made a proposal to build a music hall on a site in Chiswick High Road in Chiswick. There followed a public debate with many local people opposed to Stoll's plan, arguing that such a venue would be unsuitable in one of the more select residential areas in the town. Others were concerned that a music hall would encourage working-class people to waste their money: ‘having too many music halls is a great blow to thrift – a great weakness of the English race was their want of thrift’ suggested one local resident. However, the new theatre had some local support and a petition was drawn up with 2,000 signatures, claiming that a new theatre would create employment for the town and give people a place of entertainment. Eventually permission was granted and Stoll built his new theatre on Chiswick High Road where some shops and the local smithy had to be demolished to accommodate it.Christina Pain, The Chiswick Empire – Brentford and Chiswick Local History Journal 10 (2001) The Chiswick Empire (1913) Located at 414 Chiswick High Road, the Chiswick Empire was designed by theatre architect Frank Matcham for Oswald Stoll. The interior was decorated in what was called a \\"Jacobean\\" style, similar in design to that of the London Palladium. With a large two storey centrally placed opening which contained an open verandah,The Chiswick Empire Theatre – Cinema Treasures website the auditorium could seat 1,948 – with 890 in the Stalls, 454 in the Dress Circle, and 554 in the Balcony and eight boxes. The stage had a proscenium width of 44 feet and an orchestra pit for 15 musicians. Behind the scenes were 10 dressing rooms for the artistes. An innovation was the sliding roof which was seldom opened but when it was would cause clouds of dust to drop on the audience. The Chiswick Empire opened on 2 September 1912 with a Variety bill that included some of the most popular performers of the time. While built as a venue for variety acts the Empire also at times staged plays. On 19 August 1913 while the theatre was empty a serious fire broke out which destroyed the stage and caused considerable damage to the auditorium. After extensive restoration at a cost of £12,000 the theatre reopened three months later with the appositely-named play The Miracle.History of the Chiswick Empire – Arthur Lloyd.co.uk: The Music Hall and Theatre History Site Dedicated to Arthur Lloyd, 1839 – 1904 For the Christmas season each year the Empire put on a popular pantomime, with George Formby appearing in that for 1915 while the popular entertainers Dorothy Ward and Shaun Glenville appeared there in Jack and the Beanstalk in 1949. Alma Cogan was in the 1955 pantomime Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp. In 1915 the Empire also saw Gladys Cooper, Marie Lloyd and Vesta Tilley. In January 1917 Clara Butt appeared in a number of charity matinees and Queen Alexandra attended a concert in aid of the Chiswick Memorial Homes. Between the Wars Poster for Chico Marx at the Chiswick Empire (1949) By the 1920s the Empire was home to twice nightly variety acts as well as revues, plays and opera, with the Swiss clown Grock appearing in 1921. The company of Ben Greet held a Shakespeare season at the theatre while variety stars such as Wee Georgie Wood, Tommy Handley and Charles Hawtrey also appeared. In 1930 Sybil Thorndike appeared at the theatre in the play The Distaff Side and the Carl Rosa Opera Company played there, as did the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1931. In 1932 the Empire had a new manager who previously had worked in a theatre that had done well financially when it had changed to a full-time cinema. The Chiswick Empire similarly had a change of use to a cinema with a Western Electric sound system being installed. However, the move was not a success and in October 1933 the Empire reverted to being a live theatre with films only being shown on Sundays when live performances were prohibited. A season of the works of Shakespeare was given at the Empire by Anew McMaster and his company among which was a young Anthony Quayle. Later years Poster for Liberace at the Chiswick Empire (1959) At the beginning of World War II the Empire closed in common with all other theatres across the country, but reopened at the end of 1941 when some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry appeared including: Vera Lynn, Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss, Jimmy James, Arthur Askey and Lucan & McShane (Old Mother Riley and Her Daughter Kitty). After the War the Empire saw Laurel and Hardy in their first British tour (1947) and Chico Marx (1949), while in the 1950s entertainers who appeared at the venue included: Tommy Cooper, Max Miller, Max Bygraves, Julie Andrews, Morecambe and Wise, Ken Dodd, Max Wall, Dickie Valentine, the Ray Ellington Quartet, Peter Sellers and Dorothy Squires (1952), Laurel and Hardy on a return visit (1954), Al Martino, Alma Cogan, Terry-Thomas (1955) and Cliff Richard (1959). The Chiswick Empire closed on 29 June 1959 following a hugely successful week of performances by the popular American pianist Liberace. The structure was demolished within a month and Empire House, an office building, erected on the site.

Through unconventional use of common place materials such as thread, needle, scissors, fire, and water, Liu extrapolates complex cultural narratives through a hybrid work form that merges site-responsive installation, sculpture, public art, and performance. Liu lives and works in Austin, Texas and is a University of Texas System Regents' Outstanding Teaching Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  Early life  Beili Liu was born in a farming village in Jilin, China to parents who were among the 16 million sent-down youth during China's Cultural Revolution. After ten years of exile and re-education in the countryside, her parents relocated to the Northeast Chinese industrial city of Shenyang. In 1989, one month before the Tiananmen Square Protests, her family migrated to the southern coastal city of Shenzhen, a major manufacturing center and economic hub bordering Hong Kong and one of four \\"Special Economic Zones\\" designated at the early stage of Chinese economic reform.  Education  Liu attended Shenzhen University, studying Chinese Literature before immigrating to the US in 1995. Liu received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2001 and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2003 as a Barbour Scholar.  Career  Early in Liu's career senior critic Janet Kaplos remarked in Art in America (2009) that Liu's installations were \\"materially simple but metaphorically rich.\\" DeWitt Cheng, arts critic for Artillery, noted in 2012 that \\"The idea of aggression and danger halted by gentle restraint is ... embodied\\" in Liu's site-specific installations.

Radiometric dating gives it an age of 13 to 6 million years, corresponding to the Miocene epoch. Geology The Jemez Mountains lie on the intersection of the western margin of the Rio Grande Rift and the Jemez Lineament.Aldrich 1986Whitmeyer and Karlstrom 2007 Here magma produced from the fertile rock of an ancient subduction zoneWolff et al. 2004 has repeatedly found its way to the surface along faults produced by rifting. This has produced a long-lived volcanic field, with the earliest eruptions beginning at least 13 million years ago in both the northern (Polvadera Group) and southern (Keres Group) portions of the volcanic field.Heiken et al. 1990 High-silica eruptions of the Tewa Group began about 1.85 million years ago and continued almost to the present day.Zimmerer et al. 2016 The Keres Group is a sequence of basalt, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite flows that underlie the southern Jemez Mountains. It overlaps the Polvadera Group to the north and has a maximum thickness of about . It overlies the Santa Fe Group to the south and is overlain by the Tewa Group.Smith et al. 1969, pp.2-8 Keres volcanism began about 12 million years ago and continued to 6 million years ago. Volcanic activity generally shifted eastward over time during this interval.Kelley et al. 2013 = Formations = From oldest to youngest, the formations recognized within the Keres Group are the Paliza Canyon Formation, the Canovas Canyon Rhyolite, and the Bearhead Rhyolite. Paliza Canyon Formation andesite near south rim of Valles caldera The Paliza Canyon Formation is a sequence of mostly andesite flows that is widely exposed in the southern Jemez Mountains. The formation was erupted by numerous coalesced composite volcanoes centered on an axis from the northern Valles Caldera wall south through Paliza and Peralta Canyons to Ruiz Peak (). Exposures along this axis generally exceed . The base of the formation is not exposed along this axis, but is estimated from exposures to the west to be about . The formation rests on rocks dating from the Permian to the Miocene. These include red beds of the Abo Formation in the valley of the Rio Guadalupe in the western Jemez and in upper Canon de San Diego; Chinle Formation beds in lower Paliza Canyon; Abiquiu Formation on the west wall of the Valles caldera and in upper San Juan Canyon; and Santa Fe Group at the east foot of St. Peter's Dome to the east. The Paliza Canyon Formation is intruded and locally overlain by Bearhead Rhyolite. In the north and northwest wall of the Valles caldera, the Paliza Canyon Formation appears to be conformably overlain with dacite and quartz latite flows of the Tschicoma Formation (Polvadera Group). However, the alteration of the Paliza Canyon beds in contrast with the fresh appearance of the Tschicoma beds suggests a disconformity between the formations. The Paliza Canyon Formation is also locally overlain unconformably by the Bandelier Tuff. Beds assigned to the Basalt of Chamisa Mesa have since been found to be unremarkable in age and composition and are now assigned to the Paliza Canyon Formation.Gardner et al. 1986 The Canovas Canyon Formation is a sequence of rhyolite flows, tuffs, domes, and associated shallow intrusions exposed primarily around Bear Springs Peak (). The formation is named for exposures in Canovas Canyon (). It has a maximum exposed thickness of and extends to Borrego Mesa to the southwest.Smith et al. 1969, pp.5-6 Isolated exposures are found further to the east as far as the San Miguel Mountains.Goff et al. 2002 The formation is generally overlain and interbedded with flows of the Paliza Canyon Formation. It overlies beds of the Santa Fe Group. Radimetric ages for this formation range from 12 to 8 million years. Peralta Tuff at Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument The Bearhead Rhyolite is a thick stack of rhyolite tuffs, flows, domes, and associated shallow intrusions exposed from the northeastern Valles caldera rim to north of Cochiti Pueblo. It is named for exposures on Bearhead Peak (), one of the major source vents of the formation. The formation ranges in age from 7.1 to 6.5 million years. High-silica volcanism shifted to the north around 7.5 million years ago, producing the separation between the Canovas Canyon Rhyolite and the Bearhead Rhyolite. The Bearhead Rhyolite rests on an erosional surface cut mostly on flows of the Paliza Canyon Formation. Its uppermost beds interfinger with the Cochiti Formation.Smith et al. 1969, p.8 The tuffaceous facies of the Bearhead Rhyolite, extensively exposed at Kasha- Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument, are assigned to the Peralta Tuff Member, a name first used by Kirk Bryan and J. E. Upson. The member is named for its exposures in Peralta Canyon. It consists mainly of bedded air-fall tuffs but includes pyroclastic flows and reworked tuffs.  Economic geology  Gold has been mined from the Bland district,Vieth 1950 from beds identified as the exhumed interior of a Keres Group volcano. History The group was first defined by Bailey, Smith, and Ross in 1969 as part of their work establishing the stratigraphy of the Jemez Mountains. The group was named for the Keresean Range, an older name for the southern Jemez Mountains. They included in the group the Basalt of Chamisa Mesa, the Canovas Canyon Rhyolite, the Paliza Canyon Formation, and the Bearhead Rhyolite.Smith et al. 1969, p.5 The Basalt of Chamisa Mesa has since been abandoned as a formation name, since it is similar in age and composition to the Paliza Canyon Formation.Gardner et al. 1986 The division of the precaldera formations of the Jemez Mountains into the Keres and Polvadera Groups, based largely on geography, has been criticized as artificial.Rowe et al. 2007 Goff et al. abandoned the Polvadera Group in their 2011 mapping of the Valles Caldera and included its formations in the Keres Group.Goff et al. 2011  References  Bibliography =     Category:Geologic groups of New Mexico Category:Neogene formations of New Mexico Category:Miocene Series of North America ","title":"Keres Group"},{"id":"63977706","text":"NGC 6509 is a galaxy in the New General Catalogue.

No members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but several are known from inscriptions, and at least some of them were of senatorial rank. A large number of the Steii settled in the provinces of Africa and Numidia.PIR, vol. III, pp. 271, 272. Origin The nomen Steius resembles names belonging to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', which was typical of Oscan gentes.Chase, pp. 120, 121. However, because the nomen is so short, this resemblance may be superficial, with ' belonging to the root, rather than being part of a gentile-forming suffix. Besides the African colonials, all of the known Steii lived at or in the immediate vicinity of Rome, in Latium, suggesting that the family might be of Latin origin. Praenomina The Steii known from inscriptions used only the most common praenomina, including Lucius, Gaius, Marcus, and Publius, with no obvious preference.

He was a partner in a family business that ran sugar plantations in the West Indies and owned a number of slaves. Pinney was selected as mayor of Bristol in 1831 and within weeks had to manage the response to major riots. Public order was lost for a number of days and significant damage caused to the city centre. Pinney was charged with neglect of duty over his actions but was acquitted at trial. He returned to local government as an alderman, holding the position until 1853.  Early life and career  Charles Pinney was the youngest son of John Pretor Pinney and his wife Jane (née Weekes), sugar planters and traders in Nevis, West Indies. Charles was born on 29 April 1793, after the couple returned to England and settled at 7 Great George Street in Bristol. Charles took over the running of his father's business, in partnership with Robert Edward Case, which included the ownership of a number of slaves on plantations in the West Indies. Pinney was at one point close to marrying the daughter of noted slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce but the engagement was broken off and on 8 March 1831 married Frances Mary Still; they would have two sons and a daughter. Pinney was a member of the Whig Party and was president of the Anchor Society, which was then associated with the party, in 1822. He was selected as a councillor in the Bristol Corporation in 1822 and served as a sheriff from 1823-24. Pinney was one of few Whigs in the Tory-dominated corporation, but would serve until it was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Pinney also helped to found and run a Mechanics' Institute in the city and was a supporter of the 1830 French Revolution.  Mayor during the 1831 riots  A 1901 depiction of the attack on Pinney and Wetherell's carriage Pinney was selected as mayor of Bristol on 16 September 1831. The political environment was fraught, a Whig government was attempting to pass the second Reform Bill to implement electoral reform in the House of Commons. The Tories opposed this bill but it was supported by much of the general populace, including many in Bristol. Pinney's selection as mayor may have been an attempt by the Tory majority in the corporation to curry favour with pro-reform elements in the city and head off unrest. Pinney attempted to remain politically neutral after his appointment, though this angered many of the Whigs who regarded him as having abandoned his beliefs to join The Establishment. Civil disturbances occurred at the visit of the anti-reform Bishop of Bath and Wells on 24 October and the anti-reform judge Charles Wetherell on 29 October. The latter instance saw attacks on a carriage carrying Pinney and Wetherell, which escalated into the 1831 Bristol riots. The civic authorities lost control of the city until 31 October. Pinney was criticised by some for his actions during the riot and was tried at the Court of King's Bench from 25 October 1832, charged with neglect of duty. He was found not guilty of the charge by the jury after seven days.  Later life  Camp House, later known as Engineers House Pinney claimed £2,000 from the Bristol Corporation for losses of his property, principally wine and china, during the riots; he was awarded £714. He continued his business with Case and the company was awarded £3,572 in compensation for slaves following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Pinney failed, by 34 votes, to be elected as a Whig councillor for the St Augustine constituency in the 1835 elections to the reformed Bristol Corporation. He was afterwards selected as an alderman, though he later defected to the Tories. The 1835 selection of aldermen restored a Tory majority to the council, which had been split 50:50 in elected members. Pinney served as president of the Society of Merchant Venturers for 1844–45. In 1850 he unsuccessfully proposed that the corporation purchase Clifton Down, a traditional open space in the city, to preserve it from development. He ceased to be an alderman in 1853. Pinney died at his home, Camp House in Clifton, on 17 July 1867 leaving a fortune of £60,000.

It flew on Falcon 9 booster B1040 from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A, which touched down at Landing Zone 1 following launch.

Vietnam War resisters in Sweden were Americans that fled to Sweden to avoid service in the Vietnam War between 1967 and 1973. Among the 1,000 American exiles included around 800 military deserters. Unlike other nations like Canada that discretely harbored Vietnam War resisters, the Swedish government granted war resisters asylum status and the public openly welcomed them. This unique acceptance and Swedish politicians' open protests against American involvement in the Vietnam War caused a rift in relations between the United States and Sweden.  History  During the Vietnam War 503,926 desertions occurred in the United States military. Most deserted in the United States, but some fled to other countries. During the war American servicemen were often stationed in or took retreats to Japan, and had trouble deserting while there due to the language barrier. Activists from the Japanese leftist group Beheiren devised a way to reach out to servicemen and assist them in deserting. Sweden became the target destination for deserters because it was the only country that granted asylum to Vietnam War deserters. Sweden's granting of asylum to deserters worsened relations between Sweden and the United States. In 1969 the United States revoked its ambassador to Sweden in protest. Of the 1,000 American war resisters that would come to Sweden two thirds were deserters rather than draft evaders. Very few would stay in Sweden for their lives, and the few that remained assimilated into Swedish society. Those that remained over the years typically did so because of a distaste for American politics or because of careers and family now in Sweden.  People  Deserters = Most deserters reported their decision to desert was spontaneous. Around 100 black Americans deserted to come to Sweden, but had little plans to live for long in Sweden, and most eventually left the country. Many deserters had trouble navigating Swedish culture, guilt with abandoning their army compatriots, and had trouble keeping relationships with people in the United States, usually due to geographic distance or controversy from their decision to desert. = Draft evaders = Draft evaders typically had an easier time adapting to Swedish life because unlike deserters, most were college educated and familiar with the anti-war movement. They also did not have troubles finding ways to immigrate unlike military deserters who had to escape from the U.S. military.

Kurinczuk and Marian Knight studied the risks associated with being pregnant during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. She analysed the outcomes of over 400 pregnant women admitted to all of the hospitals in the United Kingdom with a maternity unit during a five- week period. Her study demonstrated that pregnant women were not more likely than non-pregnant women to contract severe forms of coronavirus disease. She demonstrated that black and minority ethnic pregnant women were more likely than white women to be hospitalised with coronavirus disease.

The monument commemorates what is called the \\"Turning Point\\" of the American Revolution—the surrender of British forces led by General John Burgoyne to the Americans under General Horatio Gates. Description The Saratoga Battle Monument contains four niches intended for life size bronze statues of the American commanders associated with the Battle of Saratoga. Saratoga Monument Association On 17 October 1856, a group met at the General Schuyler House in Schuylerville, New York to discuss creation of a monument to celebrate the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga. In 1859, the Saratoga Monument Association was organized, with a board of fourteen permanent directors: George Strover, William Wilcox, Henry Holmes, James M. Marvin, John A. Corey, James M. Cook, Leroy Mowry, Asa C. Tefft, Peter Gansevoort, Hamilton Fish, Phillip Schuyler, George W. Blecker, and Horatio Seymour. Hamilton Fish was elected first president. The association was incorporated by New York State in 1859. The trustees got as far as choosing the location for the monument before the Civil War intervened. The effort to build the monument was resumed in 1872. In 1874, the New York State Legislature approved an appropriation of $50,000 for construction of the monument. The association asked each of the thirteen original states to pledge $5,000 each, but only Rhode Island replied with a conditional offer. Cornerstone Saratoga Battle Monument under construction in 1877 On 17 October 1877, 100 years to the day after Burgoyne's surrender, the cornerstone of the monument was laid with great pageantry, including a parade two miles long to the site, music, speeches and the reading of Fitz-Greene Halleck's \\"The Field of Grounded Arms\\": > ... And such were Saratoga’s victors—such The Yeomen-Brave, whose deeds and > death have given A glory to her skies, A music to her name. In honorable > life her fields they trod, In honorable death they sleep below; Their sons’ > proud feelings here Their noblest monuments. Construction John C. Markham, designer of the Monument Plaque: Women in the Revolution The monument was designed by John C. Markham of New Jersey. The capstone was placed on 3 November 1882, and the bronze statues were completed in August 1887. The statues were designed by George Bissell (Gates), Alexander Doyle (Schuyler), and William O'Donovan (Morgan). Markham designed the sixteen bronze bas-relief plaques that line the interior of the first floor. The monument was formally dedicated and turned over to the State of New York on 18 October 1912. In 1980, the state transferred the monument to the US National Park Service. Funding Final funding for the Saratoga Battle Monument consisted of $2,300 from private donations, $95,000 from the federal government, and $10,000 from New York State. Much of the labor and material was donated. In 1895, when the monument was transferred to New York State, a debt of $4,500 remained. Renovations By 1987, the monument had deteriorated such that it had to be closed due to safety concerns. A renovation was undertaken at a cost of $3 million, and the monument was reopened on Columbus Day, 2005. Funding was provided by the National Park Service thanks to the efforts of Congressman Gerald Solomon.

Biography  Gyalzur was born as Tenzin Dolkar in Shigatse, Tibet. She lost her parents in the Chinese annexation of Tibet and as a child crossed the Himalayas on foot and on horseback to flee to India. She grew up in an Indian orphanage, and was chosen to be one of a dozen children sent to Germany by the Tibetan government in exile in 1963. In Germany, she obtained a nursing degree, married another Tibetan refugee, Losang Gyalzur, and moved with him to Switzerland.

It is maintained by the national statistics bureau ' (Insee). Since October 2019, the register has been accessible online free of charge and without registration.  Data in the register  The register contains deaths since 1970, inclusively. For the current year there are monthly and quarterly files. For past years, the data are summarised in one file per calendar year. Each entry concerns one person and contains the surname, first names, sex, date of birth, the Insee code of the place of birth (or country of birth for those born abroad), the name of the place of birth (for those born abroad also the name of the country of birth), the date of death, the Insee code of the place of death and the number in the death register of the respective municipality. The text fields contain only capital letters without diacritics. Each data set is included in the file that corresponds to its date of processing at the Insee, not the date of death. The law gives French civil registry offices one week to report deaths to the Insee. For reports submitted in paper form by traditional mail, postal delivery and processing at the statistics bureau will cause an additional delay before the data are recorded. Public holidays or other circumstances affecting the work of the authorities involved may also cause delays. A file of the register published by Insee for a given period therefore usually contains a significant number of entries for previous reporting periods; conversely, not all deaths occurring during the reporting period are included in the file for that period. For example, the monthly file for March 2020 contained about 8,700 entries concerning deaths before 1 March, but the file was missing 9,500 cases of deaths in March that were not recorded until April. For this reason, the numbers of deaths listed in the monthly files of the death register do not correspond to consolidated death statistics per period, such as the figures published by the Insee since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, broken down by département.  Access  Until 2017, access to the central death register was available only to certain commercial genealogy services, which Insee charged about 7,000 euros per year. Access subsequently became free of charge, but remained restricted to authorized companies bound by a licensing agreement with Insee. However, on 17 May 2019, the French state's commission in charge of questions related to freedom of information and access to official data, CADA (Commission d'accès aux documents administratifs), decided at the request of a genealogical association that the central death register must immediately be made publicly accessible. The commission argued that the register was a set of administrative documents not containing any personal data in need of protection, since the persons concerned were not alive anymore. This sets the register apart from other civil status databases such as birth and marriage registers, for which a protection period of 75 years applies in France. For the same reason, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation was not applicable, according to CADA. Following this decision, the Insee made the data freely available in October 2019 under the Open License for French government data. Today, they are accessible from at least two official web portals: the French state's open data portal data.gouv.fr and the Insee website, insee.fr. There is no legal guarantee for the correctness of the data. On data.gouv.fr and on insee.fr the data can be downloaded as text files, although the file formats are not identical on both sites. Neither of the two sites offers search and display functionality for the data, and the Insee encoding of places is not resolved.

Synopsis Unsounded describes itself as covering \\"fall[ing] into the Epic Fantasy Adventure genre, with occasional forays into the horrific, the profane, and the goofy\\". It follows the lion-tailed daughter of the Lord of Thieves, Sette Frummagem, as accompanied by the resurrected soldier Duane Adelier, she travels through the continent of Kasslyne, divided by a war between Alderode and Cresce, who fight over land, politics, religious beliefs, and simple bad blood. However, both agree that power lies in the Khert, the invisible spectral plane that holds all life and laws together. Using pymary (a type of magic), a spellcaster can bend the world around them. Publication The comic was collected in a book independentally published by Cope in November 2012, after a Kickstarter campaign intended to raise $9,000 raised over $40,000 instead, with further Kickstarter campaigns was made for a second and third book respectively in 2014 and 2017 each raising over $70,000 against goals of $25,000 and $50,000. Reception The Star-Ledger, which selected Unsounded as one of the best new and most-dynamic webcomics of 2013, approved of the comic as having \\"grown to be the richest comic on the Internet, and, when Cope feels like demonstrating her chops, the most artfully drawn, too\\", which \\"[w]ith its bright colors, spell effects, action sequences, and descents into dreamscapes and dens of thieves, Unsounded often feels like a Fritz Lieber story illustrated by Herge.\\" The Daily Dot complimented how \\"Cope takes particular advantage of the web medium through her use of animation during impactful scenes\\", with E.K. Weaver noting to The Austin Chronicle its \\"incredibl[e] intrica[cy]\\" and The Beat complimenting how Cope \\"uses the comic’s digital nature to great advantage. Dramatic moments will sometimes pop out of the borders, magical forces will infiltrate the website design, or a joke will be animated for full effect. These tricks are used sparingly but to great effect. In many ways, this speaks to Unsounded as a whole. It can feel conventional, until it suddenly doesn’t.\\", before concluding that \\"Unsounded isn’t a fantasy story about good and evil, but about different people with different goals. It has a huge supporting cast, and watching characters with competing world views bounce off each other is incredibly rewarding, especially as the plot thickens and the story increases in scale. All of these elements come together to make the comic a meaty meal that I recommend for people who really want to delve into their reading.\\" ComicsAlliance likewise concluding \\"Cope [to be] fantastic at drawing action scenes, making them easier to follow visually than some superhero comics.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2010s webcomics Category:American webcomics Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:Kickstarter-funded publications Category:2012 webcomic debuts Category:Feminist webcomics ","title":"Unsounded"},{"id":"63978122","text":"Raccordo autostradale 6 (RA 6), managed by ANAS, is a motorway in Central Italy and allows a quick connection of the SS 3 bis (also known as E45) near the city of Perugia with the Autostrada del Sole where the route begins in the locality of Bettolle, municipality of Sinalunga (SI).

The actor felt the offer of the role was good timing, as he was approaching his 40th birthday and feeling unconnected to anything. He previously appeared in the serial as Stafford McRae in 2004. Nichol relocated from Melbourne to Sydney to accommodate his filming commitments, and he began filming alongside his on-screen family in early 2017. Nichol expressed an interest in staying with the show for a long time. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 June 2017. Ben is introduced along with his wife Maggie Astoni (Kestie Morassi) and two daughters Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman) and Coco Astoni (Anna Cocquerel), making them the first nuclear family to be introduced to Home and Away in 17 years. Ben is portrayed as a laidback, loyal, hotheaded family man. He is a carpenter and former professional surfer. Nichol thought Ben was the type of man he shares a beer with, and he felt he could relate to his \\"daggy\\" side. The Astoni family relocate to the town of Summer Bay for a fresh start, which Nichol could identify with following his own move. The introduction of the family was a return to parent-child storylines that had not been featured in recent years. The Astoni's closeness and loyalty have been tested numerous times, with issues ranging from Coco's eating disorder, Ben's temper, and the introduction of Maggie's overbearing mother Diana Walford (Sarah Chadwick) ahead of Ben and Maggie's vow renewal. The biggest test for the family was an issue-led storyline focusing on Maggie's battle with cancer. Nichol found the emotional scenes easy to play out due to his close friendship with Morassi. Ben was central to a male depression storyline, which began airing from late 2019, that sought to raise awareness of the disorder and the impact it has on suffers and their loved ones. The storyline was filmed over six months, and Nichol admitted that he was left exhausted by the end of the plot. Ben's depression is triggered by an arrest for drug trafficking, and he is seen continuously rejecting help from Maggie and Ziggy. The character's estranged brother Marco Astoni (Tim Walter) was introduced during 2020, which helped further explore Ben's fictional backstory. Writers used Marco's arrival to test Ben and Maggie's marriage, as it emerges that they once had a one-night stand. The revelation raises questions about Ziggy's paternity and leads to the couple separating. During this time, producers explored a potential romance between Ben and Gemma Parata (Bree Peters). After airing a reconciliation between Ben and Maggie, both characters departed Home and Away on 14 July 2020. The character has been called \\"one of the town's favourite residents\\" by a writer for New Idea, but The West Australian' Stephanie McKenna was critical of his persona saying he \\"displays no emotion\\" and \\"rarely expresses an opinion\\". Casting In early June 2017, Luke Dennehy of the Herald Sun confirmed that the four-strong Astoni family, played by Rohan Nichol, Kestie Morassi, Sophie Dillman and Anna Cocquerel, would soon be introduced to the serial. The actors had been photographed filming their first scenes earlier in the year. The Astonis are the first nuclear family to be introduced to Home and Away in 17 years, since the arrival of the Sutherlands in 2000. Nichol was cast as patriarch Ben Astoni. He had previously appeared in the guest role of Stafford McRae in 2004. Nichol admitted that he was \\"approaching 40 and just feeling very burnt out and not connected to anyone or anything\\" when he was offered the role. He thought it was good timing and described it as the \\"right thing\\" for himself. He was also glad of the chance to work with Morassi, whom he was friends with. He stated \\"When I came for the call back, I saw her out the front and I went 'thank god it's Kestie'. We got in there and looked after each other, had a blast, and we both had a good feeling about it.\\" Nichol relocated from Melbourne to Sydney to accommodate his filming commitments. He was keen to stay with the show for a long time, and took inspiration from his co-star Ray Meagher, who has played Alf Stewart since the first episode. He found Meagher's perspective interesting and said \\"I think he was around my age when he joined, when the show started, and as a man in your 40s you sort of think about 'where am I going in this caper, what am I doing?'\\" The Astoni's arrival was preceded by a promotional trailer, which showed them visiting the fictional town of Summer Bay. Nichol made his debut as Ben on 20 June 2017. DevelopmentCharacterisation= Ahead of the character's introduction, a press release stated \\"Ben is a family man, besotted with his wife and a devoted father to Ziggy and Coco. His business in the city is floundering and his kids are going off the rails. Ben is looking for a circuit breaker.\\" The character's profile on TVNZ describes him as \\"just your average Aussie bloke.\\" He is \\"laidback and cheeky\\", but also has a tough side and is protective of his family, whom he always puts first. Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz said Ben is a \\"hotheaded\\" former professional surfer. Nichol branded Ben \\"a daggy dad\\" and \\"hot tempered and emotional\\", which are traits he shared and could relate to. Nichol liked his character's persona and thought he was the type of man he would spend time with at the weekend. Nichol said \\"He's a good guy, he's a guy I'd like to have a beer with! I like the fact that Ben is very loyal and he's a lover. He's very in love with his wife.\\" Nichol found the beach scenes were an incentive for him to stay fit, but he thought Ben did not have to \\"look like a superhero\\", he just needs to look like a man who stays fit, but also enjoys an occasional beer. Nichol was comfortable portraying Ben's family life and occupation as a carpenter, but he struggled with his character's passion for surfing. He admitted that he could not surf and he felt like he was \\"chained to a coffee table\\" every time he left the water with a surfboard. =Introduction= The Astoni family spend the day at the beach in Summer Bay, where surfer Ben is impressed by the \\"bumper waves\\", before they decide to move to the town for a fresh start. Ben and eldest daughter Ziggy Astoni (Dillman) were the first members of the Astoni family to be introduced. Dillman said Ziggy is running away from an issue she has caused in the city when she ducks into a bathroom and meets Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood). He helps hide her in his car as Ben comes looking for her. Later at home, Ben chastises his daughter for stealing a car and fleeing the scene. At the same time, his wife Maggie Astoni (Morassi) brings their youngest daughter Coco Astoni (Cocquerel) home and reveals that she had been suspended from school, leading Maggie to suggest that they all go on a day trip. Dillman said the Astonis were \\"a normal family. But they're trying to make things work with two kids.\\" The family end up in Summer Bay, where they spend the day at the beach. When it is time for them to leave, they discover their car will not start, leading Ben to introduce himself to town stalwart Alf Stewart, who realises that their car will not be fixed that day, leaving them stuck in the Bay. The family stay in the caravan park and Ziggy causes trouble by stealing from the locals. Johnathon Hughes of the Radio Times observed that the Astonis are \\"relieved to be leaving\\" when the car is fixed, until Ben reverses into a water tank and causes a pipe to burst. Ben and Maggie decide to move to the Bay permanently, as Maggie secures the principal's job at the local high school and Ben decides on a career change. Vanessa Williams of The West Australian wrote that Ben is \\"impressed by Summer Bay's golden beaches and bumper waves\\", and he realises that the town can also offer his family a fresh start. Nichol told Williams that the Astonis like the idea of living in the Bay, as their time in the city has not being working out for them. He continued, \\"They encounter some friendly faces and it's all a bit fortuitous that they land there and Ben's a surfer, and the waves are good, and between him and his wife, they decide to do what a lot people dream to do and have a bit of a sea change. So that's how it comes to be and naturally there are dramas along the way which everyone will find out about.\\" Nichol identified with the character's move to Summer Bay, due to his own experience of relocating to Manly from Melbourne for the role. Series producer Lucy Addario said the Astonis would settle into the community without any major incidents. =Family= The introduction of the Astoni family was a return to parent-child storylines that had not been featured in recent years, as many of the show's disjointed families had dominated the plots. Nichol told Williams that to help him and his new co-stars bond, the producers decided against easing them in slowly and gave them a lot of content straight away. They spent long days filming together, which helped them to develop their family dynamics and show their strengths and weaknesses. He thought the process worked well for them. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap liked how the family pull together in a crisis and noted that they have a good chemistry. Morassi told her that the actors are all friends off-screen and regularly get together for dinner. Addario said the Astonis were fiercely loyal to one another, which helped ground them, and like a lot of families they have \\"a keenly attuned instinct for riling each other up\\". Morassi later stated that family had \\"struck a chord\\" with fans due to their tightness and portrayal of normal issues that families go through. Nichol was also hopeful that the Astoni family would be accepted by the show's viewers, citing the humour and lightheartedness in them and their stories. The actor, who does not have children, brought his experience with living with four sisters to the role. He admitted to having a protective streak which helped him understand Ben's family dynamic. He also felt that he was finally the right age to play a father, and compared playing Ben to his role as family man Luc Palermo in headLand where he thought he was \\"a bit young for it then.\\" Nichol also found the role helped him gain an insight into raising teenagers. He explained 'I've learnt sometimes it's best to listen and let young people talk. Very often I tend to just want to fix something immediately, rather than actually hear somebody. I think it's very important with teenagers that they're heard.\\" The family are soon tested by Coco's eating disorder. After spending the day not eating, Coco collapses and is hospitalised after suffering a convulsion. She asks Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) to keep the truth about her condition from her parents, as she thinks that she has it under control. Cocquerel said \\"Maggie and Ben are deeply suspicious. In addition to being very worried about her, they know she's hiding something.\\" Maggie and Ben do find out about Coco's eating disorder eventually and Cocquerel thought the revelation would have \\"serious repercussions for the Astoni family.\\" Ben's temper also causes problems for the family when he attacks Brody after a misunderstanding. Ben witnesses Ziggy shouting at Brody to leave her be and instantly thinks \\"the worst\\", so he punches Brody in the face. He later learns Brody was helping Ziggy after her drink was spiked. To help convey Ben and Maggie's strong relationship, writers scripted a vow renewal for the couple. An Inside Soap writer noted that things had not been easy for them during their first few months in the Bay, and Ben's temper had put a strain on his marriage. Their issues are not helped by the introduction of Maggie's overbearing mother Diana Walford (Sarah Chadwick), who makes it clear that she disapproves of Ben and blocks his plans to celebrate his wedding anniversary. He then comes up with the idea of renewing his vows to Maggie, and tries to get Diana \\"on board\\". After they reconcile their differences, Diana helps Ben plan the ceremony and leads Maggie down to the beach. Morassi said that Maggie is \\"very touched\\" when she sees her family waiting for her, and her mother's presence makes it even more special. Maggie later tells Diana that Ben is the man she wants and he will always be there for her. In another issue-led storyline for the show, Maggie is diagnosed with cancer and the Astonis are \\"forced to face up to her mortality\\". Morassi told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Maggie wants to survive for herself and her family, and she hoped viewers would be able to relate the journey. Maggie's test results indicate that she needs immediate treatment and Ben, Coco and Ziggy attend her first chemotherapy session. She is initially upbeat, but later collapses in Ben's arms and he talks to her about all the things they will do when she is better to reassure her. Maggie is informed that she can undergo a stem cell transplant, so Ben is tested but is not a match. He then convinces his wife to ask Ziggy, even thought she is reluctant to put her daughter through the process. Nichol said he tried not to think about what would happen if Maggie died, as she is the love of Ben's life. He found the emotional scenes easy to play out with Morassi, as they are close friends, but he admitted that they were tiring. Diana later arranges for Maggie to join a medical trial in the United States. Nichol commented that Ben is \\"very apprehensive\\" as he knows Maggie is not in a fit state to travel. Maggie is later given a stem-cell transplant in Australia and she goes into remission. =Depression= In late 2019, the character was the focus of a male depression storyline, which sought to raise awareness of the disorder and its impact on sufferers and their loved ones. Nichol was grateful that the scriptwriters and producers entrusted him with the storyline, saying he was \\"proud\\" of the plot and how well it had been crafted. He carried out his own research and commented, \\"I wouldn't be a man of my age and breadth of life without having had a brush with that sort of despair here and there, especially in this profession. Acting is a really hard thing to just survive in, let alone become successful in. I know a few people in my line of life that have had struggles with mental health.\\" Nichol believed his character was \\"a prime candidate\\" for depression due to his age. He told Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz that people \\"ask a lot of questions of [themselves]\\" when they reach their late 30s and 40s. The cast and crew spent six months filming the storyline, and Nichol admitted that the stamina needed was a challenge and the heavier scenes wore him out. He also found to his surprise that he did not draw on his own life experiences, as Ben's depression felt different from anything he had been through. Ben's depression is triggered by his arrest for drug trafficking. After he outsources a large surfboard order, the police find the surfboards have been hollowed out and filled with drugs, leaving Ben as the prime suspect in the investigation. As he is questioned, Ben \\"protests his innocence\\" and explains how he outsourced the production to firm in Yabbie Creek, so their employees must be responsible. However, the police find the warehouse empty and no trace of the company, so a \\"frightened\\" Ben is kept in the cells at the station overnight. Ben's arrest also affects Dean, with O'Connor commenting that his character is \\"completely horrified\\" and worried that he may come under suspicion too. Harvey pointed out that Ben's depression may have been inevitable after he spent months supporting Maggie through her cancer battle and Ziggy with her marriage break-up. The arrest was \\"the final straw\\". As Ben spirals further into depression, he is forced to sell his businesses and he also moves into the caravan park. He continuously rejects help from Maggie and Ziggy and does not tell them about his feelings. Maggie and Ziggy struggle to cope and seek counselling for themselves, which Nichol thought was \\"really important\\". Nichol liked that the plot also showed how Ben's depression affects Maggie and Ziggy. He also wanted to be sure that they conveyed Ben and Maggie's commitment to one another, and he praised Morassi's work in particular, saying she \\"does it justice, absolutely.\\" Ben spends most of his time at the caravan park, where he meets Dean's mother Karen Thompson (Georgia Adamson). Her \\"flirtatious nature\\" makes Ben smile for the first time in months and he finds comfort in her kindness. A TV Week writer observed that the pair seem to share a good chemistry, as Ben enjoys Karen's \\"cheeky attitude\\". Maggie and Ziggy attempt to raise interest in Ben's surf business, but the response is low until they get Ben to offer free surf lessons. Ben is \\"slightly buoyed\\" when Dean pays him, until he learns the lessons were free and arranged by his family, which leaves him feeling embarrassed and he tells them to go to hell. This results in Maggie giving him an ultimatum – get professional help or their marriage is over. Ben reaches \\"a devastating climax\\", after attempting to drive away from the Bay and breaking down in tears at the wheel. He and his family decide to go to the hospital, where he tells Doctor Alex Neilson (Zoe Ventoura) how he has been feeling. After completing a mental health assessment, Ben is diagnosed with severe depression and Alex recommends antidepressants. Ben is initially reluctant to take them as they can produce some bad side effects. Nichol admitted to being exhausted at the end of the storyline, commenting that it was \\"a real downer\\" acting out Ben's low moments. He expressed his gratitude and pride at been given a chance to take on \\"an issue that's so relevant and relatable\\", adding that the plot was done with \\"respect and wisdom.\\" =Marco Astoni= Producers introduced the character's brother Marco Astoni played by Tim Walter in March 2020. Marco's introduction helped to further explore Ben's fictional backstory, as the brothers are estranged. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that Ben assaulted Marco after seeing him argue with Maggie, whom Marco has been in love with since he was a teenager. Marco comes to Summer Bay under the pretence of reconciling with Ben and going into business with him. Ben's \\"temper flares\\" when he sees Marco at his birthday party, but Ziggy helps diffuse the situation and Ben softens towards his brother. Maggie is seen acting \\"on edge\\" around Marco and does not want him around. It soon emerges that Marco and Maggie had a one-night stand during a time when she and Ben were not together. Marco uses this to blackmail Maggie, which leaves her feeling guilty. Morassi commented \\"Maggie knows that she made a terrible mistake all those years ago, but at the same she and Ben had temporarily broken up. Now she just wants to move on and can't take the pressure anymore. She feels she has no choice but to tell Ben. She needs the truth to come out, even though she knows that it may destroy her marriage.\\" As Marco requests financial help for a business deal, Maggie soon tells Ben about their one- night stand. The resulting confrontation between the brothers brings up questions about Ziggy's paternity. Dillman pointed out that when Marco arrived, her character did all she could to reunite her uncle and father, as she thought she saw regret in Marco's eyes, but the discovery that she could be Marco's daughter has changed everything. In an interview with the Radio Times' Johnathon Hughes, Dillman said that Ziggy has such a close relationship with Ben that \\"it kills her that he might not be her father, it's made her feel a bit lost and definitely thrown a spanner in the works.\\" Ziggy knows that Ben will always be her father, so she is initially against doing a paternity test, but the results confirm that she is Ben's biological daughter. Hughes noted that the plot was \\"one of the biggest challenges yet for the tight-knit clan\\" and would continue to affect the family. Dillman thought Marco's decision to stay in the Bay made it difficult for the family to move on, and she believed that he might be \\"desperate for some form of redemption\\", as he has got Ben in trouble in the past and could be still in love with Maggie. =Marriage separation and departure= Ben struggles to get past Maggie's revelation and the strain on their marriage leads to their separation. Despite Ziggy's attempt to get them to work things out, the couple start arguing and eventually decide to live apart. In episodes broadcast in mid-May 2020, Ben suffers a health scare and is hospitalised. The scenes see Ben collapse in front of Maggie, before being rushed to the hospital in a critical condition, where he then suffers a seizure. Morassi commented that Maggie is still in love with her husband and wants to move on, but now she might not be able to. While Dillman said that Ziggy wants to make sure her father is okay and she knows he needs Maggie by his side. The scenes revisit the character's depression storyline, as it emerges that Ben took \\"a dangerous cocktail of drugs\\" to deal with the stress of his separation. He is advised to talk to his psychiatrist about his problems in the future. During Ben and Maggie's split, writers explored a potential romance between Ben and the newly introduced character Gemma Parata (Bree Peters). A New Idea columnist observed that Ben appears to feel relieved by his separation from Maggie. Nichol told them: \\"Ben's marriage was always an absolutely sacred place to him. But now that it's no long that, he has come to feel that he doesn't know Maggie at all. That trust is gone.\\" Ben befriends Bay newcomer Gemma when she invites him to a hāngi at her home. The columnist noted that they shared \\"an easy banter\\". Gemma's teenage son Nikau Parata (Kawakawa Fox-Reo) also notices their connection and takes an instant dislike to Ben. Ben flirts with Gemma as they grow closer, which devastates Maggie when she sees them together. Morassi commented \\"The thought of Ben being with another woman is her worst nightmare.\\" Following a confrontation between the pair, Ben gets drunk with Gemma and they go back to his motel room. Ben and Maggie eventually reconcile and decide to make a fresh start in Italy. Morassi commented \\"Moving to Italy with Ben has always been one of Maggie's dreams\\". She also said that the separation means the couple are \\"very different people now\\", so they feel that they are starting their relationship over, which leaves them both excited and nervous. Ben and Maggie ask their daughters to come with them, but they choose to stay in Australia. The plot development marked the departures of both Ben and Maggie from the show. Their final scenes saw them spending their last night in the Bay reflecting on their time there, before attending a surprise goodbye lunch hosted by Alf and their friends. The couple's exit causes Ziggy to become depressed, and Dillman commented \\"They've always been in it together and they've been through so much. She's lost. Where do you go from here?\\" Following the broadcast of his character's exit scenes on 14 July 2020, Rohan took to his social media to thank the producers, cast, crew, and fans. He added that they had \\"made a few dreams come true for me.\\" Reception A TV Week reporter observed that the Astoni family \\"have not had a smooth sea change\\" when Ben and Maggie bought the Pier and Diner. The magazine's Tamara Cullen said Ben and Maggie had \\"a tough 2019\\", which left their marriage \\"hanging by a thread\\". Ali Cromarty of New Idea pointed out the character was popular with the show's fans, saying that they \\"love Ben\\", and Nichol told her that people who visit the outdoor set \\"are always so happy to see me\\". Another writer for New Idea described Ben as \\"one of the town's favourite residents\\" and a \\"much-loved dad\\". While another writer for the publication stated that Ben and Maggie \\"were once one of Summer Bay's happiest married couples.\\" Many viewers related to the character's depression storyline, with some reaching out to Nichol to talk about their struggles. He said that \\"it's meant a lot to me. Being courageous enough [to open up] is lovely.\\" Stephanie McKenna of The West Australian branded the character a \\"future Darwin award winner\\" after he admitted to changing his dose of anti-depressants before his collapse. McKenna called the short romance between Ben and Gemma \\"a bit disappointing\\" because of the limited relationship options in Summer Bay, and she quipped \\"the producers love getting our hopes up and then crushing them.\\" McKenna was also critical of the character's persona when confronted, noting that \\"in typical Ben fashion he displays no emotion nor an ounce of personality\\", and adding that he also \\"rarely expresses an opinion\\". When Ben stopped Maggie from leaving town, McKenna wondered how much time he needed to make a decision about their marriage, commenting \\"Get over it and go back to her or move on.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Ben Astoni at TVNZ *Rohan Nichol at 7plus Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional carpenters Category:Fictional surfers ","title":"Ben Astoni"},{"id":"63978177","text":"Deepika Kundaji (born c. 1963) is an Indian farmer whose methods gained national attention and an award from the Government of India.

If they find out how to fix their land then there is 93 million hectares of land in India that also needs to be restored to productive and sustainable use. In 2009 she had spoken about the importance of seeds. She believes that the local farmers in Auroville need to concentrate on preserving their seeds. The poor land is being transformed slowly using 80-90 different seed varieties but to achieve success they need to save and distribute about 3,000 packets of seeds. She ensures that the hardiest of varieties are conserved so that they can transform the land. She understands climate change is coming but it isn't new - climate does change. Kundaji notes that humans have been cultivating crops for 10,000 years and we need to exploit the varieties of crops that are available. Her award of the Nari Shakti Puraskar was made in the Durbar room of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace) by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, on International Women's Day. The award is India's highest civilian award for women. She had not been expecting the award. She had flown to New Delhi the night before after an official had contacted her at the start of March to mention the award. She had been dealing with both her brother and her mother who had needed her support when the phone call came.

His main area of study revolves around infectious diseases and intervention. Ever since 1986, he has been a main contributor to the information about AIDS in Africa. As a co-coordinator of a Tanzanian-Swedish research collaboration called TANSWED, he was involved in many research projects that lead to multiple publications in medical journals. His more recent research on HIV/AIDS involves studying breast cancer in HIV prevalent areas, evaluating prevention of mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1, and observing sexual behaviors of high risk populations for HIV-1.  Education  Mhalu trained in medicine at Makerere University College Medical School in Kampala, Uganda. He continued training pathology, microbiology, and immunology at various universities, including the University of Ibadan Nigeria, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at London University. In 2003, Mhalu was awarded an honorary Doctorate at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.  Career  Early career = Mhalu was a professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, a Dean of the School of Medicine, and the Director of Postgraduate Studies and Research at Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences (MUCHS) in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Before working on AIDS, Mhalu largely focused his studies on communicable diseases and intervention tactics. He was the lead researcher on Tanzania's cholera outbreak. In 1986, his career path shifted and he started researching AIDS prevalence among barmaids in Dar Es Salaam, which had similar trends of transmission to cases in Uganda. Mhalu was a co-coordinator for TANSWED, an HIV/AIDS research program, with Professor Gunnel Biberfeld from Sweden since 1986. He was also a coordinator for a multicenter study in Tanzania for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV transmission (PMTCT) program from 1996 to 1999. Mhalu served as another coordinator for an intervention project called Mother-to-Infant HIV transmission in Tanzania. In 1986, Mhalu was sent to Congo to investigate an emerging drug, and was found to be very skeptical of its effectiveness. He claimed that effective treatment comes from scientific approaches that studies the molecular biology and biochemistry of the HIV virus, and not spontaneous trials without the usage of scientific principles. = Recent career = In 2000, Mhalu was invited by the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, to be a part of a panel in the 2000 International AIDS Conference. The purpose of this conference was to bring together many scientists and experts from all over the world to debate the pathology of AIDS. President Thabo Mbeki questioned the relationship that AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, and instead believed it was caused by poverty and side effects from Western pharmaceuticals. Through this conference, Thabo Mbeki wanted to get answers from questions, like the pathology of AIDS and prevention, to assist with governmental responses to the epidemic. Mhalu did not attend the conference in Durban, South Africa. In response to this stance by the president of South Africa, five-thousand scientists, including Mhalu, published the Durban Declaration. These scientists were anxious that AIDS denialism presented by Thabo Mbeki would contribute to more AIDS cases and deaths in HIV-prevalence countries, since prevention strategies like condom usage and blood screening would not be encouraged. Mhalu was a contributor to the Durban Declaration Organizing Committee, but he did not sign the declaration. In 2004, Mhalu co-signed a letter in support for vaccine trials of the RV144 HIV vaccine. This phase III clinical trial in Thailand immunized three-thousand volunteers and tests immune responses at the cellular level. The trial is sponsored by Thai and United States government, and has received some criticism by Dennis Burton and colleagues. Mhalu recognized benefit from this clinical trial because of its contribution to gain knowledge on HIV vaccination development. Mhalu's most recent published work has been focused on the molecular epidemiology of HIV, vaccine trials among police officers in Tanzania, and HIV infection transmitted through breast milk.  TANSWED  Started in 1986 by collaboration of Mhalu and Biberfeld, TANSWED, a Tanzanian and Swedish HIV/AIDS program, is a bilateral project aimed at collecting information about HIV infections in Tanzania. In 1987, this program launched a research project in Kagera called KARP (Kagera AIDS Research Project) to study HIV prevalence in blood samples among adults. Not too soon after this first project, TANSWED expanded their research areas outside of Kagera due to their growing numbers of researchers involved in the program. The main goals of TANSWED included advancing knowledge on the epidemiology and immunopathology of AIDS, studying behaviors that increased the risk of infection, and analyzing less expensive diagnostic techniques. TANSWED has supported the research of many Tanzanian scientists, including Japhet Killewo As a co- coordinator of the program, Mhalu made large contributions to many projects within TANSWED, as well participating in meetings to evaluate and improve the program overall. In 1988, Mhalu attended the 3rd International Conference on AIDS in Africa in Arusha, Tanzania and served as a chair member. Mhalu supervised the eight subprograms initiated through TANSWED, which included, but is not limited to, improving the diagnosis of HIV-1, studying mother-to- child transmission of HIV-1,and evaluating HIV-1 vaccine preparations. Some projects that Mhalu took part in include the research of improving HIV-1 laboratory diagnosis, preparation for HIV-1 vaccine evaluations in Tanzania, and studies that focused on young people and STDs in comparison with HIV. Some scientific articles that Mhalu has published through TANSWED include a comparison study of HIV prevalence in controls and patients, a case definition explanation of AIDS, and a population-based study of HIV prevalence in the Kagera region.

The museum closed for renovations in 2018 as part of an expansion project and reopened on February 11, 2019. Description Located in between the Koryo Hotel and Pyongyang station, the Korea Stamp Museum is situated in a three floor building with awards from philatelic exhibitions housed in the ground level, a souvenir shop on the second floor, and an exhibition hall on the third floor. The exterior of the museum after its renovation was built to resemble a postage stamp and has a bronze statue of a dove holding a postcard while flying above the Earth located outside the building. The museum functions more as a shop than a museum to attract international philatelists despite the limitations of international sanctions. Collection The Korea Stamp Museum houses over 6,000 stamps, envelops, and postcards. In this collection, the museum contains relics from the ancient times and artifacts from the postal system established at the end of the Joseon dynasty, as well as relics since the establishment of the North Korean Postal Service including the first stamps created by the service. The museum also houses an album of stamps collected by Kim Jong-il. The stamps displayed highlight events in the country's history, flora and fauna, and world events including the launch of Sputnik, the birth of Prince William, and the 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit.

Plot  Marisol Rios De La Luz (\\"sea and sun\\"), a student at Columbia University with a major in Earth and Environmental science, is studying abroad in Puerto Rico. Shortly after arriving, she finds out that her classes at the University of Puerto Rico are not longer available due to budget cuts. Initially she is disappointed, but she decides to she create her own lab in the back of her grandfather's café where she will conduct research on the rock samples that she acquires from her exploration of five caves. One night, she goes to Cueva Ventana during a storm and makes a shocking discovery about La Estrella Del Camino, which results in her receiving her powers from Atabex, Huracan, and Yucahu. As a superhero with a commitment to solving Puerto Rico's environmental issues, the people recognize her as their vigilante and La Borinqueña.  Themes  Reconnecting with Culture = La Borinqueña is a story about Marisol's self-discovery as an Afro-Puerto Rican. Throughout the story, she establishes an even deeper connection with her culture when she gets the opportunity to study abroad in Puerto Rico. This expressed through her embracement of the Puerto Rican flag, acknowledgement of the Taíno mythology, and commitment to resolving environmental issues. = Colorism = As an Afro-Puerto Rican, she encounters the issue of colorism when she meet Sofia, a white passing Puerto Rican. Unaware that Marisol is the granddaughter of the cafe owner, she automatically assumes that she is la \\"morena cocinado\\" because of her appearance.  Identity  Identity is a prominent theme throughout the text. It is explicitly addressed through Marisol's physical, geographical, and her political identity. As an Afro- Puerto Rican she belongs to two different racial groups and has a hybrid identity, so she has to learn how to embrace both parts of her even though she may face issues, such as colorism. Additionally, her identity as a New Yorker is extremely important to the plot of the story. Historically, New York has been the center of revolution and change for Puerto Rico, so having a character with this identity refers to this history. The implications of having a character who is both Puerto Rican and from New York is that it acknowledges pays homage to the individuals that were exiled to New York after the Lares Rebellion. Marisol's adoption of the flag that was created during El Grito de Lares gives he a new identity amongst her people. After seeing Marisol dressed in the colors of the Puerto Rican flag, people are filled with nationalism and begin singing both reminded renditions of La Borinqueña, Puerto Rico's National Anthem. This is how she is given the name, La Borinqueña, which gives her political significance. She is now a political symbol decolonization, rebellion, and pride. = Nationalism = In this story, there are clear references to the Puerto Rican flag and the National Anthem which are both important symbols of the Puerto Rican nationalism. Because of this nationalism, that Marisol is uplifted as a superhero by her community. This is significant because the Puerto Rican Flag was not always accepted. There have been many attempts to degrade this symbol decrease the pride by restraining any acts of nationalism. The Puerto Rican people's embracement of Marisol, who wears the Puerto Rican flag as her superhero costume, shows that this symbol is still significant to the people despite all of the efforts to restrain their acts of nationalism. Although this flag has a long and controversial history, the flag has become part of Puerto Rico's ethnic identity. Strength and Perseverance This comic alludes to several key events from Puerto Rico's past such as the Indigenous Rebellion and Colonialism. In addition, it acknowledges Puerto Rico's constant struggles with various environmental issues and the Debt Crisis. By depicting these events, Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez shows the resiliency of the Puerto Rican people who have persevered through many devastating events.  Historical References  Taíno Mythology = Marisol receives her superhero abilities from Atabex or Atabey (goddess), Huracan, and Yúcahu, who are keys figures of Taíno mythology. Atabex, the Mother of Boriken, speaks directly to Marisol after she locates the five crystals (which come together to form La Estrella Del Camino). Her son, Huracan, the spirit of storms, gives Marisol the power to control the wind. Through him, power to control the storms and fly. Atabex's other son, Yucahu, the spirit of the sea and mountains gives Marisol her the power to control the earth. = Estrella Del Camino = The story makes several references to the La Estrella Del Camino. Professor Robles and several other people have searched for this star. When Marisol finds all five crystals which form this star, she meets Atabex, and her powers are unlocked. This is important because this symbol leads her to her destiny as the Puerto Rican superhero, La Borinqueña. = Puerto Rican Flag History = Before Marisol leaves for Puerto Rico, her Mother gives her a family heirloom, which is a piece of the remaining fabric that Marian Bracetti used to sew the flag for El Grito De Lares. El Grito De Lares was a rebellion in Puerto Rico that was against Spanish rule. Later, another flag was adopted by a group of exiles in New York in solidarity with the Cuban Revolutionary Party. When Marisol speaks to Atabex, this ribbon expands to form her suit which resembles the Puerto Rican flag. When people see her wearing the flag, they are filled with nationalism and pride. = Economic Debt Crisis = When Marisol arrives in Puerto Rico, she finds out that all of her classes are canceled because of budget cuts that the University of Puerto Rico was experiencing. This is a direct reference to the economic debt crisis that is affecting Puerto Rico. In the 20th century, Puerto Rico received assistance from the United States to keep its economy afloat, but this only worsened the conditions of the economy. As the economy continues to shrink and decrease in size, the government is placed in an uncomfortable position. Due to the lack of jobs, the working class has suffered the most and the funding for the public sector has taken a huge hit. = Poaching of Puerto Rican Sea Turtles = Before colonialism, this species of sea turtles was plentiful in Puerto Rico. Because of the negative human environmental interaction and animal poaching, they have become an endangered species. = Puerto Rican National Anthem = There are two versions of La Borinqueña, the Puerto Rican National Anthem: Manuel Fernández Juncos' version and the 1868 version of the anthem. When people see Marisol for the first time, they sing both anthems and give her the name, La Borinqueña.  As a Latinx Speculative Fiction Work  This comic belongs in the field of Latinx Speculative Fiction because it centers the experiences of the Marisol, who is an Afro-Latina, by focusing specifically on her identity and journey to embracing her culture. Written by Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez, who is a Puerto Rican, it presents an accurate and informed representation of Puerto Rican culture, vernacular, history, and mythology. This is significant because it helps to defamiliarize the Latinx stereotypes present in white mainstream comic series, expand the image of Latinx characters beyond the geographic origins and cultural restrictions, and diversify the representations of the Latinx Community. While the existence of La Borinqueña, who has an indigenous and Afro-Caribbean identity, within the field of Latinx Speculative Fiction help to represent people with hybrid identities and eliminate stereotypes of the Latinx community, there is still a lot of work needed to be done to eliminate the existing hierarchy within the metropolitan narrative.  Creation, Concept, and Influence  * Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez decided to create his own comic starring a Puerto Rican hero. Miranda- Rodriguez was inspired to make the character when he was approached by organizers of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City. They wanted to honor him for his previous work. Miranda-Rodriguez created a comic book to be introduced at the 2016 Puerto Rican Day Parade in NYC * Named after the national anthem of Puerto Rico, La Borinqueña mainly deals with political issues such as voter rights and climate change and police accountability. Her creator has described her more as a \\"symbol of hope\\" than a \\"crime fighter\\". * Wanted to write from the perspective of a student. Young people often go into college without specific political ideologies and the evolves as we hit different courses. Often, when traveling abroad, students minds and perspectives expand Marisol is not just leaning about her culture but her identity as well.  Collaboration and Remakes  Ricanstruction: Reminiscing and Rebuilding Puerto R = This is an anthology collaboration with contributors from popular comic book series. They team up with La Borinqueña and some of the most well known superheroes of all time. It takes the readers on a beautiful journey of Puerto Rican history and show the strength of the culturing in rebuilding the island  Fictography  * La Borinqueña /origin: The hero's origin story links the character to a Taino Specific history of not only resistance, but also resilience; those who stood up against the Spaniards, like Cacique Mabodamaca.

Such cases are thought to be more effective when victims take class action as a group. Lawyers with app access can reach out to users who have the choice to respond. Matches will be notified if another victim of the same perpetrator contacts a law firm. Lawyers take cases on contingency and JDoe profits from attorney legal marketing fees and successful case outcomes. As of 2019, the company claimed to be working with 30 law firms and to have helped identify 65 offenders.  Founder  JDoe founder Ryan Soscia, a survivor himself, began working on the app in 2014 after hearing several friends recount being assaulted by the same person a few years prior. Soscia sought to use technology to make the reporting process easier. Soscia took a leave of absence from University of California, San Diego to work on the app with a venture capital firm, eventually being selected as a fellow in the Halcyon Incubator and the LexisNexis Legal Tech Accelerator.  Criticism  Since the app creates matches based on user reports, concerns have been raised about potential harm toward those affected by false allegations. Soscia has said that the system itself weeds out false reports since only lawyers have access to the reports and are unlikely to take cases that will not hold up in court. Some critics have claimed that JDoe would be required to turn over user information if ordered to do so by a court. However, Soscia claims that because of the encryption setup, JDoe would be unable to access user data even if compelled by a warrant.

She served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War as well as a variety of domestic missions. She currently serves as a seamanship training vessel for Job Corps.  Construction and characteristics  USCGC Ironwood under construction in 1943Ironwood was built at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland. All other Mesquite-class ships were built at a commercial shipyard. Despite her identical design, Ironwood was by far the most expensive ship in her class. She cost the Coast Guard Yard $1,388,227 while the other five Mesquite-class ships cost an average of $878,029. She was the largest vessel ever built at the Coast Guard Yard at the time of her launch. Her keel was laid down on November 2, 1942, she was launched on March 16, 1943, and she was commissioned on August 4, 1943. Her hull was constructed of welded steel plates. As originally built, Ironwood was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement was 935 tons. While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. Ironwood had a single propeller driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 700 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran an electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which had the ability to lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Ironwood's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 42 enlisted personnel. Ironwood was armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. Two racks of depth charges were also mounted on the aft deck. All of her on-deck armament was removed in 1966, leaving only small arms for law enforcement actions. At the time of construction, Ironwood was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. The designation was system was changed in 1965, and Ironwood was redsignated WLB, an oceangoing buoy tender. Her namesake is a small tree or bush native to the midwest and south of the United States, Sideroxylon lanuginosum. One of its many common names is ironwood.  World War II service  USCGC Ironwood raising Japanese midget submarine off Guadalcanal After commissioning, and a short trial and training period in the Boston area, Ironwood sailed for the Pacific. She broke her propeller shaft en route and was towed in to Key West, Florida for repairs. She departed Key West February 12, 1944. Ironwood was able to reach New Caledonia on March 24, 1944 via Bora Bora, and Pago Pago. Her primary mission was supporting aids to navigation, moorings, and torpedo nets in 3rd Fleet operating areas. In addition, she moved cargo, mail, and personnel, towed barges and other vessels, participated in establishing the LORAN network, and provided search and rescue. She rescued 65 Navy and Marine personnel from the grounded freighter SS John Lind on March 28, 1944, returning them to Noumea the next day. She and two Navy tugs managed to pull the freighter off the reef and refloat her several days later. In January 1945 Ironwood sailed to Guadalcanal where Japanese midget submarine HA-37 had been discovered in shallow water off Cape Esperance. The two-man crew of the sub had aborted their mission and had run it ashore on after discovering its depth regulator was faulty. It took more than two weeks for divers to work a lifting bridle around the sub. On January 25, 1945 Ironwood raised the sub and towed it to Florida Island. Navy mine disposal officers were unable to remove its torpedos, so after the sub was searched, it was sunk. Ironwood was assigned to the 7th Fleet and sailed to Philippine waters, arriving at Leyte on August 6, 1945. Here she removed Japanese buoys and placed American aids to navigation and moorings. In summer 1947, Ironwood returned to San Francisco for a major refit. She reached her new homeport of Monterey, California in November. In addition to her work maintaining aids to navigation, she was involved in search and rescue efforts for lost ships and planes. She destroyed a derelict floating Japanese mine off Monterey Bay on April 11, 1948.  Pacific service  In May 1950, Ironwood was reassigned to Guam. From this base she serviced aids to navigation and LORAN stations throughout a wide area of the Pacific. On November 15, 1951 Ironwood became the first Coast Guard buoy tender to enter the Korean War. Between 1951 and 1954 Ironwood deployed to Korea four times. She supported LORAN stations on the peninsula. She was one of 24 Coast Guard ships that earned the Korean Service Medal. By the late 1990s she out out-lived all her peers and was the last active-duty ship so honored. In July 1954 Ironwood was reassigned to Honolulu, Hawaii. From this new homeport she ranged widely over the central Pacific servicing aids to navigation and LORAN stations. For example, in June 1960 she left Honolulu for a four month cruise with working stops in Samoa, Ponape, Truk, Guam, Koror, Ulithi, and Okinawa. During this cruise, in August 1960, Ironwood was caught in Typhoon Trix while en route to Osaka, Japan. Her captain was unable to avoid the storm which carried 155 mph winds. A large wave swamped her aft deck. Water poured into the engine room and shorted out the electrical control board. The main engines and generators stopped, leaving the ship adrift with no electrical power. After extinguishing an electrical fire, the crew was able to restore enough power to radio for help. An Army tug was able to tow Ironwood to port in Okinawa. In August of 1963 Ironwood undertook a special mission to investigate radiation levels at Rongelap Atoll in the aftermath of a 1954 hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll. A temporary lab was constructed on her buoy deck. For twelve days the ship carried a party of scientists around the atoll sampling plankton, fish, and vegetation. Much of the atoll was uncharted, so hydrographic data was collected as well. One of the newly discovered geographic features was named Ironwood Reef in honor of the ship. In 1967 the Republic of Vietnam had only a single buoy tender. It was not adequate to maintain and improve navigational aids needed by the increased US shipping activity along the South Vietnamese coast. The Coast Guard deployed four buoy tenders, including Ironwood, on short rotations to support aids to navigation during the Vietnam war. Ironwood's first deployment began in July 1967. Among the unique challenges faced in the war zone was that aids to navigation were used for target practice by all sides in the conflict. Batteries for lighted buoys were stolen by all sides for use in cars and other applications. Whenever any of the Coast Guard buoy tenders were deployed to the theater they sailed with Vietnamese lighthouse service personnel aboard. The training they received was deemed sufficient to turn over responsibility for maintaining their own aids to navigation in December 1972, but by then the regime was falling. The last Coast Guard buoy tender left Vietnamese waters in the spring of 1973 as part of the general withdrawal of U.S. forces.  Alaska service  On January 5, 1969 Ironwood arrived in Homer, Alaska. She was the first Coast Guard ship home-ported there. An Atlantic Richfield Company tanker, SS Yukon, hit a rock in Cook Inlet in March 1969 and began to spill oil. Ironwood was dispatched to the scene to escort the vessel to safety. In April 1969 a Shell Oil drilling platform in Cook Inlet exploded and caught fire. Ironwood responded, assisting in fire fighting. While stationed at Homer she was active in enforcing fisheries laws in the Bering Sea. USCGC Ironwood in 1979In 1974 Ironwood underwent a major renovation at the Coast Guard Yard where she was built. Her Diesel engines were overhauled, and she received a new electric motor to power her propeller. Water and sewage piping was replaced. Wiring and electrical switchboards were replaced. A bow thruster was added to improve her maneuverability. Crew quarters were modernized. After her renovation, Ironwood was assigned to Adak, Alaska. She was manned by the crew of the recently decommissioned USCGC Balsam', which had been assigned to Adak prior to her retirement. She arrived at her new homeport in 1975. During this assignment she rescued four fisherman who had abandoned their vessel on Great Sitkin Island. After her service on Adak, she was reassigned to Kodiak, Alaska, where she spent the rest of her Coast Guard career. She arrived on May 1, 1979. On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound spilling of crude oil. Ironwood was dispatched as part of a large Coast Guard response. She placed boom, set moorings for the response fleet, and observed conditions of the oil slick and affected wildlife. Ironwood was decommissioned at a small ceremony at Kodiak on October 6, 2000. She received many awards during her government service including Coast Guard Unit Commendation, two Meritorious Unit Commendations, World War II Victory Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, American Campaign Medal, 6 E-ribbons, Korean Service Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal.  Civilian service  Training Vessel Ironwood at 2017 Fleet WeekThe Coast Guard planned to sell Ironwood to the Nigerian Navy, but the deal fell through. She was sold to a private individual instead in February 2001. He, in turn, donated the ship to the U.S. Department of Labor which uses it as a training vessel in the Job Corps Seamanship Academy at Tongue Point in Astoria, Oregon. She now sails with a crew of sixty students and six instructors. Ironwood participated in the Fleet Week celebrations in Portland, Oregon in 2017.

Course in the United States Note: US segment is officially called: \\"North Branch Missisquoi River\\" From the Canada-US border, the course of the Sutton River, now called the North Branch Mississquoi River, descends 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) to the southwest in an agricultural area, forming two curves toward the southeast, crossing Pinnacle Road.[4] The North Branch Mississquoi River then flows into a bend in the north bank of the Missisquoi River. From the Canada-US border, the course of the Sutton River descends to the southwest in an agricultural area, forming two curves toward the southeast, and crossing the Pinnacle Road.USGS The Sutton River flows into a bend in the north bank of the Missisquoi River, which, just as it rises in Quebec. This confluence is located west of downtown Richford, Vermont. The road that runs along the west side of this american segment of this stream is called North Branch Rd.OpenStreetMap  Flood zone  The by-law relating to the town planning program for the town of Sutton mentions a flood zone along the Sutton river, between Schweizer road and the boundary of the municipality of Abercorn.By-law relating to urban plan No. 114-1 of the town of Sutton-June 2009. During the night of July 14 to 15, 1997, torrential rains fell on the valley of the Sutton river. A bridge on a tributary of the west bank of the Sutton River on Claybank Road (which takes the name of Frontier Road at Frelighsburg) in Abercorn was badly damaged. The flood took the bottom of the road and the wooden structure of the bridge crashed into the bottom of the stream. The debris blocked the branches carried by the current. Almost all of Abercorn's roads were damaged, notably Spencer and Church streets.Article \\"A salty bill\\" (in reference to the damage caused by the torrential rain), by André Duchesne, newspaper \\"La Voix de l'Est\\", July 17, 1997, p. 5.  Toponymy  The name of the American segment of Sutton River, which is designated \\"North Branch Missisquoi River\\", creates confusion with the name of the Missisquoi River North which spills upstream on the north shore of the Missisquoi River in Canada. The course of the Missisquoi North River flows between the mouth of Eastman Lake and Highwater, entirely in Quebec. In addition, in Vermont, there is a second Sutton River which is a tributary of the West Branch Passumpsic River; the latest is part of the watershed of the Connecticut River. The toponym \\"Rivière Sutton\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Site de la Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym \\"Rivière Sutton\\".

Initiated by Apostolos Georgopoulos, a Regents Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota, the premise for the project was inspired by a conversation with his wife, the endocrinologist Lily Georgopoulus, who had observed a small cohort of female patients who were thriving physically and mentally well into their 80s and 90s. Georgopoulos is working with Lisa James, an associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota to construct a comprehensive, longitudinal database with information on cognitive abilities and genetic markers that can be used to understand the molecular biology of the aging brain. As of 2019, the study had enrolled over 100 women ranging in age from their 20s to 104 yrs old. Annual checkups are used to track the impact of genetic markers, brain images, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors on cognitive changes in the women. The data has shown a link between a human leuckocyte antigen and brain health, with the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele correlating with less brain damage and with cognitive health over time. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease.

Biography Edith Mary Dale was born in Kanpur, India. Her father was George Desborough Dale, and he worked in the Indian Civil Service. Douglas was sent home to school in England. She married Major Clifford Hugh Douglas in 1915. She was his second wife and they had one daughter. Douglas was often referred to as Mrs C. H. Douglas, using the convention of adopting the husband's full name. Through him she learned about engineering and finance. Her husband was one of the founders of the Social Credit movement during the 1920s. He was Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during the First World War. Douglas worked with her husband and got involved with the technical aspect of his work. As a result, Douglas was the first woman to fly in experimental bomber aircraft. She attended the 1926 World Engineering Conference in Tokyo and travelled around the world twice, and was considered a great raconteur about her travels. She became co-director of the Swanwick Shipyard (Hamble River Yacht & Engineering Co.) The shipyard worked on craft powered by sail, steam or motor, generated its own electricity and pumped its own water, and had a slipway for boats up to 250 tons. During the Second world war the company provided construction for small craft for the Admiralty. Douglas was actively involved in establishing women's organisations. She became a member of the Women's Engineering Society in 1932, was elected Vice President to celebrated pilot Amy Johnson when she held the presidential role, often stepping in when Johnson was unavailable. Edith Douglas became President of the Society in 1938. She was succeeded in the role by Caroline Haslett and her Vice President was electrical engineer Gertrude Entwistle. A 1937 article stated that the soon to be WES president “Mrs. Douglas… starts work most days round about 8 a.m. in Southampton ship-building yard which belongs to the company of which she a director. In a blue flannel suit and old yachting cap, this handsome, dark-eyed woman directs gangs of men and organises the business of the yard”. She told the interviewer that “more women should go in for planning yachts. Even though yachts do float, they are potential homes and as such should be planned from the woman’s point of view.” Edith Douglas was a successful competitive sailor and yachtsman and won many prizes in regattas, owning a sloop named 'Enid'. She loved playing sport, particularly tennis and golf, and had a great sense of humour. After the end of the war she retired and moved to Scotland. Edith Mary Douglas died on 30 November 1962.

The act prohibits blocking access to solar collectors by trees on an adjacent property, and provides criminal penalties for violation. The solar collectors may be for water heating, space heating or cooling, or electricity generation. The law was amended in 2009, allowing trees to remain, if they were planted before the solar collector was installed. The amendment also changed violations from criminal to a civil matter. Application The law attracted little attention until 2008, when a dispute in Sunnyvale, California ended up in court. The tree owners spent $37,000 on attorney fees, before triming their trees. In Culver City, California, a furniture and cabinet maker spent $80,000 in May 2006 on solar panels to reduce his electric bill. The system worked well for two years, until his neighbor spent $60,000 to plant palm trees along the property line. The city became involved in trying to negotiate a compromise. In a 1986 dispute in involving two Stanford professors, the court ruled in Sher v. Leiderman that the law only applied to solar collectors, and not to homes designed to be passively heated by sunlight.

During the Winter War Starikov's unit was to capture the Finnish town of Terijoki (now Zelenogorsk, Russia). Rather than an expected easy victory, the Red Army performed poorly, and while the Soviet Union was able to impose several territorial concessions on Finland, the reputation of the Soviet armed forces suffered.Nenye et al, p. 65 In June 1940 Starikov was promoted to major general and later named Chief Inspector of the Red Army's Infantry Inspectorate. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Starikov received command of the 19th Rifle Corps, part of the 23rd Army on the Northern Front. His unit unsuccessfully defended the Karelian region after Finland invaded to reconquer the territory, lost after the Winter War. After a decisive loss at the Battle of Porlampi in early September Starikov and the rest of the 23rd Army spent the rest of the month defending the northwestern approaches to Leningrad. In December Starikov was named deputy commander of the 8th Army, part of the Volkhov Front, becoming commander in April 1942. In August 1942 the Red Army launched the Sinyavino Offensive to break the German blockade of Leningrad. The German 11th Army, however, had just arrived from the Crimea under Erich von Manstein, with 12 divisions. The German high command had planned to finish off the Leningrad siege with Operation Nordlicht but due to the Soviet offensive had to instead use the 11th Army to hold their forward positions. By September 25th the German forces had encircled much of the 8th Army and on the 29th Volkhov Front commander Kirill Meretskov ordered the Soviet withdrawal.Glantz, p. 224 In November Starikov was promoted to lieutenant general. Another Soviet attempt to relieve Leningrad came in January 1943 as the Battle of Stalingrad sapped Germany of manpower, supplies, and morale. During Operation Iskra the 8th Army under Starikov supported the 2nd Shock Army on its southern flank, but made little progress. Nevertheless, the operation was a partial success, establishing a land corridor to Leningrad that enabled far more essential supplies to reach its inhabitants.Glantz, p. 268 On July 22nd, the Red Army launched the Mga Offensive, named for the town of Mga, where the 8th Army was supposed to link up with 67th Army. Starikov's 8th Army attacked from the east, but was unsuccessful, and the offensive ended with large Soviet losses on August 22nd.Frieser, p. 275 In January 1944 Starikov's 8th Army participated in the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive, providing vital defense during the Battle for Narva Bridgehead when the German 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions under Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz penetrated deep into Soviet lines.Röll, p. 148 After a period of rest and reinforcement, Starikov and 8th Army next saw action during the Narva Offensive, successfully capturing Narva but failing to dislodge Axis forces from the Tannenberg Line.Buttar, pp. 209-210 Along with the 2nd Shock Army and the Baltic Fleet, the 8th Army took mainland Estonia in the Tallinn Offensive in September. As a subset of the overall Baltic Offensive, 8th Army was part of the Moonsund Operation in November that cleared Axis forces from the West Estonian archipelago. The 8th Army defended the Estonian coast from December to May 1945 and in October 1945 it was disbanded. From 1945 to 1949 Starikov served as deputy commander of the Moscow Military District and as Assistant Inspector General of Infantry for the inspector general of the Soviet Ministry of Defense. From 1949 to 1951 and again from 1953 to 1954 he served as deputy chair of the central committee of DOSAAF, the Soviet Union's paramilitary sports organization. Between those tenures he worked for the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. Until his retirement in 1955 he held a position at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.

Stolice conference was a military-political conference of the leadership of the Yugoslav Partisans, held on 26 September 1941 in the village of Stolice (now part of Brštica), near Krupanj. The conference was led by the general secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the commander of the Chief Headquarters Josip Broz Tito. It was attended by representatives of military and party leaders from Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and commanders of the nearest partisan detachments from Serbia. At the conference, experiences were presented, issues of further liberation struggle were discussed, and important decisions were made for strengthening and developing further struggle. Chief Headquarters had to be formed in all the provinces, and the General Staff was renamed the Supreme Headquarters. Also at the conference, a unique name for the fighter was adopted - a partisan and his outer mark - a red five-pointed star.  Background  In the period from July to August 1941, an armed uprising broke out in most of Yugoslavia and visible results were achieved. But in addition to visible successes, there were many difficulties. In Macedonia, there were difficulties due to the work of the secretary of the Provincial Committee of the CPY for Macedonia, Metodije Šatorov, and there has been no uprising yet. In some areas of Slovenia and Croatia, the uprising did not reach the expected proportions, while in Montenegro, under the attack of Italian divisions in the second half of July, the insurgent forces dispersed to their homes, and the liberation struggle temporarily subsided. Thus, the momentum of the armed uprising put increasingly complex tasks before the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the Chief Headquarters, as well as the delegates on the ground. The conditions for the operation of the Chief Headquarters from occupied Belgrade were increasingly difficult, and maintaining ties with the provincial committees, staffs and units was difficult and irregular. Therefore, in August 1941, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and Chief Headquarters decided to move to the liberated territory and to hold military-political consultations of the most responsible leaders and representatives of staffs from all parts of Yugoslavia. Commander of the Chief Headquarters, Josip Broz Tito, left Belgrade on 16 September and went out through Čačak and Požega to the liberated territory of Valjevo countryside. Other members of military leadership: Ivan Milutinović, Aleksandar Ranković and Ivo Lola Ribar left Belgrade two days later. After coming on liberated territory, on 19 September 1941 Tito went to village Struganik, where he met his future opponent, colonel Dragoljub Mihailović. Tito tried to negotiate an alliance between the Partisans and Chetniks, but they failed to reach an agreement as the disparity of the aims of their respective movements was great enough to preclude any real compromise. After the meeting to left for Krupanj.  The conference Stolice conference was attended by members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the General Staff of NOPOJ: Josip Broz Tito, Ivan Milutinović, Aleksandar Ranković, and Ivo Lola Ribar, members of provincial leaderships: Sreten Žujović, Rodoljub Čolaković and Filip Kljajić from Serbia, Rade Končar and Vladimir Popović from Croatia; Franc Leskošek and Miha Marinko from Slovenia and Svetozar Vukmanović and Slobodan Princip from Bosnia and Herzegovina and commanders and political commissars of the nearest partisan detachments: Koča Popović, Nebojša Jerković, Miloš Minić, Zdravko Jovanović and Dragojlo Dudić. Due to weak communication lines, the leadership in Montenegro was not informed about the counseling. Around same time a new Provincial Committee for and Provincial Staff for Macedonia were appointed, headed by Dragan Pavlović and Lazar Koliševski. The most important decisions from the period of the uprising of 1941 were made on it: on the formation and organization of partisan units and staffs, on the development and competencies of provincial military staffs and detachment headquarters, and appropriate signs and symbols were introduced for all partisans. The Chief Headquarters was renamed the Supreme Headquarters, as the only military leadership to lead the liberation struggle throughout the country. Instead of headquarters of different names, it was decided to form General Staffs in the provinces. The name \\"partisans\\" was adopted for all fighters in the entire country, and \\"partisan detachment\\" was adopted as the basic combat and tactical unit. The detachment consists of battalions composed of companies. It was decided that the detachment and battalion would be commanded by a staff consisting of: the commander, the political commissar and their deputies. All headquarters were pointed out to the constant need to strengthen discipline and organize the intelligence, medical and quartermaster service, as well as a number of other issues of importance for the organization. It was also decided that groups of partisan detachments with special temporary staffs could be formed from several neighboring partisan detachments in order to perform joint tasks. All partisans were obliged to take the partisan oath by joining detachments, the text of which was published in the Bulletin of the General Staff on August 19, 1941.

He came into conflict with both Pope John V and Pope Mark III of Alexandria for preaching against the practice of private confession of sins, and was excommunicated.  Life  Mark was most likely born in Sunbat, near Zefta, Gharbia, Egypt. He was likely born blind, thus the epithet. He was made priest by the bishop of Damietta. As priest, Mark Ibn Kunbar preached against the common practice of taking censers into personal homes for the confession of sins. Traditionally, sins were confessed at a confessional, and a censer would be placed nearby for the purpose of purifying the surrounding air. Mark Ibn Kunbar objected strongly to this form of private confession, insisting that a priest must be present for the absolution of sins. He was an eloquent preacher, and drew many crowds in Egypt who heard his sermons and received from him absolution from their sins. He also preached to the Samaritans, resulting in Samaritan Coptic conversions. He also preached against various other issues, including circumcision. His followers were called the \\"Qanabira\\". Tensions rose between Mark Ibn Kunbar and the then Pope John V of Alexandria, head of the Coptic church, resulting in the excommunication of Mark Ibn Kunbar on the false grounds of sexual immorality. Nevertheless, Mark Ibn Kunbar continued to preach and draw crowds. During this time he also wrote books and commentaries on the Bible, including translations of the Bible from Coptic to Arabic. In 1164, John died, and Pope Mark III of Alexandria took office in 1166. The bishops of Upper Egypt wrote to Pope Mark about Mark Ibn Kunbar and the Pope arranged to meet him in person. He was convinced by the Coptic Pope during that meeting to correct his actions. He kept quiet for a little while, but then recommenced his preachings against the teachings of the Coptic church. In 1173, Pope Mark then called a synod of sixty bishops at The Hanging Church in Egypt. The synod unanimously resolved against Mark Ibn Kunbar's teachings and excommunicated him once again. He was placed on guard at the Monastery of Saint Anthony. He and his family pleaded with Pope Mark to let him go, and he vowed to not return to his preaching again. Pope Mark relented, and he returned to Egypt, and once again began teaching against the Pope. Mark Ibn Kunbar then appealed to the Muslim sultan, Saladin, saying that he had not gone against the original teachings of the church, and insisting on a fair trial in the Church. The Muslim rulers commanded Pope Mark to give him a fair trial, but the Church refused to do so under the authority of the Sultan. In 1179, Michael, the metropolitan of Damietta, wrote an official condemnation of Mark Ibn Kunbar for the Coptic Church. However, Pope Mark accepted arbitration of a trial by Patriarch Michael I of Antioch, who sided with neither party. Potentially afraid of another excommunication in his home church, Mark Ibn Kunbar became a Miaphysite and joined the local Melkite sect instead. Although Patriarch Michael eventually supported Mark Ibn Kunbar's position of confession to a priest, he excommunicated him for his Miaphysitism. In 1186, Mark Ibn Kunbar met Patriarch Sophronius II of Alexandria, and requested a church in Zefta, but this request was declined. Then he went back to the Coptic church, who accepted him once again. However, he lost his followers by becoming Coptic again, and he returned once again to Miaphysitism and the Melkites. Once again, he attempted to return to the Coptic faith, but this time he was rejected by Pope Mark. On hearing of his relapse to the Monophysite Coptics, Sophronius rebuked him and sent him to the Melkite monastery in Dayr Al-Qusayr, near modern-day El Quseyya, in the Asyut Governorate of Egypt. Mark Ibn Kunbar spent his last days there and died on 18 February, 1208.  Writings  Mark Ibn Kunbar was one of the first to translate of the Bible into Arabic, after Saadia Gaon. His commentaries of Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, most likely written after his conversion to Miaphysitism, all have several different recensions. His commentaries were often wrongly attributed to Cyril of Alexandria or Ephrem the Syrian by ancient scribes. Mark employed allegorical interpretation methods and typological exegesis in his commentaries, and he often noted how the Pentateuch showed the Trinity, Jesus Christ, church institutions, and ascetic monastic life. The commentaries also strongly show Mark's unique convictions, like confession to a priest and doing penance. The commentary's Christology is Chalcedonian, and the verses are organized according to the traditional Melkite liturgical divisions, leading scholars to believe that he wrote the commentary after he became a Miaphysite Melkite. He also wrote the Book of Confessions and the Book of the Master and Disciple which were made popular by Pope Cyril III of Alexandria in the next century.  Doctrines and practices  Mark Ibn Kunbar argued that one must confess one's sins to a priest and do penance to obtain absolution of sins, and take communion, to go to heaven. He also allowed men to grow long hair. He preached that circumcision is for the Jews and Muslims, not for Christians. He also opposed the burning of sandarac in churches, but allowed only frankincense as incense in worship. He was also accused of calling the Holy Spirit feminine, though it may have just been a note that the gender of ruah, the Hebrew word for spirit, is feminine.  Legacy  The conflict that Mark Ibn Kunbar raised is now seen as the first time auricular confession was an important topic in Coptic history. Although Mark Ibn Kunbar was firmly rejected and his followers dispersed, his discussion on the necessity of confession to a priest carried on to the next century in the writings of Pope Cyril III of Alexandria, who published Mark Ibn Kunbar's Book of the Master and Disciple. Mark's doctrine of auricular confession eventually became the official teaching of the Coptic church. John Mason Neale, a nineteenth-century scholar, has compared Mark Ibn Kunbar with the seventeenth-century English clergyman William Chillingworth because of the controversies and defiance of the church of both men.

Personal life  Ralph was the son of author and journalist Julian Ralph. In 1904, Ralph married war correspondent Elsie Reasoner, who became a famous model and sculptor. In 1913, she died of phlebitis in Lloyd, Florida, and was buried at the Ralph family plot in New Jersey. Ralph survived typhoid but died of appendicitis at the age of 48.  Work  Ralph painted war scenes of the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and First and Second Anglo-Boer wars. His classic Girl Scout poster is part of the Pritzker Military Museum & Library collection. The face from the poster was also used for Girl Scout pins. He and W. B. Wollen designed special menu cards for a dinner of dignitaries. He illustrated his father's account \\"In the Wake of the War\\" from the Turkish side of the war with Greece. Ralph also covered the Anglo-Boer War. He provided illustrations for Mark Twain's \\"Eve's Diary\\" in Harper's. When a Charlton, Massachusetts library expelled the book due to nude depictions by Ralph, Twain commented amusedly on the irony of making the Bible freely available. Ralph illustrated stories in Scribner's Magazine and Collier's, as well as Owen Wister's 1906 novel Lady Baltimore. His illustrations of people dancing, including The One Step, featured on postcards and he also illustrated a Walk-Over shoe company catalog in 1916.

She was the de facto regent of Fatimid Egypt as the influential mother of her son, the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustansir Billah, between 1044 and 1071.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam Life Rasad was of Sub-Saharan African origin. Variously described as being Sudanese, Ethiopian and Nubian, she first entered the harem of Fatimid Caliph Ali az-Zahir of Egypt as a slave concubine when the ruler purchased her from Abu Sa'd al-Tastari, a Jewish merchant. Rasad soon became her husband's favourite, and given the title malika, often translated as queen, signifying that the woman was formally a part of the royal family rather than a slave concubine. When she later gave birth to a son that they named al-Mustansir Billah, a delighted az-Zahir declared that the young prince would succeed to the Fatimid throne upon his own demise. =De facto ruler= In 1036, her son al-Mustansir ascended the throne of Egypt in his seventh year. Formally, Egypt was ruled by the vizier Ali b. Ahmad al-Jarjarai during the minority of al- Mustansir; Rasad was never formally regent, but as the mother of the Caliph (equivalent to that of a queen mother), she had a great deal of informal influence.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam When al- Jarjarai died in 1044, she used the power vacuum to influence the appointment of her previous owner al-Tustari as the head of her diwan, and put him up against al-Fallahi, who eventually succeeded as vizier, and played them against each other.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam With the blessing of her passive son, she effectively ruled the state by influencing the appointment of favourites to posts and offices, and it was said that she was the ruler of her son and that her diwan was the 'gate to power' of the state.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam When her favourite al-Tustari was killed by vizier al-Fallahi in 1047, she had al- Fallahi arrested and executed the following year.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam She then collaborated with her supporter Muhammad al-Yazuri, who served in parallel as the head of her diwan as well as the vizier of her son until 1058.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam Rasad was waited upon by 5000 slaves,Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam endowed valuable philanthropies, and underwrote a building campaign. She championed the cause of her black soldiers - most of whom were her countrymen - in their ongoing struggle for supremacy against their Turkish rivals in the royal army. The battle of wills between the two halves of the army eventually degenerated into open warfare in 1062, and a prolonged drought that then hit Egypt only exacerbated the situation. The Turks soon claimed victory, and in recompense for the Caliph and the Caliph mother both having supported the blacks, the latter was arrested and stripped of her property. For his part, al-Mustansir was strongarmed into bribing his own soldiers to stand down by emptying his treasury. In 1071, Caliph al- Mustansir was able to restore order with the help of Badr al-Jamali and his army of Syrian mercenaries. Al-Jamali, who had also once been a slave, was made the vizier thereafter in 1074. This was the effective end of Rasad's long de facto rule, though she continued to serve as a royal diplomat for the remainder of her life. Leigh K. Jenco, Murad Idris and Megan C. Thomas (2019), The Oxford Handbook Of Comparative Political Theory, p. 288. She is mentioned in 1078, when performing a diplomatic correspondance with queen Arwa al- Sulayhi.Delia Cortese: And the Fatimids in the World of Islam Descendants Through the various kings of both the Fatimid dynasty and its cadet families that have ruled following al-Mustansir's death in 1094, Rasad's bloodline has come down to the present day. For example, the Aga Khans - a dynasty of mixed Persian/European ancestry that is currently led by the Aga Khan IV, Imam of the Nizari Ismailis - claim direct descent from Rasad through al-Mustansir.

Vasari's Life of Rosso Fiorentino briefly states that he saw several portraits by the artist in homes in Florence, probably produced before Rosso left for Volterra in 1521. How Man entered the Medici-Lorraine collections is unknown, since the first definite mention of the work is an 1815 inventory placing it in the Galleria's Sala dell'Iliade. Previously attributed to Pontormo, this was changed by Falciani due to several similarities between it and faces in the Volterra Deposition, placing it just before or after Rosso Fiorentino's stay in Volterra. Franklin (1997) argued against the reattribution, but it was backed by Padovani and Antonio Natali, with the latter seeing similarities to a medal of Jacopo Sannazaro by Girolamo Santacroce and thus theorising that Rosso had made a trip to Naples Antonio Natali, Rosso Fiorentino, Silvana Editore, Milano 2006. . Schaeffer (1910) had previously identified its subject as the Florentine canon Francesco da Castiglione based on similarities to the Entry of Leo X fresco at the Palazzo Vecchio, but Falciani argues against this as the man is in civil not ecclesiastical dress.

Harlan would, multiple times, run for the mayoralty of Chicago. He was the son and father of United States Supreme Court associate justices (the elder and the younger John Marshall Harlans, respectively). Early life and family Harlan was born December 12, 1864 in Frankfort, Kentucky. He was the youngest son of John Marshall Harlan (who would serve as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1877 through 1911) and Malvina Shanklin Harlan. Historically, Harlan's family had been politically active. His forebear George Harlan served as one of governors of Delaware during the seventeenth century; his grandfather James Harlan was a congressman during the 1830s. Harlan's brother James S. Harlan, was attorney general of Puerto Rico and then chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. At the age of fifteen, Harlan began attending Princeton University. He graduated in 1884, after four years of study. He spent the subsequent two years completing postgraduate studies at Columbia University and the University of Berlin. Career Harlan first worked for his father as a law clerk. Harlan then moved to Chicago in 1888 to practice law. Harlan became a prominent lawyer in Chicago, working at the firm Harlan and Harlan. While, in his early political career, Harlan had established himself as an opponent of the city's traction interests, he would ultimately represent them after financial strains took a toll on his legal firm, and after he had mellowed his political stance towards these interests and other lucrative clients. After a long career in Chicago, in either 1911 or 1912, he and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C.. In 1924, he moved to New York City. Harlan died at his home in Manhattan in New York City on March 23, 1934 after suffering from a long illness.'John M. Harlan Dies In His Home,' Brooklyn Times Union (New York City, New York), March 24, 1934, pg. 10A While Harlan had achieved prominence and had become well-connected, he lacked much financial success, and would ultimately die in poverty. =Political career= From 1896 through 1898, Harlan served as a Chicago alderman for the 22nd Ward. During his time involved in Chicago politics, he became regarded as an expert on the city's traction issue. As an alderman, he was responsible for the \\"Harlan Report\\", a well-founded assessment of legal matters associated with public transit. On June 21, 1897, only twelve days after Governor John Riley Tanner signed the Allen Law, Harlan introduced the so-called \\"Harlan resolution\\" to the Chicago City Council, which would appoint a committee to investigate the traction issue and the conditions of the street railways. The resolution passed on October 13. The resultant committee consisted of Harlan, William Jackson, Adolphus T. Maltby, and William T. Mayoble. Mayor Harrison served as ex-officio chairman. George E. Hooker was appointed its secretary. The \\"Harlan Report\\" was the product of this investigation, and was submitted on March 28, 1898. Campaigns for mayor Harlan ran for mayor of Chicago as an independent Republican in the 1897 Chicago mayoral election, placing a distant second behind Democratic nominee Carter Harrison Jr. in a multi- candidate race. Taking advantage of the city's traction concern, Harlan ran on a platform which sought greater regulation for streetcars, and advocated the solution of municipal ownership of the city's streetcar lines. Harlan unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for mayor in 1901, losing the nomination to Elbridge Hanecy. Harlan's candidacy had drawn the support of many non-machine/independent Republicans. After Hanecy won the nomination, there were unsuccessful efforts to draft Harlan into making an independent run in the general election. Harlan again unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for mayor in 1903. In 1905, Harlan won the Republican nomination for mayor. He lost the general election to Democratic nominee Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne. By the time of the 1905 election, Harlan's position on the traction issue, including his stance on municipal ownership, had significantly weakened. His Democratic opponent, Dunne, was a staunch supporter of municipal ownership, and many of those who supported Harlan's 1897 campaign backed Dunne instead, while a number of groups that had opposed Harlan's 1897 candidacy backed him in 1905. Personal life In 1891, Harlan married Elizabeth Palmer Flagg, with whom he had three daughters and a son. Harlan's son John Marshall Harlan, named for Harlan's own father and often referred to as John Marshall Harlan II to distinguish the two, became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court like his namesake, serving from 1955 through 1971. Harlan's father-in-law was Ethan Flagg, the industrialist who constructed the Ethan Flagg House in Yonkers, New York.

There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment. Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions. In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex. Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic. The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally, including increased loneliness resulting from social distancing. Mental healthChildhood vaccinations UNICEF estimates that 117 million children across 37 countries may not receive their immunizations in time to prevent a measles outbreak. Pediatricians in the United States are worried about childhood vaccination rates. In April, the CDC reported that 400,000 fewer doses of measles vaccine were ordered in 2020 compared to the same time last year.  Mosquito-borne diseases  Although it is highly unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted by mosquitoes, the pandemic nevertheless has a large impact on the control of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria or dengue fever. Reasons are disruptions in medical supply chains, patients avoiding hospitals, and halted mosquito control campaigns such as removal of breeding sites or distribution of insecticide treated bed nets.

The site was protected by the central government as a National Historic Site in the year 2002. Overview The ruins are located about 1 kilometer north of Chūson-ji in Iwaizumi, and by tradition the site was the location of the fortified residence of Kinji Yoshitsuji, a gold merchant who was in the service of the Northern Fujiwara, especially Fujiwara no Hidehira. His name appears in the Heiji Monogatari, Heike Monogatari and other contemporary sources. However, per an archaeological excavation in 1958, it became apparent that this was the site of a major temple complex with predated Northern Fujiwara rule. The foundations of the South Gate and a western building were confirmed, and the site was surrounded by a wooden palisade and moats over 100 meters in length on each side. Numerous artifacts, including ink stones and many types of earthenware shards were recovered. However, as no Lecture Hall or dormitories for the training of monks was found, it appears that this temple was constructed over the palace of the Abe clan and was intended for prayers for the clan as their bodaiji. The name of the temple is unknown. Traces of heat on cornerstones and from excavated soils indicate that the temple was most likely destroyed by fire during the Former Nine Years War. In 1189, after Minamoto no Yoritomo destroyed the Northern Fujiwara, he commented in the Azuma Kagami that he ordered a search for the ruins of the palace of the Abe clan which his grandfather, Minamoto no Yoriie had destroyed, but all that his men could find was a remnant of an earthen wall in a field overgrown with autumn grasses.

They were heavily ornate, incorporating Tibetan, Middle Eastern, Indian, and European techniques. The design or decorative aspect of the craft was as important as the crafting technique itself and Qing artisans were particular about the materials they used, such as jade (yu), stones, and wood. In their designs artisans drew heavily from a number of motifs, both mythical and natural. Certain areas in China became well-known for specific types of handicrafts; for example, Jingdezhen was known as the capital of porcelain. During the Qing era, Imperial Workshops built in Beijing brought together artisans and raw materials that were once only obtainable in disparate regions. This allowed for the combining of technologies and materials to produce new types of handicrafts. The tributary system also brought new sources for materials and artisans that were not from the production centers. To the state, crafts were an important part of the Qing dynasty's economy and were regulated by the state. With the stronger presence of Western powers in the nineteenth century, handicrafts, especially porcelain, took on different characteristics depending on whether it was for domestic consumption and international export. Unlike the Ming, the proliferation of handicrafts in the Qing dynasty not only attests to the dynasty's \\"materialistic mandate\\" and but also the value of craftsmanship. Studies of the technological advancement of handicrafts in the Qing dynasty show the early stages of Chinese industrialization.  Materials  alt= A list of common materials that were used by artisans. * Jade (yu) * Hardstone * Bamboo * Silk * Clay * Lacquer * Hardwood * Ivory * Marble *Glass  Types of handicrafts  Handicrafts in the Qing era are marked by their ornamentation, use of colors, and innovative production technologies. These aspects not only enhanced the quality of objects produced, but added to their value as luxury products as it was easier for artisans to incorporate more complex techniques in their work. The advancement of handicraft technology and the contact between specialized artisans at imperial workshops resulted in the possibility of combining multiple raw materials in a singular object, such as the hardwood being inlaid with enamelled porcelain. With the increase of trade networks and the tributary system, the centers of certain handicraft traditions shifted as raw materials such as hardwoods and ivory from Southeast Asia, marble from Yunnan, and jade from Burma were able to be imported from different locations. For example, Suzhou became the center of the production of carved lacquer, jade carving, metalwork, silks, and furniture by the 18th century, replacing than the various center located in the towns of western Zhejiang. Taste for handicrafts also differed between the court and the literati. For example, the imperial household preferred blue-and-white porcelain in the 18th century while the literati preferred archaistic bronzes or ceramic imitations of bronzes. Handicrafts from the imperial manufactory set the standard, but the commercial market had a larger output in comparison. = Porcelain = Porcelain vase from alt= Further information: Chinese ceramics Porcelain changed significantly throughout the Qing era itself, moving from Transitional porcelain to monochrome porcelain, porcelain with painted scenes, and export porcelain. Jingdezhen was the capital of Chinese porcelain since the Ming dynasty but other sites of porcelain production included Dehua, known for their production of porcelain dolls in the both the Ming and Qing era. Other forms of pottery like yixing clayware were also popular in the Qing era. Wares in the mid-18th century were named after superintendents due to their achievements in the improvement of quality of porcelain: 'Lang ware' was named after Lang Tingji, 'Nian ware' after Nian Xiyao, and 'Tang ware' after Tang Ying. Porcelain in the Qing dynasty features opaque overglaze colors, especially highlighted through the style of monochrome porcelain. Monochrome porcelain also highlights the importance of smoothness (run) found in Qing era decoration and handicrafts. Glazes, in fact, only became a major party of decorative art during the Qing dynasty after the Kangxi, Yongzhen, and Qianlong emperors came into contact with Jesuit missionary glassmakers. Qing (青) (not to be confused with the character for the Qing dynasty, 清), meaning green, blue-green, or blue, was one type of glaze that artisans strove to perfect through techniques such as firing lavender glaze and apple-green enamel-type glaze at high temperatures to produce a multitude of tints and hues. Glazes also allowed for patterning techniques such as the \\"cracked-ice\\" style that was first featured on porcelain from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Techniques for ceramic production advanced as emperors dug up earlier productions of ceramics from the palace collection to serve as models. Moreover, contact with imported enamels from Europe encouraged the pursuit of an even more diverse palette of colors, including sepia enamel (grisaille). = Inkstone = Inkstone with jar pattern, 1800-1894. Inkstone (also called ink-slab, ink palette, or even Mr. Clay Water) were essential writing instruments in early modern East Asia. In China, inkstones were used in the culture of wen (writing, literature, civility), as a collectible object and desired gift, and as a marker of status. They were made out of clay, lacquered wood, old bricks, fallen times, glass, or semi-precious stones but were most often made from specifically harvested stones found in quarries. During the Qing era, the Kangxi emperor insisted that inkstones were to be made out of a new material, Songhua stone, in hopes of grafting a Manchu identity on a Chinese instrument. Songhua stones, being slender, flat, and thin, often patterned with bright green or purple veins or layers, could be easily shaped and carved with innovative technology that allowed for a combination of materials and techniques. However, inkstones made from Duan and She stones remained the favorites of Chinese scholars and literati. Gu Erniang (fl. 1700-1722) was the most famous female stone-carver and one of the most accomplished among all stone-makers in the Qing era from Suzhou province. Accounts from her patrons in the Inkstone Chronicle compiled by Lin Fuyin (ca. 1690-1572) reveal the importance of both artisans and literati in the life of inkstones and vice versa. The mark of Gu also attests to her identity as a \\"super-brand\\" and the popularization of inkstones as collectible items, as it was during this era when marking handicrafts with signs of authorship became a common practice. = Furniture and wood carving = alt= Many Jiangnan cities became known for furniture and carved objects during the Qing era. Highly ornate and decorative furniture made from the best wood could only be found in the dwellings of the literati and court elite. In the 16th century, hardwood furniture from Jiangnan was on the rise. In contrast to lacquered soft-wood furniture, exposed wood became the norm and a luxury surface. Main types of hardwood include zitian (紫檀, rosewood or red sandalwood), hualimu (花梨木 rosewood), jichimu (鸡翅木 lit. chicken wing wood), tielimu (铁力木 ironwood), wumu (乌木 ebony), and hongmu (红木 mahogany) who all had their own distinctive color and grain. Softwoods like southern elm and namu burl were also popular, alongside spotted bamboo. Furniture and wood carving in the Qing era owes much of taste to styles from previous dynasties. Root-wood is one popular style of furniture and incense stand that has proliferated since the Tang dynasty (618-907). It is made by separate pieces of wood being joined by pegs in order to emulate the form of a tree's single root. Furthermore, Ming literati taste continued to influence furniture styles in Shanxi such that even 19th century furniture retained principles of Ming dynasty cabinetry. = Textiles = Textile with Peonies and Lattice, 18th centuryIn the early Qing era, there were about 800 textile looms in Suzhou, but by the reign of the Qianlong emperor and the Jiaqing emperor, there were as many as 30,000 looms in Nanjing, 10,000 in Suzhou, and 3,000 in Hanzhou. Southern China was known for its innovation of dress and fashion due to the strong silk industry in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Textiles were used to accent plain furniture with bright colors, but they were also used as tributary items due to the high value of silk. Textile artisans and embroiderers used the technique trompe l'œil to create the illusion of a painting mounted on a scroll but the technique also became adapted in large- scale building projects. Kesi (cut silk) silk tapestry is one type of textile that was first used in the Tang dynasty, but continued to proliferate until the end of the Qing. The technique of cutting silk can also be used to replicate famous paintings and paintings of literati but mostly featured symmetrically composed designs. Kesi was mostly used for table and chair coverings during formal occasions but their patterning also became imbued in other forms of surfaces, such as lacquer, jade, and bamboo carving. Kesi silk tapestry were among the many art forms catalogued during the Qianlong emperor's reign (producing the Bidian Zhulin and the Shiqu Baoji, published in 1744–1745, 1793, and 1816), alongside painting and calligraphy.  Motifs  Vase with archaic motifs from the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 B.C.). Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Qianlong period (1736–95) Handicrafts during the Qing era were more elaborate in terms of its decoration and shapes, especially prominent in crafts produced for the imperial family or ceremonial purposes. Handicrafts also became the surfaces where stories were told or where literati artists displayed their technique. They also become important objects for use, display, and collection. There were crafts that presented more than one of these motifs outlined below but not all surfaces were inlaid with motifs either. *Mythical motifs: dragons (long) were a popular symbol used in handicrafts and Qing art in general. Under Kangxi rule, its identity as a shape-shifting creature signifies the inheritance of the Chinese imperial tradition that was significant during an era where the dynasty's identity as \\"foreign\\" rule had to be legitimated. Hanjun bannerman Liu Yuan (ca. 1641-before 1691) is one artisan who was well known for his use of dragons. Other mythical motifs include qilin, flying horses, and magic fish. *Religious motifs: lotus imagery was often used in reference to The Lotus Sutra, a central text of Mahayanist Buddhism. Daoist and Confucian symbols were also found among surfaces and sometimes found together. Ceremonies also required the use of handicrafts and homes were often turned into religious spaces during festivals, marriages, deaths, and ancestor worship. During this time, Buddhist statues continued to be produced, especially when the Qing state made alliances with Tibet and Mongolia. *Natural motifs: natural motifs demonstrate the way man-made environment was connected to the natural environment and thus nature was a heavy point of reference in both Ming and Qing handicrafts. As countrysides rapidly urbanized, nature became increasingly important, even if it was represented artificially through handicrafts. In contrast to religious motifs, secular motifs could evoke prosperity, happiness, fertility and more. For example, fish (yu) were used to symbolize abundance and plenty. Items like pine, bamboo, and prunus were depicted together as the \\"three friends of the coldest part of the year.\\" *Archaic motifs: the style of archaic bronzes produced during the Tang dynasty was a popular form of vessel in the Qing period, so much so that replicas and forgeries were made. Patterns and vessel shapes from even earlier Chinese history were also valued. Patination was used as a technique to simulate the aged look of bronzes and archaic vessels. Archaic objects projected a sense of antiquity and political authority in connecting art forms to Chinese art traditions of the past. Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci wrote that to the Chinese archaic bronze collector, \\"they desire them with a certain particular corrosion.\\" *Women as motifs: the beautiful young woman (美人 meiren) was a common motif in decorative handicrafts for she symbolized the pleasure of viewing the object and real-life women as well. Women in white make-up was also a comparison for the measure of whiteness on the surfaces of vases and handicrafts and often depicted with white porcelain bowls or white jade vases. The blackness of women's hair was evoked in the comparison to lacquer.   Imperial workshops  Imperial workshops, or Palace Workshops, (造辦處 zaobanchu) were first established during the Kangxi emperor's reign in 1680 around the Forbidden City and Yuanmingyuan palace. Imperial workshops was one place where technocratic culture was formed. They were established for the maintenance and creation of objects for the imperial family or ceremonial functions of the court but they also thrived as an area of artistic production as artisans and craftsmen from all over China, Asia, and even overseas (Jesuits from Europe) came into contact with each other. In addition, official workshops were established in certain provinces and the court continued to send out orders to those workshops, making certain areas well-known for their production of a single type of handicraft. The first forty years of the imperial workshop system is unknown due to a lack of archives, but some aspects can be constructed from material evidence of the objects that were produced. Under the reign of the Yongzheng emperor (1723-1735), imperial workshops became better rationalized and organized as different offices were established to maximize operational capacity. Imperial workshops, being in close proximity to the imperial seat, boasted an \\"imperial\\" style that was meant to differentiate between objects produced in the imperial quarters and those outside the court. In fact, all objects also had to be made and released with the emperor's approval. As a result, handicrafts produced during different reigns varied in style because the emperors had their own \\"imperial style\\". For example, the Yongzheng emperor favored West Hill stones for inkstones and preferred details like a contrast of colors between the inkstone's box and stone.  Handicraft regulations  Zeli (則例) or \\"regulations and precedents\\" were legal documents produced by the Qing court for administrative units. Jiangzuo zeli (匠作則例) or \\"handicraft regulations\\" were sets of texts and lists produced by officials that set the precedent for the production of buildings and handicrafts as determined by the imperial standard. They include administrative references, account books, and cost estimates. Before building products and luxury production, cost estimates, a list of materials and workloads, and technical data had to be submitted to the Ministry of Public Works and these were record in the jiangzuo zeli. The handicraft regulations are not only a valuable source to the technical history of handicrafts in Qing China but demonstrate the regulation of economy and wages. In contemporary China, architects and historians use these documents to analyze and rebuild historical buildings for the preservation of Chinese cultural heritage.

He was appointed to a series of imperial offices, including praefectus or governor of Roman Egypt. Hans-Georg Pflaum first traced the rise of his family, the Mettii, identifying their origins in Petelia, a small Greek-speaking town in Bruttium, whence they emigrated to Arles when Julius Caesar settled one of their ancestors, a soldier or centurion of his Legio VI, there. Rufus' father was Marcus Mettius Modestus, procurator of Syria; he is known to have a brother, Mettius Modestus, suffect consul in 82. Two men have been identified as sons of Rufus: Gaius Trebonius Proculus Mettius Modestus, suffect consul in 103;Bernard Rémy, Les carrières sénatoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie au Haut-Empire (31 av. J.-C. - 284 ap. J.-C.)

This person was in charge of the public dole of bread to the inhabitants of Rome. He is attested as holding the office of praefectus of Egypt from some point before 2 August 89 (his predecessor is last attested in office 26 February 88) to some point after 12 July 90 (his successor is first attested on 14 March 92).Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), pp. 277-278 His primary concern as governor of Egypt was to safeguard the harvest and delivery of grain to the populace of Rome, but surviving letters from his administration show his responsibilities extended further. One records an order he issued on 1 October 89 for the inhabitants of Roman Egypt: having learned that records of property ownership were allowed to become so out of date as to be unusable, Rufus issued an edict that all property owners register the lands they owned within the next six months, and that legal clerks tighten their processes for updating property records accordingly, as well as revise the records at least once every five years.Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 237, col. 8 lines 27-43.

Early life Williams was born at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 12, 1935 to Henry, Sr. and Beatrice (née Henderson) Williams. The family lived in the 2nd Ward of New Orleans at 2522 Howard Avenue according to the 1940 U.S. Census. Henry, Sr. was listed as a construction laborer with the Works Progress Administration. Charles Williams was the second son in the family that included siblings Henry Jr., Clifford, Lloyd, and Mary Alice. He said his mother sang a lot because she was church- going, and his father liked to dance. Henry, Jr. played guitar and younger brother Lloyd played drums. Williams reported that \\"ever since I been big enough to know myself I used to be always beating on something, tin cans or something like that.\\" Education At age eight or nine years old Williams was put into Municipal Boys Home on Franklin Avenue in New Orleans. His teacher there was Peter Davis, called Mr. Dave by the boys. Davis taught Louis Armstrong to play the trumpet, and encouraged young Williams to take up the horn. \\"I used to tell him all the time, I say, 'Mr. Dave, I don't like to play trumpet, I want to play drums'. But he kept drivin' and drivin' it into my head, and I learned to play the trumpet a little bit. I didn't like it.\\" When Williams got out of the Municipal Boys Home he moved to McDonoghville, a neighborhood community of New Orleans on the West Bank of the Mississippi River. \\"That's where I was living, with my parents. After I got out of the home, I went back to my parents. There was a place called the Pepper Pot in Gretna, and that's how I met Professor Longhair. I used to go up there to dance and things, and Fess was playing up there. I'd worry Fess to death to sit in with him. At the time, he had a guy named Milton Stevens on drums. He was one of the best brush men to ever come out of New Orleans. And right after that, after Milton left, I think he got Honeyboy [Charles Otis], plus he had Papoose (Walter \\"Papoose\\" Nelson) on guitar. That's all- he only had three pieces. I finally convinced him to let me sit in. My timing and things was bad, but I did the best I could do.\\" Williams' musical education continued when he studied Fats Domino's drummer Cornelius \\"Tenoo\\" Coleman. Coleman, left-handed like Williams, also taught Walter \\"Popee\\" Lastie. Both Williams and Lastie would later play drums for Domino. Williams said of Coleman, \\"I idolized the dude, I always wanted to play like him. But, ah, they made me a valet; Fats [Domino] made me a valet. And everytime I got a chance, I'd set up Tenoo's drums like an hour before the gig, and I would sit on his drums and practice before the gig started.\\" Influences and Technique Williams told Tad Jones, \\"Paul Gayten and Earl Palmer and all of 'em used to come up there (to Club Tijuana) just to listen to me play, because they couldn't understand what I was doing. I used to, I still do it, I played thirty-second notes with my left hand, and no drummers could do that. Plus I had a mixture. My music, my drumming, is between calypso and rock, you know, blues. I had something different going. Like a double beat on the bass drum that makes it funky. I had calypso going and funk at the same time. I started the 'double clutching' with my bass drum, with my foot. Wasn't no other drummer doing that.\\" Singer, guitarist, and songwriter Earl King agreed, \\"I've seen him do things with his left hand: I'm still waiting for another drummer to do it. Charles' playing emanated out of the calypso-type stuff.\\" During his time at Club Tijuana Williams often took part in drumming contests with Ricardo Lopez, a Cuban percussionist who played bongos and congas. Williams added Latin effects to his stylistic influences that included marches, country and western, and the music of the Spiritual church of his youth. He said \\"I'd take all this and hook it up and make a jambalaya out of it, and it'd come out like this funky thing.\\" Williams was known for his experiments with adapting Latin percussion patterns to the drum set. In his playing on Tommy Ridgely's The Girl Across The Street, the shrill, metal sound he plays on the bell of his cymbal is described by writer Antoon Aukes as an Afro-Cuban cáscara that Latin percussionists would play on a cowbell or on the sides of timbales. In Ridgely's When I Meet My Girl Williams came upon the well-known drum set figure of performing the high-low conga accents with rimshot-on-snare and open snare or tom-tom, as he did in Huey Smith's Free, Single and Disengaged. Ridgely remembered the sessions, \\"Hungry (Williams) was on drums; this particular beat was his style- nobody could duplicate what he was doing.\\" Record label owner and producer Al Reed acknowledged, \\"The change came when Funky Charles started playing drums... and a whole lot of people right now aren't hip to his contribution to rock. He was the funkiest thing out. A funky beat was characterized by drummers who improvised to make people dance harder. Funky rhythms went as far back as Congo Square and Second Line, particularly in the distinctive styles of drummers like \\"Tenoo\\" Coleman, his pupil Williams, Smokey Johnson, and Joseph \\"Zigaboo\\" Modeliste of The Meters. New Orleans saxophonist Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler said of Williams, \\"This guy had more natural ability than all of them put together. He was another musician that couldn't read a note, but as far as feeling, he would do things on the drums most drummers would say, 'How does he do that?' And it was only because he didn't know he wasn't supposed to do it. In fact Earl Palmer and I used to get off our job and go to the place Hungry was working at.\\" Palmer agreed, \\"Well, if you listen to the New Orleans drummers you find that they all played more bass drum than the average guy. Listen to “Hungry” play. He played a lot. You know, he sure could play.\\" Palmer wrote in his autobiography, “A guy we called Hungry, Charlie Williams, was a mother on drums, a guy who never knew how good he was.” Career In the early 1950s Williams joined pianist Paul Gayten's band during the band's residency at the Brass Rail club on Canal Street. The band included sax man Lee Allen. Gayten later told author John Broven, \\"For a while I had one of the greatest drummers in the world- that was Hungry Williams.\\" Louisiana swamp pop idol Warren Storm was influenced by Williams' drumming during this time. Warren joined fellow Abbeville swamp pop musician Bobby Charles Guidry in seeking out rhythm and blues artists. Storm and Bobby Charles would visit the Brass Rail and listen to Paul Gayten's R&B; band featuring tenor sax star Allen and- at different times- world-class drummers Palmer and Williams. “I think I picked up a lot of the New Orleans style of drumming and brought it down to Lafayette,” Storm said. Through the years he was to give a new dimension to the art of drumming in South Louisiana. Learning from drummer Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams, Warren formed a band in 1956, known as the Wee-Wows (later the Jive Masters). From 1959 through 1965, Storm was session drummer for Jay Miller's studio band in Crowley, La., accompanying swamp-blues stars Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, Lazy Lester, Lonesome Sundown and many other acts. Williams left Gayten's band in 1953. After working as a poker dealer on Rampart Street he began to sit in with the Club Tijuana house band in 1954. The band included pianist Huey Smith, saxophonist Robert Parker, and blind singer/ guitarist Billy Tate. Williams soon became a regular member of the band. It was Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith who named him \\"Hungry\\", Williams said. \\"I'd order a double order every time I'd eat. I'd have a plate of beans stacked that high, beans and rice. I went up to two hundred and six pounds when I was eighteen years old. I'd be walking around looking like a Baptist mule.\\" It was the Dew Drop Cafe cook, Huey recalled, who noticed Williams' habit of ordering double portions and subsequently described the drummer as \\"hungry\\". Smith and other musicians followed the cook's lead, and Charles Williams became \\"Hungry\\" Williams. Williams first worked as a studio musician in June 1953 when Huey Smith cut You Made Me Cry and You're Down With Me for Savoy Records at J&M; Studio. The cuts featured Smith on piano and vocals, Lee Allen on sax, Billy Tate on guitar, Roland Cook on bass, and Williams on drums. In December 1955 former bandmate Huey Smith wrote and played piano on Williams' (on drums and vocals) first single for Checker Records Mary Don't You Weep, Mary Don't You Moan, backed with So Glad She's Mine, written by Williams. Paul Gayten, at that time New Orleans A&R; man for Chess Records and subsidiary Checker, arranged the session. Gayten set up another session in March 1957 when Williams recorded Darling backed with So Worried. Three tracks from a June 1958 session Rhythmatic Rhythm, I Cried All The Way Home, and What Can I Do remained unreleased until 1984, appearing on Chess: New Orleans R&B.; Studio Musician During the early 1950s Earl Palmer was the foremost studio drummer in New Orleans. When Palmer departed for Los Angeles in 1957 Williams became the first choice studio drummer. Mac Rebennack, also known as Dr. John, explained, \\"I believe it was Eddie Mesner (of Aladdin Records) that offered Earl the job out on the West Coast, and he took it and cleaned up... But this caused a search (here) for a new drummer to take his place, which Charlie Williams eventually got that job. But for a while, they were trying out drummers, everybody from Edward Blackwell, who was too hip of a drummer and he was too jazz-influenced, to June Gardner, who was too straight. There was a search high and low; practically every session had a different drummer for a time. And finally Charlie Williams, who was the funkiest of them all, he just took it.\\" Williams agreed, \\"Before I knew it, man, they weren't using anybody else. Sometimes, man, I was in the studio six and seven days a week.\\" Dave Bartholomew led the studio band at Cosimo Matassa's J&M; Studio. As an engineer, Matassa worked with producers and arrangers Bartholomew and Allen Toussaint among others to craft what came to be known as \\"the New Orleans Sound\\" in the 1950s and 1960s. The key to that sound was the group of studio musicians associated with Cosimo Matassa's studio that included Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams on drums. Huey Smith recorded his hit Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu (#5 on Billboard's R&B; chart and #52 on the pop chart) for Ace Records in June 1957. Williams added his distinctive polyrhythmic drumming to that track as well as to Smith's 1958 hit recording Don't You Just Know It backed with High Blood Pressure (#4 on the R&B; chart and #9 on the pop chart). In the late 1950s Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith and the Clowns toured the South including Florida with the Silas Green Minstrel Show. In an interview with writer and funk drumming historian Jim Payne, Clayton Fillyau said the most important rhythmic lesson of his life was taught to him by the drummer in Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith's band The Clowns. Fillyau, the drummer who originated the funk beat in James Brown's band, said he saw Smith's show in Jacksonville and caught up with the band's drummer in his hotel room afterward. \\"Back then musicians were always in everybody's room playing\\", Fillyau remembered. They started jamming, and the older man, probably Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams, showed him a little lesson in New Orleans drumming, taking him from standard stiff beat-keeping to secrets of the second line. Then he bore down, as if to say it all comes down to this, and told Fillyau, \\"Now use your imagination. Only thing you got to remember is, 'Where is one?' I don't care where you put it on those drums.\\" Meaning you can hit it on the snare, bass, or cymbal. \\"Remember where the one is and you'll never lose time.\\" Fillyau acknowledged, \\"Now this (New Orleans) is where funk was really created! That's where funk originated.\\" Williams continued to record and perform with Huey Smith and The Clowns. He was also part of the Ace Records studio session personnel that included Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler on tenor and baritone sax, Lee Allen on tenor sax, Melvin Lastie on cornet, Allen Toussaint on piano, Frank Fields on bass, and Justin Adams on guitar, and Williams on drums. Other artists recorded for Ace included Sugarboy Crawford, Benny Spellman, Chuck Carbo, Jimmy Clanton, Joe Tex, Bobby Marchan, James Booker, Lee Dorsey, Big Boy Myles, and Mac Rebennac. Between 1957 and 1959 Williams was New Orleans' premier studio drummer. Using his \\"double clutch\\" style, his hard-driving rhythms punctuated and enhanced hundreds of records on various labels with artists like Fats Domino, Paul Gayten, Professor Longhair, Mickey and Sylvia, Smiley Lewis, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters's, Art Neville, Bobby Mitchell, Frankie Ford, Allen Toussaint, Earl King, Bobby Charles, Chris Kenner, Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, Lee Allen, and dozens more. In the early 1960s Williams lost his position as the first call studio drummer in New Orleans to John Boudreaux, and dropped out of the recording scene. He left for New York as the British Invasion eclipsed record sales and radio play in New Orleans. Said Earl King, \\"He was one of those who drifted off and got into this whirl and that was it. He was around New York somewhere. Charles Williams, a hell of a drummer.\\" New York City became Williams' adopted home as it had for New Orleans expatriate drummers jazz and R&B; stickman Idris Muhammad and Charles “Honeyman” Otis, who played drums with Professor Longhair. Williams' last known recording session was for Albert King's New Orleans Heat, produced by Allen Toussaint for Tomato Records in New Orleans. Later Years In his later years Williams made few public appearances. His last was an impromptu jam session at New York City's Lone Star Cafe in April 1985. “I remember Dr. John was playing ‘Iko Iko’\\", said Barbara Becker, a close friend to Williams, “and Charlie thought the drummer didn’t have the beat right. So he just jumped up on the stage and took the sticks out of his hands and began to play.\\" Charles “Hungry” Williams died May 10, 1986 in New York City after years of battling Paget's disease, a crippling bone marrow disorder.

It began with the an exchange of insults at a festival, escalated to raiding and finally to open warfare. The decisive engagement was fought near the mouth of the Adige on 22 October 1215 and a peace treaty was signed on 9 April 1216. Narrative sources for the war include the Liber chronicorum of Rolandino of Padua, Les estoires de Venise of Martino Canal, the Chronicon of Andrea Dandolo, De origine urbis Venetiarum of Marino Sanuto and Historie venete of Gian Giacomo Caroldo.Predelli 1885, p. 421.

This was defended by ladies and damsels against the assaults of the young men of Treviso, Padua and Venice, who threw flowers, pastries and spices, respectively, at the battlements. Rolandino describes the weapons of this pageant as follows: > and the arms and engines wherewith men fought against were apples and dates > and muscat-nuts [nutmeg], tarts and pears and quinces, roses and lilies and > violets, and vases of balsam or ambergris or rosewater, amber, camphor, > cardamums, cinnamon, cloves, pomegranates, and all manner of flowers or > spices that are fragrant to smell and fair to see. A panel of knights was supposed to referee the event and decide to which city the castle would surrender.Foligno 1910, pp. 51–52. Eventually the Venetians switched to throwing ducats, which the women abandoned the battlements to pick up. When the Venetians moved to enter the castle, a fight ensued with the Paduans. The rectors of Treviso and the commander of the Paduan militia, Paolo da Sermodele, intervened to break it up, and so narrowly averted bloodshed. War Ruins of the Torre delle Bebbe today, site of the main battle of the War of the Castle of Love thumbCommemorative plaque on the Torre delle Bebbe, which records how in 1214 it was \\"strenuously defended by Chioggians under the guidance of Marco Cauco from Trevisans and Paduans in the fight for the castle of love\\" (da Trevigiani e Padovani nella lotta pel castello d'amore, da Clodiensi sotto la guida di Marco Cauco strenuamente difesa) Warfare did not break out immediately as a result of the spoiled pageant, but relations between Padua and Venice turned sour. According to the Cronaca Altinate, Doge Pietro Ziani strove to maintain peace through diplomacy so that Venice could concentrate on its recent acquisitions in Greece. The year following the pageant was spent in diplomatic exchanges and raids until Venice severed commercial relations with Padua. In the words of Rolandino: > For in process of time the enmity between Paduans and Venetians waxed so > sore that all commerce of trade forbidden on either side, and the confines > were guarded lest anything should be brought from one land to the other: > then men practised robberies and violence, so that discord grew afresh, and > wars, and deadly enmity. In the autumn of 1215, Padua invaded Venetian territory and attacked the Torre delle Bebbe near the mouth of the Adige. This tower had been built by Venice to control the traffic on the Adige. Its garrison consisted of men from Chioggia and some sailors. In preparation for the Paduan assault, they filled its base with earth, dug a ditch around it and created a covering for it with ropes taken from ships in order to protect it from the projectiles of siege engines. Taking advantage of high tide on 22 October, the defenders sortied, supported by a small fleet, sacked the Paduan camp and took 400 prisoners One source puts it at 400 knights plus many foot soldiers besides, but Dandolo records it as 200 knights and 200 foot soldiers. The Paduan captain, Geremia da Peraga, was among the captives. For its service, Chioggia was released form its annual tribute to Venice of three hens per household. Owing to unusually heavy rains, the ground was exceptionally marshy and the Paduans were forced to break up in retreat. Some of the retreating Paduans encountered a force under the podestà of Treviso that had been coming to reinforce them. Observing the rout, the Trevisans returned home. The author of the Cronaca Foscariniana and Bartolomeo Zuccato writing in the 16th century both report the Paduan–Trevisan alliance as having been signed on 4 September 1215. Other sources give 4 February 1215.Thaller 2016, p. 386n. Following the intervention of Patriarch Wolfger of Aquileia, separate peace treaties for Padua and Treviso were signed on 9 April 1216 at San Giorgio in Alga in Venice.Thaller 2016, pp. 392–393. This achievement is mentioned on Wolfger's tombstone. Wolfger's influence stemmed in part from his position as the superior of the suffragan bishops of Treviso and Padua, but he may also have received a papal commission from Innocent III when he attended the Fourth Lateran Council in November 1215. The pope was at the time preparing a new crusade, which required general peace among the Christian powers of Europe. Present at the signing of the treaties was the prominent peacemaker Giordano Forzatè, who had probably acted as one of the Paduan government's advisers.Gaffuri 1997. According to the treaties, \\"on the occasion of the games of Treviso, the devil instigating, no small war between Venetians and Paduans arose\\" (instigante diabolo, occasione ludi Tarvisii, inter Venetos et Paduanos werra non modica fuisset suborta).Thaller 2016, p. 385. One of the articles of the treaty stipulated that the wealthy Jacopo da Sant'Andrea and twenty-five other Paduans would be at the disposal of the doge of Venice (perhaps to be tried). This suggests that Jacopo may have been behind Padua's decision to go to war. ReferencesBibliography *Coulton, G. G. (ed.)

The original southern facade of the Harrison Building is still visible from High Street. The building was designed by Snyder & Babbitt in the Second Renaissance Revival style. The main, east- facing facade uses fine-grained limestone, with a large central entranceway, multiple belt course, and decorative cornice. The style matches the new building with the old Harrison Building. During construction of the Huntington Center next-door, the architect, added a modern stucco pattern to the 1926 building's then-plain brick west facade, mirroring its east facade.

Buckwalter studies how inflammatory responses affect brain recovery after injury or insult, with a specific emphasis on the neuroimmune and glial cell response after stroke.  Early life and education  In 1984, Buckwalter pursued her undergraduate degree in Biological Chemistry at the University of Chicago, in Illinois. She completed her Bachelors of Science in 1988 and then pursued her MD/PhD training at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in the Department of Human Genetics. Under the mentorship of Sally Camper, Buckwalter helped to localize specific disease causing mutations to mouse chromosomes. She completed her dual degree training in 1996, and then pursued further clinical training at the University of California, San Francisco. Buckwalter completed her Internship in Medicine and Residency in Neurology at the UCSF Medical Center, becoming a Board Certified in Neurology and Psychiatry in 2001. Buckwalter then conducted her Fellowship training in Neurological Critical Care at UCSF, completing her training in 2002. From 2002 to 2004, Buckwalter conducted her postdoctoral fellowship in Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University. Under the mentorship of Tony Wyss-Coray, Buckwalter explored the impacts of brain inflammation and neuroimmune signalling in brain disease. = Localization and identification of mouse mutations = During her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, Buckwalter localized various genes in the mouse genome. She first identified the location of Ames dwarf (df) mutation on mouse chromosome 11 via an intersubspecific backcross. Buckwalter and her colleagues then mapped, for the first time, the location of the Gabrg-2 subunit of the GABA receptor as well as interferon regulatory factor 1 on mouse chromosome 11. Following this, Buckwalter mapped the candidate genes of the spasmodic recessive mutation to mouse chromosome 11 and evaluated the candidate mutated genes leading to the behavioral abnormalities associated with the mutation such as fine motor tremors, leg clasping, and stiffness. She found, through recombination analyses, that the spasmodic mutation maps to the Glra1 gene, coding for a glycine receptor subunit, and this point mutation decreases the glycine receptor function. = Effects of transforming growth factor signalling in the central nervous system = Much of Buckwalter’s postdoctoral research focused on exploring the effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) signalling in the brain. Human data showing increases in TGFb mRNA correlating with the degree of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in the brain prompted Buckwalter to explore how TGFb might be implicated in cerebrovascular pathology in disease. She found that overexpression of TGFb in astrocytes lead to Alzheimer’s Disease like abnormalities and it led to decreased cerebral blood flow in the limbic system. Since TGFb is also rapidly increased in aging and after injury, Buckwalter and her colleagues proposed that it may play a role in decreasing hippocampal neurogenesis. They found that over-expression of TGFb in astrocytes almost completely blocked neurogenesis in the hippocampus and it appears to exert its effects at very early stages in neurogenesis, before differentiation into either neurons or astrocytes. Buckwalter and her colleagues later explored how TGF affects T cell recruitment to the brain meninges and parenchyma in models of Alzheimer's Disease. They found that the increased TFGb in addition to increases in amyloid precursor protein led to increased CD4+ T cell infiltration.  Career and research  In 2004, Buckwalter became an Instructor in the Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University. By 2007, she was promoted to Assistant Professor, and now holds the title of Associate Professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences and is a Bio-X Affiliated Faculty. Buckwalter is a leader in stroke research and directs several clinical stroke initiatives at Stanford. She is the Deputy Director of the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, co-founded and now co-leads the Stroke Collaborative Action Network, and is the co-founder of the Stroke Recovery Program at Stanford. Buckwalter is also the Principal Investigator of the Buckwalter Lab. Her lab focuses on exploring the neuroimmune landscape after brain insult and injury to guide stroke recovery treatments and therapeutic development. Buckwalter explores how astrocytes regulate inflammation in the brain after stroke, how transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) signalling can limit the immune responses after brain injury and infection, and the central and peripheral effects of stroke on the immune system. = Role of TGFb in brain inflammation = In her lab at Stanford, Buckwalter has been exploring the pleiotropic nature of TGFb in the brain post-stroke. TGFb appears to be neuroprotective after stroke through orchestrating glial scarring and regulating the local immune landscape in the brain, so Buckwalter and her lab wanted to see how this process changes in age. They found that activated macrophages and microglia were the predominant sources of TGFb after stroke and that astrocytes, macrophages, and microglia all upregulate their TGFb dependent signalling after stroke whereas neurons and oligodendrocytes do not. Moreover, the increases in TGFb signalling increase with age. Further exploration of the effects of this over-expression highlighted the striking effects that TGFb can have on the neural landscape in the long term. Along with Sheena Josselyn and Paul Frankland, Buckwalter helped to discover that TGFb led to volumetric expansion in the hippocampus which was associated with defects in spatial learning. In the context of infection, however, TGFb appears to play a critical role in moderating the immune response. Buckwalter and her colleagues showed that upon infection with Toxoplasma gondii, TGFb is critical to preventing over-infiltration of immune cells and actually helps to limit neuronal injury and death. Similarly, after an acute stroke, astrocyte mediated TGFb signalling appeared to limit neuroinflammation and preserve brain function. The acute astrocytic responses to TFGb seem to mediate the brain’s anti-inflammatory response to stroke. = Small molecule stroke treatment = Buckwalter and her colleague Frank Longo developed a small molecule tropomyosin-related kinase B agonist (LM22A-4) and tested its effects on stroke recovery. They found that LM22A-4 promoted neurogenesis when administered 3 days post-stroke and it significantly improved recovery, improving limb speed and accelerating the return to normal gate accuracy. = Stroke effects = To explore the underlying causes of post-stroke associated dementia, Buckwalter probed the B lymphocyte response to stroke that had been observed. She found that B lymphocytes infiltrate the brain and are found in neuropil and are associated with aberrant LTP and cognitive delays. Further, pharmacologically blocking B lymphocytes prevented cognitive delays after stroke. To look at the possibility of B cell mediated deficits in cognition in humans, Buckwalter and her colleagues measured autoantibodies in patients after stroke and found that increases in autoantibodies to myelin basic protein were associated with cognitive decline after stroke.

Tracing its origins back to the Western Han Dynasty, it retained its prominence in Chinese politics and society up to the end of the Tang Dynasty. HistoryHan Dynasty= The Du clan can be traced to Du Zhou (d. 94 BC), who served as a censor in the Western Han Dynasty under Emperor Wu of Han, and his son Du Yannian, who also served as a chief censor and shifted the clan's base to Duling (in modern day Xi'an). After this, however, the Du family appears not to be deeply involved in politics during the Eastern Han. =Three Kingdoms Period and Jin Dynasty= The Du family regained prominence in government during the late Han period with Du Ji, who came to the attention of Cao Caovia Xun Yu and became a renowned governor of Hedong Commandery (modern day southern Shanxi). His son, Du Shu, also became a regional governor, and Du Shu's son Du Yu became the chief commander of the conquest of Wu by Jin. In the wake of the Disaster of Yongjia, when the Western Jin capital at Luoyang was sacked, the Du clan generally did not embark on the southern migration to the Eastern Jin that was undertaken by many other prominent clans, instead choosing to remain in northern China and to serve the succeeding non-Chinese regimes. They retained their prominence even during the tumultuous period of the Five Barbarians, and are reported as filling important military and political posts after moving east into Later Zhao. An exception to the trend of remaining north was Du Yi (杜乂), who achieved fame as an elegant gentleman in the Eastern Jin court, but died without issue. =Northern and Southern DynastiesTang Dynasty= During the Tang Dynasty, members of the Du clan played an important role in both governance and culture.

It was in Ottoman Egypt, that de Castro rose to great social prominence, especially in official government circles. He leased the taxes on customs and trade in Alexandria, and in 1520, Selim I, appointed de Castro as master of the mint (mu'allim dār al-darb). After this appointment, de Castro became involved in several philanthropic activities on behalf of individuals and institutions in Egypt. Although, following the succession of Suleiman the Magnificent, a certain Aḥmad Pasha was appointed as Viceroy of Egypt. In 1523, Pasha plotted to establish himself as an independent sovereign, and asked de Castro to mint the coins with his name in lieu of the sultan. de Castro secretly left Egypt and hastened to Constantinople to inform the sultan of Aḥmad's plot. The sultan received him with high honors and gave him costly presents. After hearing of de Castro's actions, Pasha threatened to murder all the Jews in Cairo, although this massacre was evaded after Pasha was stabbed to death by one of his junior officers, leading to the event later being known as the \\"Cairo Purim\\". By the late 1530s, de Castro had moved to Jerusalem, where he played a central role in the city's Jewish society, primarily in its economic life, mainly dealing with real estate.

About 96% of people are positive for the Sd(a) antigen, which is inherited as a dominant trait. Among Sd(a) positive individuals, the expression of the antigen ranges from extremely weak to extremely strong. Very strong expression of the antigen is referred to as a Sd(a++) phenotype. In addition to being expressed on red blood cells, Sd(a) is secreted in bodily fluids such as saliva and breast milk, and is found in the highest concentrations in urine. Urine testing is considered the most reliable method for determining a person's Sid blood type. Antibodies against the Sd(a) antigen are naturally occurring, meaning people produce them without having been exposed to Sd(a) positive blood through transfusion or pregnancy. These antibodies are not usually considered to be clinically significant, but there have been two cases of transfusion reactions associated with transfusion of Sd(a++) blood to people with anti-Sd(a) antibodies. Sid was officially designated a blood group in 2019 after its genetic basis was discovered. Molecular biology The Sd(a) negative blood type is caused by missense mutations in B4GALNT2, a gene located on chromosome 17q21.32 which encodes a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the Sd(a) antigen. The Sd(a) antigen exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. The antigen is not only expressed on the surface of red blood cells but is found in soluble form in human plasma, breast milk, saliva and meconium, and is present in very high quantities in the urine, where it is carried on Tamm- Horsfall glycoprotein. It is also expressed in the stomach, colon, kidneys, and lymph nodes. Newborns do not express Sd(a) on their red cells until about 10 weeks after birth (although they do express the antigen in their bodily fluids), and expression of Sd(a) antigen on red blood cells often decreases during pregnancy. Clinical significance The expression of Sd(a) antigen in positive individuals is highly variable, and ranges from expression so weak that it is barely detectable, to expression so strong that the cells are agglutinated by plasma from most human donors (polyagglutination). Extremely strong expression of Sd(a) is denoted as Sd(a++). The Sd(a++) phenotype is sometimes referred to as the Cad phenotype, after a 1968 paper that identified a novel antigen in members of the Cad family from Mauritius. The Cad positive cells showed polyagglutination and reacted with Dolichos biflorus lectin, a reagent used to identify type A1 red blood cells, even though the cells were type B or O. Later research showed that strong examples of Sd(a) also exhibited polyagglutination and reaction with Dolichos biflorus, and that Cad was likely an exceptionally strong Sd(a) positive phenotype. It is believed that Sd(a) and Cad share the same antigenic determinant and are likely synthesized by the same enzyme, but there may be structural and quantitative differences in the expression of the two substances. The Cad/Sd(a++) phenotype, like the Sd(a) positive phenotype, shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Anti-Sd(a) is a naturally occurring antibody, meaning Sd(a) negative individuals produce it without having been exposed to Sd(a) positive blood through transfusion or pregnancy. Anti-Sd(a) is not typically considered to pose a hazard in blood transfusion, but as of 2018, two cases of transfusion reactions following the transfusion of Sd(a++) blood have been documented. It is suggested that people with anti-Sd(a) are transfused with \\"least incompatible\\" blood (the blood unit that gives the weakest reactions during crossmatching) to avoid potential exposure to Sd(a++) units. Anti-Sd(a) is not known to cause hemolytic disease of the newborn. Epidemiology Approximately 91% of people test positive for Sd(a) through blood typing, and 96% test positive through urine testing. The Sd(a++) phenotype is rare, especially in Europe, but may be more common in East Asian populations. Laboratory testing Urine is considered the optimal specimen for Sd(a) phenotyping. The Sd(a) antigen can be detected in urine using hemagglutination inhibition testing: anti-Sd(a) is added to the urine, followed by Sd(a) positive blood cells. If Sd(a) is present in the urine, it will bind the antibody and prevent the red blood cells from agglutinating. Anti-Sd(a) is usually composed of immunoglobulin M and is reactive at room temperature, but it also displays reactivity in the indirect antiglobulin test. The antibody displays a characteristic pattern of mixed-field agglutination during testing. Under the microscope, small, shiny clumps of red blood cells are visible, surrounded by unagglutinated cells. The reactivity of anti-Sd(a) is enhanced by enzyme treatment with ficin, papain, and trypsin, and the antibody is resistant to treatment with dithiothreitol. Guinea pig urine contains very high concentrations of Sd(a) antigen and is sometimes used to identify anti- Sd(a) antibodies by inhibition testing. History The antigen was named for Sid, an employee at the Lister Institute whose red blood cells were used for antibody screening. They were found to react strongly with samples containing an unidentified antibody, which was later characterized as anti-Sd(a). Although the Sd(a) antigen was named in 1967, and had been studied since at least 10 years earlier, it was only connected to B4GALNT2 in 2003 and assigned to a blood group in 2019 following the discovery of the molecular basis of the Sd(a) negative phenotype. It had previously been classified as part of the ISBT 901 series of high-incidence antigens.

It is now the starting point of the Breisach Railway (Breisacher Bahn) to Freiburg and the Kaiserstuhl Railway (Kaiserstuhlbahn) to Riegel. The Breisach Railway crossed the Upper Rhine, running from Breisach to Colmar in France, until the destruction of the Breisach rail bridge in 1945.  History The Freiburg–Breisach line was completed in September 1871 as part of a planned European east–west connection. The line was extended to the Alsatian town of Colmar with the construction of railway bridge over the Rhine in 1878. The trains took about 70 minutes to run between Freiburg and Colmar, while the Freiburg–Breisach section took about 35 minutes. The private Kaiserstuhl Railway was opened from Breisach to Gottenheim via Endingen and Riegel in 1895. This made Breisach a small railway junction. The current entrance building was opened in 1914, replacing a temporary shed. During the First World War, the line between Breisach and Colmar saw a significant increase in traffic due to military traffic. Since Alsace was no longer part of the German Empire from 1918, Breisach became a border station between Germany and France. As a result, the importance of the Breisach Railway fell sharply. The Breisach Railway Bridge was blown up by German troops in February 1945 at the end of the Second World War. The railway line to Colmar was not rebuilt afterwards. On 1 June 1997, passenger services on the Breisach Railway were taken over by the Breisgau S-Bahn (BSB), which was founded in 1996 as a subsidiary of Südwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (SWEG) and Freiburger Verkehrs AG (VAG), each holding 50%. As the successor to Deutsche Bundesbahn, DB Netz continues to be responsible for the track infrastructure, while the station belongs to DB Station&Service.;  Station building The rather stately and somewhat oversized entrance building of Breisach station was built in 1913/14 from Kaiserstühl basalt. It replaced a temporary structure that had existed since the Breisach Railway opened.  Track layout As a former centre of operations of the Freiburg–Colmar railway, Breisach station still has an extensive track layout (as of 2015). A total of three platform faces are available for passengers at the platform next to the entrance building and on an island platform. Numbering begins on the northwest side of the entrance building. * Platform 1 is a “house” platform directly in front of the entrance building. It is currently used by Breisgau-S-Bahn trains to and from Freiburg. * Track 2 shares an island platform with track 4\\\\. It is now used by the SWEG trains of the Kaiserstuhl Railway towards Endingen and Riegel. * Track 4 is on the island platform next to track 2\\\\. The track is only used in scheduled traffic in the afternoon for the trains of the Breisach Railway. * Track 5 is a siding without a platform. * Track 6 is a dead-end track Tracks 5 and 6 can only be reached from the line by reversing on to and off track 4. A siding of a freight forwarder also connects via track 4. The platforms at Breisach station are barrier-free for the disabled. To platform of tracks 2 and 4 is assessed over a pedestrian level crossing over tracks 1 and 2. Before the adaption for the Breisgau S-Bahn, the island platform had a canopy. Some tracks have been dismantled. At the beginning of the nineties there were at least four storage and loading tracks. The Kaiserstuhl Railway originally had its own station northeast of the current tracks, to the east of the station building. The company's own line was abandoned in 1960 and the line from Riegel merged with the Deutsche Bunderbahn line from Freiburg at line-km 25.89. The Kaiserstuhl Railway still had a separate departure platform for passenger trains to the northeast of the station building on the north side of the house platform. It had its own crossing loop and there were also two sidings and a siding serving businesses on Kandelstrasse.  Rail services The Breisgau-S-Bahn has been running on the Freiburg–Colmar railway to Freiburg im Breisgau since 1 June 1997. DB Regio has operated Breisgau S-Bahn service to Freiburg, continuing on weekdays to Titisee, Seebrugg and Villingen, since December 2019. The trains run every half hour. Regio-Shuttle RS 1 railcars are operated by the Südwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (SWEG) for the Breisgau S-Bahn on the Kaiserstuhl Railway to Riegel am Kaiserstuhl.

The parish was founded in 1864, with the current building on Peachtree Street constructed in 1906.  History  The parish of St. Luke's was organized by Charles Todd Quintard on March 28, 1864, in the midst of the American Civil War. On April 22 of that year, Stephen Elliott, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia, consecrated the parish's first church building, with Quintard as its rector. This church house, bounded by Broad Street, Walton Street, and Forsyth Street in downtown Atlanta, cost $12,000 to build and held its first church service on April 24. On June 15, Quintard and Reverend John W. Beckwith hosted funeral services for Confederate major general and former Episcopal Bishop Leonidas K. Polk, who had been killed a day prior at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. Several days later, a funeral was held at the church for the infant son of Richard Peters. In August, shells fired by Union forces severely damaged the building, which was later destroyed during the burning of Atlanta. The parish would be reformed on June 12, 1870 under the name St. Stephen's, in honor of Elliott. The name was reverted to St. Luke's on January 8, 1872. In 1875, a new building was erected at the intersection of Spring Street and Walton Street. On April 10, 1881, Bishop John W. Beckwith made St. Luke's his cathedral, the first building to ever be designated as such in the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia. Financial difficulties facing St. Luke's had prompted the decision to bestow cathedral status on the parish, as Beckwith felt it would help the parish. In 1883, a new cathedral was built at the intersection of Pryor Street and Houston Street, at the present-day location of the Georgia-Pacific Tower. In 1894, the parish lost cathedral status. In 1906, the church constructed a new building on Peachtree Street, which was consecrated later that year and is currently in use by the church. This Gothic structure was designed by P. Thornton Marye and A. Ten Eyck Brown.

The book argues that East Germany in particular was extremely hostile to Israel and waged \\"undeclared wars\\" against it by funding Arab militant groups and other anti-Israel actions. The book received positive reviews for being well researched and uncovering new information on East Germany's relationship with Israel.Content The book discusses the period between the Six-Day War in 1967 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, chronicling such incidents as the Munich massacre (1972), Yom Kippur War (1973), the Kiryat Shmona and Ma'alot terror attacks in Israel in 1975, the \\"Zionism is racism\\" declaration (1975), the Entebbe hijacking and attacks on theaters that screened Victory at Entebbe (1976), Lebanon War, and West Berlin discotheque bombing (1986). His approach, in contrast to German historians who have examined the same subject, includes as sources Jewish victims of attacks. He also draws on extensive archive research in SED's Politburo, the GDR Council of Ministers, the GDR's foreign and defense ministries, and elsewhere.Blog post about the book According to Herf's research, the East German state sent \\"750,000 Kalashnikov assault weapons; 120 MiG fighter jets; 180,000 anti- personnel land mines; 235,000 grenades; 25,000 rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers; and 25 million cartridges of various sizes\\" to countries and groups at war with Israel. Some of these went to the PLO, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Herf describes how East Germany funded Palestinian militant groups and West German radical leftists were trained by Fatah, the PFLP, and other groups to carry out attacks on Israeli targets. He also discusses the \\"propaganda war against Israel\\" waged at the United Nations and other international organizations. Using anti-Israel actions, East Germany was able to obtain diplomatic recognition outside the Eastern Bloc, from countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Syria, and Egypt. Herf finds that the East German government distinguished between \\"moderates\\" and \\"extremists\\" in the Arab world: Herf notes the difference between West Germany, which had an \\"eleventh commandment\\" of doing no harm to Jews, and East Germany, which had no such premise. He praises the role of West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinski, who wrote editorials denouncing antisemitism on the left. In contrast, Herf is critical of Willy Brandt, because \\"The West German chancellor who famously kneeled in an act of atonement at the memorial to the Jews killed in the Warsaw Ghetto declared his country to be neutral in the most dire days in Israel’s history since 1948 [the Yom Kippur war].\\" He describes the essay of Ulrike Meinhof defending the Munich massacre as \\"one of the most important documents in the history of antisemitism in Europe after the Holocaust\\". Reception In Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Russell Berman praised the book for being well researched. He writes that the book sheds light on \\"an important study of a difficult and multidimensional chapter in the history of Germans and Jews\\". praised Herf's \\"excellent analysis\\". described it as a \\"meticulously researched study\\", although one that sometimes gets bogged down in repetitive arguments and excessive detail on arms shipments. Allan Arkush describes the book \\"prodigiously researched indictment\\" and \\"a timely reminder\\" but predicts that the \\"tale of two hatreds would [not] shame\\" those who continue the politics Herf describes in the present.

Background  Catire Bello which roughly translates to pretty blonde in Spanish was a Chestnut colt bred at Haras La Quebrada. He had no white markings on his feet but he had a signature white blaze on his face to go along with his orange coat. His sire was Inland Voyager a modest stakes runner who never finished better than 4th in graded stakes company. However he was quite an influential sire in Venezuela. Siring champions such as Voyardo, Delta Force, and Traffic Control His dam was Pink Screen was a proven dam who mostly ran in allowance races. At auction he would be sold to Stud Illusion for 1,150,000 Venezuelan bolívars.  History  2-year-old-season = Catire Bello would make his first start on August 4, 1991, the race would be contested at 1100 meters or 5 1/2 furlongs. The race was an effortless win going on to win by 11 lengths. The race was so impressive that 20 days later he would go into stakes company for the grade 3 Clasico Victoreado. Again it was barely even a challenge to Catire Bello. Halfway through the homestretch he already had a huge lead but in an instant, he more than doubled it to 8 lengths running away comfortably defeating Santu Pretu. Despite a small set back finishing second in the Premio Alberto H. Cipriani behind Santu Pretu. He would make his grade 1 debut in his 4th start the Premio Comparacion. Catire Bello would break well and set the pace keeping a good 1 length lead overall comers that tried to get near him. However, by the far turn, he began to simply open up throughout the stretch managing a 6 length score getting back at Santu Pretu. After another win 6 days later his 2-year-old year concluded and he would be awarded Co-Champion 2-year-old along with Santu Pretu. = 3-year-old season = To start his 3-year-old-year Catire Bello would continue his success in Venezuela with 2 more victories being added to his record. In both of these, he would have a rematch with fellow Venezuelan champion 2-year-old Santu Pretu. The first of these was the grade 2 Premio Francisco de Miranda. The race would entirely Catire Bello's way as he would take the lead by a length with Santu Pretu right behind him. As they moved into the far turn Santu Pretu moved on the rail only a neck behind Catire Bello. But on the outside, Catire Bello with steady encouragement would slowly but surely repel Santu Pretu and go on to win. The second time around the race was not even a contest Santu Pretu was not able to get close to Catire Bello and Catire Bello would easily romp by 11 lengths. = American Campaign = The 2 wins were so impressive to his trainer Ivan Calixto as they decided to try and run him in the biggest race in Florida. The Florida Derby, if he ran well enough the bigger goal after that would be that years Kentucky Derby. The race would offer him many new challenges that he had never had to deal with before. He had never been around 2 turns, as well the difficulty of the horses in the race would simply be way harder than those in Venezuela. The idea of a Venezuelan colt winning the Kentucky Derby was not impossible as Canonero II had done it 21 years prior. Many Venezuelans attended the race and listened on the radio to see their horse run. However, when the race began Catire Bello slammed into the starting gate cutting into his stiffe and getting rid of any chance he had of winning. He would not be able to go the lead and instead had to pick off runners late he would face trouble again with 3/16th's to go to be a distant 6th place. Despite such a rough start to his American campaign Catire Bello would try again with a run in the Tropical Park Derby. Despite breaking better this time he simply didn't have it in him a higher dose of Lasix and fast fractions led to an even bigger dud then seen in the Florida Derby finishing 9th and only managing to defeat 1 horse in the race. His final bid to make it into the Kentucky Derby would be the Derby Trial. Like in the Florida Derby he would not go to the lead and stay towards the back running past tired horses to finish 4th by over 11 lengths. The possibility of making it into the Kentucky Derby was now simply unachievable so they decided to go for a different triple crown instead. = Venezuelan Triple Crown = With no hope of running in the Kentucky Derby and replicating the achievements of Canonero II they shipped Catire Bello back quickly to get him back to Venezuela in time for the first jewel of the triple crown The Clasico Jose Antonio Paez. The trip back was very exhausting as Catire Bello would have just over 3 weeks after the Derby Trial to run in The Clasico Jose Antonio Paez. The trip caused Catire Bello to loose over 20 kilograms or 44 pounds. To get him into shape trainer Ivan Calixto prepped him with easy 2 mile gallops. Even with a nearly undefeated record in Venezuela people were skeptical if he was fit enough to win the race. Due to many people believing that Catire Bello was not at his best and vulnerable the race attracted 10 racers to challenge him. Despite being far from at his fittest Catire Bello ran in the race anyway. At the start, he was not a clear leader, and instead stalked right behind the front runners and not going with his normal front running style. But by the far the turn he picked up drifting to the center of the track and opening up a 4 length lead to win. After winning such a race despite so many disadvantages the criticism disappeared, now everyone knew that Catire Bello was the best 3-year-old horse in Venezuela. By the second jewel the Clasico Ministerio de Agricultura y Cria he had gained back some of the weight he had lost and was closer to his full strength and ready to run. Now that his soundness was no longer questionable now he had to answer a new question could he handle two turns and a 1 1/4 mile race. At the start, he immediately fought for the front managing to take the lead over his rivals. The race after that turned into an exhibition as he continued to open up stride after stride until he crossed the wire 22 lengths ahead of his nearest opponent. Most challengers were scared silly after such a performance so for the Clasico Republica de Venezuela only 5 horses challenged him. The race would be run at 1 1/2 miles and seemed for sure to be a slam dunk. However, some were not so sure when the race began. At the start, Catire Bello zoomed the lead no one followed him except for one horse. His name was Camici and he ran right with him. Camici was a natural-born sprinter and was specifically sent to tire Catire Bello out. He would try as the two fought for the lead setting a suicidal pace running the first quarter in 21 2/5 seconds. But after that Camici was exhausted and dropped back. Catire Bello had no one even near him and an exhausted sprinter. He was able to canter home winning the race by 9 lengths with a final time of 2:32.2. He was now the 4th triple crown winner. = 1992 Clásico del Caribe = Following his victory in the triple crown, he would race 3 times against elder horses in preparation for the biggest race of his career the Clásico del Caribe. He first would win the Premio Cria Nacional before managing a grand slam when he ran in the biggest race in Venezuela the Clasico Copa de Oro. The race started as he got a 1 length advantage in the backstretch and in the far turn opened up. However late game he tired slightly having his lead receding until the wire when he won by just under a length. He would win by a more confident margin in the Gran Premio Unicria before losing his final prep the Clasico Simon Bolivar. Even with the loss in the final prep, he was favored for the Clásico del Caribe. At the start, things didn't go his way as he would not manage to take the lead and instead had to move his way up into the second place right behind the Panama bred triple crown winner Leonardo. Throughout the entire race, Catire Bello played the role of second-best with Leonardo leading around every turn. Despite giving it all he had Leonardo simply was to tough for Catire Bello to pass and held him off until they hit the wire. Losing the Clásico del Caribe by 1 length. Even with 2 losses to end the year Catire Bello was still good enough to earn the award for Venezuelan Horse Of The Year, Champion 3-year-old horse, and Champion Sprinter.  Retirement  After losing the Clásico del Caribe Catire Bello would run once at the age of 4 in the Clasico Andres Bello. At the start, he would be second on the rail but soon he would take the lead. By the far turn, the race was over and he easily won the race carrying 58 kilograms by over 6 lengths. An injury after the race would end his career and he would be put to stud. As a stud, he would manage to still win awards siring multiple champions such as Don Corleone and winning Venezuelan leading first-crop sire in 1997 and leading Venezuelan bred sire in 1999. However, his stud career would be cut short after a battle with Laminitis in 2001.

In his 1996 book Job Creation and Destruction (co-authored with John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh), he uses plant-level data from the manufacturing industry to examine how businesses and workers respond to changes in their economic environments. Among the most striking findings in the book are the large and persistent gross job flows, which dwarf the net job flows that are commonly observed in employment data. Job Creation and Destruction laid the groundwork for subsequent research that not only confirmed the existence of such large gross job flows in other time periods, sectors, and countries, but also delved into the mechanisms and theories that would explain these flows.Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Profile of and Interview with John Haltiwanger In a review published in the Journal of Economic Literature in 1997, David Blanchflower concluded that Job Creation and Destruction \\"is an important piece of work.

He was a to his stablemate Ryuden, who was a fellow Yamanashi Prefecture native and alumnus of his junior high school judo club. Starting in March 2014, Shobushi was a performer of on regional tours and exhibition tournaments. His partner in the performances was Takamisato of the Azumazeki stable. Usually both wrestlers in shokkiri are from the same stable, but Azumazeki had no-one small enough to provide a contrast to the larger Takamisato, so Shobushi who was of short stature and weighed only around was asked instead. Following Takamisato's retirement in 2018 Shobushi's partner was Ebisumaru, who made his professional debut alongside Shobushi and is also from Takadagawa. Shobushi also performed at Takekaze's in February 2020. Illness and death Shobushi was the first sumo wrestler confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, though his identity was not disclosed at the time. On April 4, he developed a fever, but was not able to get medical attention or get admitted to a hospital until April 8 when coughing up blood, due to the high number of people with symptoms that Japan was experiencing at the time.As Japan reopens, coronavirus testing slowed by bureaucracy and staff shortages, Reuters (28 May 2020) An initial test for coronavirus came back negative, but after being transferred to a different hospital he tested positive on April 10. He remained in intensive care from April 19 until his death from multiple organ failure brought on COVID-19 related pneumonia on May 13. Prior to his death, he suffered from diabetes and in 2016 had to withdraw from a bout because of hypoglycemia. He was the first active sumo wrestler to die since Wakamiume of the makushita division died of acute myelogenous leukemia in 2008. Shortly before the announcement of his death, the May tournament was cancelled. The Nishonoseki ichimon (a group of related stables) is planning to hold a ichimon funeral for Shobushi, which are normally reserved for wrestlers who go on to be elders of the Japan Sumo Association (JSA). The JSA chairman, Hakkaku, said after Shobushi's death, \\"We cannot find any words to say when we think about the broken hearts of his family. It must have been so very painful to fight the disease for over a month but, like a sumo wrestler, he persevered and endured, fighting to the very end.

McGregor Mountain is situated northwest of Lake Chelan in the northern Methow Mountains, on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The closest community is Stehekin, and the nearest higher neighbor is Goode Mountain, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Stehekin River. Topographic relief is significant since the southern aspect of the mountain rises 6,600 feet above this river in approximately two miles. The famous Pacific Crest Trail traverses the western base of this mountain, and the strenuous 7.7-mile (12.4 km) McGregor Mountain Trail gains 6,400 feet (1,920 m) of elevation to take hikers within a half-mile of the summit. Reaching the summit requires exposed scrambling the final 1,100 feet (330 m), and an ice axe is needed if the trail remains covered by snowpack.McGregor Mountain Trail NPS The summit was the site of an old fire lookout cabin from 1923 until 1955, but now has a radio repeater for the National Park Service. The views from the top include Glacier Peak, Black Peak, Corteo Peak, Frisco Mountain, Tupshin Peak, Dome Peak, Glory Mountain, and many others. This mountain was named for Billy McGregor, a Stehekin Valley resident who had a cabin and homestead at the base of this mountain during the 1890s.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. page 289. In May of 1901, Billy disappeared overnight from a boat docked in Lake Chelan, and was never seen or heard from again.Tom Hackenmiller, Ladies of the Lake: Tales of Transportation, Tragedy, and Triumph on Lake Chelan, Point Publishing, 1998, page 50. Climate McGregor Mountain has an alpine climate which supports the Sandalee Glacier on its northern slopes. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology McGregor Mountain's south aspect. Enlarge to see the repeater visible on the summit The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He had important roles in the relations between Siam and the Sultanate of Kedah during the nineteenth century. His modern descendants bear the surname Na Nagara (), Komarakul Na Nagara () and Chaturangakula (). Chao Phraya Nakhon Noi was known in Malay sources as Phya Buri Sakmuton and in contemporary British sources as the Raja of Ligor. Biography When King Taksin led an expedition to subjugate Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1769, he took a daughter of Chao Phraya Nakhon Nu, the warlord of Nakhon Si Thammarat after the Fall of Ayutthaya, named Prang as Chao Chom or one of his minor consorts. The wife of Uparaj Pat, who was the vice- governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat and Nakhon Nu's son-in-law, died in 1774. King Taksin expressed his will to give up his own Consort Prang to be Uparaj Pat's new wife. However, the court ladies told the king in 1776 that the menstruation of Consort Prang had ceased for two months and she might be pregnant with the king. King Taksin insisted that he himself should heed his own words and Uparaj Pat reluctantly accepted Consort Prang as his new ceremonial wife. Consort Prang bore a son at Nakhon Si Thammarat and Noi Na Nagara was born on 27 August 1776. Uparaj Pat became Noi's adoptive father. Uparaj Pat was appointed as Nakhon Pat the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat in 1786. Nakhon Pat brought his adoptive son Noi to Bangkok to began his career as a royal page of King Rama I. Noi was later made Phra Borrirak Bhubetr and was allowed to return to Ligor. He served his adoptive father during the Burmese Invasion of Phuket in 1809. He led a fleet from Trang to recapture Phuket from the Burmese, though the Burmese had already abandoned Phuket earlier. His adoptive father Nakhon Pat resigned from the governorship of Ligor in 1811 and Noi was appointed Phraya Nakhon Si Thammarat the new governor of Ligor, though his adoptive father still wield authorities. Also in 1811, Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II of Kedah had conflicts with his brother Tunku Bisnu. Tunku Bisnu was then made the governor of Setul and approached Nakhon Noi. His adoptive father Nakhon Pat died in 1814. The governorship of Ligor also served as the base for Siamese control over Northern Malay States. In 1815, Sultan Muhammad I of Kelantan requested Nakhon Noi that Kelantan be separated from Terengganu and became direct vassal of Siam. King Rama II granted Kelantan as a separate vassal state to the authority of Ligor. In 1820, King Bagyidaw of Burma planned a new invasion of Siam. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah of Kedah, upon hearing the news of Burmese invasions, decided to secretly went into alliance with Burma. Tunku Mom, a brother of the sultan, informed Nakhon Noi about the sultan's secret alliance with Burma. King Rama II then summoned Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah to Bangkok but he did not go so he ordered the Siamese invasion of Kedah. Nakhon Noi brought troops to capture Alor Setar in 1821. The sultan then fled to Penang, which had been leased by Kedah to the British in 1786. Siam imposed a direct rule on Kedah. Nakhon Noi's son Phra Phakdi Borrirak was appointed as the governor of Kedah with the title of Phraya Abhaydhibet. The British at Penang was concerned with Siamese presence in Kedah as then the sultan was taking refuge in Penang. Marquess of Hastings, the Governor-General of India, sent John Crawfurd to Bangkok in 1821. When Crawfurd reached Penang in December 1821, Nakhon Noi \\"the Raja of Ligor\\" sent a letter to Crawfurd declaring that he and Siam had no intentions of invading Penang. However, Crawfurd was still convinced about the potential Siamese threat. When Crawfurd arrived at Bangkok in April 1822, he presented the personal letter of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah to King Rama II blaming Nakhon Noi. In October 1825, Henry Burney arrived at Ligor. Nakhon Noi led Burney to Bangkok and became one of three Siamese delegates that participated in the conclusion of Burney Treaty in June 1826 that recognized Siamese suzerainty over Northern Malay States. In 1831, Tunku Kudin a nephew of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah led forces to capture Alor Setar. Phraya Abhaydhibet, Nakhon Noi's son, fled the city. Nakhon Noi ordered the forces to be levied from Pattani to fight Tunku Kudin in Kedah. Tuan Sulung the governor of Pattani also rebelled and joined Kedah with supports from Kelantan and Terengganu. The event rose to become the rebellion of Northern Malay Sultanates. Nakhon Noi led forces to recapture Alor Setar. Tunku Kudin was killed and his severed head was sent to Bangkok. King Rama III sent Chao Phraya Phraklang to aid Nakhon Noi. Nakhon Noi restored his son Phraya Abhaydhibet as the governor of Kedah. Nakhon Noi then joined Phraklang to take Pattani. Tuan Sulung the governor of Pattani fled to Kelantan. Nakhon Noi and Phraklang pursued Tuan Sulung to Kelantan. Sultan Muhammad of Kelantan surrendered and voluntarily gave Tuan Sulung to the Siamese. In 1837, Princess Mother Sri Sulalai, mother of King Rama III, passed away. While Nakhon Noi and most of the officials in Southern Siam were away in Bangkok to attend the funeral, another Kedah Rebellion occurred in February 1838. Two of the Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin's nephews, Tunku Muhammad Sa'ad and Tunku Muhammad Akib, had the Andaman pirates led by Wan Mali attack and capture Alor Setar again. Phraya Abhaydhibet the Kedah governor fled to Phatthalung. Nakhon Noi who had been ill hurriedly returned to Ligor. King Rama III sent Phraya Sripipat (Phraklang's younger brother) to aid Nakhon Noi. His son Phraya Abhaydhibet retook Alor Setar. Nakhon Noi then passed away on 14 May 1838 at Nakhon Si Thammarat. After the demise of Nakhon Noi, Phraya Sripipat installed Tunku Anum as a new ruler of Kedah. Nakhon Noi's son Noiklang succeeded his father as the new governor of Ligor. Phraya Abhaydhibet, the former governor of Kedah, was made governor of Phangnga instead. Family and Issues Nakhon Noi had many wives, in accordance to social customs of the era. His main wife was Lady In, a daughter of Phraya Pinat-akkhi from Bangchang family. Nakhon Noi had total of thirty-four children. His notable children include; *Noiyai (? - 1905), became Chao Chom Manda or minor consort to King Rama III.

In the Indies, it formed one of the main sources of state revenue prior to the twentieth century. The pachters could extract profits on top of what was due to the authorities, and were allowed to enforce their rights with private armies and intelligence agencies. The pachters usually employed administrators, the kuasa pacht, to run the day-to-day operations of their pachten. A pacht territory could be managed as a discrete unit or divided further into smaller farms, sub-contracted to sub-farmers. The Dutch colonial authorities granted or auctioned off pachten for the sale of opium and salt, for the running of toll houses, pawnshops and gambling dens, for the collection of land, market and poll taxes, for the management of forests, and for the gathering of produce such as birds' nests, pearls, trepang and sponges. As the colonial state became more centralised, most of these revenue farms were gradually taken over by the government or state monopolies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

It was written by Fan Chung and Ronald Graham, based on a 1997 survey paper by Chung, and published in 1998 by A K Peters. A softcover edition with some updates and corrections followed in 1999. Topics The book has eight chapters, the first being a short introduction. Its main content are six chapters of unsolved problems, grouped by subtopic. Chapters two and three are on Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory. The fourth covers topics in graph coloring, packing problems, and covering problems. The fifth concerns graph enumeration and random graphs, the sixth generalizes from graphs to hypergraphs, and the seventh concerns infinite graphs. The book concludes with a chapter of stories about Erdős from one of his oldest friends, Andrew Vázsonyi. Each chapter begins with a survey of the history and major results in the subtopic of graph theory that it covers; Erdős himself figures prominently in the history of several of these subtopics. The individual history, motivation, known progress, and bibliographic references for each problem are included, along with (in some cases) prizes for a solution originally offered by Erdős and maintained by Chung and Graham. Audience and reception One target audience for the book is researchers in graph theory, for whom these problems may provide material for much future research. They may also provide an inspiration for students of mathematics, and reviewer Arthur Hobbs suggests that the book could even be used as the basis for a graduate course. Additionally, reviewers Robert Beezer and W. T. Tutte suggest that the book may be of interests to mathematicians in other areas, and to historians of mathematics, for the insight it provides into Erdős's life and work. Ralph Faudree writes that the book is suitable both as reference material and for browsing. Tutte notes, for those not familiar with the topic, that in mathematics, a well-posed and unsolved problem can itself be a significant contribution, a success rather than a failure. In a similar vein of thought, Faudree adds that the book provides \\"an appropriate tribute\\" to Erdős and his history of both formulating and solving problems.

She has introduced legislation in Congress to remove the previous deadline for the ERA's ratification in order to allow it to continue to receive support from the necessary number of states.

Murkowski stated that many children in Alaska and the United States rely on meals from school and attributed federal policies as the reason for difficulty in feeding hungry children. = Budget = In February 2012, after Senate leaders reached a compromise to lower the threshold for the number of votes needed to pass bills, Murkowski was one of fourteen Republican senators to vote for legislation that extended a 2 percentage-point cut in the payroll tax for the remainder of the year and provided an extension of federal unemployment benefits along with preventing doctors' payments under Medicare from being cut. In 2017, Murkowski was a cosponsor of the End Government Shutdowns Act, a bill by Rob Portman that would form an automatic continuing resolution (CR) for every appropriations bill for the purpose of the federal government never shutting down again. Funding for the continuing resolution would be reduced by 1 percent after the first 120 days, and by 1 percent every 90 days thereafter before Congress finished the annual appropriations process. In January 2019, Senator Murkowski supported both Republican and Democratic bills to end a government shutdown. She was one of six Republicans who broke with their party to vote in favor of the Democratic proposal. In response to United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross stating that he did not \\"understand why\\" workers had to go to food banks during the shutdown, Murkowski commented, \\"We saw yesterday the insensitivity of certain remarks a Cabinet secretary that demonstrated to me that he is just so clearly of out of touch, with men and women who get up every day and go do oftentimes pretty menial work at some of these jobs. I’m talking about the secretary of Commerce. And you know what he said was so disconnected from reality that it stunned me.\\" In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate passed $484 billion in relief with most funding going to refill the coffers of the Paycheck Protection Program. Murkowski stated that lawmakers knew they would be underestimating certain areas when passing the Families First Act and CARES Act and that they were aware they \\"have directed a lot of federal resources and it will require us getting back to work in order to deal with this\\", citing \\"no good choices\\".

National Association of Water Companies (NAWC) President and CEO Robert F. Powelson stated that the NAWC was \\"very grateful for the support and leadership of Senators Shaheen and Murkowski in pushing S. 2942 forward\\" and that the bill would \\"allow America’s water companies to continue to provide safe, reliable drinking water and wastewater services to customers at an affordable price by ensuring that the expansion of these services to new customers or new locations does not unfairly burden a utility’s existing customers.” In May 2020, along with Mike Braun, John Hoeven, and Kelly Loeffler, Murkowski introduced the Safeguarding Small Business Act, legislation that would end all tax liability associated with loan forgiveness under the Paycheck Protection Program. Murkowski said lawmakers needed \\"to give our small businesses whatever help we can to make sure they are able to keep their workers employed and their doors open\\" and promoted the bill's passage as helping \\"ensure Alaska’s small business owners are protected under the PPP as intended, giving them much-needed support to overcome the impacts of this pandemic.\\" =Criminal justice= On December 18, 2018, Murkowski was one of twelve senators to vote against the FIRST STEP Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners through expanding job training and other programs in addition to forming an expansion of early- release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, \\"to more equitably punish drug offenders.\\" In a tweet before the vote, Murkowski charged the Senate with rushing through a package \\"that could reduce time that drug traffickers & other convicted felons spend in federal prison in the name of rehabilitation.\\" =Affirmative action= Murkowski opposes affirmative action. =Alaska Native issues= Murkowski is an active member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and served as Vice Chairman of the Committee during the 110th Congress.

In 2012, Murkowski submitted a biomass-related amendment for inclusion in the Tribal Energy Bill that contained a provision for tribes to be authorized to become involved with rural biomass energy demonstration projects, as Murkowski insisted that the bill did this only for tribes in the Contiguous United States and not Alaska. Murkowski called the bill without her amendment \\"another one of those laws and rules that don’t work in Alaska, where our people have hundreds of thousands of acres of timber lands and an enormous need for exactly these sorts of innovative solutions.\\" The amendment was passed unanimously by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on September 13, 2012. At the start of the 116th United States Congress, Murkowski and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto revived Savanna’s Act, a bill intended to improve the response of the federal government to the crisis of murdered and missing Native American women and girls. The bill passed in Senate with unanimous support during the previous Congress when it was sponsored by then-Senator Heidi Heitkamp, but was blocked from passing in the House by Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte. Of the bill, Murkowski said, \\"It got held up in the House literally over one member. That member’s gone and I’m still here.\\" In January 2020, Murkowski co-sponsored the INVEST Act, a bill that sought to improve the existing New Markets Tax Credit program to heighten its outreach to Native communities. Mazie Hirono, a fellow sponsor of the bill, said the bill would ensure \\"Native Hawaiian communities in our state and other Native communities across the country will benefit from new access to much-needed resources\\" and that she was \\"proud to join Senator Murkowski to introduce this legislation to support Native communities and build on the program’s success.\\" In April 2020, after Congress allocated $8 billion in funding for tribal governments as part of the CARES Act, Murkowski and Alaska Representative Don Young were among thirty-one lawmakers to sign a letter to President Trump requesting the funding be allocated quickly while also being distributed in a manner respectful to tribal sovereignty: \\"It is therefore incumbent upon these agencies to respect the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and show deference to Tribal views, particularly as they relate to the use and distribution of CARES Act resources.\\" = Hate crimes = After the 2017 Unite the Right rally, Murkowski was part of a bipartisan resolution that condemned white nationalists, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other hate groups, and called on the Trump Administration to use resources toward the improvement of data collection on hate crimes and to work together to address the growing prevalence of hate groups.

In a Senate floor speech, Murkowski said, \\"Seniors are not only being denied a choice of doctors, but in many cases they don’t have the ability to see a doctor at all. This is because doctors, or health care providers in Alaska are paid just about 37 cents on the dollar for the care they provide to seniors on Medicare.\\" Murkowski opposed President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; she voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and she voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

In 2016, Murkowski threatened a hold on the confirmation of Robert Califf as Commissioner of Food and Drugs due to the Obama administration's approving of genetically engineered fish. In 2017, Lisa Murkowski announced that she was opposed to repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan. She voted against starting debates in the Senate.

The Senate passed the bill in December 2018. In an August 2019 interview, Murkowski promoted the Lower Health Care Costs Act, legislation that reduced the overall cost of health care through provisions relating to price transparency and pharmaceuticals cost reduction. She stated that the Lower Health Care Costs Act would allow a negotiation between insurers and providers over the prices of out-of-network costs, which she opined was \\"a headache in the first place and it’s even worse when you’re not well\\", and noted her efforts toward \\"a provision that would force pharmaceutical manufacturers to justify rate increases on their medications above a certain amount.\\" In August 2019, Murkowski and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced the Rural Health Innovation Act, a bill that would form a national telehealth program and authorize a five-year grant program for the purpose of forming growth of telemedicine programs into rural communities as well as mandating a new payment system to encourage the adoption of telemedicine. In October 2019, Murkowski was one of twenty-seven senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Schumer advocating for the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \\"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\\" = Housing = In 2017, Murkowski was a cosponsor of the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill by Maria Cantwell and Orrin Hatch intended to expand and retool the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program for the purpose of forming or retaining roughly 1.3 million affordable homes over the course of a decade. =Same-sex marriage and LGBT issues= In 2004, Murkowski voted in favor of a federal constitutional amendment to define marriage to be between one man and one woman.

Murkowski supported the repeal of don't ask, don't tell after consideration of the Department of Defense report. \\"Our military leaders have made a compelling case that they can successfully implement a repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell',\\" she said. \\"It is infinitely preferable for Congress to repeal the law, and allow the service chiefs to develop and execute a new policy, than to invite a court-ordered reversal of the law with no allowance for a military-directed implementation. I've heard from Alaskans across the state who believe it's time to end this discriminatory policy, and I agree with them.\\"Alaska's senators vote to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' 18 December 2010.

She became the third sitting Republican United States Senator to do so after Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois.

The bill received 56 votes and was successfully blocked by Republicans. In February 2017, Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins were the only two Republicans who voted in the Senate against Donald Trump's selection for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. This caused a 50-50 tie broken by Senate president Mike Pence to successfully confirm DeVos' appointment. A day earlier, Collins and Murkowski both voted for DeVos within the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, passing DeVos' nomination by a vote of 12-11 to allow the Senate to vote on DeVos. In September 2017, Murkowski, Richard Burr, and Bob Casey introduced the Boost Saving for College Act, a bill intended to give low- and middle-income families access to tools with tax advantages to assist with paying for the high cost of higher education through authorizing contributions to college savings accounts to qualify for the Saver’s Credit already applicable to retirement account contributions for household of lower and middle income.

After Trump announced a 'zero-tolerance' migration policy that separates children from parents Lisa Murkowski opposed the Trump administration's actions and called the policy \\"cruel, tragic\\". In 2019, Murkowski was among a group of senators introducing bipartisan legislation to oppose Trump's decision to use an emergency declaration to build a border wall. She was then one of a dozen Republicans who broke with their party, joining all Democrats, to vote for a resolution rejecting Trump's use of an emergency declaration.

At a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the 2020 budget for FEMA, Murkowski pressed Acting Administrator of the FEMA Pete Gaynor on the vagueness of the criteria for the home repair award, citing the appeal decisions as not being readily available and questioned Gaynor on how lawmakers could \\"know that disaster victims can have confidence in this program that is being administered\\". = Drugs = In May 2019, Murkowski was one of four senators to cosponsor the Fair Accountability and Innovative Research Drug Pricing Act, intended to implement a requirement that drugmakers notify the Department of Health and Human Services in addition to submitting a “transparency and justification\\" report at least 30 days prior to an increase of prices for drugs costing at least $100. Murkowski stated that the legislation would mandate drugmakers produce \\"a justification for each price increase, manufacturing, research and development costs for the qualifying drug, net profits attributable to the qualifying drug, marketing and advertising spending on the qualifying drug, and other information as deemed appropriate\\" and cited the need to change the \\"little to no transparency from pharmaceutical corporations\\" at a time of prescription costs rising. =Cannabis= Murkowski has cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.

The bill was meant to respond to the plastic pollution crisis threatening oceans, shorelines, marine life, and coastal economies and served as a continuation of the Save Our Seas Act. = Opioids = In October 2017, Murkowski and Democrat Elizabeth Warren wrote a letter to President Trump applauding his \\"stated commitment to addressing opioid addiction\\" and concurring with his position that the opioid crisis deserved an increase in federal spending. Warren and Murkowski expressed that they were \\"extremely concerned\\" that Trump had \\"yet to take the necessary steps to declare a national emergency on opioids, nor \\"made any proposals to significantly increase funding to combat the epidemic\\". The senators wrote that they hoped that Trump would pursue actions supporting his \\"verbal commitment to fighting the 'serious problem' of opioid addiction with action.\\" In December 2017, Murkowski was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing opioid use as a non-partisan issue presently \\"ravaging communities in every state and preys upon individuals and families regardless of party affiliation\\" and requesting the pair \\"make every effort to ensure that new, substantial and sustained funding for the opioid epidemic is included in any legislative package.\\" In January 2018, Murkowski, Claire McCaskill, and Dan Sullivan wrote a letter to acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration Robert Patterson calling on the DEA to issue a new regulation that would authorize certain health-care providers to obtain special registration letting them use telemedicine to prescribe medication for individuals with an opioid addiction. In May 2018, Murkowski and Democrats Ed Markey and Maggie Hassan introduced legislation requiring federal agencies to form ways of measuring the effectiveness of efforts to address the opioid epidemic over the period of the next 180 days with the intent of \\"significantly reversing\\" misuse of opioids and opioid-related deaths within five years. = Privacy = In June 2019, Murkowski and Democrat Amy Klobuchar introduced the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, legislation mandating the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services create regulations for apps that track health data, wearable devices, and genetic testing kits in addition to forming a National Task Force on Health Data Protection that would evaluate and give a position on potential cybersecurity and privacy risks related to consumer products using customer health data. In a statement, Murkowski cited the need \\"to keep up with advancements in recent technology\\" and added that the bill prioritized American consumer privacy. =Supreme Court nominations= Murkowski and Brett Kavanaugh in August 2018 On April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, President Obama nominating Solicitor General of the United States Elena Kagan to replace him. Murkowski and Senate Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch announced their opposition on July 2, Murkowski cited the cautious approach Kagan had while being questioned during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and opined that Kagan did not \\"live up to\\" a standard she imposed in a 2005 article where Kagan advocated for the Senate to probe the legal views of a nominee to guarantee the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent in the Senate. Murkowski also took issue with Kagan's heritage, saying that while she welcomed that the Obama administration \\"has substantially increased the representation of women on the high court, it is of greater significance to me that the administration has not increased representation of people from the West or from rural backgrounds on the court.\\" In February 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, which led President Obama to nominate Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to succeed Scalia. While Murkowski initially supported holding hearings for Garland, she reversed her decision according to her spokeswoman Karina Petersen: \\"Senator Murkowski respects the decision of the chair and members of the Judiciary Committee not to hold hearings on the nominee.\\" Garland's nomination remained before the Senate for longer than any other Supreme Court nomination in history, and the nomination expired with the end of the 114th Congress. Murkowski has taken different positions on the so-called \\"nuclear option\\", under which the majority party can approve a nominee to the Supreme Court by a simple majority instead of allowing for the Senate's tradition of filibusters. She has said she opposes use of this option, arguing that \\"it will further inflame partisan passions\\", and prefers a more bipartisan process. However, in April 2017 the Republican leadership of the Senate used the nuclear option to win approval of Neil Gorsuch to the Court, and Murkowski voted for it. Because of her pro- abortion rights position, she is often considered a possible \\"no\\" vote on appointments to the Supreme Court. In 2017 she voted to confirm the appointment of conservative Neil Gorsuch to the Court. On September 28, 2018, she sided with Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and stated she will not vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh unless the FBI conducts an investigation of sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and others. On October 5 she was the only Republican who voted against the cloture motion to end debate and advance Kavanaugh's confirmation to a vote; the cloture motion passed 51-49. She was the only Republican who voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation, but she requested to be recorded as 'present' in a process known as a \\"pair between senators\\" as a favor to Senator Steve Daines from Montana so that he could attend his daughter's wedding. Since Daines was voting 'yes' and Murkowski voted 'no,' the process allows them to cancel each other's votes. The Alaska Republican Party opposed her decision while the regional Planned Parenthood thanked her for opposing Kavanaugh. = United States Postal Service = In June 2012, Murkowski sent a letter to United States Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe regarding information she had heard about the U.S. Postal Service becoming \\"a main conduit for drug trafficking in Juneau, Petersburg, and other Southeast Alaska communities\\" and asserted that actions needed to be taken to prevent the USPS from being a drug trafficking avenue, urging Donahoe to consider \\"whether cross-deputization agreements could be entered with local law enforcement that might allow them to conduct inspections, if they have the resources to do so.\\" In March 2019, Murkowski was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as an establishment that was self-sustained and noting concerns that a potential privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for customers of USPS with a particular occurrence in rural communities. = Workplace harassment = Throughout early 2018, in her capacity as chair of the Energy Committee, Murkowski pressed officials within the Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Interior, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs about sexual harassment and bullying. Murkowski said in an interview, \\"It is \\"almost a culture in certain areas, where it's just, 'Well, you know, if you decided that you're going to work in a man's world, then you should just expect that.' Well that's not right. And that's not what one should expect. And you shouldn't expect that in the military. You shouldn't expect that as a firefighter. You shouldn't expect that in the movie industry. You should just not expect that.\\" In March 2019, Murkowski and Democratic Senator Kamala Harris reintroduced the Ending the Monopoly of Power Over Workplace Harassment through Education and Reporting (EMPOWER) Act, a bill that would prohibit non-disclosure and non-disparagement clauses used by some employers in employment requirements, Murkowski citing the need \\"to create an environment of transparency where victims feel empowered to speak up without the fear of retaliation\\" and promoting the legislation as \\"a step in the right direction\\" due to aiding in ending workplace harassment. Energy and environment Secretary of State John Kerry and Murkowski discuss the effects of Arctic climate change in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 30, 2015 For the 109th Congress, Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group dedicated to environmental causes, gave Murkowski a rating of 2%, noting that in 2006, she voted against S.C. Resolution 83, intended to bolster energy security and lower energy-related environmental impacts, against an amendment to S. 728 that would make the Army Corps of Engineers more accountable for the environmental and economic impacts of their projects, for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for offshore oil and gas drilling. Murkowski is currently the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She has given her support to efforts to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Murkowski believes that recent technological developments have made drilling safer and more economical. In July 2019, Murkowski was one of nine lawmakers to become a founding member of the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus, a group of Republican members of Congress meant to focus on environmental issues with specific priorities including reducing water and ocean plastic pollution, and heightening access to public lands and waters in the United States for outdoor recreation, hunting and fishing. = Legislation = Obama administration  Murkowski introduced a bill that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from limiting the amount of greenhouse gases that major industries can produce. In a statement, Murkowski said, \\"We cannot turn a blind eye to the EPA's efforts to impose back-door climate regulations with no input from Congress.\\" In the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico), Murkowski opposed a bill that would have raised the liability cap for oil spills from $75 million to $10 billion. She said that such a large cap would jeopardize various businesses, and that exposing companies to greater risk would make it impossible for smaller companies to compete. Murkowski has received over $50,000 from BP. In April 2015, Murkowski was a co-sponsor of a bill that directed the federal government to establish both temporary and permanent storage sites for waste stemming from nuclear weapons and energy production and mandate storage sites must have the consent of its respective community. Murkowski said, \\"Nuclear energy is a vital part of America’s energy portfolio and for far too long, the American taxpayer has been on the hook for the federal government’s failure to implement an effective plan to handle the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle.\\" In May 2015, Murkowski unveiled 17 bills that she intended to make up an energy reform package during the 114th United States Congress. The bills ranged from topics that included electricity reliability, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and methane, hydropower or helium production. Murkowski said that not all of the bills would be included in her proposal and that it was not \\"about sending a message, this is about changing the policy, and how can we change the policy is by winning, and in order to win, we have to make sure we have the votes that are there.\\" In February 2016, Murkowski was one of seven senators to offer a bipartisan amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act that would repeal the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) revenue sharing cap and authorize states in the Mid-Atlantic and Alaska receive future offshore energy production revenue. Alaska would receive 37.5 percent of royalties with a total of 12.5 percent of its federal treasury revenues distributed to the new Tribal Resilience Program. In May 2016, Murkowski introduced the Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016, a bill intended to hold foreign companies accountable for the costs of potential oil spills in U.S. waters. Murkowski cited the need for the bill at a time of increasing shipping in the Arctic.  Trump administration  In September 2018, Murkowski was the lead cosponsor of the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, a bill that promoted a \\"robust public-private partnerships among the federal government, leading research institutions and industry innovators\\" and provide a fast neutron source that was both versatile and reactor-based. In December 2018, Murkowski and Democrat Tom Carper introduced the Wood Heaters Emissions Reduction Act, a bill that reduced toxic air pollution in addition to protecting public health and backing an American jobs expansion. The bill also mandated that Indian tribal and rural communities are fairly represented as it pertained to the allocations of funds, Carper saying that the bill \\"ensures communities that rely on wood heaters have access to cleaner, more affordable ones, reduces toxic pollution in the air we all breathe and creates jobs here at home.\\" In March 2019, Murkowski was an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill intended to mandate the Environmental Protection Agency declare per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances that could be addressed with cleanup funds via the EPA Superfund law in addition to forming a requirement that polluters undertake or pay for remediation within a year of the bill being enacted. In May 2019, along with Joe Manchin and Martha McSally, Murkowski introduced the American Mineral Security Act, a bill that would codify current methodology that was used by the United States to list critical minerals and require the aforementioned list to be updated at least once over a period of three years. McSally's office also stated the bill would mandate nationwide resource assessments for every critical mineral. On June 13, 2019, Murkowski, Joe Manchin, Rob Portman, and Cory Gardner introduced the Federal Energy and Water Management Performance Act of 2019, a bill intended to improve federal and energy water performance requirements as they pertained to federal buildings and form a Federal Energy Management Program. The bill also authorized FEMP through fiscal year 2030 and would set goals for energy and water reduction for the following decade. In June 2019, Murkowski was a sponsor of the Financing Our Energy Future Act, legislation that would make \\"biomass; renewable fuels; biorefineries; fuel cells; combined-heat-and-power (CHP); carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS); solar; wind, marine and hydrokinetic energy; energy storage; waste heat-to-power; and energy efficient buildings\\" eligible for master limited partnerships. In March 2020, Murkowski promoted the American Energy Innovation Act as helping \\"Alaskans pioneer new technologies, ranging from renewables to energy storage and even advanced nuclear, to help lower local energy costs\\" and said the bill would \\"protect our cybersecurity, enable Alaska to produce more of the minerals needed for clean technologies, and help us meet the rising threat of climate change.\\" Later that month, the Senate failed to end debate on the American Energy Innovation Act and voted down ending debate on a package of amendments from Murkowski. The HFCs amendment served as the main hold up on the American Energy Innovation Act, with cosponsors John Kennedy and Tom Carper pushing for a vote while it attracted opposition from United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso and the Trump administration. Murkowski told reporters, \\"You have a few individuals who feel that their priority needs to trump everything else that we're doing around here.\\" In May 2020, Murkowski and Republican Jim Risch introduced the Energy Infrastructure Protection Act, legislation that would update provisions in the Federal Power Act and impose restrictions on sensitive energy information's federal disclosures. Murkowski called protecting electric infrastructure a matter of national security and said the bill gave \\"the federal government with additional tools to safeguard the utility industry’s sensitive information\\" while ensuring critical information in utility operations were not exposed. = Public statements = Obama administration  Following a report warning that the Clean Power Plan could hurt the electricity grid of the US in November 2014, Murkowski and Representatives Fred Upton and Ed Whitfield sent a letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Cheryl LaFleur requesting information about any consultation between the FERC and EPA and requested that FERC put together a conference to discuss the environmental regulations: \\"We can’t afford to play a guessing game when it comes to reliability, and we need to be assured that EPA won’t simply leave Americans in the dark.\\" In December 2014, after lawmakers submitted a bipartisan series of long-awaited energy and public lands measures to the National Defense Authorization Act that included provisions to enable mineral development projects and expand a program intended to streamline oil and gas drilling permits, Murkowski said in a statement that they had developed \\"a balanced package that will increase resource production and provide new economic opportunities for western communities.\\" Later that month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced an investigation into potential risks that proposed federal regulations might impose, Murkowski stating that she appreciated the commission's decision and that a national conference and three regional technical conferences were \\"no substitute for EPA’s failure to engage FERC and DOE in a formal, documented process to address the impact on electric reliability of EPA’s series of major rule-makings in recent years.\\" In January 2015, it was announced that President Obama would request Congress impose more protections on the remote wilderness area in the northern reaches of Alaska as to prevent any potential oil or natural gas drilling there. Murkowski lambasted the decision in a statement: \\"What’s coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive. It’s clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory.\\" In February 2015, Murkowski told United States Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell that Jewell had \\"enabled an unprecedented attack on our ability to responsibly bring these resources to market\\" via a budget request by the Interior Department and added that President Obama had \\"withdrawn over 22 million more acres of Alaska from energy production just in recent weeks, and that has occurred on top of many other restrictions and regulations being imposed on us.\\" In July 2015, after an amendment authored by Bernie Sanders to an energy reform bill was rejected by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Murkowski dismissed the amendment as unnecessary due to the resolution approved by the committee earlier in the congressional session along with work done on the same bill: \\"I think everything that we have done along the way is designed to move us towards that cleaner, more efficient, more responsible, greater focus on our environment, while at the same time ensuring a level of affordability and access to all Americans.\\" In November 2015, Murkowski and Representatives Ed Whitfield and Fred Upton sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to requesting an examination of the usage of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), opining that electricity markets, generation technologies and electric grid investments \\"changed substantially since PURPA was enacted nearly 40 years ago as part of President Carter’s energy plan.\\" In January 2016, following an announcement by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that the Alexander Archipelago wolf would not be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, Murkowski said in part, \\"At a time when timber harvesting on Prince of Wales Island is barely a tenth of its levels of two decades ago, the attempt by some environmental groups to list the wolf seemed to be an effort solely to end the last of the remaining timber industry in Southeast Alaska. Fortunately, it did not work.\\" In July 2016, Murkowski was one of seventeen senators to sign a letter to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell asserting that Air Quality Control, Reporting and Compliance, a proposed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) rule, should be withdrawn due to there being no proof offshore energy production impacts onshore air quality: \\"Offshore oil and natural gas production are essential to U.S. energy supply. Rather than hinder this production, the department should seek ways to further our energy security.\\" In August 2016, following the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) releasing a rule that preempts the jurisdiction of Alaska over wildlife management in national wildlife refuges in the state, Murkowski wrote that the FWS \\"has once again decided that it knows what is best for us, and is trampling Alaska’s long-standing right to manage wildlife in refuges\\" and that she was shocked the policies of the Obama administration were \\"pointing to a future where we can fill our freezers with genetically engineered salmon, but not the moose and other game we have traditionally harvested in a sustainable manner from our refuges.\\" In December 2016, after President Obama signed an executive order that designated 112,300 square miles from the Bering Strait to north of Bristol Bay as a \\"climate resilience area\\" following consultations with Native Alaskan tribes that relied on the maritime ecosystem for subsistence living, Murkowski took issue with the \\"climate resilience area\\" term and said that while she strongly backed \\"meaningful consultation with tribes, this opens the door to a whole host of unknowns, and could easily be misapplied to block even the most responsible Arctic subsistence, activities, and development.\\" In December 2016, following President Obama announcing a ban on new oil and gas drilling federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and Canada implementing its own ban in its Arctic waters, Murkowski, fellow Alaska senator Dan Sullivan and Representative Don Young called the announcement \\"an incredibly lopsided trade for the United States\\" and theorized that it may be a few years before the United States \\"is bracketed by activity on both sides and importing the oil resulting from it\\" while noting Russian development underway in the Arctic.  Trump administration  In March 2019, Murkowski and Susan Collins were the only Republican senators to sign a letter to the Trump administration advocating for the inclusion of funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which they credited with helping \\"to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine\\", and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) in the fiscal year 2020 budget proposal. In March 2019, Murkowski and Joe Manchin wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in which they wrote that climate change debate in Congress was depicted as \\"an issue with just two sides — those who support drastic, unattainable measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and those who want to do nothing\\" and affirmed their support \\"to adopting reasonable policies that maintain that edge, build on and accelerate current efforts, and ensure a robust innovation ecosystem.\\" On July 19, 2019, Murkowski delivered a speech to Commonwealth North in Anchorage where she noted that it had been twelve years since Congress passed a full-scale update to federal laws covering energy development, security, reliability and innovation, citing the laws as outdated due to advancements in technology since. In October 2019, Murkowski delivered a speech at the 11th North American Infrastructure Leadership Forum where she expressed frustration in regards to the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Pipeline project being held up in Alaska during a regulatory process and cited the need for the U.S. to maintain its present position as an energy superpower. In October 2019, Murkowski was one of six senators to sign a letter to the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. urging the rescinding of an international nuclear energy financing ban. Murkowski stated that prosperity from energy \\"requires long- term investments and relationships, which ultimately form the basis for any enhancement to our national security\\" and that civil nuclear projects were unattainable \\"without the diplomatic agreements and a substantial government- backed financing.\\" In April 2020, Murkowski sent a letter to United States Secretary of Treasury requesting an assurance that oil and gas companies would receive federal loans provided for businesses in the coronavirus stimulus package: \\"Producing companies and the businesses that contract with them are being impacted not only by the market demand shock from the coronavirus, but also the Russia-Saudi Arabia power struggle against American energy.\\" In May 2020, Murkowski requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and United States Department of the Interior (DOI) unite in the allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 tests for federal wildland fire crews. Murkowski opined that the \\"federal government has a unique responsibility to ensure a sufficient supply chain of PPE and rapid testing for all wildfire crews, in coordination with their state counterpart\\" as a result of the intergovernmental nature of the wildland fire response of the federal government. In June 2020, Murkowski agreed with a strong rebuke of Trump's policies, published in _The Atlantic_ , authored by former Defense Secretary James Mattis'. Mattis criticized the president for dividing the country, and for improperly using his presidential powers. She said the article was \\"true and honest and necessary and overdue.\\" Murkowski also stated that she had reservations about voting for Trump in the 2020 election. In return on twitter, Trump pledged to campaign for Murkowski's opponent, \\"good or bad\\", in 2022. When asked about Trumps' tweet, Murkowski did not walk back her previous comments and said she could not be concerned over a tweet. = Votes = A major supporter of fossil fuels, Murkowski joined most of her Republican colleagues in repealing the Stream Protection Rule, a regulation which prevented coal companies from dumping coal in waterways. In March 2019, Murkowski joined all Senate Republicans, three Democrats, and Angus King in voting against the Green New Deal resolution, a proposal that strove for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the US and the creation of millions of high wage jobs. In her floor speech Murkowski called for reducing domestic and global emissions through the development of clean resources and called for other lawmakers to join her in seeking bipartisan solutions in support of innovation and efficiency: \\"We’ve got to take these policies that can keep us moving to lower emissions, to address the reality of climate change, to do so all the while that we are recognizing that we’ve got an economy that we need to keep strong, that we have vulnerable people that we need to protect, that we have an environment that we all care about—Republicans and Democrats.\\"  National security  Surveillance = In July 2003, Murkowski introduced the Protecting the Rights of Individuals Act, a bill that would limit searches under the USA Patriot Act to the records of individuals who were foreign agents engaged in either acts of espionage or terrorism. In November 2005, along with Democrats Dick Durbin, Russ Feingold, and Ken Salazar and fellow Republicans Larry Craig and John E. Sununu, Murkowski wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees indicating that the six would stop a measure to renew the Patriot Act unless further changes were made. = Veterans = In September 2012, along with Susan Collins, Scott Brown, Olympia Snowe, and Dean Heller, Murkowski was one of five Republicans to waive objections to a Democratic bill that would have given priority to post-9/11 veterans at the time their employment prospects were three points below the national average. Republicans opposed the bill on the grounds that it violated spending limits agreed to in Congress the previous year and it failed to get the 60 votes to go forward with the bill. In May 2014, Murkowski signed on to the Suicide Prevention for America’s Veterans Act, which if enacted would form a reviewing process of discharges related to mental health issues and promote growth in the VA psychiatry ranks through repaying medical school loans. Democratic Senator John Walsh said, \\"It is our duty to come together and fight on behalf of those who fought for us, and Sen. Murkowski’s support will strengthen this bill and send the urgent message that our veterans need care now.\\" In June, Murkowski sent a letter to the VA Office of Inspector General requesting a review of the operational practices of the Wasilla Community Based Outpatient Clinic and an investigation into claims that the Alaska VA Healthcare System in Anchorage used fake appointments in 2008 in order to make waiting times appear shorter. Murkowski's press secretary Matthew Felling said the senator wrote the letter to expedite an investigation after viewing the \\"unraveling in the community morale-wise and frustration-wise\\". In November, Murkowski introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention bill, legislation that would mandate the Pentagon and VA submit an independent review of their suicide prevention programs and form a website that would provide consolidated information on mental health services available to veterans. The bill was named for Clay Hunt, a former Marine who committed suicide in 2011 following seeking treatment for both combat-related depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In March 2018, along with Democratic Senators Tom Udall and Tammy Duckworth, Murkowski introduced the Military Hunger Prevention Act, a bill that altered language in federal law for the purpose of eliminating inconsistencies that prevented service members in need from accessing the federal food assistance programs. Murkowski declared that American military families \\"enough to worry about as they defend our nation’s security.\\" In May, Murkowski introduced S. 2897 with Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rob Portman (R-OH), which made up half of bipartisan legislation that would authorize states can postpone using Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) systems to ensure personal care services were billed correctly in place. Murkowski said the bill \\"ensures that Alaskans have adequate time to thoughtfully develop an effective EVV system based on the input of our family caregivers and stakeholders so patients receive the quality services they need and deserve.\\" In June 2018, when Murkowski announced that the military and veteran affairs budget for federal Fiscal Year 2019 cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee with committee's consent for continued investment in Alaska military installation and programs, Murkowski said, \\"Alaska has the highest veteran population per capita in the country. I remain committed to equipping our veterans with the support they need, including ensuring that Alaska’s VA health facilities are fully staffed and deliver the quality of care veterans deserve.\\" In February 2019, with Democratic Senators Jon Tester and Tammy Duckworth and Representative Chellie Pingree, Murkowski reintroduced the Servicemember and Veterans’ Empowerment and Support Act, legislation that increased the definition of MST to ensure service members and veterans that experienced online sexual harassment would have access to VA counseling and benefits. In April 2019, Murkowski and Democratic Senator Brian Schatz introduced the Compacts of Free Association Veterans Review Act, legislation that would form a pilot program to improve access to care for veterans living in Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. In a news release, Murkowski spoke of the progress made in Alaska \\"to ensure our veterans have access to care, closer to home, and my goal is that we do all we can to ensure all our veterans receive the care they need and deserve.\\" In December 2019, Murkowski and Democratic Senator Chris Coons introduced the Justice for ALS Veterans Act, intended to mandate surviving spouses and families of veterans who die from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis receive needed benefits.  Foreign policy  Murkowski and Mitch McConnell in Afghanistan, 2010 = Cuba = In 2011, members of the Obama administration kept watch over the offshore drilling projects of Cuba out of concern that an oil spill could threaten America’s coast, though they were limited in their surveillance due to the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Murkowski warned against focusing on Cuba, calling it \\"a reality that you’ve got exploration going all around the globe offshore\\" while speaking with reporters: \\"It’s not just Cuba. It’s Mexico; it’s Jamaica; it’s the Bahamas; it’s Canada; it’s Russia; it’s everybody that has water around their nation that is looking to explore and produce. The focus was Cuba. But I’m not going to get hung up on whether we need to now lift the embargoes against Cuba.\\" = Iran = In March 2015, along with Susan Collins, Thad Cochran, Bob Corker, Dan Coats, Jeff Flake, and Lamar Alexander, Murkowski was one of seven Senate Republicans to not sign a letter organized by Tom Cotton to Iranian leaders to inform them that any nuclear deal they reach with the United States would be “nothing more than an executive agreement.” In June, Murkowski released a report where she warned that US oil production would be negatively impacted by more Iranian crude oil and that lifting Iranian sanctions \\"without also lifting the ban on U.S. exports will allow Iran to compete in markets largely inaccessible to American companies.\\" In May 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the Iran nuclear deal. Murkowski supported the move, calling the agreement \\"a fatally flawed deal\\" and wrote that she looked \\"forward to hearing more about the President’s plan to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. Because the thought, let alone the reality, of Iran becoming a nuclear nation remains unacceptable.\\" In January 2020, President Trump ordered a targeted U.S. airstrike on January 2, 2020, which killed Iranian Major General and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, as well as eight other people. Murkowski co-sponsored a resolution by Ted Cruz commending President and the United States Armed Forces and intelligence community for the operation, saying that Soleimani and the Iranian Quds Force were \\"responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members and repeated attacks on American facilities, including the horrible and unacceptable attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that recently took place.\\" Murkowski called the operation's activities \\"significant, decisive and eliminated one of the greatest threats to peace in the region\\" and stated her hopes to find a path toward de-escalation through \\"collaboration and continued briefings with my colleagues, the administration and members of the military community\\". In February 2020, Murkowski was one of eight Senate Republicans to vote for a resolution by Senator Tim Kaine would require Trump to pull any U.S. troops from military hostilities against Iran within 30 day until receiving congressional approval for the military actions. = Russia = In December 2010, Murkowski voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years. In September 2016, Murkowski was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State John Kerry advocating for the United States using \\"all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria that are clearly not in our interest\\" and that there should be clear enforcement by the US of the airstrikes violating \\"a legally binding Security Council Resolution\\". = Yemen = In March 2018, Murkowski voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda. Murkowski voted against the resolution again in December, explaining, \\"The human rights abuses that are taking place in Yemen must stop, and the kingdom must also be put on notice that assassinating journalists will not be blithely dismissed and ignored\\" but added that she would not \\"support a resolution that would have undermined U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East, emboldened Iran and leave our country without immediate recourse should the Houthi rebels attack U.S. defense assets and interests in the region.\\" In March 2019, Murkowski was one of seven Republicans to vote for the resolution withdrawing American forces form Yemen within 30 days unless they were engaging al Qaeda forces. In May 2019, she was also one of seven Republicans voting to override Trump's veto of the previous Yemen resolution. In June 2019, Murkowski was one of seven Republicans to vote to block President Trump's Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, but also voted for the Trump administration's additional 20 arms sales. = Canada = In June 2019, Murkowski was one of eight senators to sign a letter to Premier of British Columbia John Horgan expressing concern over \\"the lack of oversight of Canadian mining projects near multiple transboundary rivers that originate in B.C. and flow into\\" U.S. states Alaska, Idaho, Washington, and Montana. The senators requested British Columbia replicate American efforts to protect watersheds. = Defense = In July 2019, Murkowski was one of sixteen Republican senators to send a letter to Acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin encouraging them to work with them to prevent a continuing resolution \\"for FY 2020 that would delay the implementation of the President’s National Defense Strategy (NDS) and increase costs\\" and that the year long continuing resolution suggested by administration officials would render the Defense Department \\"incapable of increasing readiness, recapitalizing our force, or rationalizing funding to align with the National Defense Strategy (NDS).\\" = Foreign markets = In July 2019, along with Martin Heinrich, Murkowski was one of two senators to introduce the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act, a bill that would further penalties within the United States for trafficking objects held sacred by tribes through an increase in prison time from five to ten years for violating the law twice or more and form a framework for collectors to return protected items to tribes without facing penalties. The bill was part of a bipartisan effort to ban collectors and vendors from exporting Native American ceremonial items to foreign markets. Murkowski stated they were \\"actively preserving the cultural identity and history of our Native populations\\" through both the protection and repatriation of tribal cultural heritage and that returning the items would aid Native communities in healing from cultural oppression. = North Korea = In June 2006, Murkowski called for the United States to focus on North Korea's nuclear weapons program ahead of other issues: \\"While the issues of currency counterfeiting, weapons proliferation, and human rights are all very important, the reality is that without an agreement on the primary source of irritation, there will be no progress on the other issues either.\\" Murkowski warned of growing division among nations involved in multilateral nuclear talks, citing the view of the South Korean and Chinese governments that the counterfeiting issue gave North Korea an excuse to boycott discussions. In March 2017, following recent missile tests conducted by the North Korean military that saw some landed approximately 600 miles off the coast of regional American ally Japan, Murkowski was a cosponsor of a bill by Ted Cruz to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. On June 12, 2018, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held a summit in Singapore, resulting in North Korea affirming its intention \\"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\". In an interview with reporter Peter Zampa, Murkowski said she supported \\"the goal of what was outlined, which is complete denuclearization of North Korea\\" and that in the event there is \\"committed willingness on both sides, really by all the world's partners here, perhaps we can achieve this peace that has alluded us for so many decades.\\" She furthered that the meeting did not \\"condone the atrocities that we have seen from North Korea regarding how they have treated their people\\" but that it did present \\"the opportunity for working towards a goal which we have been talking about, again, for decades.\\" In April 2019, Murkowski was part of a congressional delegation that toured South Korea and Vietnam which included a visit to the Demilitarized Zone and was briefed in South Korea \\"on the recent events happening in the region\\". She asserted that North Korea \\"remains one of the country’s primary security threats.\\" = Saudi Arabia = In March 2020, Murkowski and five other Senate Republicans sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to advocate to Saudi Arabia that the country leave the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries, calling the organization \\"a relic of a cartelized past, one that burdens the Kingdom with free-riders and forces it to shoulder the lion’s share of every production decision.\\" They asserted Saudi Arabia should instead collaborate with the US on international strategic energy infrastructure projects and become \\"a free market energy powerhouse.\\" References Category:Political positions of United States senators ","title":"Political positions of Lisa Murkowski"},{"id":"63981735","text":"The alt= Shashi Tharoor's Oxford Union speech on 28 May 2015 was in favour of the motion, \\"This house believes Britain owes reparations to her former colonies\\". Shashi Tharoor was the seventh speaker on his team and was allotted eight minutes to speak. In the end, Tharoor's side won the debate with 185 votes to 56. Shashi Tharoor in 2016 Once the debates were uploaded onto the official Union YouTube channel on 14 July 2015, Shashi Tharoor's speech went viral, especially in India, where it was widely shared, discussed and attributed. Narendra Modi, at an event in the Parliament of India in July 2015, responded to the debate by saying that \\"what he spoke there reflected the sentiments of the citizens of India\\" and that the debate \\"shows the importance of saying the right thing at the right time\\". The video has over 7 million views on YouTube (as of July 2020) and is Oxford Union's most watched debate speech. Following the response to his speech, Shashi Tharoor wrote a book expanding upon the debate.  Background  The Oxford Union debate in the 'Debating Chamber' was held on 28 May 2015 at 8:30p.m. The motion of the house was, \\"This house believes Britain owes reparations to her former colonies\\", and the premise was The team speaking for the proposition included Jamaican High Commissioner Aloun Ndombet-Assamba, Ghanaian economist Dr George Ayittey and Indian politician Shashi Tharoor. The opposition included British politician Sir Richard Ottaway, British historian John MacKenzie and American historian William Roger Louis. (YouTube) Shashi Tharoor was the seventh speaker on his team and was allotted eight minutes to speak.  Speech  Shashi Tharoor's speech was called \\"witty\\" and \\"passionate\\" among other things. The Time magazine wrote that apart from the insight, it was Tharoor's \\"rapier barbs\\" that got everyone's attention, such as the line \\"No wonder that the sun never set on the British Empire because even God couldn't trust the English in the dark\\". Shashi Tharoor opened up with an analogy to Henry VIII's the last wife: While Tharoor himself did not provide attribution to his speech, some columnists have tried to verify the facts he cited. The speech itself gave insight into the impact of colonial rule on the economy of India, how India contributed to the world wars and how it impacted India, and how the British never cared about the starving in India, directly mentioning Churchill and the Bengal famine as example. Tharoor took the examples of Robert Clive as a colonialist who looted India, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and the mutilation of weavers by the British, and concluded that the infrastructure built by the British in India (such as the railways) was not a \\"gift\\" to India but a means to loot India even more. Shashi Tharoor focused on the principle of owing reparation rather than how much was owed: In the end, Tharoor was on the winning side of the debate, taking 185 votes to 56.  Impact and aftermath  Within a week of the speech, the video became Oxford Union's fifth most-watched YouTube video. The video has over 7.5 million views on YouTube (as of December 2019), and is Oxford Union's most watched debate. It was a trending topic in India for a number of days, being shared on a number of platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp. Rebuttals were being written and published by media houses. A review in India's Livemint commented, \\"Tharoor's speech at Oxford was neither great nor entirely original; however, it was an articulate, well-reasoned, witty and, at times, passionate criticism of the British Raj.\\" An article in The Week backed up a number of statements that Tharoor had made with research from British economists Angus Maddison and Colin Clark, British writer William Digby and American historian Will Durant. WSJ asked over 2000 of their India Real Times readers \\"whether Britain should pay reparations to India and its other former colonies\\" and a large majority said yes. Some Indians around the world showed sudden anger to British colonialism in various articles and social media posts. There were calls for the return of the Kohinoor started by British Indian MP Keith Vaz. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, at an event in the Parliament of India in July 2015, responded to the debate by saying that \\"what he [Tharoor] spoke there reflected the sentiments of the citizens of India\\" and that the debate \\"shows the importance of saying the right thing at the right time\\". The Telegraph also reported on the speech, saying that India's Prime Minister 'endorses the call for reparations'. The headline in The Guardian was \\"Narendra Modi endorses Britain paying damages to India for colonial rule\\", adding that the Prime Minister had praised an \\"opposition MP\\". Modi's praise was rare as he and Tharoor belong to rival parties. Following the response to the speech, Shashi Tharoor transformed the speech into a book, titled An Era of Darkness: the British Empire in India, and later published in the United Kingdom and United States as \\"Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India\\".. (4:40 to 6:20+) Tharoor went on to win a Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Award in 2017 for the book as well as a Sahitya Akademi Award in 2019. In 2016 Tharoor had written in an article that \\"the book is not intended to have any bearing on today's Indo-British relationship. That is now between two sovereign and equal nations, not between an imperial overlord and oppressed subjects.\\"  Opposing perspectives  John MacKenzie, a professor of history, countered Shashi Tharoor in a BBC piece on 28 July 2015. He stated that Tharoor \\"overstated the case\\" and that \\"Britain does not owe reparations to India\\". With regard to the British plundering of India, MacKenzie stated that even before the British came, India was ruled for the benefit of the rulers. He took the example of the famines and deaths during the period of the Mughal Empire, even during the construction of the Taj Mahal. MacKenzie countered various other points put forward by Tharoor in his speech. Jonathan Foreman also wrote a similar statement in his commentary in Politico, \\"Oddly enough you never hear calls for reparations for Moghul rule.\\" Tharoor responded in an interview by noting that \\"the Muslim rulers were unlike the British, because they stayed and assimilated here, married into Indian society and made this country their home[...] The fourth Mughal was seven-eighths of Indian blood[...] whereas the British drained our resources for the benefit of their faraway homeland.\\" During his rebuttal, Sir Richard Ottaway maintained that \\"to ask today’s tax payers to finance reparations to the free citizens of independent states merely assuages at 21st century guilt.\\" British historian Patrick French also countered Tharoor in an article titled \\"Sorry, Shashi Tharoor, but Britain doesn't owe India any reparations\\". He noted that while the speech was \\"witty and entertaining\\", Tharoor's points were built on \\"insecure foundations\\". British politicians like Gordon Brown and more recently Nigel Farage have advised not \\"apologizing for Britain's colonial past and concentrate on delivering a better future\\". William Dalrymple said that the debate was \\"the first time I've ever heard the word reparations ever used\\" between the two countries, but pointed out that it was not an official speech. Dalrymple said that reparations are not the answer, instead urging education of the British on both the good and bad things in their history. He further noted that \\"there's hardly a single reference to the British empire as a whole in the English education curriculum.\\"  See also  * The King and Country debate  References  Further reading  * FULL SPEECH (International Business Times), FULL SPEECH (News18) * Henderson, Barney (2015). \\"India's prime minister endorses call for Britain to pay reparations for colonial rule\\".

Early life  Charles Hoskins was born on 26 March 1851 in the City of London, to John Hoskins, gunsmith, and his wife Wilmot Eliza, née Thompson. He emigrated with his family to Melbourne as a small child in 1853, and all his education occurred in Melbourne. After his father's death, the family moved to Smythesdale, near Ballarat. Hoskins began work as a mail boy, tried his luck on the goldfields, and worked as an assistant an ironmongery store in Bendigo.  Sydney  Agricultural Society Show of 1904. Charles Hoskins joined his elder brother George (1847-1926) in Sydney in 1876, operating a small engineering workshop at Hay Street, Ultimo. Around 1889, they moved to larger premises in Wattle Street, Ultimo and established a foundry, pipe-works and boiler shop. This plant was expanded in 1902. It was pipe manufacturing that would lead to their success. = Innovation and success = Soon after moving to their larger premises, G & C Hoskins began to win major contracts for pipes. A breakthrough came when they began to win contracts for the Sydney water supply mains. This was to provide a steady flow of work through their factory for a number of years. In 1911, G & C Hoskins opened a second facility at Rhodes, to manufacture cast-iron pipes. The Hoskins Brothers were not only efficient; they were also innovative, patenting a number of their ideas for improving pipes and their manufacturing processes. = Free trade and industry protection = The issue of protection against imports was the principal political division of late 19th-century Australia. In New South Wales, almost alone of the Australian colonies, there was widespread support for free trade. A growing force was the Labor Party; it somewhat favoured protection, as a means to maintain relatively high wages, but also advocated nationalisation of major industries, complicating its position. Politically, Hoskins was for Federation, free trade between the Australian colonies, and uniform tariff protection against imports from other countries. The Chamber of Manufacturers of New South Wales had been established in 1885—Hoskins was an early and prominent member—with its primary supporters focusing on lobbying for protection, in direct opposition to the \\"Free Traders\\" led by Sir Henry Parkes and later George Reid. This oppositional approach made little progress, with Free Trade governments holding power in New South Wales, except between 1891 and 1895. In 1895, Charles Hoskins was the first President of a reconstituted Chamber of Manufacturers that aimed to advance industry without partisan political lobbying, an approach that it has followed since that time. Free Traders were not opposed to a local iron and steel industry; their view was that it could come about, without a protective tariff. The N.S.W. Government had offered a large contract for locally made steel rails. A leading Free Trade businessman and politician, Joseph Mitchell won the contract, in 1897, but died before he could build his planned large iron and steel works near Wallerawang. G & C Hoskins also tendered, unsuccessfully. It was an early sign of an interest in entering the iron and steel industry. However, in 1899, when William Sandford attempted to interest Charles Hoskins in buying the Eskbank works at Lithgow, the offer was declined. Charles Hoskins was a Protectionist but also—through lack of other options—a major user of imported iron and steel. After his friend and fellow protectionist, William Sandford, commenced production of pig iron at Lithgow, in May 1907, G & C Hoskins became one of Sandford's major customers.  Interstate expansion  First pipe manufactured by G & C Hoskins in Western Australia for the Coolgardie Water Supply Scheme. The man standing in front of the pipe on the left is Charles Hoskins. (Photographer William D. Dawson). In the 1890s, G & C Hoskins opened a branch in Melbourne to make steel pipes. In 1898, after negotiations, G & C Hoskins and the Melbourne firm Mephan Ferguson shared the contract to manufacture and lay 60,000 lengths of pipe over the 350 miles (563 km) from Perth to Coolgardie, for the water-supply scheme designed by C. Y. O'Connor. This allowed the Hoskins' firm to further increase its technical capabilities in pipe manufacturing, as a result of the collaboration with the leading Melbourne firm and the purchase of their patent rights for New South Wales. Hoskins' share of the contract was worth around £500,000. The contract for the pipeline in Western Australia stipulated that the pipes were to be manufactured in that state, and that all would be to Mephan Ferguson's design using an ingenious 'rivetless' locking bar. The steel for the pipes for the Coolgardie Water Scheme was imported but the Hoskins' share of the pipes were fabricated at a factory that the Hoskins established at Midland Junction, which was reported to employ 200 workers. Ferguson made his share of the pipes at another factory in Perth, reported at the time as 'Falkirk', now Maylands. This major contract allowed the Hoskins' firm to further increase its technical capabilities in pipe manufacturing, as a result of the collaboration with the leading Melbourne firm and the purchase of the rights to use Mephan Ferguson's patents in New South Wales. Hoskins' share of the contract was worth around £500,000. After completion of the pipeline to the Goldfields, the Hoskins established a works, on a block lying between Wellington and Murray Streets in Perth, and won other work associated with the reticulation of water in Western Australia. In November 1923, the company opened a steel pipe plant at South Brisbane.  Lithgow  Taking over from William Sandford = In December 1907, there was a crisis when the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney took over the assets of William Sandford Limited, owners of the Eskbank Ironworks at Lithgow, including its nearly new modern blast furnace. It was Charles Hoskins, one of William Sandford's closest friends, one of his largest customers, one of the few outside shareholders of William Sandford Limited, and a fellow protectionist, who stepped in to acquire the assets and keep the works operating. Charles Hoskins relocated to Lithgow, to manage the works, leaving his brother George to manage the growing pipe manufacturing operations. Ironworks, Lithgow; this part of the plant lay west from the site of the blast furnace. (Taken between 1900 and 1927, State Library of N.S.W.) G & C Hoskins became the owners of the blast furnace, a colliery, coke ovens, steelmaking furnaces, rolling mills, an iron ore mine at Coombing Park near Carcoar, an iron ore lease near Cadia, and 400 acres of freehold land at Lithgow, as well as Sandford's house on his 2000-acre estate, 'Eskroy Park', near Bowenfels. As for the management team, Sandford, his two sons, and their reliable and competent General Manager, William Thornley, were lost to the Hoskins, but most of the line management came over, which was crucial to the Hoskins' subsequent success. William Sandford Limited had been a large enterprise employing over 700 workers. Although notionally a public company, it had been run more like the private company of the Sandford family, who held nearly all the company's shares. Sandford had managed the company in an idiosyncratic manner. Sandford has employed his workers under contracts, with different wage rates in different parts of the works. Upon taking over, the businesslike Hoskins found the account books in a mess. The costs of production were difficult to identify and understand but turned out to be higher than expected. The Lithgow works had been making a loss, which became clear within a year after the take over. = Industrial strife and disputes = Charles Hoskins' views on industrial relations were very different to those of William Sandford. Hoskins had a more belligerent personality, not given to compromise. He was also under pressure to turn around a failing enterprise. As Hoskins prepared to take over the works from Sandford, he made a generous gift to workers facing a bleak Christmas of 1907, following the shutdown of the works. Any initial goodwill did not last, when Hoskins attempted to move from contract arrangements to day labour wages, in 1908, and to lower the overall wage paid to his workers. He closed the works for five weeks in July 1908, ostensibly to carry out repairs, but later was found guilty of deliberately engineering a lock out and fined. Matters came to a climax at the end of August 1911, when during a bitter and sometimes violent company-wide strike—following Hoskins use of strikebreaking 'scab' labour in his coal mine to keep the works operating—Hoskins and his sons, Henry and Cecil, were besieged by rock-throwing workers and his motor car was destroyed by the rioters. The blast furnace was shutdown briefly. Perhaps as a result of the strain he was under, earlier in August 1911, Charles Hoskins had made some ungracious public remarks—about the previous owner, William Sandford, and his management of the Lithgow plant—resulting in a bitter public dispute between the two old friends. By then, both men felt that they had been deceived by the other; Sandford believed that Hoskins had connived in his downfall and besmirched his reputation and Hoskins believed that Sandford had not disclosed that the Lithgow works has been losing money. The two men also had very different views of their workforce; Hoskins had little of Sandford's paternalistic concern for his workers and was more concerned about profits. The strike continued for another nine months—an uneasy industrial peace resulted from a compromise outcome in April 1912—but Hoskins did achieve a wage cut. Lithgow and its coal and ore mines were never to be harmonious workplaces, once Hoskins took over; there were numerous disputes and strikes, right to the end. The same was true of the G & C Hoskins plants in Sydney. Hoskins also took a hard line in commercial relationships. When ore mining ceased in May 1923 at Coombing Park, near Carcoar, the cause was not that the ore was exhausted but because Hoskins would not agree to renew the lease on similar terms to the original agreement.266x266px = Initial expansion and protection = As part of the rescue deal, C & C Hoskins took over Sandford's contract to supply the iron and steel needs of the New South Wales Government, extending its term to nine years from 1 January 1908. Unfortunately for the new owners, apart from the new blast furnace, much of the rest of the plant was antiquated and not ready to supply the Government with its needs, particularly steel rails. The long-sought protection of the iron and steel industry was finally introduced, from the first day of 1909, by Andrew Fisher's Labor government, in the form of bounties to be paid under the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act, which made it a condition that those benefitting from bounties would pay \\"fair and reasonable wages\\". The government paid a bonus of 12s per ton from 1908 to 1914 and 8s per ton thereafter, until 1917, after which the industry would receive no further payments. The Lithgow plant was in urgent need of expansion; the Hoskins brothers had the financial means to do so and experience of operating a heavy industrial enterprise. The new management immediately closed down marginal operations such as the sheet mill and galvanising plant—although these were to be reopened later—and began to renovate and rearrange the existing operations.Teeming steel into ingot moulds, c.1914.Hoskins imported a new rolling mill for rolling heavy sections such as rails. New reheating furnaces were built to suit rail rolling. It would take until 1911 for Lithgow to deliver the first steel rails made in Australia. The works later won a contract to supply rails for the new Trans-Australian Railway. Sandford's plans for Lithgow had provision for up to four blast furnaces. G & C Hoskins quickly built a second blast furnace—with its parts made at Hoskins' own works at Lithgow and Ultimo—which was almost identical to Sandford's, but slightly larger. This new furnace opened in 1913. The company had modernised and upgraded the mine at Carcoar, by mid 1909, and opened a second iron ore mine at Tallawang in 1911. By 1914, the Lithgow plant had been transformed into a viable iron and steel making operation. = First World War = billet in the roughing mill stand on the right.The man on the left is manipulating a rail that has been rolled in the finishing stand. Australia entered the First World War with a small but economically viable iron and steel industry at Lithgow, a fortuitous circumstance because the country could no longer rely upon imports from Europe or America, for the duration of the war. Much of the credit for this belonged to Charles Hoskins. During the war, the Lithgow plant was put to use making special grades of steel unobtainable from Europe. In 1916, it made ferromanganese needed for armaments, using manganese ore from a mine near Grenfell. It supplied the nearby Lithgow Small Arms Factory with steel for weapon manufacture. Charles Hoskins became personally involved in solving problems of wartime production. While the war was in progress, he was building a new branch railway line and an aerial ropeway to open up a new iron ore quarry at Cadia. However, by the time of the war, difficulties associated with the location of his plant at Lithgow had already become apparent to Hoskins, leading him to reconsider its long term future. Consequently, the further expansion of the Lithgow plant effectively ceased by the end of the war. Hoskins had offered to sell the plant to the N.S.W. Government in early 1914 but his offer was not taken up. = Difficulties, vision for the future, and sole control = Iron ore  Cadia iron ore quarry c.1923. - the quarry is on the hill and the aerial ropeway is visible to the to the front and left of centre.. The original decision to site an ironworks at Lithgow in 1875, was based upon the existence of coal and a relatively small iron ore deposit there. After blast furnace operation recommenced at Lithgow in 1907, ore had to be brought from further away, from Coombing Park—near Carcoar—(up to May 1923), Tallawang (from 1911 to Feb. 1927) and Cadia (from 1918). The ore from Carcoar was high in manganese and needed to be blended with other ore for some grades. The Tallawang ore was largely magnetite but the grade was only around 42% iron and the deposit relatively small. The ore from Cadia was hematite with some magnetite but averaging only around 51% iron with a high silica content; the silica content resulted in relatively large amounts of slag, when the ore was smelted, and increased the consumption of limestone flux. New South Wales, although it possessed some widely dispersed smaller deposits of iron ore, was not well-endowed with large deposits. With two blast furnaces in operation at Lithgow, after 1913, not only did Hoskins need to rail his complex iron ores a considerable distance but his ore deposits had a limited life. This last aspect became more critical, once it was discovered that the ore deposit at Cadia—to which Lithgow's future was to be inextricably tied—contained a far lesser quantity of good-quality ore than had been estimated by the Government's geological surveyor. G. & C. Hoskins explored and—in some cases—took out leases on other deposits of iron ore in New South Wales; one was close to the eastern side of the Main Southern Railway between Breadalbane and Cullerin—mined sporadically from 1918, with the ore smelted at Lithgow—and others were near Crookwell , Michelago, Cumnock, Picton, Cudgegong near Mudgee, and even as far from Lithgow as Tabulam. Through Charles Hoskins' commercial intransigence—his unwillingness to renew the lease on the existing terms and conditions—the company lost access to its deposit at Carcoar in 1923, after extracting only about a third of its ore.  Transport  Lithgow was totally dependent upon rail transport. Until 1921, the railway west of Lithgow toward the ore mines was single track. Limestone, for use as smelting flux, needed to be carried from Ben Bullen and Havilah, and later from Excelsior near Cullen Bullen. The cost of rail freight and sensitivity to increases in freight rates were unavoidable disadvantages of Lithgow's inland site and its distance from the ore and limestone quarries. Until 1910, rail traffic from Lithgow to the coast and Sydney was constrained by the Lithgow Zig Zag. Even after the Zig Zag was replaced by the Ten Tunnels Deviation and the line duplicated—including the Glenbrook Deviation (1913)—the distance from the coast and the gradients of the Western railway remained an issue. Although Hoskins sought new sources of ore in other states, it would never be feasible to bring iron ore from a coastal port to Lithgow; in the longer term, the blast furnaces could not remain in operation at Lithgow.  Competition and product quality  With BHP's rival steelmaking operation imminent, the N.S.W. Government ended Hoskins' exclusive contract for supply of iron and steel in 1913, and he claimed £150,000 in compensation. For a time, there was active consideration of the government purchasing the works. However, initially, Lithgow was not badly affected by competition, due to buoyant demand for steel during the First World War and the government bonuses paid until 1917. That began to change once the war ended. The newer and larger BHP works at Newcastle could produce larger quantities of rolled steel products of a higher quality, at a lower cost of production; its seaport location brought access to virtually inexhaustible amounts of very high-grade iron ore from Iron Knob. By the early 1920s, Newcastle had three blast furnaces, each of which was capable of making 50% more pig iron than both of Hoskins' Lithgow blast-furnaces combined. BHP also had vast cash flows from its Broken Hill silver-lead mines and smelters, with which to fund expansion of its steelworks. Hoskins' family-owned enterprises could not match BHP's ability to fund capital works. BHP had access to more modern American technology and employed more professionals; the quality of their steel was higher than Hoskins could make at Lithgow; in 2006 it was stated that, \\"rail produced before 1914 and all Hoskins rail are generally regarded as being of dubious metallurgical composition\\".  Labour  Lithgow always had relatively higher labour costs—a legacy of the industrial relations arrangements of William Sandford—and a relatively strong culture of unionism. Under competitive conditions, labour costs, poor labour relations, and strikes affected the long-term viability of the Lithgow plant. Wage rates at coastal locations were lower and unions perceived as less troublesome there.  Vision for the future and sole control  Charles Hoskins began to see that his works at Lithgow had inherent problems that could not be resolved—even more so, after BHP's Newcastle works became a formidable competitor, from 1915 onward. He began to form a vision for a larger, more modern steelworks on the coast. In 1919, Charles Hoskins bought out his older brother George's share of the company G & C Hoskins, renaming the company Hoskins Iron and Steel Limited in July 1920. George retired, leaving Charles—by then in his late sixties—in sole charge of the destiny of the company.  Plans for Port Kembla  Port Kembla was selected, by the New South Wales Government at the end of 1898 as main port for area and in 1901 construction commenced on two breakwaters to protect two existing coal jetties at the site and to enclose and area of seabed that became the Outer Harbour. In 1908, it first became the site of heavy industry when the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company's plant was opened. The first association of Charles Hoskins with Port Kembla was in 1911, when there was talk of an ironworks at Port Kembla to process Tasmanian iron ore. In 1912, BHP planned to set up a large steelworks at Newcastle to exploit its vast South Australian iron ore deposits. Port Kembla was a site that BHP had considered before deciding upon Newcastle. That left the stage clear for Hoskins to take advantage of Port Kembla's seaport location, amidst the Southern Coalfields renown for their excellent hard coking coal. Charles Hoskins' first step was when G & C Hoskins purchased the Wongawilli colliery at Dapto, in 1916, and established a cokeworks there. Hoskins had secured a source of coal and coke, close to a seaport at which iron ore could be unloaded. At first, the high-quality coke would be railed to Lithgow. However, he soon had more coke making capacity than he needed. Hoskins' approach to industrial relations was no different at Wongawilli and there were numerous strikes there. In late 1920, the company acquired 380 acres of the Wentworth Estate, at Port Kembla, as the site for a steelworks. Also in 1920, Hoskins secured leases over an ore deposit near Mt Heemskirk in Tasmania, and apparently planned to ship the ore via rail to the port of Strahan. At an official event in Wollongong in April 1921, Hoskins spoke openly about his plans for a steelworks on the land that he had purchased at Port Kembla but also about what he wanted from the N.S.W. Government first, a lease for a private wharf at the harbour and a new railway line connecting Port Kembla to the Main Southern line. In July 1923, he announced that a new integrated steelworks would be built at Port Kembla, without at this stage mentioning closing Lithgow; it was stated that Port Kembla was intended for the ‘interstate trade'. Later in 1923, the government announced the building of a rail line to Moss Vale, which would allow limestone flux to be carried from Marulan. The company gained the lease for a private wharf at Port Kembla that would be completed in 1928. Charles Hoskins retired as managing director in 1924, leaving the question of the future of the Lithgow works open. The construction of the new plant at Port Kembla would be for his successor as Chairman, his son Cecil Hoskins. His other son A. Sidney Hoskins would take charge of the Lithgow Steelworks. Together the two sons were co-Managing Directors of the company, which after their father's death would gradually transfer operations from the old works to the new.  Family, homes, and personal life  Although his father had died when he was young, Charles Hoskins was never an orphan, as his obituary would incorrectly state; his mother, Wilmot Eliza Hoskins, lived until 1896. He also had an uncle, William Hoskins, in Australia, as well as two brothers, George John Hoskins (1847-1926)—his business partner—and Thomas, and at least one sister. Charles married Emily Wallis (1861-1928) on 22 December 1881. They raised eight children; sons Henry Guildford (1887-1916), Cecil Harold (Sir Cecil 1889-1971), Arthur Sidney, known as Sid, (1892-1959), and daughters, Florence Maud, later Mrs. F.A. Crago (1882-1973), Wilmot Elsie, later Mrs F.A. Weisener (1884-1964), Hilda Beatrice (1893-1912), Nellie Constance (1894-1914), and Kathleen Gertrude, later Mrs E.C. Mackey (1900-1950). Another daughter, Emily (b.1886), died soon after birth. 'Illyria', the Hoskins' family home at Strathfield until 1908. The family moved often; their choices of housing in Sydney reflected the family's rapidly increasing prosperity. During the 1880s, they lived first at 'Exeter Terrace' on Crystal Street, Petersham, then on Macauley Street, Leichhardt., then at 'Auburn Vale', Granville, and later at 'Waverley' on Croyden Street, Petersham. In the 1890s, they lived first at 'Koorinda' on Albert Street, Strathfield and later at 'Illyria', on The Boulevard, Strathfield. Hoskins built 'Illyria' in the early 1890s. With his typical thrift and practicality, the stone facade of this grand building was obtained from the City Bank building in Pitt Street—built in 1873—which had been gutted by a fire in October 1890. The stonework was dismantled and transported in sections to its new site and re-erected in the same orientation as the original bank building, becoming the facade of a more conventional Italianate mansion. It was at 'Illyria' that Charles was able to indulge his passion for motor cars, buying the second Ford car imported to Australia, in 1904, and a succession of other cars, including a 1908 Clement-Talbot. The garage suite, at the rear of the house, was probably built during Hoskins' time to house his vehicles, making it one of the earliest private garages in Sydney. In 1907, his eldest daughter, Florence, and her new husband were living at 'Mevaina', on Appian Way, Burwood, in an exclusive 'garden city' influenced residential precinct—known as the 'Hoskins Estate'—founded in 1903 by Charles Hoskins' brother, George, who lived at nearby 'St Cloud'. After the takeover of the Lithgow works, in early 1908, Charles and his family moved from Strathfield to Marrangaroo, west of Bowenfels and Lithgow, living in William Sandford's former home, 'Eskroy Park', which was situated on 2000 acres of land. They also spent time at Lawson in the Blue Mountains, having an association with the area that went back well before their move to Lithgow. Later, they were to make their home in the area and contribute to the beautification of its parks and gardens. Charles and Emily lost three of their children, within the space of four years. In 1912, his daughter Hilda drove her car onto the level crossing at 'Eskroy Park' where it was struck by a locomotive. Although she was taken to the house, she died without regaining consciousness. In 1914, his daughter Nellie, who was stricken with tuberculosis, died at Lawson, before the family's new home nearby—built with her recovery in mind—could be completed. Their eldest son, Henry Guildford Hoskins was fatally injured in an acetylene gas explosion, in 1916, while repairing a gas generator, at 'Eskroy Park'. Although moved to a hospital in Sydney, he died. He was 28 when he died and already a significant figure in the company. 'Cadia Park' at Bullaburra, the home of Charles Hoskins from 1914 to 1922. (Unknown photographer, taken c.1927.) The family's home 'Cadia Park', on five acres of land, at Bullaburra, lay close to the boundary of that mountain settlement with Lawson and was completed in 1914. It had eight bedrooms, billiard-room, drawing and dining rooms, three bathrooms, entrance hall, maids' dining room and larder, and kitchen. Separate out-buildings include stables, a garage accommodating six cars, and laundry. The house was sighted so as to have magnificent views over the adjacent valley. Outdoors, 'Cadia Park' had grassed tennis courts, shrubberies, two large swimming baths, one for adults and one for children, and extensive gardens. Hoskins also leased some crown land nearby for use as a private zoo to which he allowed public admission. The Hoskins made 'Cadia Park' their home, until 1922. Charles sold the property in 1923, with the land-holding totalling 42 acres. Charles Hoskins moved, in 1922, to what would be his last home, Ashton in Elizabeth Bay.  Later life and death  After he stepped down as Managing Director of Hoskins Iron and Steel, in 1924. Charles Hoskins had only a short retirement; he was in poor health during that time. He died at his home on 14 February 1926, not living to see the fulfillment of his plans for Port Kembla. He was survived by his wife, Emily, two sons, three daughters and twenty-two grandchildren. His fortune of well in excess of £1,000,000 had been distributed among this large family before he died, and he left a relatively small personal legacy of £12,018. Charles Hoskins' immense fortune had been made in his own lifetime, starting from nothing, aged thirteen. He had been very much a self-made man. His widow Emily died in November 1928, having lived just long enough to light the new blast furnace at Port Kembla in August of the same year. Charles Hoskins' grave lies in the Congregational section of the Rookwood Cemetery; nearby are the graves of his wife and his children, Florence, Hilda, Nellie and Henry.  Legacy  Hoskins Kembla Works in 1936 just after the merger with BHP. Left: open-hearth steelmaking plant and to its right the Administration Building. Centre: rolling mills. Right-rear: blast furnace. The most lasting legacy of Charles Hoskins is the large steelworks at Port Kembla. Although he did not live to see it, his vision and foresight had led to its creation. For many decades, this plant was known as 'Hoskins Kembla Works'; now, no longer known by that name, it is still the site of most of Australia's steel production. Between 1928 and early 1932, some parts of the old Lithgow works were re-erected at Port Kembla but other parts, including the two Lithgow blast furnaces, made the journey to Port Kembla only as scrap iron to be fed into the furnaces of the younger plant. In December 1931, the last steel was rolled at Lithgow. Only very little remains of the Lithgow works today, in what is now the Blast Furnace Park. Hoskins Iron and Steel Limited become a part of Australian Iron and Steel Limited, a new company—also part owned by Dorman Long, Howard Smith Limited, Baldwins and preference shareholders—that was set up in March 1928 to build and operate the new plant at Port Kembla and its associated iron ore, limestone and coal mines. In 1935, a victim of the Great Depression, this company became, via an exchange of ordinary shares, a subsidiary of BHP. Charles Hoskins' sons Cecil and Sidney Hoskins remained managers at Port Kembla and were major shareholders of BHP. Under BHP ownership, the plant was greatly expanded, and outlived the Newcastle works. Following the demerger of BHP's steel interests from the rest of the company, it is now owned by Bluescope Steel. The mansion that Hoskins built in the early 1890s, 'Illyria' at Strathfield, was renamed 'Holyrood' by its next owner—William James Adams, a nephew and an heir of George Adams—and survives to this day. It is heritage listed and better known now as part of Santa Sabina College. Charles's home near Lithgow, 'Eskroy Park'—earlier the home of William Sandford— is now part of the clubhouse of the Lithgow Golf Club. The Hoskins Memorial Presbyterian Church in Lithgow was intended as a memorial to his son Henry Guidford Hoskins and also to commemorate his daughters Hilda and Nellie but it also commemorates Charles, his wife Emily, and two of his grandsons, all of whom died before its opening., Standing on an opposite corner of the intersection of Mort and Bridge Streets from the church, the Charles Hoskins Memorial Institute building—opened in 1927—is now a campus of the Western Sydney University. Charles Hoskins had initiated the Hoskins Trust, in 1919, for charitable purposes, endowing a fund to support the Hoskins Memorial Church. Since 2006, this trust has awarded an annual scholarship, the Hoskins Lithgow Scholarship, for a Lithgow resident to study at a university or other tertiary education institution. Ruins at blast furnace site, Lithgow. Although Hoskins and his family endowed Lithgow with fine buildings, their longer-term legacy there is mixed; the stark and desolate ruin of the blast furnace's blower house stands as a reminder that the closure of the town's main industry—at the height of the Great Depression—and the exodus of skilled managers and workers to Port Kembla—with their families, about 5000 people—was a blow from which the future prospects of the town never recovered fully. A former garden at Lawson, 'Hilda Gardens', was funded by Hoskins and dedicated to the memory of his daughter, Hilda. Sadly, this garden has been subsumed by the growth of the Lawson Bowling Club and no trace of it remains. Hoskins' house, 'Cadia Park', on the Great Western Highway, Bullaburra, was too large to be a practical family residence. 'Cadia Park' was sold several times in the 1920s, before becoming a convent in 1930. It was still a convent when the old building was destroyed by the massive bushfire of December 1977; it was never rebuilt, leaving only an ornamental rotunda made of iron ore, a brick boundary fence, and the overgrown garden beds, pathways and terraces of Hoskins' extensive gardens.

It is the one of the area's most popular fishing lakes due to its productivity and convenience to the main highway State Route 260. The lake is in Apache County. As the lake is on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, permits must be acquired in nearby Hon-Dah for all activities at the lake including fishing, camping and hiking.  Location  Horseshoe Cienega Lake sits at 8,100 feet (2,500 m) on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The lake turnoff is approximately 20 miles (32 km) from Pinetop-Lakeside in the west and approximately 25 miles (40 km) from Eagar to the east. The main parking area and boat launch are about a mile (1.6 km) south of State Route 260, and are accessed by a well-maintained dirt road. Unlike many of the high-altitude White Mountain lakes, Horseshoe Cienega Lake is accessible year-round. Ice fishing is possible when the lake freezes over, typically from late-November until mid-April . The average high temperature at the lake in January is compared to an average high of in July while the average low temperature in January is compared to average low of in July.  Description  The lake was created by damming Horseshoe Creek in the early 1960s. It has a 120 acre (49 ha) surface area, with an average depth of 30 ft (9.1 m). The lake was briefly drained in the winter of 1990-91. The forest surrounding the south shore of the lake contains around 70 primitive campsites with numerous pit toilets, picnic tables and potable water faucets. A convenience store that sold permits, groceries, bait and rental boats was consistently open from Memorial Day to Labor Day as recently as the 1990s; the store now appears to open only sporadically, and it is unclear whether it has been abandoned altogether. The lake also once held the distinction of having produced the state record brown trout of 16 pounds, 7 ounces and nearly 30 inches long; this record was broken in 1999 by a brown trout caught in Reservation Lake .

The right to be tried within reasonable time was, in Williamson's case, delayed nearly three years between the laying of charges and the end of trial. The justices weighed whether the accused’s right to be tried within reasonable time under s. 11(b) of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed, and found a new framework for determining s. 11(b) infringement. The Court used the ratio decidendi of R v Jordan (2016). Background The case involved the sexual abuse of a minor (Ruttan) at the hands of a Queen's University student (Williamson) who was given authority over him by the judiciary in Kingston. In the summer of 2017, Ruttan obtained permission from the Court for The Globe and Mail to disclose his name. At the age of 12, Ruttan began skipping school and stealing money from his mother. The Children’s Aid Society intervened, and Ruttan ended up in Kingston child-protection court. In 1979, a judge found his mother unable to care for him and ordered Ruttan to accept a mentor, Williamson, who was a 26-year-old student working towards a Bachelor of Education degree at the University. Williamson met Ruttan through a juvenile diversion program designed to place boys with positive male role models. With his Court- sanctioned influence in hand, Williamson proceeded repeatedly and lengthily to bugger Ruttan, sometimes at his dormitory room on University grounds.

The episode was written by Alec Berg and directed by series co-creator Mike Judge, and originally aired on HBO on June 1, 2014. Berg received a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards for writing the episode. Plot In the aftermath of the previous episode, TechCrunch informs the Pied Piper team that Dan Melcher has been banned from judging at Disrupt, fired from his job at Oracle, and that his wife has left him. Desperate to avoid litigation as a result of Melcher's assault of Erlich (T.J. Miller), the head of Disrupt offers Pied Piper a ticket straight to the final round, where they will compete for the grand prize. However, the team soon witnesses Gavin Belson's (Matt Ross) presentation of Nucleus, which reveals additional optimal features as well as a Weissman score of 2.89, the same as Pied Piper's. The presentation leaves Richard (Thomas Middleditch) and the rest of the Pied Piper team despondent. Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) contemplates about leaving Pied Piper while Jared (Zach Woods) attempts to pitch the company to people outside of the conference, only to be arrested by the police in an incident involving Adderall. Monica (Amanda Crew) tells Richard that she has been called back to Palo Alto as a result of Belson's presentation, and offers to have a drink with him afterward. At night, retrieved to their hotel rooms, the Pied Piper team remains pessimistic about the presentation. But Erlich proclaims that he will go as far as giving every man in the conference room handjobs just for the team to win. This results in the team mocking up a mathematical model for Erlich's claim, and Richard has an epiphany about Pied Piper. He spends the night revamping Pied Piper's platform and keeps only the compression engine. In the morning, he reveals the changes to the group and asks to present; Monica heads back to San Francisco to watch the team. As Richard presents, he reveals that because Pied Piper cannot match Nucleus in terms of features, he has revamped the platform and achieved a Weissman score of 3.8. The crowd gasps in response and one of the Disrupt judges hands Richard a file to compress: a 132 GB 3D video file, which Pied Piper had difficulty compressing. Richard runs the file, and it compresses into half of its initial file size. Richard initially thought the file was wrongfully compressed, but a Weissman test reveals a record-breaking 5.2 Weissman score, doubling the best score on record. The crowd cheers and Belson walks out in humiliation, Pied Piper is awarded the Disrupt cup and $50,000 in prize money. Afterward, the Pied Piper team is greeted by reporters and interested potential investors. Monica congratulates Richard and tells him that because of increasing business interests, things will only get harder. Overwhelmed, Richard rushes out of the back door and throws up into a dumpster. Reception Les Chappell of The A.V. Club give the episode an A- rating, saying the episode \\"finds a way to be simultaneously crude and technical in a way that encapsulates the full energy of the show\\". Clifford Wheatley, in a review for IGN, calls the episode \\"a phenomenal and hilarious finale to a very strong first seasons of Silicon Valley, leaving the characters in a more interesting place than it found them with lots of potential ahead\\". Alec Berg was nominated for an Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards for writing the episode at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards.

In: Einsicht 21 (1991) pag. 89-98. When the reforms of the Second Vatican Council came to his Mexican parish in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he refused to conform. Influenced by his friend, Fr. Joaquin Saenz Arriaga (who came to the conclusion that the Second Vatican Council had established a new religion and that Paul VI was a false pope), Carmona came to embrace Fr. Saenz's ideas, and was excommunicated and removed from his post as pastor of Divine Providence parish by Rafael Bello Ruiz, the bishop of Acapulco, on April 30, 1977. With the support of his 2,000 parishioners and due to Mexican law, Father Carmona was able to keep his parish church despite his excommunication. Carmona, along with Fathers Joaquin Saenz Arriaga and Adolfo Zamora, formed the Union Catolica Trento. On October 17, 1981, Fathers Carmona and Zamora were consecrated bishop by the sedevacantist Vietnamese traditionalist Roman Catholic bishop Ngô Đình Thục in Toulon, France.

Names  Wisutthithewi's name is variously romanized Visuddhidevi, Wisutthi Thewi, and Wisuthithewi. While the Chiang Mai Chronicle consistently records her name as Wisutthathewi, the Yonok Chronicle prefers Wisutthithewi. She also has a number of names across extant historical sources: in the Burmese and Chiang Saen chronicles, she is referred to as Lady Wisutthathewi, and is also called Maha Dewi (မဟာဒေဝီ, ) in U Kala's chronicle, Maha Yazawin, and as Ratcha Thewi () and Nang Thewi in other sources.  Early life  Wisutthithewi's origins are unclear; she may have been a daughter of Ket Chettharat, a ruler of Chiang Mai, or Princess Ton Kham, the youngest daughter of Chettharat. She may have been the queen consort of her predecessor Mekuti.  Reign  The reign of her predecessor, Mekuti, saw Lan Na transition into a vassal state of the Toungoo empire. In 1564, she was installed as queen regent by Bayinnaung, in response to Mekuti's refusal to join Bayinnaung's military campaign against Ayutthaya, which was seen by Bayinnaung as an act of rebellion. Throughout her fourteen- year reign, Lan Na enjoyed political stability, and Wisutthithewi offered tribute to the Toungoo empire, in exchange for political stability in her dominion, which had seen recurrent instability from raids and conflicts with neighboring territories. Wisutthithewi is portrayed in a contemporaneous Thai epic poem Khlong mangthra rop Chiang Mai (โคลงมังทรารบเชียงใหม่, lit. the \\"Epic of Mintaya's war against Chiang Mai\\"), written by an anonymous Lan Na author. The poem mentions a queen, Mae Mintaya Sri, which implies that she may have been wed to Bayinnaung. However, no other Burmese or Lan Na sources corroborate any marriage between Bayinnaung and Wisutthithewi; moreover, no Chiang Mai princess is listed among Bayinnaung's queens and concubines in these sources.  Death  Wisutthithewi died in October 1578, and news of her death reached Pegu in January 1579. Following her death, Bayinnaung appointed his son Nawrahta Minsaw as her successor. The ashes of Wisutthithewi are interred in a chedi at Wat Lok Moli in Chiang Mai.

Biography His artistic education began in the studios of Mariano Fortuny, a Spanish painter who lived in Rome during the 1870s. Shortly after completing his studies there, in 1878, aged twenty-five, he moved to France, where he would remain for the rest of his life. There, he continued his studies and began holding exhibits at the Salon; receiving a bronze medal in 1889. As his reputation grew, he exhibited in Munich and Berlin as well, where he developed a sizeable following. He specialized in historical period pieces, largely scenes from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, designed for the tastes of the petit-bourgeoise. His favorite subjects were the cavaliers, troubadours and courtiers of the 18th century, dramatically re-imagined with richly colored clothes and fine fabrics.

Edward Day Cohota (~1843–1935) was an ethnic Chinese soldier who fought in the American Civil War for the Union Army, and served thirty years of active service. Despite this, Edward was never granted US citizenship. Early Life Edward Day Cohota's exact date of birth is unknown with many conflicting reports-- presumably he was born around 1843 most likely in Shanghai. https://sites.google.com/site/accsacw/Home/cohota The earliest account of Edward was on December 27, 1845 when Captain Sialas left Shanghai, China.https://weservedtoo.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/1st-known-civil- war-soldier-of-asian-heritage-in-va-history-edward-day-cohota/ On his ship named the Cohota, he found two starved ragged Chinese boys. They were two brothers--one a few years older than the other. Both were near the brink of death. The Captain instead of turning back kept them onboard. The older boy died, but the younger survived the voyage. The Captains decided to raise the survivor himself naming him Edward Day Cohota, and December 27 would be his chosen birthday. Edward grew up with the Captain at his home in Gloucester, Massachusetts and with his family who Cohota had a close relationship with for the rest of his life.https://www.mccunn.com/Civil-War.pdf There he went to school and was trained in the ways of a sailor. Time as a soldier On May 16, 1864, Cohota enlisted with the 23rd Massachusetts Infantry of the Potomac Army.https://sites.google.com/site/accsacw/Home/cohota He saw action in many battles and skirmishes including Drury's Bluff where reportedly seven bullet holes went through his clothes but none injured him.https://www.mccunn.com/Civil-War.pdf At Cold Harbor, a bullet grazed his head which left a permanent part in his hair. Cohota was an energetic soldier, and fought bravely and well relishing in combat. With the war concluded, Cohota was discharged and worked as a sailor for a year until reenlisting in the fall of 1866, unwilling to part with a soldier's life.https://www.mccunn.com/Civil-War.pdf Cohota would spend the next 30 years mostly in the West as a private serving in Company C and H of the 15th Infantry, and was well respected by his fellow troops and officers. He was stationed in Texas, New Mexico, Fort Sheridan, Illinois, Fort Randall, and Fort Niobrara, and fought in numerous battles of the American Indian Wars. In 1883, Cohota married Anna Halstensen, a Norwegian woman, at Fort Randall.https://sites.google.com/site/accsacw/Home/cohota There too, he reportedly guarded perhaps the greatest Indian chief resistance fighter, Sitting Bull. Later life Cohota would retire from the army in August 1895 settling down with his wife and kids in Valentine, Nebraska. Cohota and Anna had six children: Lucy, Edward, Elizabeth, Willian, Daisy, and Miles, who died in infancy.https://www.mccunn.com/Civil-War.pdf The rest of the children lived well into adulthood. Cohota worked as a baker and ran a livery barn business for a number of years. His wife Anna died in 1898 from illness. Later, Cohota opened one or two restaurants in Valentine, and was well-respected in town. Cohota last great battle was with the Federal Government. Though fighting to preserve it in the Civil War and continued as one of its soldier for over thirty years, Cohota was ironically never a citizen of the US. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 made it legally impossible. Cohota had always assumed he was a citizen. In fact, he never missed an election to vote in his public citizen life, and was dismayed when he was informed he was not a citizen in 1912 around age 69. Unable to stand aside, Cohota went before to Congress and to the courts fighting hard until his death even getting the support of Senator Brown, but ended to no avail. Cohota did receive a veteran's pension at least, and showed no ill will against his country that denied him citizenship.https://sites.google.com/site/accsacw/Home/cohota In 1917, Cohota retired to a sanitarium for veterans in South Dakota. Still very energetic, he loved to drive and cook for his family. He died on November 18, 1935.https://www.mccunn.com/Civil-War.pdf His granddaughter recalls him dying on the front porch of the family home at Parmelee South Dakota, and was later buried with his wife in Valentine.

He first appeared in the eleventh episode of series thirty-two, which was broadcast on 4 November 2017. Rash is introduced into the series as a junior doctor undergoing his first year of the Foundation Programme. Rash is characterised as a shy and bashful doctor; he is an eternal optimist who tries to make others laugh. Casualty's series producer Lucy Raffety billed Rash as an \\"innocent, cautious and nice\\" character. Mohan took a temporary break from the show in 2019 and upon his return writers introduced a more assertive version of the character, with his \\"innocence jaded\\". Writers created a relationship story for Rash and hospital porter Gemma Dean (Rebecca Ryan). Their romance is made difficult due to Rash's shy persona. Producers decided to focus an entire series of Casualty highlighting the pressure the NHS workforce endure. Rash's role in the saga explored hospital hierarchy and how junior doctors are burdened with pressure. The story incorpoarated a feud with his mentor and consultant Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). Rash also spars with F1 Mason Reede (Victor Oshin), but his subsequent death at work has a negative effect on Rash. Other stories include Mohan participating in a car stunt and dealing with grief following the death of his mother, Madia Masum (Buckso Dhillon-Woolley). For his portrayal of Rash, Mohan was nominated for a \\"Best Newcomer\\" award at the 2019 National Television Awards. Casting Mohan successfully auditioned for the role of Rash but had recently relocated to London with his partner. Mohan still accepted the role, opting to commute to Cardiff where Casualty is filmed. Mohan's casting was first publicised by Elaine Reilly of What's on TV and the character was previewed in the show's Autumn 2017 trailer. Mohan made his first on-screen appearance as Rash in episode 11 of series 32, which was broadcast on 4 November 2017. DevelopmentCharacterisation and introduction= Rash is characterised as an \\"eternal optimist\\" and \\"cheeky\\" doctor who tries to bring laughter to the emergency ward. He is portrayed as possessing a \\"charming bedside manner\\" which builds a good rapport with patients. Sometimes Rash lacks confidence in his own ability and his \\"cheerful outlook\\" masks his work place anxiety. In scenes Rash has been shown to have \\"a nervous disposition\\" but always present is his motivation to succeed in the medical business. Rash is from a working class background and his family of \\"high flyers\\" value education greatly. Rash is an intellectual and is not \\"street smart\\". When he is introduced into the series, Rash is living at home and looked after by his mother, making him appear as a \\"mummy's boy\\". One reason Rash chooses to work at Holby City hospital is to reinvent himself and lose his \\"boyish charm\\". Casualty's series producer Lucy Raffety revealed that Rash would be a \\"innocent, cautious and nice\\" character. When he is first introduced, Rash has a \\"preppy look and glasses\\" which were reminiscent of the style portrayed by established character Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). What's on TV's Reilly opined that Rash had \\"the look of a young Ethan Hardy\\" and Rainsford told the journalist that \\"a couple of people have mentioned that Rash looks potentially like an Ethan-in-the-making in a bookish, bespectacled way.\\" Upon his arrival, Rash is allocated a mentor, Lily Chao (Crystal Yu). Rash is a junior doctor undergoing his first year of the Foundation Programme. Producer Raffety told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that Rash would find a friend in nurse David Hide (Jason Durr), who \\"takes him under his wing which is lovely.\\" Mohan liked working with Durr, who he believed had really \\"took him under his wing\\" just like the story with their characters. Rash fails to make a positive impression with his colleagues because of his unwillingness to work in resus. When he has to take part in a gory case, Rash vomits in the toilets. He then tries to overcome his fears and treat more patients. =Relationship with Gemma Dean= Producers created Rash's first relationship story with hospital porter Gemma Dean (Rebecca Ryan). The story begins when Rash is determined to prove himself is the resus ward, after doctor Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) asks him to treat a dangerous patient, Jack MacLellan (Sam Hudson). Rash tries to be confident and control the situation but Jack escapes and takes Gem hostage. Mohan told What's on TV's Reilly that \\"Rash has his confidence challenged by prisoner Jack.\\" When Jack takes Gem hostage, Mohan believed Rash's entire demeanour changed and he \\"kicks into fight or flight mode\\". Jack drags Gem out of the hospital, bundles her into a stolen car and tries to flee. In order to save Gem, he added that Rash \\"dives on the bonnet of the car\\". The story was the first stunt Mohan filmed in Casualty. To make it seem authentic, Mohan was tied down to the bonnet of the car. When the driver put the vehicle in motion the actor was swung to either side of the bonnet. In the following episode, Gem arrives at the work with a new hair style. Rash realises he is attracted to Gem and likes her more after saving her from danger. Rash's feelings for Gem continue to grow and writers used his shy and bashful characterisation to make awkward scenarios. Mohan told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that \\"Rash is out of his depth when he's talking to women anyway, but when he's got a crush on someone, it just spirals out of control!\\" Rash wants to tell Gem how he feels but opts to remain quiet on a number of occasions. When he witnesses Gem talking to another man, he decides to ask her out for lunch. She accepts but clinical lead Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) orders Rash to carry out medical research. Rash leaves Gem waiting and he cancels their date. When Gem discovers that he was working she is not impressed. Mohan explained that the pair's romance would be a \\"slow burn\\" which would \\"be worth it in the end\\". In another scenario, Rash and Gem have a date which is ruined by Rash vomiting. After this Rash considers taking Jamila Vani (Sujaya Dasgupta) to a ball, but their colleagues sabotage his plans. Rash explains to Gem that he nervously threw up because he had never had sex before and they reconcile. Rash and Gem are portrayed with quite contrasting personalities. Mohan believed that the pair were compatible despite being \\"such opposites\\". They have opposite personalities and different upbringings but Rash finds this \\"intriguing\\". He added that Rash \\"really fancies\\" Gem and that is why Rash struggles to impress her. When Gem's brother, Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), attempts to commit suicide, Rash tries to support her through the ordeal. Gem behaves out of character and does not appreciate Rash's efforts to help. Ryan told Inside Soap's Alice Penwill that \\"it's hard for Rash, as he wants to be there for Gem, although she's very stubborn.\\" The actress explained that Gem wants Rash to look after her but she \\"pulls away\\". He can only offer words of sympathy and that \\"irritates\\" her. Regardless of their problems, Ryan thought that Rash and Gem had a good future together. She added that they \\"have had a lot of ups and downs, but Gem's very content and she's happy with him.\\" =Temporary departure and return= In 2019, Mohan took a break from Casualty. In his exit story, which was broadcast in April 2019, Rash and Gem had agreed to go travelling. They postpone their plans after Gemma's brother Iain attempts to commit suicide. They later decide to resume their plans and he books tickets to travel to Vietnam. Rash's mother, Madia Masum (Buckso Dhillon-Woolley), discovers the tickets and suffers an angina attack. When she is admitted to the ED, she tells Rash that she found the tickets. Rash tells Madia that he wants to travel prior to resuming the second phase of his medical career. Gem convinces Rash to leave without her and to stop relying on his mother so much. The story ended with Rash leaving alone to go travelling. Mohan's departure was not publicised prior to the broadcast and this lead viewers to believe the character had left permanently. Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy reported that Mohan had taken a break from the series. She added that he was already back filming with the show. A publicist for the drama series announced Rash would return in August 2019. Details about his return were under a press embargo. Dainty stated that Rash and Gem's relationship was in doubt. Gem begins to miss Rash and decides to quit her job and join him travelling. After the episode aired, it was confirmed that Ryan had left the series and the scenes were her departure story. This signalled the end Rash and Gem's relationship with Rash's imminent return. Mohan believed that Rash and Gem's relationship ending off-screen felt \\"unresolved\\". The character returns in the opening episode of the following series. It is revealed that Madia had died and he returns for her funeral. When Rash hears of an emergency he decides to return to work and leaves his father, Ashok Masum (Kriss Dosanjh), to grieve alone. After he returns the clinical lead Dylan Keogh (William Beck) offers Rash a full time position in the ED. Rash returns to work intent on \\"finding his position within the hospital\\" and \\"finding his assertiveness\\". Madia's death had a negative affect on Rash's well being and this soon becomes apparent in scenes. Mohan explained that it is \\"absolutely heart-breaking\\" for Rash and he finds it hard to support his father through their grief. Mohan later assessed that Rash had evolved from the \\"fresh and green\\" character that first appeared in Casualty. Rash's \\"innocence is slightly jaded now\\" and because he had endured \\"so many difficult and heart-breaking things.\\" =Hospital hierarchy= Writers decided to focus an entire series portraying the NHS under pressure. Rash featured heavily in a story which explored the dynamics of hospital hierarchy. It shows the effects of a clinical lead off-loading work onto consultants, such as Ethan. In turn, Ethan passes his duties onto junior doctors, including Rash and Mason Reede (Victor Oshin). Ethan is supposed to be their mentor offering support but he is preoccupied and suffering from Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Rainsford branded it a \\"big storyline\\" focusing the \\"true reflection\\" of NHS staff \\"struggling under the weight of their responsibilities.\\" Rash and Mason are often put to work together on the ward, but Mason refuses to cooperate with Rash and they are often depicted at odd with each other. Oshin told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Mason received a negative reaction from Casualty viewers because Rash is well liked. He believed his character needed to \\"relax\\", \\"listen\\" and realise that being on a team of medics is a \\"collaborative effort\\". Dylan continues to struggle in his role and Ethan prepares for a hospital inspection and passes his work onto Rash. At this point Rash is already overworked; Mohan told Reilly (What's on TV) that Rash is \\"willing to take on all this extra pressure.\\" He thought that the \\"chain of command\\" was prevalent and \\"all going downwards\\". Rash keeps accepting more work to complete his fellowship and tries \\"his absolute best\\". When two patients are admitted to the ED, Rash prioritises the care of the more visibly wounded. The other patient suddenly becomes critically ill and Rash gets the blame. The actor explained that Ethan accuses Rash of negligence and launches a verbal attack about his family problems. When Ethan mentions Rash's grief over his mother's death, he punches Ethan in the face. Mohan justified Rash hitting his superior, adding that \\"Rash is being made a scapegoat. He's dealing with so many difficult things, and it's really hard for him.\\" Rash and Ethan both struggling with work and personal issues creates \\"the perfect storm\\". Rainsford found the story difficult to film because he knew Ethan was \\"being hypocritical\\" and \\"acting out of character\\" towards Rash. He added that he tried not to judge the characters and made sense of the story's context. Producers incorporated the surprise death of Mason into Rash's story. The scenes were not publicised prior to broadcast and featured Rash finding Mason dead in a storeroom. The scenes highlighted how the pressurised working environment left Rash not knowing much about his work colleague. Rash finds Mason's death difficult but tries to continue working. He also comes to the realisation that, like himself, Mason was just trying to do the best job possible. Ethan buckles under the pressure and decides to take a leave of absence following Mason's death. His decision further damages his working relationship with Rash. Rainsford explained that Ethan's departure was poorly timed and he thought that Ethan should have stayed to help his colleagues and resolve his issues with Rash. Writers continued to explore the idea that \\"everybody in the NHS is under pressure.\\" When Ethan returns he tries to support Rash, but he rebuffs Ethan's gestures. Their working relationship becomes volatile and Rash behaves out of character. Rash ignores Ethan and in one scene argues with him in front of patients. Rainsford believed that Rash and Ethan were quite similar characters and therefore clash. He acknowledged that there was a \\"lot of bad blood between them\\" and only \\"some self- reflection and also some honesty\\" could resolve their differences. Writers later gave reconciled the pair after they are forced to treat a patient together. Ethan acknowledges that he should have better supported Rash through the ordeal. Reception For his portrayal of Rash, Mohan was nominated in the \\"Newcomer\\" category at the 2019 National Television Awards. Sophie Blackman of the Daily Star commented that viewers were left \\"gasping\\" at the \\"unexpected violence\\" that occurred between Rash and Ethan. Katabella Roberts from the newspaper stated that \\"Casualty viewers were more than a little shocked after Rash decided to follow his dreams and move to Vietnam.\\" Digital Spy's Dainty opined that viewers were \\"sad\\" to see Rash leave and say a \\"bittersweet\\" good-bye to Gem. Jenni McKnight from What's on TV stated that fans were \\"distraught\\" and \\"left in shock\\" over Rash's departure. Joe Julians from Radio Times wrote that Rash is \\"quite the charmer, something that comes in handy at work when it comes to having a good bedside manner.\\" Sarah Ellis (Inside Soap) branded Rash a \\"shy\\" and \\"jumpy F1\\", adding that he is a \\"hot doctor\\". What's on TV's Reilly said that Rash made a \\"bad impression\\" on his colleagues for throwing up at work. She believed Rash was an unlikely hero for saving Gem's life, adding \\"think of a hero and Casualty's Rash Masum doesn't exactly spring to mind.\\" Rash and Gem's slow developed romance frustrated Sue Haasler from Metro. She said that she wanted to \\"shove them into a store room and make them actually talk to each other.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Casualty (TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Rash Masum"},{"id":"63982542","text":"Bende Velin (born 5 September 1934) is a Danish diver.

With factories and workplaces shut down due to the lockdown imposed in the country, millions of migrant workers had to deal with the loss of income, food shortages and uncertainty about their future. Following this, many of them and their families went hungry. Thousands of them then began walking back home, with no means of transport due to the lockdown. In response, the Central and State Governments took various measures to help them, and later arranged transport for them. More than 300 migrant workers died due to the lockdown, with reasons ranging from starvation, suicides, exhaustion, road and rail accidents, police brutality and denial of timely medical care. Background There are an estimated 139 million migrants in the country, according to the World Economic Forum. The International Labour Organization (ILO) predicted that due to the pandemic and the lockdown, about 400 million workers would be poverty-stricken. Most migrants in the country originate from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, followed by Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The cities of Mumbai and Delhi attract the highest number of migrants. While most men migrate for work, women migrate due to marriage. Migrant workers majorly comprise of daily-wage labourers working in the manufacturing and construction industries. They are often denied adequate healthcare, nutrition, housing and sanitation, since many of them work in the informal sector. They are mostly from rural areas but live in cities for work for most of the year. Many have no savings and lived in factory dormitories, which were shut due to the lockdown. Additionally, there was no central registry of migrant workers, despite the existence of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979. According to research published in the Royal Geographical Society, the workers who have been treated the worst are from areas like Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, in which the indigenous population's natural resources were extracted by outsiders. Further, workers paid the least for the hardest work belong to the backward classes, mainly from the Dalit and the Adivasi communities. The research also indicated that the families of the migrant workers supported them by maintaining their houses and taking care of them, either when seasonal work is unavailable or when they are no longer able to work. Maharashtra has the largest number of migrants, according to the 2011 Census of India. Its state government imposed a lockdown on 20 March in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Nagpur, leaving the migrant workers with no work. Thousands then gathered at the train termini and bus stations, seeking transport to their hometowns. With the nationwide lockdown, all transport facilities were closed. Food shortages Migrant workers stand in a queue for food at a Delhi Government school during COVID-19 lockdown at Delhi According to government reports, there was enough food grain stocked up in the FCI godowns to feed the poor for at least a year-and-a-half. While government schemes ensured that the poor would get additional rations due to the lockdown, the distribution system failed to be effective as the ration cards are area-specific and fair price shops were largely inaccessible. Additionally, the 'One Nation, One Ration Card' system has been implemented in very few states, as of mid April. While the scheme allowed migrant workers to retrieve foodgrains for free anywhere across the country, very few were aware of the scheme. In addition to this, the scheme also required biometric authentication, which was discontinued due to fears of spreading the virus through common fingerprint sensors. In Telangana, many could not avail of the ration due to a lack of Aadhaar cards. As such, many were left without food and money due to the lockdown. A survey published by ‘The Hindu’ states that 96% migrant workers did not get rations from the government, and 90% of them did not receive wages during the lockdown. Exodus With no work and no money, and lockdown restrictions putting a stop to public transport, thousands of migrant workers were seen walking or bicycling hundreds of kilometres (or even more than a thousand kilometres) to go back to their native villages, some with their families. Many did so while hungry. Social distancing was not possible for these migrants since they travelled together in large groups. According to some of them, they would rather die from the virus at their own village than starve because of no work in the city. Many were arrested for violating the lockdown, after being caught at inter-state borders, forests between states and even on boats to cross rivers. Some of the migrants died of exhaustion. Others died in accidents on the roads after walking or hiding in vehicles. On 31 March, as many as 120 migrant workers were allegedly beaten up by the police in Gujarat and forcefully rounded up in a single lorry and dropped in Maharashtra, despite being wounded. In Aurangabad, 16 migrants were killed on 8 May after a freight train ran over them while they were sleeping on the tracks, exhausted from walking. 26 migrants were killed in an accident between two trucks carrying migrants in Auraiya on 16 May. Later in May, a 15-year-old girl carried her ailing father on a bicycle for from Bihar to Gurugram over the course of a week. She was later approached to try out for the National Cycling Academy by the Cycling Federation of India, and received praise from Ivanka Trump. Later in May, despite the launching of special trains and buses by the government, the migrant workers chose to either travel together in large groups in the cargo compartments of trucks and containers, or travel by foot. They did not wait or their turn to board the government- arranged transport, mainly due to starvation. Additionally, they felt that going back to their hometowns, they could return to farming and take up small jobs under the MGNREGA. The consumption of mobile and broadband data under BharatNet more than doubled in rural areas. Reverse exodus Despite government promises and schemes to generate employment in rural areas, some migrant workers began going back to the cities due to lack of employment in their hometowns, as lockdown restrictions were reduced as part of Unlock 1.0 in June. A large number of these were returning to Mumbai. The reopening of the regular services of the railways also helped facilitate this. The cities, too, reported major shortages of labour, especially in the construction industry. A study conducted in April-May stated that 77% migrant workers were prepared to return to cities for work. The return of the migrants to cities is expected to help revive the economy, which had sustained an impact. Some employers sponsored the travel of migrants back to their workplaces. This included taxis, trains and even flights. Government responseDirectives= On 27 March, the Home Ministry ordered the states to ensure that migrants would not move during the lockdown, permitting the states to use the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for providing food and shelter to the migrants on 28 March. On 29 March, the government issued sweeping orders directing that the landlords should not demand rent during the period of the lockdown and that employers should pay wages without deduction. It also announced that those who violated the lockdown were to be sent to government- run quarantine facilities for 14 days, and that it had asked state governments to set up immediate relief camps for the migrant workers returning to their native states. However, the order regarding payment of wages was withdrawn in the guidelines for the lockdown extension issued on 17 May. On 16 May, the government announced the National Migrant Information System (NMIS), an online database created by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). This was to help streamline the movement of the migrant workers. It will help states find the current number of stranded migrant workers and their location. The government planned to keep the workers updated by feeding their phone numbers in the system. On 14 July, the Ministry of Human Resource Development requested the state governments to create a database of children in rural areas who have migrated. =Relief camps= Soon after the central government directive in late March, state governments set up thousands of camps to house lakhs of migrants and stop the exodus. Delhi government provided free food to 4lakh people every day, as of late March. Over 500 hunger relief centres were set up by the Delhi government. By 5 April 75lakh people were being provided food across the country in food camps run by the government and NGOs. As of 12 April, 37,978 relief camps and 26,225 food camps had been set up. To cater to the needs of the migrants and prevent them from leaving the camps, the government of Kerala changed the food being provided by adding north Indian dishes to the menu, providing carrom boards and recharge facilities for phones, as well as provide other medical essentials such as masks, sanitizers, and medicines. =Transport arrangements= As of 28 May 91 lakh migrants had travelled back home in government-arranged transport facilities. However, according to the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN), migrants were confused about the exact procedures to register themselves for travel. Additionally, many state registration portals were either in English or the local language of the states they lived in, which very few migrants could understand. Further, general lack of information from the government to the migrants had resulted in them paying large sums of money to register themselves. Buses In late March, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to arrange buses at Delhi's Anand Vihar bus station to take the migrants back to their villages for free. Large crowds then gathered at the bus station. However, with the extension of the lockdown, many remained stranded till the last week of April, when the state governments were permitted by the central government to operate buses, but not trains. As of 23 May 40 lakh migrants had travelled to their homes by buses. Condition in the buses is generally poor, with social distancing being impossible due to overcrowding and higher fares being charged than promised. Shramik Special trains Stranded migrant worker rushing to New Delhi railway station to reach native village by \\"Shramik Special\\" train On 1 May, the central government permitted the Indian Railways to launch \\"Shramik Special\\" trains for the migrant workers and others stranded. On 3 May, the Ministry of Home Affairs mildly reprimanded the state governments for hurriedly requesting for trains to transport migrants, stating that the trains were primarily mainly meant for those who were stranded due to the sudden lockdown, and not the migrants. Additionally, this service was not free, with additional charges over the normal fares. The central government then faced criticism from the opposition, with the Indian National Congress promising to sponsor the tickets of the migrants on 4 May. The government then announced that the Railways would offer an 85% subsidy on the train fares, with the state governments funding the remaining 15%. However, the migrants were still forced to pay an undisclosed amount in some cases. The central government initially declined to share the details regarding this with the Supreme Court, but later confirmed that it was not paying for anyone's fare. Additionally, the central governments directives regarding which states should pay for the migrants' travel resulted in disagreement between Maharashtra and other states. A few days after the Shramik Special trains were introduced, the Karnataka government cancelled the trains (reportedly supporting the construction industry) and the Bihar government did the same to trains coming from Kerala (refusing to provide a No-Objection Certificate). The two states later reverted their decisions. Further, migrants faced many hardships while travelling by these trains. Many reported to have no food and water arranged for them while they travelled. A train from Goa to Manipur reported a 58-hour delay, no proper food or sanitation facilities on the train, and stone pelting. Others who received food packets and water reported that the provisions were simply dumped at the entrances, leaving workers fighting with each other for their share. Some migrants also died during the train journeys, but the Railways stated that most of them had existing illnesses. According to Railway Protection Force, there have been almost 80 deaths on board the Shramik Special trains between 9 and 27 May. 50% of the coaches converted into COVID-19 care centres were used for these trains. As per a report given by the Indian Railways on 23 May, migrant labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh comprised 80% of the train travellers. Additionally, it was expected that 36 lakh migrants would be travelling in the ten days after the report. 4,277 Shramik Special trains had transported about 60lakh people, as of 12 June. =Relief measures= Soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced in late March, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a spending plan for the poor. This consisted of cash transfers and steps to ensure food security. By 3 April, the central government had released 11,092 crore to states and UTs under the NDRF, to fund food and shelter arrangements for migrants. To help provide jobs and wages to workers, the average daily wages under the MGNREGA were increased to from the earlier , as of 1 April. 1,000 crore from the PM CARES Fund was allocated for the support of migrant workers on 13 May. On 14 May, FM Sitharaman further announced free food grains for the migrant workers, targeting 80 million migrant workers by spending . The government of India launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan initiative to tackle the impact of COVID-19 on migrant workers in India. It is a rural public works scheme which was launched on 20 June 2020 with an initial funding of for 116 districts in 6 states. =Labour laws= The governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat sought to temporarily revise their labour laws in early May with the purpose of attracting industries and investments. Labour unions criticized this as being harmful to the migrant workers while giving more authority to the employers. Ten of them then wrote to the ILO on 14 May regarding the same, to which the ILO responded by reassuring them that it had contacted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. =Quarantine measures= Many states reported high numbers of positive cases of COVID-19 among the migrants returning home as lockdown restrictions eased. State governments opened thousands of quarantine centres to house them, with some states imposing mandatory institutional quarantine. States also imposed strict measures for migrants to follow, either while leaving or after entering state borders. Conduct towards migrant workers Migrant workers who decided to stay back during the exodus faced assault from their neighbours, who accused them of being infected with coronavirus. They thus could not venture out to buy food. Many also faced police brutality if they ventured out of their homes. Upon their return to their hometowns and villages, they were treated with either fear or a \\"class bias\\", being hosed down with disinfectants or soap solution in some cases. They were feared to be carrying coronavirus from the urban areas where they had been employed. They faced assault and harassment from the people of their hometowns. Since many of them belonged to the lower castes, they had to face caste slurs. Thousands got into property disputes. Migrants travelling by Shramik Special trains reported that food and water provisions were either not provided or simply dumped at the entrances of the trains, leaving workers fighting with each other to get their share. Passengers then hurriedly filled their water bottles at the railway stations that the trains stopped at. Many migrant workers expressed a fear of returning to their old jobs in the cities, after facing unemployment during the lockdown. Companies reported labour shortages from mid-April. Estimates state that this would last for at least another six months. Supreme Court hearing The Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a petition on behalf of the migrant workers on 30 March. The Court asked the central government to file a status report with respect to the situation of migrant workers. In its report, the central government stated that the migrant workers, apprehensive about their survival, moved in the panic created by fake news that the lockdown would last for more than three months. The court added that it was satisfied by the government response thus far. A plea requesting payment of minimum wage was rejected by the Court on 21 April, on the grounds of workers already being provided free meals. On 16 May, the Supreme Court rejected a PIL to direct the District magistrates to identify and provide free relief and transport to the migrant workers, stating that it was the responsibility of the state governments. Speaking about the workers killed sleeping on the Aurangabad railway tracks, the Court stated that it could not have been prevented. Further, the central government stated that inter-state transport had already been provided to the migrants and requested them to wait their turn instead of choosing to walk. On 26 May, the Supreme Court admitted that the problems of the migrants had still not been solved and that there had been \\"inadequacies and certain lapses\\" on the part of the governments. It thus ordered the Centre and States to provide free food, shelter and transport to stranded migrant workers. Hours before this ruling, senior lawyers from Mumbai and Delhi wrote a strongly-worded letter to the Court, regarding its \\"self-effacing deference\\" towards the government thus far. Deaths Due to the lockdown, more than 900 deaths were reported , with reasons ranging from starvation, suicides, exhaustion, road and rail accidents, police brutality and denial of timely medical care. Among the reported deaths, most were among the marginalised migrants and labourers. 80 died while travelling back home on the Shramik Special trains, in the one month since their launch. Notably, on 8 May, a freight train killed 16 migrants who had stopped to rest on railway tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. On 14 May, eight migrant workers were killed and nearly 55 injured when the truck they were in collided with a bus near Guna, Madhya Pradesh. On 16 May 24 migrant workers were killed and many more were injured when a trailer carrying migrants (along with sacks of lime) rammed into a stationary truck, also carrying migrants, in Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh. According to data collected by SaveLIFE Foundation, an NGO working in road safety, 198 migrant workers were killed in road accidents, as of 2 June. Reception Thousands of migrants have since protested across the country, for reasons ranging from demanding transport back home, quality of food served, not being allowed to cross the border, and against government directives preventing them to walk home. Some of the protests turned violent. Labour unions organised nationwide protests to protest the changes in labour laws, with the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh organizing one on 20 May and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and the All India Trade Union Congress organizing another on 22 May. Seven left parties wrote to the President to intervene in the issue. Ten labour unions wrote to the International Labour Organization (ILO) regarding the labour laws, on 14 May. In response, the ILO expressed \\"deep concern\\" to PM Modi and requested him to instruct the central and state governments to uphold commitments (towards labour laws) made by India. Negative comparisons have been made between the situation of many domestic migrants and Indians abroad: Shekhar Gupta criticized the media and Modi for focusing on the Vande Bharat Mission and thus the more affluent at the expense of the working class. Some politicians criticised the central government for not focusing enough on migrant workers. NITI Aayog CEO, Amitabh Kant, admitted that the migrant workers could have been better taken care of and stated that it was the responsibility of the state governments. Economist Jean Drèze stated that the lockdown had been \\"almost a death sentence\\" for the underprivileged of the country, further stating, \\"The policies are made or influenced by a class of people who pay little attention to the consequences for the underprivileged\\". In May, Manoj Muntashir composed a poem on the plight of migrant workers. Later in June, Javed Akhtar also composed one on the same.

Located at the head of a mountain at the north-west end of Skaka, a wall built of stone and clay with four towers in its corners and the castle is reached by a single and winding road, the castle has stood the protector of the city for a long period of time due to the strength of its fortifications and difficulty to reach it, and the people are trading legendary stories about this castle and standing steadfast in the face of the invaders who wanted to demolish it for its strategic importance.القلاع والحصون، شركة تارة الدولية، الرياض، 1433هـ، ص143  History  An old picture of the castle The age of the Za’abal Fort is about 900 years .

It has a structural formula similar to that of diphenylcarbazone and can be easily converted into it by oxidation.  Properties  Diphenylcarbazide is a white solid that is scarcely soluble in water, but readily soluble in organic solvents like acetone, hot ethanol and acetic acid. It forms colored complex compounds with certain metal ions. Diphenylcarbazide oxidizes to Diphenylcarbazone when exposed to light and air, turning pink in the process.  Uses  Diphenylcarbazide is used as a redox indicator and for the photometric determination of certain heavy metal ions, like those of Chromium, Mercury, Cadmium, Osmium, Rubidium, Technetium and more. Reacting a Diphenylcarbazide with Chromium (VI) compounds, such as chromates or dichromates produces diphenylcarbazone, which forms a red-violet complex with the chromium compounds. Chromium (III) compounds can also be determined using this method, by first oxidizing these to Chromium (VI) using an oxidizing agent (e.g. ammonium persulfate solution). Diphenylcarbazide has also been widely used in the chemical lab to detect Mercury (II) compounds, in a similar fashion. The reagent is typically used either as 1% to 0.25% solution in some organic solvent, or in the form of test-strip paper for detection of heavy metals in drinking water at home. The reagent is very sensitive, with a sensitivity threshold at 0.000,000,05 g/ml for Chromium (VI) ions, and 0.000,002 g/ml for Mercury (II) ions, that is 50 ppb and 2000 ppb, respectively. In the beginning of the 20th century, the following procedure using the Diphenylcarbazide indicator was developed, to prove the presence of mercury in solution: One drop of the solution to be tested is deposited on a filter paper which had been dipped into a freshly prepared 1% alcoholic solution of Diphenylcarbazide. Mercury salts produce a purple spot, even in a very diluted solution. Chromates and molybdates produce the same reaction.W. Böttiger, Bestimmung kleiner Mengen Quechsilbersalz in stärker Verdünnung.

Ch. Soc. 51, 3351, (1929) The major drawback of the test is the deterioration of stock solution of Diphenylcarbazide in different solvents. Thus, it needs to be freshly prepared. To avoid this problem, a solution has been found in the publication by Urone in 1955. Accordingly, non-aqueous Ethyl acetate and acetone were the better solvents, Diphenylcarbazide solutions of which are stable for months. Diphenylcarbazide solutions of Methyl ethyl ketone, methyl cellosolve (2-methoxyethanol), and Isopropyl alcohol are usable for 1-2 weeks. Aqueous solutions and solvents tending to be basic such as methanol and ethanol, and those containing traces of water and basic impurities, do not make good solvents for stock solutions of the colorimetric reagentP.

He participated in a foiled plot to murder the Prince of Orange.  Education  Slatius originally intended to be sent to Dutch East Indies as a preacher in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1603, the Heren XVII (central board of the VOC) \\"had ordered that one be informed after two suitable and qualified persons to nominate Godts Woorts, and the people against all superstition and the exuberance of the Moors and the Atheists through admonishment of the scriptures\\". However, in the period before the foundation of the Indian Seminary in 1622, the company continued to struggle to interest competent but also willing persons. Slatius was the first with whom a contract was signed in 1606. This stipulated, among other things, that the company would pay his theology studies at the University of Leiden and then leave for the Dutch East Indies in the service of the VOC. During his final exam in Middelburg, concerns were raised against Slatius because he was a proponent of Arminianism based on the ideas of Jacobus Arminius. In Utrecht he passed the exam, although he was advised to conform to the ideas of Gomarus. Slatius eventually decided not to go to the East.  Ministry and publications  Slatius became a Remonstrant minister in Bleiswijk. He made the Remonstrant doctrine sound loud and clear. After the Synod of Dordrecht, he was removed from office, after which he fled to Antwerp. He published several works from Antwerp.  Plot and betrayal  The execution of Oldenbarnevelt was a thorn in his side. Together with, among others, the brothers Willem and Reinier van Oldenbarnevelt, sons of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who was sentenced to death at the instigation of Maurice in 1619, he plotted an attempt on Maurice's life. In 1623 Slatius provided the weapons that would be used in the attack. Lennep, J. van J. ter en Gouw, \\"\\" Considered the signs of history and folk life \\"\\" p. 385 (1868) ed. Kraay Amsterdam Claes Michielsz Bontenbal, secretary of Zevenhuizen, contributed to the financing. A. van Cruyningen, Attacks on Orange (2015), pp. 83-95. The plot was betrayed and Slatius fled. He disguised himself in peasant clothes and fled via Amsterdam, Leeuwarden and Groningen to Drenthe. From there he wanted to escape to Germany. Seen some light, he enter in an inn in Rolde. Worried by the presence of soldiers, he settled his meal, but left the full jug of beer untouched. This raised suspicion among the soldiers, who followed and arrested him. Although he tried to save his life with excuses, it was discovered that he was the wanted Slatius, on whose head was put four thousand guilders. Slatius was brought to The Hague via Coevorden, Zwolle and Amsterdam.  Imprisonment and execution  Retrieval of the buried and hidden corpse of Slatius in 1623, print room Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen During his imprisonment, Slatius tried to avoid the death penalty by distancing himself from his Remonstrant views. When this vain hope turned out, he revoked this statement. He was sentenced to death after all. In his farewell letter to his wife, he wrote: Deursen, A.Th. of Baboons and mudgies: church and people in the time of Maurits and Oldenbarnevelt 3rd edition (1998) publ.

Content  Many films critically report on the time of the American war in Vietnam. The biographies of the Vietnamese veterans who survived the war, but who still suffer from the consequences of the use of Agent Orange, have so far mostly been left out. The film presents the fates of former Vietnamese soldiers and lets those affected have their say who have so far received little public attention. They exemplify more than three million Agent Orange victims about their experiences and the cruel consequences for their families - consequences of political failure.

Aesthetically, the film corresponds to its content orientation: it lives from the reserved images of humble Vietnamese veterans and popular songs sung. The title “Lighter than Orange” is a reference to the changes in the genome brought back from the war zones by the returnees, which, unlike actual war trophies, had no weight. A large part of the film was shot in March 2012 in the Vietnam Friendship Village, on the western outskirts of Hanoi in the formerly rural Hoài Đức district. The project was financed with private funds from Leupold Film Production Berlin and from the Stiftung Umverteilen (Stiftung für eine solidarische Welt) and the Hamburg Foundation Asienbrücke, as well as from the Technical University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. It goes back to records that Felix Klickermann made in the Village of Friendship in 2009. The Vietnamese Germanist Nhung Lương Tuyết accompanied the recording work in 2012 and took over the extensive translation work in the following years. The German-American artist and translator Julia Metzger-Traber worked on the project on a voluntary basis from 2013 to 2017. The Vietnamese title is ĐIỂM LẶNG, which means in English: ″Quiet point″.

It is the second video game of the Transport Fever franchise, and was available worldwide for Microsoft Windows and macOS on 8 November 2016. Gameplay Like its predecessor Train Fever, Transport Fever focuses on traffic simulation, but offers more varieties of transport vehicles, including buses, trains, ships and planes. The game starts in 1850 and allows players to play until the modern days, experiencing the transportation history stretching more than 150 years. New and better transport vehicles will be released gradually until the year 2014. The game also features American and European campaigns, with each provides seven challenges by telling the historical context of the 19th and 20th century. Development and release Transport Fever was revealed in April 2016. It was developed by Urban Games, which was the developer of the Transport Fever franchise. The game was released on 8 November 2016 worldwide for Microsoft Windows. Reception Transport Fever received \\"fairly positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game scores an overall 7 points from TheSixthAxis, which suggests the game \\"great attention to detail\\", and praises the campaign mode is a good new content to enjoy. However, the cluttered UI system, inflexible roads and tracks placements and occasional bug would likely to make players lose their interests. Sergio Brinkhuis of Hooked Gamers writes that in comparison to its predecessor Train Fever, the game improved in almost every term of aspects. However, time progression in the game is a bit off. He also criticises the time system that \\"travel time versus distance is completely out of whack and a day in the game lasts mere seconds.\\" The highest score among the thirteen reviews comes from GameStar. Benjamin Danneberg praises that the game offers better cargo systems and good new transports, but the controls are still flawed.

In Luzon, a blue bird called the Tigmamanukan was similarly believed by the Tagalog people to be an omen bird.  Historical accounts  \\"What they believe in thoroughly are omens, which are almost general in all the islands. There are many of them: of birds, like the limocon; of insects, like the lizard; of accidental occurrences, like sneezing; of happenings, like deaths or earthquakes; of observances at time of sowing, and of reaping, and of the hunt—all of these have their observances, which they fulfill in order to have luck in the work; for they believe that without these it will be unlucky, and without any profit. Therefore, they do not undertake those things, since in many districts it is considered an omen when anyone asks for a portion of what may be caught (as for instance, of the hunter or fisher), if we say to him when he goes to try his luck: “Divide with me what you shall catch.” They consider that as a bad omen, and return to their house, for they believe that they will catch nothing.\\" Fr. Francisco Combes, History of Mindanao, Sulu and Adjacent Islands (1667) \\"A common method used by the spirits to communicate with mortals is through the call of the limokon. All the people know the meaning of its calls and all respect its warnings. If a man is starting to buy or trade for an article and this bird gives its warning the sale is stopped. Should the limokon call when a person is on the trail he at ones doubles his fist and thrusts it in the direction from which the warning comes. If it becomes necessary to point backwards, it is a signal to return, or should the arm point directly in front it is certain that danger is there, and it is best to turn back and avoid it. When it is not clear from whence the note came, the traveler looks toward the right side. If he sees there strong, sturdy trees, he knows that all is well, but if they are cut or weaklings, he should use great care to avoid impending danger. When questioned as to why one should look only to the right, an old man quickly replied: \\"The right side belongs to you; the left side is bad and belongs to someone else.\\"\\" Fay Cooper Cole, The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (1913) \\"Pan-áu-ag-táu-ag to li-mó-kon. Though at the beginning of ordinary journeys the consultation of the omen bird is of primary importance, yet before a war expedition it acquires a solemnity that is not customary on ordinary occasions. This ceremony is the last of all those that are made preparatory to the march. The warrior priest turns toward the trail and addresses the invisible turtledove, beseeching it to sing out from the proper direction and thereby declare whether they may proceed or not. In one of the instances that came under my personal observation a little unhulled rice was placed upon a log for the regalement of the omen bird, and a tame pet omen bird in an adjoining house was petted and fed and asked to summon its wild mates of the encircling forest to sing the song of victory. Many of the band imitate the turtle bird's cry as a further inducement to get an answer from the wild omen birds that might be in the neighborhood. This is done by putting the hands crosswise, palm over palm and thumb beside thumb. The cavity between the palms must be tightly closed, leaving open a slit between the thumbs. The mouth is applied to this slit and by blowing in puffs the Manóbo can produce a sound that is natural enough to elicit in many cases response from a turtledove that may be within hearing distance. In fact, I have known the birds to approach within shooting distance of the artificial sounds.\\" John M.

Eltiona Skana, a 30-year-old woman unknown to the Jones family, was charged with murder.  Victim  Emily Grace Jones was born on 18 January 2013 in Bolton. Her parents were credit manager Mark Jones and solicitor Sarah Barnes. The family were from the Doffcocker area. Jones's parents said, \\"Emily was seven years old, our only child and the light of our lives. She was always full of joy, love and laughter.\\"  Stabbing  The Jones family were at Queen's Park in Bolton on 22 March 2020, which was Mother's Day in the United Kingdom. The police coroner's officer Rebecca Gardner described the attack, \\"Emily was on her scooter playing. As she rode past a wooden bench, a female sat on the bench suddenly attacked Emily, stabbing her in the neck, causing catastrophic injury. Emily was taken to Salford Royal Hospital, but despite best efforts to save Emily her death was diagnosed at 15.56 hours that day.\\" Coroner Alan Walsh stated, \\"In my 20 years as a coroner this is one of the most tragic deaths that I have dealt with.\\"  Trial  A 30-year-old woman who was unknown to the Jones family was arrested on the scene. She was detained under the Mental Health Act and placed in a high-security facility. An inquest into Jones' death was opened on 1 April, and adjourned to 3 July. On 20 May, the suspect was identified as Eltiona Skana (born 24 February 1990), who is originally from Albania. She was charged with murder along with possession of a bladed article. Skana was remanded in custody and scheduled to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court on 26 May. Skana did not enter a plea to the charges at her May court appearance. A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 5 October. Appearing via a video link from Rampton Secure Hospital, Skana did not speak at the hearing, and her barrister asked that the arraignment happen at a later date. Presiding judge, Mr. Justice Henshaw, adjourned the proceedings until 6 November.  Memorial  Jones was a pupil at Markland Hill Primary School in Bolton. After her killing, the school announced plans for a memorial garden. The fundraising target of £5,000 was reached within 12 hours, and soon surpassed £11,000. Headteacher Louise Close said, \\"We want a lasting legacy for this little girl who was taken so soon, so quickly and tragically.\\" A separate fundraiser started by Jones's parents raised over £10,000 within 24 hours, with the funds going to the Bolton Lads' and Girls' Club, which provides sports and art activities for children and teenagers across Bolton.

The council serves as an advisory body that helps in devising direct routes of transfers between postsecondary institutions for all students in Ontario, Canada. Ontario has a binary system of postsecondary education that consists of colleges and universities. The structure has been static and intentional for long, with only minimal mobility to offer between the two sides, which created resistance and, therefore, demanded the development of a more articulated system. The Provincial government in 1996 initiated the CUCC program. The council offers voluntary memberships to all postsecondary institutions. CUCC aids in the creation of a bridge program while maintaining the autonomy of colleges and universities according to the created agreement. In 2011, John Milloy announced his plans to construct a new centralized system of credit transfer which led to the evolution of CUCC into “Ontario Council on Articulation and Transfer” (ONCAT). This council has an implied jurisdiction over OCUTG; currently known as the “Ontario Postsecondary Transfer Guide” (OPTG). ONCAT was created to enhance academic pathways and reduce barriers faced by students who are looking to transfer between public colleges and universities, and indigenous institutes in Ontario.  Council members  * Dr Douglas Auld – President, Co-Chair, Loyalist College * Professor Bonnie Paterson – President, Co-Chair, Trent University * Ms. Barbara Taylor – President, Canadore Colleges * Dr Robert Rosehart – President, Wilfrid Laurier University * Ms. Cindy Hazell – Vice President Academic, Seneca College * Dr Fred A. Hall – Associate Vice President (Academic), McMaster University  Mission statement  The main objective of ONCAT is to “facilitate, promote and coordinate joint education and training ventures that will: aid the transfer of students from sector to sector; facilitate the creation of joint programs between colleges and universities; and further the development of a more seamless continuum of postsecondary education in Ontario.” The council aims to expand the credit transfer options for students and help them make informed decisions related to postsecondary education.This aim complies with the economic plan of Ontario’s government. ONCAT was also created as an effort to combine liberal educational courses in universities with applied studies courses taught in community colleges.  Contributions  In 1997, the consortium launched the “Ontario College-University Transfer Guide” on the web, which provides detailed information related to credit transfer policies, agreements, and articulation along with the specifics regarding collaborative programs between Ontario universities and colleges. In 1999, CUCC developed a template that enabled participating institutions with the freedom to enter data that covered out-of- province agreements. In 2003, the council commissioned a policy paper that presented the challenges found within the classification system for postsecondary education used by Statistics Canada, the national reporting and data collection agency over the last two decades proposing substantial revisions. In 2019, ONCAT funded the research in collaboration with the “Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)” called “Automating Articulation: Applying Natural Language Processing to Post-Secondary Credit Transfer”.

Life  Education= Born in Breslau, Schrammek, son of a surveying engineer, received his first organ lessons as a pupil of the Herzog- Friedland-Gymnasium in Żagań by his music teacher Gustav Mikeleitis. At the age of 15 he was called up for military service. After the end of the war he and his parents were expelled from the Silesian homeland. In Jena he passed his high school diploma in 1948 and began a two-year study of church music at the Hochschule für Musik Franz Liszt, Weimar, which he completed with the Mittlere Staatliche Prüfung für Kirchenmusiker. He then studied musicology, German studies and ethnology at the University of Jena until 1953. . After a three-year aspirancy at the University of Jena, he received his doctorate there in 1956 under Heinrich Besseler. His dissertation topic was: Das deutsche Lied in den deutschen Orgel tablatures des 15. Jahrhunderts unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Buxheimer Orgelbuches. = Academic activity = From 1956 to 1962 Schrammek was a research assistant in the music department at the in Leipzig. During this time he edited folk song editions and worked in field research on the Harz folklore, here especially about the . Fruits of this work were the series Volkslieder aus deutschen Landschaften published by Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag under his direction and other publications on the customs in the Harz. In 1962 he began his professional career as a research assistant at the Museum of Musical Instruments of Leipzig University. In 1977 he was appointed as curator, in 1988 as provisional director and in 1989 as director of this museum. During this time, he devoted himself to all museological work and participated in over 50 special exhibitions. He specialized in keyboard instruments, especially the organ and the harpsichord. From 1965 to 1990 he was a member of the Council for Museums at the GDR Ministry of Culture. Schrammek conducted extensive scientific research on the history of the organ. He was particularly interested in the Central German organ landscape. In this area he was a proven expert for all questions of construction, performance practice and liturgy. As such, he was instrumental in the rescue and restoration of numerous historical organs in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. On 27 May 1968, under conspiratorial circumstances, he led the rescue of the small organ from the Leipzig Paulinerkirche, which had already been prepared for demolition. In 1993 he was appointed to the commission \\"Art History, Literature and Musicology\\" of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and in 1994 he was appointed extraordinary professor. After his retirement in 1995, Schrammek was visiting scholar at the Leipzig University until 2006 and worked as a lecturer until 2011 for the Military bands of the Bundeswehr in Hilden. Since 2004, he was a member of the university rectorate commission \\"Organ for the new construction of the assembly hall/church on the campus Augustusplatz\\", whose concept he significantly influenced. = Church music = In addition to his professional activities, Winfried Schrammek was organist and choirmaster at the Catholic Church St. Bonifatius. Until 1990 he belonged to a Collegium musicum, the \\"Chorus Cantorum\\", which was exclusively dedicated to the research and faithful performance of the Gregorian chant. In concerts he was particularly prominent as an interpreter of medieval organ and clavichord music. A close collaboration existed with Hans Grüß and his Capella Fidicinia. As an organist and expert, he also participated in numerous recordings for radio and CD. Schrammek died in Leipzig at age 86 and was buried in the University Rebates of the II Department of the Leipzig Südfriedfriedhof, not far from the grave of his teacher Heinrich Besseler.

Ancient religious processions dedicated to local saints, protectors of parishes have taken over time a folkloric character, without the religious aspect getting totally lost. They are accompanied by armed escorts, which are just as well traditional. In 2012, fifteen of these marches were recognised as masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage by UNESCO. Walcourt, Trinité 2012, video report (also on YouTube)  History  These religious processions have their origin in the Corpus Christi processions. They were most often then dedicated to a saint who miraculously interceded in favor of the local community. Many steps are thus placed under the patronage of Saint Roch (Thuin, Ham-sur-Heure, Châtelet, Acoz ...) who would have interceded on behalf of the populations during the plague epidemics of the 17th century. Morialmé, the sappers and zouaves of the Saint- Pierre march (2006) The origin of the armed escorts accompanying these processions is essentially secular. These armed escorts are the heirs of the urban and rural militias which were to protect towns and villages. These militias also honored major protests in their localities. Over time, these militias have disappeared and their role has shifted to more popular societies, the \\"jeunesses\\". These societies of unmarried men were most often responsible for the organization of festive events in towns and villages. These groups perpetuated the traditions by preserving a military aspect to the escorts and by equipping them as best they could with uniforms (of the First and Second Empire and the Belgian Garde Civique) and firearms. Since the 1960s, there have been more groups dressed in uniforms inspired by or identical to those of the armies of the First Empire.  Procession order  Although subject to different variants, the order of these processions obeys a few rules common to the different markets: \\\\- The procession is almost always opened by a platoon of men wearing sapper uniforms. Recognizable by wearing a white apron (in canvas or leather), they carry an ax. \\\\- Next is the battery. This musical phalanx is composed of fifres and drums performing traditional tunes. Led by a drum major, the drums are sometimes followed by a music company, fanfare or harmony. Then the majors on horseback follow. These officers are mounted and their number may vary. They are the ones who will generally command the bursts. The flag and its escort, most often made up of young children wearing officers' uniforms, are placed between the majors and the firing squads. The latter can be dressed in costumes of outfielders, grenadiers, zouaves, etc. When there are blunderbusses, these usually close ranks. The main role of the shooters is to make the powder speak during the discharges (bursts) in honor of the saint or of the personalities receiving the procession. The clergy then come, accompanying the relics and followed by the pilgrims. In some villages, a platoon of riders can also be added to the company. When this is the case, he often opens the way by placing himself in front of the company. 300px  Glass breaking  The breaking of the glass is a traditional ceremony during which, in certain villages of the Marcheurs, the places of officers are allocated. The priority criteria vary from one Company to another depending on local traditions. Numerous office forces are constituted according to degrees of seniority within the Company. Other committees auction off the places of officers and thus favor the highest bidders. Whatever the form, the breaking of the glass constitutes, in all cases, a swearing in, a personal commitment of each officer vis-à-vis folklore, the heritage of his land, a promise to strive to maintain traditions in their true value. In the presence of many Marcheurs, the mayor and the aldermen, each officer raises his glass, of beer or of \\"goutte\\", called a \\"misérable\\" at this occasion (because it lacks a foot), empties it at once and throws it violently at his feet.

He was one of the first to recognize the potential of this method and to identify and follow the technological approach of using zone plates as lenses in such a microscope. Schmahl and his colleagues further developed the technique until it was ready for application in two- and three-dimensional imaging of biological samples.

It is the third video game of the Transport Fever franchise, and was available for Microsoft Windows and Linux on 11 December 2019. Gameplay Like the series' previous games, Transport Fever 2 still focuses on the transport evolution of the past fifteen decades. However, the campaign mode rewrites the transport history in comparison to Transport Fever, and takes place across three different continents. The game also features a sandbox mode, a map editor and mod tools. Development and release Transport Fever 2 was announced in April 2019. It is developed by Urban Games, the developer of the Transport Fever franchise, and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment. The game was initially available for Microsoft Windows and Linux on 11 December 2019 worldwide via Steam, with A macOS version to follow in autumn 2020. Reception Transport Fever 2 received \\"fairly positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Matt S. of Digitally Downloaded rates the game 4.5 stars out of 5. He writes \\"It's elegantly presented and understands that some efficiencies are required for the sake of playability.\\" Rick Lane from The Guardian gives a 3 star with maximum 5. He compares the game with The Sims franchise of Maxis and Cities: Skylines of Colossal Order, commenting the growth of the in-game cities would bring players a lot of fun. However, despite not short of detail, he criticises the game lacks depth in certain areas. The game scores an overall 7 points from TheSixthAxis, which suggests the game \\"great attention to detail for vehicles and the environment\\". However, on the minus side, the game does feel more or less like a refined expansion rather than a proper sequel.

It was historically the home of the prominent Stockdale family, of which three Knaresborough MPs were members.  History and ownership  There has been a building on the site of Bilton Hall since the 14th Century. The first structure sat within a newly created park to form a hunting lodge for the Slingsby family. Perhaps the best known member of the family was William Slingsby, who is credited as the discoverer of the first spa water well in Harrogate. Christopher Stockdale of Bilton Hall In 1631 it was acquired by Thomas Stockdale, son of William Stockdale of Green Hammerton, whose family had been significant Yorkshire landowners since the reign of Henry VI. Thomas Stockdale went on to represent Knaresborough in Parliament from 1645 until 1653. His son, William Stockdale took his fathers seat in Parliament, serving as member for Knaresborough from 1660 until his death in 1693. The Bilton estate then passed to his nephew Christopher Stockdale, who in turn became MP for Knaresborough in April 1693 holding the seat until his own death 1713. Christopher's heir, William Stockdale, inherited Bilton Hall upon his fathers demise. Like many hundreds in the country at the time, William had over- invested in the notorious South Sea Company and lost a great fortune when the shares crashed in 1721. The earliest of the surviving elements of the current structure date back to the Stockdale period of ownership. In 1742 Bilton was acquired from the Stockdale family by John Watson of Malton. The Watsons carried out a program of refurbishment on the hall and constructed the present stable and coach house.

The command is designed facilitate the rapid movement of forces across national borders in Europe. According to NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu, \\"The new command in Ulm will help our forces become more mobile and enable rapid reinforcement within the Alliance, ensuring we have the right forces in the right place at the right time\\". It is under the operational command of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). The command is staffed by 160 personnel and extendable to 600 if required. It is located in Ulm, Germany.. Another article states it will have around 280 personnel in peacetime and more if a crisis develops. It is commanded by Lieutenant General Jürgen Knappe, who is also jointly Commander Multinational Joint Headquarters Ulm. The command was declared initial operational capable on 20 September 2019.  Background  The JSEC was announced at the same time as Joint Force Command Norfolk, established to help protect maritime transport and sea lines of communication between North America and Europe; Its design in modeled after a Bundeswehr Joint Support Service Command. The command was designed in light of growing hostilities between European countries and Russia since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and in response to logistic and bureaucratic hurdles limiting military logistics in case of a crisis. A research paper by the German Federal Academy for Security Policy mentions specific logistical issue such as modernizing diplomatic clearances required for troop movement, loading capacity standards for trucks, ascertaining which roads, tunnels and bridges in Europe can withstand tank and other heavy vehicle's movement. The German Federal Academy for Security Policy's view is that the forming of JSEC is a possible driver for the establishment of a \\"Military Schengen\\".

Geographically it is bounded by Laxey Head () to the north and Clay Head () to the south. Marine Nature Reserve Laxey Bay was first protected as a 'Fisheries Restricted Area' in 2009 to facilitate king scallop ranching, whereby the areas could be seeded with scallops, protected from fishing and then harvested at a later date. The bay was seeded with young scallops, however subsequent surveys indicated that densities remained very low (amongst the lowest of sites surveyed in Manx waters), likely owing to limited good scallop habitat within the bay. A Bangor University survey in 2016 surveyed the habitats within the bay. On the basis of the presence of habitats of conservation importance, including maerl and eelgrass (Zostera marina), the survey recommended that they bay remain closed to mobile fishing in the long term. The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture thereafter consulted the public and stakeholders on making the bay a Marine Nature Reserve. Tynwald granted Laxey Bay full statutory protection as a Marine Nature Reserve (MNR) under the Wildlife Act 1990 from 1 September 2018. It is now one of ten Marine Nature Reserves found around the Isle of Man, covering over 10% of the country's territorial waters. The reserve lies west of a line drawn between two points at the following co-ordinates: Carrick Roayrt by Bulgham Bay (54° 14.3742’ N, 04° 21.9420’ W) and Kione ny Cleigh / Clay Head (54° 11.8044’ N, 04° 23.2338’ W), up to and including the shore to the level of the Highest Astronomical Tide. The reserve encompasses an area of 3.97 km² which equates to 0.48% of the Island’s territorial seas in the 0-3 nautical mile zone. Laxey Bay MNR also includes a highly protected Eelgrass Conservation Zone within Garwick Bay. The reserve is managed by the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture in collaboration with its fisheries science advisors and other stakeholders including the fishing industry and recreational users. The Manx Marine Nature Reserves Byelaws 2018 prohibit the extraction of sand, gravel or rock, the deposition of any substance or articles, the use of mobile fishing gear (dredges and trawls) and long lines and the taking of either queen or king scallops whilst diving. Within the Eelgrass Conservation Zone even anchoring and the use of static fishing gear (pots) is prohibited to protect eelgrass, a protected Manx species and important marine habitat. While there is currently no speed restrictions for vessels in the reserve, the Isle of Man Government requests mariners have consideration of the impact of high speed on marine animals and other users. The bay is a \\"core marine area\\" of the Isle of Man's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The rocky coast of Kione ny Cleigh/Clay Head is listed as one of the top 40 geological sites in the Isle of Man and is a candidate Regionally Important Geodiversity Site.potential Regionally Important Geodiversity Sites Wildlife & Habitats The primary marine conservation features of Laxey Bay are maerl beds to the north and east, eelgrass meadows in Garwick Bay, kelp forest, rocky reef, the dog whelk (Nucella lapillus) population and relatively large numbers of the long-lived bivalve, the ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). Thornback ray, spotted ray and small-spotted catshark eggcases are regularly found on Garwick Beach, suggesting nearby breeding populations. Laxey Bay is also notable for its seabird populations, including breeding shag, black guillemot, Eurasian eider, herring gull, great black-backed gull and small numbers of lesser black-backed gull. red-billed chough, peregrine, Eurasian oystercatcher, Eurasian curlew, great cormorant, grey heron and northern fulmar are also commonly seen. Within the bay small numbers of gannet can be seen spectacularly diving for fish, as can large groups (50+) of feeding shag. Harbour porpoise regularly use the area and occasionally grey seals may be spotted. Between October and March large pods (up to 200 individuals) of bottlenose dolphins and small groups of minke whales (in the autumn) can also be found. Less commonly small pods of Risso’s dolphin and the occasional large pod (over 100) of short-beaked common dolphin can be seen. Environmental issues Historically the bay was overfished by the scallop industry, a very environmentally destructive form a fishing, however it is expected the bay will recover in time. Several fish species in the wider Irish Sea, such as cod, herring and skate species have undergone population collapse or decline, which will have impacted populations within the bay.https://www.gov.im/media/1349731/sea-fisheries-strategy.pdf As of 2020, raw, untreated and unfiltered sewage is still discharged into Garwick Bay, bringing with it larges amounts of plastic waste. Both the Laxey River and Gawne River also bring agricultural runoff into the bay, which combined with the sewage, results in both Garwick and Laxey Beaches often failing to achieve minimum bathing water standards during monthly testing.
