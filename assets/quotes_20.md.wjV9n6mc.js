The name Sveta Trojica was restored in 1992.Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia: Sv. Trojica In the past the German name was Heiligendreifaltigkeit. History During the Second World War, the village and the surrounding area was used for convalescence by Partisan soldiers crossing the Sava River into Lower Carniola. Various Partisan units bivouacked in Sveta Trojica and Partisan meetings were held there. On 22 July 1944, Partisan forces repelled a German raid on the village. German troops burned the main settlement of Sveta Trojica, the hamlet of U≈°evk, and part of Konfin on 22 August 1944. =Liberator airplane crash= On 2 April 1944 at about 11 am, an American bomber B-24 Liberator crashed near the village after it was damaged by a German air raid on its return from the bombing of a ball-bearing plant at Steyr (Austria). All of the crew members were able to jump out of the plane. Five of them escaped and join the Partisans, whereas the other five were captured by the Germans, but all of them survived and safely returned home. In 1994 a monument by the academic sculptor Tone Dem≈°ar was unveiled in Sveta Trojica in memory of this event. The unveiling ceremony was attended by some of the still living crew members. =Unmarked grave= Sveta Trojica is the site of an unmarked grave from the Second World War. The Sever Shaft Grave (), also known as the Vastance Grave (), is located about east of Sveta Trojica, on the left side of a dirt road between house no. 11 and the Vovk farm in Zgornja Javor≈°ica. During the war, the Partisans accused a civilian from Zajel≈°e of betrayal, shot him, and hid the body in the shaft. After the war, the remains were removed and reburied. LandmarksCastle= The partially preserved ruins of Koprivnik Castle () are located in the hamlet of Konfin. The castle was abandoned in the 13th century, when the owners relocated to Krumperk Castle, and it was in ruins by the 17th century. In the second half of the 19th century, the castle became known as Old Castle () or Freight Castle (), named after the nearby freight route from the Central Sava Valley. In 1930 the ruins of the castle were purchased by Valentin Ro≈æiƒç. =Church= The local church, from which the settlement also gets its name, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity ().

The combination of ethnic nationalist movements that saw caste as an island-wide dividing tool, strong emphasis on providing access to education and healthcare regardless of background, and historic lack of discrimination among the colonial civil service played a factor in eradicating the caste system in most sectors of the island's society. Although the Buddhist culture actively fought against all forms of class discrimination, many Buddhist organizations used caste as a method to extract surplus from temple property.http://idsn.org/wp- content/uploads/user_folder/pdf/New_files/Publications_from_network/Caste_discrimination_and_social_justice_in_Sri_Lan  History Lanka= Caste System  Buddhism rejects casteism as a fundamental principle of its worldview, and this had an effect on reducing the severity of the caste system on the island. Notably, the highest caste group in both communities of the island also formed the popular majority for both communities. The caste systems in Sri Lanka were organized in a similar manner to the JƒÅti systems found in South India. The history of the caste system in Sri Lanka is unclear since there is very little historical evidence and many research carried out into the subject have been criticized as being biased.http://www.seu.ac.lk/researchandpublications/kalam/vol8/5%20KALAM%20VIII%20(1)%202014%20%20(Page%2040-47).doc14.11.2014-3.pdf It's to be noted that caste positions did not correlate with wealth. Goyigama was the most common caste in the Sinhlaese community numbering around 50%. These people were basically landowning farmers but had monopolized the high positions in politics and royal courts. Vellala is the term used for the similar community among Tamils. Brahmins did not have as much influence on the island as on the mainland, and the most politically influential caste belongs to the farmers . The documented history of the island begins with the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India. The island was reportedly inhabited by four tribes at that time: the Dewa, Nagas, Yakkas and Raksha. Although the origin of Sri Lankan communities is unclear, genetic studies on Sinhalese have shown that most of the Sinhala community is genetically related to the South Indians and Bengalis.Mitochondrial DNA history of Sri Lankan ethnic people: their relations within the island and with the Indian subcontinental populations, L Ranaweera, et al; Journal of Human Genetics (2014)Pre-Vijayan Agriculture in Sri Lanka, by Prof. T. W. WikramanayakeA SHORT HISTORY OF LANKA by Humphry William Codrington, CHAPTER I; THE BEGINNINGS 'The princess and her retinue/dowry (service castes)'Buddhism Betrayed?: Religion, Politics, and Violence in Sri Lanka By Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, p. 152-3 About half of the Sinhalese population are Govigama. Of the three native tribes, it is believed that the Dewa are part of the Sinhalese castes. Ancient Sri Lankan texts, such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya, Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptions, show that a fourfold caste category namely Raja, Bamunu, Velanda and Govi existed among the Sinhalese. Evidence of this hierarchy can be seen during the 18th century British-Kandyan period,Kadayimpoth - Boundary Books indicating its continuation even after the Sri Lankan monarchy.MahavanshaSinhala Sanna ha Thudapath, Ananada thissa Kumara, Godage Publication,Second Edition,2006,pp 142,pp 137 Colonialism and foreign intervention in the dynastic conflicts of the island throughout history has also influenced the caste system, some suggesting even a re-arrangement of the occupational castes.Kandy Fights the Portuguese, C.Gaston Perera, Vijithayapa Publications, 2007An Historical Relation Of The Island Ceylon In The East Indies, Robert knox, 1681, pp. 46 & 73 At present 13 castes are commonly found among the Sinhala viz. Radala, Govigama, Bathgama, Deva, Nekathi, Bodhivansha, Rajaka, kumbal, Hunu, Durava, Karava, Salagama and Navandanna, with smaller castes being absorbed to the larger castes. = Kandyan castes = In the Central Highlands, many traditions of the Kingdom of Kandy were preserved from its 1818 collapse beyond independence in 1948 and the Land Reform Act of the 1970s. Although large agricultural landlords belonged to the Govigama caste, many now may not own land. Most Govigama were however ordinary farmers and tenants as absolute land ownership was exclusive to the king until the British colonial period. In addition to the Govigama, there were several strata of occupational castes. Wahumpura or Deva were the caste who traditionally made jaggery and farmed. The Bathgama caste was also engaged in agriculture with access to some land. The Navandanna (Achari) caste were artisans. The Rada were washers, and this caste is still prevalent in Sri Lanka's laundry sector. The Berava were traditional drummers and agricultural wage laborers. The Kinnara caste did menial work and were segregated from the rest of the community. The most important feature of the Kandyan system was Rajakariya (\\"the king's work\\"), which linked each caste to an occupation and demanded service to the court and religious institutions. = Southern castes = There were differences between the caste structures of the highlands and those of the low country, although some service groups were common to both in ancient Sri Lanka. The southwestern coast had three other castes (the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava) in addition to the majority Govigama, which was common throughout the region. Some of these castes' ancestors are believed to have migrated from Southern India, and have become important in the Sinhalese social system. The first-century BC Anuradhpura Abayagiri inscription referring to a Karava navika may be the first reference to a specialized occupation. = Tamil castes = The TolkƒÅppiyam Porulatikaram indicating the four-fold division is the earliest Tamil literature to mention caste. Sangam literature however mentions only five kudis associated with the five tinais. Colonialism also had influenced the caste system.Their caste system had stronger religious ties than its Sinhalese counterpart, although both systems have comparable castes. In the caste system observed, there were distinctions between Northern and Eastern societies, and also the agricultural and coastal societies. In the agricultural society were there mainly the castes of the Vellalar, Nalavar and Koviar, where the Vellalar caste is the dominating one, particularly in Northern Sri Lanka. They approximately constitute half of the Sri Lankan Tamil population and were the major land owning and agricultural caste. The Northern and Western coastal society was dominated by the Karaiyars, traditionally a seafaring and warrior caste. The Thimilar and the Paravar were also among the coastal communities involved in fishing. The Mukkuvars, traditional pearl divers, dominate greater parts of Eastern Sri Lanka where they were the major landowners also involved in agriculture. The artisans, known locally as Kammalar or Vishwakarma consists of the Kannar (brass-workers), Kollar (blacksmiths), Tattar (goldsmiths), Tatchar (carpenters), Kartatchar (sculptor). Along with the Kammalar were the Ambattar (barbers), Kadaiyar (lime burners), Koviar (farmers), Kusavar (potters), Maraiyar (conch blowers), Nattuvar (musician), Nalavar (toddy-tappers), Pallar (farm workers), Paraiyar (drummers), Turumbar (scavengers) and Vannar (dhobies) constituting the domestic servants termed as Kudimakkal. The Kudimakkal gave ritual importance in marriage, funeral and other temple ceremonies. Other Sri Lankan Tamil castes of importance were the Cirpatar (cultivators), Iyer (priests), Kaikolar (weavers), Madapalli (former royal cooks), Shanar (toddy-tappers) and Maravar (Poligar-Warriors). The Sri Lankan Chetties, traditional merchants, along with the Bharatha people, traditional seatraders, were listed as their own ethnicities in Sri Lankan census. The Coast Veddas, found mainly in Eastern Sri Lanka were considered a Tamil caste among the Sri Lankan Tamils. The village deities of the Sri Lankan Tamils were also shaped by the caste structure. The Sri Lankan Moors don't practice the caste system, however follow a matriclan system which is an extension of Tamil tradition. = Ceylon = With the onset of the colonial rule in the country, different castes emerged with new occupation. However, social mobility was present since the colonial rulers didn't impose hereditary occupations as was the case in the Kandy Kingdom. Therefore, it is identified that this is the point in which the caste began to be limited to a social culture rather than an occupational group. Newer castes originated at this point such as the powerful Mudaliyar class who loyally served their colonial masters. By the late 19th century the upper class natives of Ceylon (called Ceylonese by the British) formed a second class group in their own land, serving their colonial masters. The finest example of this would be the famous second class and third class carriages use by the Ceylonese on the trains due to the first being reserved only for Europeans . This upper class of Ceylonese derived their wealth from land holdings that were passed down the generations and derived their power from serving in posts in the British colonial administration. At first these were limited to post special posts reserved for natives such as Rate Mahattaya in the central highlands and the Mudaliyars in the coastal areas, letter as new generation of these native chieftains grew up educated in the Christian missionary schools, public schools modeled after their English counterparts and at British Universities they were taken in to the Ceylon Civil Service, others took up places in the Legislative and later the State councils. Entering into this upper class were successful merchants who gained wealth in the lucrative mining industry of the time. A middle class emerged at this period of a bourgeois people who gained their status by Professions or by Business. =Sri Lanka= The 20th century brought several changes to the social structure. By the 1940s when Ceylon gained Independence from the British (in 1948) there were four social groups. Upper class made up primary of landowners, the Upper middle class of educated professionals holding traditional jobs such as Lawyers, Doctors, Army officers, Academics, senior Civil Servants and police officers; and merchants. The political leaders of the new Dominion of Ceylon came from these to classes. Lower middle class made up persons who were educated but held less prestigious, but respected jobs such lower level public servants, policemen, teachers. This order changed dramatically in the 1970s due to the land reforms brought on by the government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike who limited private owner ship of land to and ownership of private houses to two (later changed), excess land was nationalized along with many industries. This rendered the wealthiest who made up the Upper class and Upper middle class who greatly dependent on a secondary income void of their income and with it their power. The following the failure of the socialist economic drive of the 1970s the new government of J R Jayewardene open up the counties economy to free market reforms. This along with the civil war saw major change in the social structure. The direct result of the changes of the 1970s and the 1980s was witnessed only at the late 20th century and start of the 21st century. Today;Today‚Äôs middle class: An insight into the contemporary middle class of Sri Lanka  Society Upper Class= The upper class in Sri Lanka is statistically very small and consists of industrialists, businessmen, senior executives and serving government ministers. These people are the wealthiest in the land, having in some cases inherited money and position, and in other cases having earned it themselves. Their educational backgrounds may vary, but they typically send their children to national, private or international schools to be educated in English and thereafter send them to overseas universities. =Upper Middle Class= The upper middle class in Sri Lanka consists of and educated professionals, Business men who generally come from educated backgrounds, having been educated at public or private schools and local or foreign universities. Traditional jobs include lawyers, doctors, engineers, military officers, senior civil servants, managers. Manage own business that have high income. They typically send their children (depending on family income, traditions, residence) to national, private or international schools to be educated in English or in their local languages. For university education, they may be sent to overseas universities or local private higher education institutions (depending on family income). =Middle Class= The middle classes include government workers such as university lecturers, teachers, government department workers and manage small business such as retails business and service provided. Some can afford to put their children into private national schools but refrain from the more expensive private international schools. The Sri Lankan national universities are mainly for the Middle classes. The middle class university students do travel abroad on university scholarships. =Lower Middle Class= The lower middle class in Sri Lanka consists of people in blue-collar jobs living in less prosperous suburbs. This class constitutes the largest of Sri Lanka's social groups. Typically they have not have had a university education, and send their children to national or provincial schools to be educated in their local languages (depending on family residence or scholarships). For university education, if selected they may be sent to local state universities, if not local private higher education institutions. =Lower Class= These people would typically be on low incomes and dependent on state benefits. Many reside in the slums or shanty towns of cities or underdeveloped rural areas. They send their children to provincial schools to be educated in their local languages.  Discrimination  Although caste discrimination is still found in Sri Lanka (particularly in rural areas), caste boundaries are blurring. Political power and wealth have largely replaced caste as the main factor in Sri Lankan social stratification, especially in the Sinhalese and Indian Tamil communities.Caste in Jaffna And India, Review Article on Neville Jayaweera's Jaffna Exorcising the Past and Holding the Vision Dr. Devanesan Nesiah (Sunday Leader 10.10.2014) Ponnambalam Ramanathan, under British Ceylon, opposed extending voting rights to the people and urged reservation of franchise only to men of the Vellalar caste.

Born in the Adelaide inner-southern suburb of Unley, he became interested in engineering and architecture while in the goldfields of Western Australia and later studied mechanical engineering at the School of Mines, serving an apprenticeship under architect Edward Davies. After graduating he accepted a position as a lecturer at the school, and was responsible for developing the first formal architecture course in the State in 1904. Between 1905 and 1914, he served as registrar at the school before leaving to join his long-time friend, Walter Bagot, at the architectural firm of Woods, Bagot and Jory. He remained with the firm until his death in 1965, and over the years was involved in a number of significant projects, including the South Australian National War Memorial and the original Australian Mutual Provident building on King William Street. Along with his teaching and professional duties, Laybourne Smith was a member of the South Australian Institute of Architects, the Federal Council of the Australian Institute of Architects, and the Australian Institute of Architects, as well as being on numerous committees and advising the State Government in the formation of both the State Building Act of 1923 and the 1939 Architects Act. During his life Laybourne Smith received a number of awards and honours, including Life Fellowship to the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal, and was invested as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Today, the architectural school which he founded (now part of the University of South Australia) bears his name‚Äîthe Louis Laybourne Smith School of Architecture.Louis Laybourne Smith School of Architecture & Design , UniSA.edu.au Early life and education Louis Laybourne Smith was born to Joseph and Annie Laybourne Smith on 1 April 1880, in Unley, South Australia. His parents had emigrated to Australia so that his father could take up a post as a chemist with F.H. Faulding & Co. However, it appears that Joseph Laybourne Smith found dentistry more to his liking, for he went on to gain qualifications in the field through the Australian College of Dentistry. Both Laybourne Smith's primary and secondary education were obtained at the nearby Windham and Way colleges; his education was interrupted in the mid-1890s when his parents decided to move to the goldfields of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Architect Personal Details According to Laybourne Smith, he became interested in machinery while in the goldfields. His parents decided to direct him towards architecture, as it \\"was the nearest thing to white-collar engineering work that they could think of\\".Louis Laybourne Smith, cited in He was articled to A. A. E. Dancker for a period before returning to Adelaide in 1898. Laybourne Smith's parents had intended for him to study architecture at the University of Adelaide, but there were no courses available at the time.. Page notes that during this period in South Australia, aspiring architects were articled to a practitioner for a fee, rather than studying the field through the education system. The first formal architecture course wasn't offered until 1906 under Laybourne Smith's direction, although according to Collins, Ibels and Garnaut, there were some architectural subjects taught in the 1880s at the School of Design (2005, p. 30). As a result, Laybourne Smith undertook to complete a mechanical engineering course part-time at the School of Mines, and (in order to pursue his interest in architecture) he was articled to Edward Davies from 1901. He proved to be an excellent student, winning scholarships in both his second and third years, and was the first person to finish the course within the proscribed four years. He completed his apprenticeship with Davies in 1904, and was admitted as an Associate to the South Australian Institute of Architects, although the ongoing impact of the depression made finding work difficult. In spite of this, he found employment as a draftsman, initially with Ernest Bayer and later with John Quinton Bruce. After graduating at the School of Mines, Laybourne Smith continued his studies at the University of Adelaide, completing a Bachelor of Science in 1911. This was surrendered in 1914 for a Bachelor of Engineering.. There are some inconsistencies about the date of completion ‚Äì Irwin places it in 1911, while Garnaut (2006) reports that his degree was completed in 1908. Teaching career In 1903, Laybourne Smith was invited to lecture in mechanical engineering at the School of Mines‚Äîa position which Page states that Laybourne Smith was \\"delighted\\" to accept. He was thereafter elected as the school's registrar in 1905, and continued in that post full-time until 1914, after which he ran the school part-time until 1951. Even then, Laybourne Smith's involvement with the school did not end after Gavin Walkley took over, and he was still associated with the school when he died in 1965. While working at the school, Laybourne Smith initiated his own classes on architecture, gathering \\"a group of colleagues who instructed one another\\" in the field. After being approached in 1906 by the Council of the School of Mines, Laybourne Smith teamed with Walter Bagot to develop a new architecture course. The result was a three-year part-time Associate Diploma, although students were still expected to be articled to professional architects in order to gain more practical experience in the field. By 1916 the course was regarded as of sufficient quality to place its students \\"in the same rank as architectural students in other parts of the world\\".H. Fuller cited in While the School of Mines no longer exists, the school of architecture founded by Laybourne Smith is now part of the University of South Australia, and since 1963 the Louis Laybourne Smith School of Architecture and Building has borne his name as its founder. Architectural career Louis Laybourne Smith (the civilian on the far right of the second row) stands with officers and nurses at the Repatriation Hospital, over which he was the supervising architect. While not a returned soldier, two of his partners were serving overseas at the time, and this overcame any reservations in regard to his involvement. Upon leaving his full-time position at the School of Mines, Laybourne Smith acted as a \\"stand- in\\" for Walter Bagot at Bagot's architectural firm, Woods, Bagot and Jory, while Bagot was overseas. Edward Woods died in 1913, and three years later Laybourne Smith became a full partner in the newly named Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne Smith. In 1930 Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne Smith became Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith & Irwin, after the departure of Herbert Jory, while today the firm is known simply as Woods Bagot. Laybourne Smith was to remain with the firm until his death in 1965. Laybourne Smith's friendship with Walter Bagot had spanned many years prior to the partnership, but their respective working methods was \\"so different that they seemed unlikely partners\\". While Baggot was \\"notorious\\" for the attention he gave to minor details in designs, Laybourne Smith was described as being just as happy to develop a sketch and to pass it on to the draftsmen to \\"work up\\" (although this does not represent a lack of attention, as his designs were \\"sketched in tiny, neat detail\\"). In spite of these differences, their respective strengths tended to balance one another: Bagot was a traditionalist in design, while Laybourne Smith brought an engineer's knowledge and \\"ingenuity\\" to the partnership. =Works= Laybourne Smith's first major work with Woods, Bagot & Jory was the refurbishment of the National Bank building on King William Street, and from there he graduated to work on a number of notable buildings within South Australia and interstate. Both the firm in general and Laybourne Smith in particular were traditionalists in their designs, to the point where Page reports that Laybourne Smith took as a compliment a description of one of his works in 1965 as \\"striped pants and all\\". This traditionalism was particularly evident in their work for the University of Adelaide. Between 1910 and 1945, the firm served as architects to the University of Adelaide, and Bagot strove towards congruity for the university. The result included a number of buildings that were designed by Laybourne Smith in a \\"Georgian revival\\" style, including the original heritage listed Student Union building and the main building of the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, which is also heritage listed and has been described as being \\"reministent of the great English country houses\\". While some of Laybourne Smith's work remains, the site was extensively redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s by Newell Platten and Robert Dickson. Similarly, Laybourne Smith applied traditional designs to a number of ecclesiastical projects. These include St Cuthbert's Anglican Church in North Adelaide, which is heritage listed as an example of Gothic Revival architecture; and the romanesque St. Dominic's Chapel at the Cabra Dominican College in Cumberland Park. His background in engineering was put to good use on a number of projects. In particular, the John Martins store on Rundle Street (now Rundle Mall), was constructed by raising the top floor of the building on hydraulic jacks, building two new floors underneath while the remainder of the store continued to operate normally. Another of Laybourne Smith's buildings, the Australian Mutual Provident building on King William Street in Adelaide, was one of the first in the state to feature air conditioning, as this was considered to be quite an \\"innovative\\" addition in 1934. Other works by Laybourne Smith include the facade on the Balfours Cafe in Rundle Mall (heritage listed in part due to the innovative \\"building envelope\\", which is \\"independent of the internal structure\\"), the Repatriation General Hospital in Daw Park (developed by Laybourne Smith from sketch plans produced by Melbourne firm Stephenson & Turner), and the South Australian National War Memorial. This last structure represents a collaboration between Laybourne Smith, Walter Bagot, and Sydney-based sculptor Rayner Hoff. Although Walter Bagot produced the original design for the architectural competition in 1924, his design was, (along with the other entrants), deemed to be \\"unsuitable\\". After the entries were destroyed by fire late that year, Laybourne Smith, working with artist Rayner Hoff, was able to redraw the design largely from memory in order to enter the subsequent 1926 competition. In doing so they built upon Bagot's work, making the memorial \\"grander\\" in its scope‚Äîand this proved to be sufficient for the firm to be awarded the commission.

Professional activities and associations John Dowie at the University of South Australia Louis Laybourne Smith, 1929. Although Laybourne Smith continued to be involved in teaching and architectural design, he was also involved in professional organisations and committees. He was admitted to the South Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA) as an associate in 1904, made a fellow in 1907, elected to the council in 1909, and served two terms as President (1921‚Äì1923 and 1935‚Äì1937). In all, Laybourne Smith served on the SAIA council for 50 years, from 1909 to 1959. Laybourne Smith played a significant role in the formation of a national body of architects. He was a founding member of the Federal Council of the Australian Institute of Architects, first proposed in 1914 and officially formed in 1915, which served as a \\"first step\\" towards the formation of a national body. Between 1991 and 1922, he served as president of this body. After the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) was formed (now known as the Australian Institute of Architects), he served as a councillor for 11 years (between 1933 and 1944), and as the President of the institute from 1937 to 1938. In addition to his role on the councils, Laybourne Smith was an adviser during the development of the State Building Act of 1923, and he was largely responsible for the framing of the 1939 Architects Act, (which provided for the formal registration of architects in South Australia). Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement in the creation of the Architects Act. Influence and awards Louis Laybourne Smith is regarded as being one of the \\"key practitioners\\" of architecture in South Australia. In particular, he had a significant influence on the direction of architectural education in South Australia. His career spanned more than half a century, with much of it directly involved in education, and during that time he (and Walter Bagot) served as one of the \\"last links with the distant past of South Australian architecture\\"‚Äîhaving known (either directly or indirectly) most of the architects of the colonial era, while being responsible for the training of many of those who were to follow. Furthermore, he had a substantial impact on the development of architecture as a professional body through his involvement in the Architects Act of 1931 and the formation of a national body for architects. This political work also had a social dimension: his work on the Building Act Advisory Committee helped to highlight the low quality of the housing in the poorer areas of Adelaide, and this led to a change in how the public viewed what was acceptable as low-income housing. The South Australian Housing Trust was a direct result of his actions, and led to the provision of low cost rental housing to working families in the state. As well as having the architectural school named in his honour, in 1961 Laybourne Smith was awarded the Gold Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and prior to that date, in 1948, he was invested as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Two busts of his likeness have also been commissioned. One was by Rayner Hoff, with whom he had collaborated on the design for the South Australian National War Memorial, and is kept in the offices of Woods Bagot. The second was unveiled in 1961, and was sculpted by South Australian artist John Dowie. It can be found at the Louis Laybourne Smith School of Architecture at the University of South Australia.. Page notes that there were plans to mount the bust on a plinth along Adelaide's North Terrace, where a number of other notable South Australian figures are displayed, but the City Council turned down the offer. Laybourne Smith was a Life Fellow with both the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, (awarded in 1944), and a Fellow (1939) and Life Fellow (1944) of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Personal life Described as a \\"dapper young man with a moustache waxed into long points\\", he made for a \\"dynamic figure with a penetrating voice\\", and was noted for riding his Douglas motorcycle through the 1920s and 30s in his khaki overalls as he traveled between his professional practice, teaching duties and home life. On the home front, Louis Laybourne Smith married Frances Maude Davies, the daughter of Edward Davies to whom he had been articled, on 9 April 1903. They had three daughters and a son, Gordon Laybourne Smith, who ultimately followed his father into architecture.. Gordon Laybourne Smith was articled to his father's firm \\"as soon as he left school\\", and later became a partner in the company. Laybourne Smith \\"consistently overworked\\"; architecture was said to be both his profession and his obsession. When his firm announced a retirement scheme he declared that he had no intention of retiring, and such proved to be the case‚Äîhe died at his desk on 13 September 1965 at the age of 85.

Definition  Centralcasting is a form of broadcast automation which operates on the presumption that large quantities of content are similar and are handled in a consistent or repetitive manner across multiple stations in a broadcast station group. While each individual station has its own digital on- screen graphic logo, call sign and identity, much of the content on a typical affiliate station consists of a common television network or syndicated programming with a small number of local broadcast programming time blocks employed for television news and sports television coverage, public affairs programming or local television commercials. Traditionally, many operations at an individual broadcast station were handled manually by broadcast engineering technicians at the local station. Network feeds would arrive by satellite; these would contain time cues to indicate when the station could switch to a prerecorded local station break from a videotape recorder, a local station ID from a character generator or a local program such as a newscast. Syndicated programming would arrive separately, either recorded in advance from satellite for tape delay or transported on prerecorded media. Local advertisements would be stored on tape cartridges (\\"carts\\") which would need to be inserted in the correct timeslots manually. A station could not operate unattended, even if it were merely retransmitting a network television programme originated elsewhere. Broadcast automation relies on computers to store and retrieve video, largely eliminating the use of individual videotapes and allowing switching and retrieval of stored programming, advertising and titles to take place automatically. The server would operate from stored playlists, in which each programme, each commercial advertisement, each live or network feed and each station break had been configured in advance. = Central control = In some cases, broadcasters have operated groups of multiple stations at the regional or national level from one central facility, removing many tasks which were formerly done locally. These operations normally take one of two forms: # A fully centralised operation may have local stations which function as little more than a local news bureau and a transmitter site. The local station sends its news footage to the central hub, which inserts it (along with local advertising and station identifiers) into a national network or syndicated programming feed. All video is stored in one central location. The resulting broadcast video streams are centrally assembled then sent directly to local station transmitters by the central hub. # A less-centralised approach involves installing servers at local broadcast station sites which may be controlled either locally or remotely. The central hub would be able to send video to the local station, along with playlist information, and local facilities would then be used to store and rebroadcast programming. = Non- broadcast operations = Many traffic and operations tasks, such as acquiring programming, selling advertisements, scheduling and keeping records of what was broadcast and billing advertisers take place behind the scenes, yet are also suited to automation and central operation by regional broadcast station groups. If computers handle scheduling of individual broadcasts, advertisements and local identification, a computerised record of what has been broadcast can easily be extracted for use at a central location to bill advertisers for broadcast time. Central operation of non-broadcast business functions removes the need for these tasks to be carried out at each of the multiple local stations.  Advantages  For some broadcasters, centralisation of broadcasting operations has reduced the number of people required to operate a station, with some saving in cost. This must be carefully balanced, however, against the cost of the extra communications links required from the local station to the hub; these often are optical fibre, microwave or (occasionally) satellite and can be costly if large amounts of digital video must be carried great distances. By shifting many of the control tasks to a central hub, centralcasting may also reduce the investment which must be made in equipment for each individual local station in the group for upgrades such as digital television broadcasting as less equipment is required at each local station site.IP-based centralcasting, Mark Warner, Broadcast Engineering, Jun 1, 2008 Centralcasting can also be used as a way to control a station's local operations remotely during off-hours (such as late night, where there may be no one or just a skeleton crew at the local site). This can allow a station to operate on an \\"auto-pilot\\" basis during off-hours in which it otherwise may have needed to sign-off.  Drawbacks  An over-reliance on automation (and a reduction in the number of people at the local station) may leave an individual station less able to respond to local breaking news, such as tornadoes or other natural disasters which require local, live and immediate coverage. Individual local stations must also retain enough equipment to handle Emergency Alert System messages, routing them automatically to any remote locations being used to encode the final broadcast signals.Barix IP Audio Devices Gaining Popularity in EAS Applications, Broadcast Equipment Guide, April 13, 2007 The use of large amounts of centrally assembled programming may also reduce local diversity, turning a station into little more than a semi-satellite of a main broadcaster in another city. In some cases, individual stations in a group will legally need to maintain nominal main studios in or near their respective communities of license but will originate little or nothing from these facilities once most broadcast-related tasks become centralised.The FCC's main studio rule: achieving little for localism at a great cost to broadcasters, Silverman, David M. - Tobenkin, David N., Federal Communications Law Journal ‚Ä¢ May 2001 Broadcast centralisation can create problems when one station in the group is sold (as the local master control functions which had been centralised must be restored before the local station is a viable stand-alone entity). There also needs to be some means to remain on-air locally if the link to the central hub is lost, lest a single point of failure take down all stations in the regional group.  Users  Individual users of centralcasting facilities include: * ION Media Networks began centralcasting in 2013, and plans to control nearly all owned-and-operated stations from its Clearwater, Florida broadcast facility. * Cox Media Group uses centralcasting. * Cowles Publishing Company's three Washington stations (which include KNDO and KNDU and their SWX Right Now channels), are operated from a centralcasting facility at flagship station KHQ-TV. * Equity Media Holdings operated a unique C.A.S.H. (Central Automated Satellite Headend) system which allowed it to programme all of its stations nationwide from one central hub in Little Rock, Arkansas. Individual station sites in the system were little more than satellite-fed broadcast translators.

These are:‚Äî #jƒ´va- the soul which is characterized by consciousness #ajƒ´va- the non-soul #ƒÅsrava (influx)- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul. #bandha (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and karmas. #samvara (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul. #nirjara (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling-off of part of karmic matter from the soul. #mok·π£ha (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul). The knowledge of these reals is said to be essential for the liberation of the soul. However, as per one sect of Jain i.e. Shwetamber (Sthanakwasi), there are total nine tattva (truths or fundamental principles). Seven tattva are same as above but 2 more tattva are there namely :- 8\\\\. Punya (alms-deed) - Which purifies our soul and provide happiness to others . 9\\\\. Paap (sinful acts) - which impurifies our soul.  Overview  The first two are the two ontological categories of the soul jƒ´va and the non-soul ajƒ´va, namely the axiom that they exist. The third truth is that through the interaction, called yoga, between the two substances, soul and non-soul, karmic matter flows into the soul (ƒÅsrava), clings to it, becomes converted into karma and the fourth truth acts as a factor of bondage (bandha), restricting the manifestation of the consciousness intrinsic to it. The fifth truth states that a stoppage (sa·πÉvara) of new karma is possible through asceticism through practice of right conduct, faith and knowledge. An intensification of asceticism burns up the existing karma ‚Äì this sixth truth is expressed by the word nirjarƒÅ. The final truth is that when the soul is freed from the influence of karma, it reaches the goal of Jaina teaching, which is liberation or mok·π£a.* In some texts punya or spiritual merit and papa or spiritual demerit are counted among the fundamental reals. But in major Jain texts like TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra the number of tattvas is seven because both punya and papa are included in ƒÅsrava or bandha. According to the Jain text, SarvƒÅrthasiddhi, translates S.A. Jain: Jƒ´va Jainism believes that the souls (jƒ´va) exist as a reality, having a separate existence from the body that houses it. Jƒ´va is characterised by chetana (consciousness) and upayoga (knowledge and perception). , GƒÅthƒÅ 16 Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state of soul and appearance of another state, these being merely the modes of the soul. , GƒÅthƒÅ 18 Ajƒ´va Ajƒ´va are the five non-living substances that make up the universe along with the jƒ´va. They are: *Pudgala (Matter) ‚ÄìMatter is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. ParamƒÅnu or ultimate particles are considered the basic building block of all matter. One of the qualities of the ParamƒÅnu and Pudgala is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed. *Dharma-tattva (Medium of Motion) and Adharma-tattva (Medium of rest) ‚Äì They are also known as DharmƒÅstikƒÅya and AdharmƒÅstikƒÅya. They are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. Dharma-tattva and adharma-tattva are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmƒÅstikƒÅya motion is not possible and without adharmƒÅstikƒÅya rest is not possible in the universe. *ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa (Space) ‚Äì Space is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. *KƒÅla (Time) ‚Äì Time is a real entity according to Jainism and all activities, changes or modifications can be achieved only through time. In Jainism, the time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of sagaropama or ocean years. p. 45 According to Jains, sorrow increases at each progressive descending stage and happiness and bliss increase in each progressive ascending stage. ƒÄsrava Asrava (influx of karma) refers to the influence of body and mind causing the soul to generate karma. It occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body. The ƒÅsrava, that is, the influx of karmic occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body. p.112 TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra, 6:1‚Äì2 states: p. 26 \\"The activities of body, speech and mind is called yoga. This three-fold action results in ƒÅsrava or influx of karma.\\" p.151 The karmic inflow on account of yoga driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short- lived karmic effect.Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.152Kuhn, Hermann (2001). p.33 Bandha The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called bandha. However, the yoga or the activities alone do not produce bondage. Out of the many causes of bondage, passion is considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. Sa·πÉvara Sa·πÉvara is stoppage of karma. The first step to emancipation or the realization of the self is to see that all channels through which karma has been flowing into the soul have been stopped, so that no additional karma can accumulate. This is referred to as the stoppage of the inflow of karma (sa·πÉvara).T. G. Kalghatgi, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 15, No. 3/4, (Jul. - Oct., 1965), pp. 229-242 University of Hawai Press There are two kinds of sa·πÉvara: that which is concerned with mental life (bhava-sa·πÉvara), and that which refers to the removal of karmic particles (dravya- sa·πÉvara). This stoppage is possible by self-control and freedom from attachment. The practice of vows, carefulness, self-control, observance of ten kinds of dharma, meditation, and the removal of the various obstacles, such as hunger, thirst, and passion stops the inflow of karma and protect the soul from the impurities of fresh karma. NirjarƒÅ NirjarƒÅ is the shedding or destruction of karmas that has already accumulated. NirjarƒÅ is of two types: the psychic aspect of the removal of karma (bhƒÅva-nirjarƒÅ) and destruction of the particles of karma (dravya-nirjarƒÅ). Karma may exhaust itself in its natural course when its fruits are completely exhausted. In this, no effort is required. The remaining karma has to be removed by means of penance (avipaka-nirjarƒÅ). The soul is like a mirror which looks dim when the dust of karma is deposited on its surface. When karma is removed by destruction, the soul shines in its pure and transcendent form. It then attains the goal of mok·π£a. Mok·π£ha Mok·π£ha means liberation, salvation or emancipation of soul. As per Jainism, Mok·π£ha is the attainment of an altogether different state of the soul, completely free from the karmic bondage, free from samsara (the cycle of birth and death). It means the removal of all the impurities of karmic matter and the body, characterized by the inherent qualities of the soul such as knowledge and bliss free from pain and suffering. Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation. A liberated soul is said to have attained its true and pristine nature of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge and infinite perception. In Jainism, it is the highest and the noblest objective that a soul should strive to achieve. It fact, it is the only objective that a person should have; other objectives are contrary to the true nature of soul. That is why, Jainism is also known as or the ‚Äúpath to liberation‚Äù.

It was the last major battle of the Yom Kippur War, before a ceasefire took effect. On October 23, with the imminent arrival of UN observers to the front, Israel decided to capture Suez, assuming it would be poorly defended. An armored brigade and an infantry battalion from the Paratroopers Brigade were committed to the task, and entered the city without a battle plan. The armored column was ambushed and severely hit, while the paratroopers came under heavy fire and many of them became trapped inside a local building. The armored column and part of the infantry force were evacuated during the day, while the main contingent of the paratrooper force eventually managed to dash out of the city and make their way back to Israeli lines. Background At 4:00 PM on Tuesday, October 23, the United Nations Security Council met in New York City to reconfirm the ceasefire and send observers to the fighting front. At 6:00 PM, General Ensio Siilasvuo, head of the UN Emergency Force in Cairo, called the Israeli Defense Minister, Moshe Dayan, and told him of the decision. Dayan suggested that the ceasefire go into effect at 7:00 AM local time, thirty-six hours after the original ceasefire was supposed take effect, and Siilasvuo accepted. The Israeli Chief of Staff, David Elazar, said in the Kirya that he was in a dilemma. From a military perspective, the IDF needed a few more days to make the Egyptian Third Army surrender and cut off the Second Army, which would collapse the entire Egyptian military. On the other hand, Israel had a great debt to the United States as a result of the massive arms shipments of Operation Nickel Grass. He later said it was the latter consideration that made him accept the ceasefire.Rabinovich (2005), p. 466 The town of Suez had about 260,000 residents before the War of Attrition, but most of them left during that conflict. However, there were enough men to form a militia, which would make up part of the city's defense force.Rabinovich (2005), p. 468 On October 23, division commander Major-General Avraham Adan had three armored brigades and a makeshift infantry brigade made up of five or six battalions.Dupuy (2002), p. 539 By October 24, Israel had two brigades on the outskirts of the city, and one battalion from Yoffe's paratroopers brigade southwest of the town at the Gulf of Suez near the old oil refinery. Suez was thus completely isolated from Egypt from the west, and so was most of the Third Army. Yoffe had pushed across the Sarag road west of Suez put a further blocked the Egyptians. Capturing Suez was not considered psychologically or strategically important, although it was presumed to hold supplies for the Third Army.Rabinovich (2005), p. 470 Throughout October 22 to 23, many Egyptian officers and soldiers had withdrawn into Suez. Most of these belonged to administrative and supply units that had been stationed on the west bank of the canal. They also contained a number of units from Third Army that had been engaging Israeli forces since October 16. The number of Egyptian forces inside Suez reached almost 5,000 men, possessing only small arms and assault rifles.Hammad, 492-493 Brigadier General Yusuf 'Afifi commanding the 19th Infantry Division east of the canal, reinforced the city with an ATGM company and a tank-hunting team. On its way to Suez, the company had expended its missiles in an engagement with Israeli tanks, destroying more than nine tanks. This left Egyptian forces in the city with a small number of RPG-7 weapons and RPG-43 grenades.Hammad, 495-496Pollack (2002), p. 123 Prelude At 2:00 AM, General Shmuel Gonen called Adan and asked him if he could capture Suez in the two to two and half hours between dawn and the ceasefire. Adan answered that it depended on the Egyptian defenses in the town, but that he thought that at least part of the town could be taken. Gonen said: \\"Okay, if it's Beersheba, go ahead; if it's Stalingrad, don't do it!\\", referring to Operation Yoav and the Battle of Stalingrad, respectively. Adan gave his orders accordingly.Dupuy (2002), p. 540 Israel argued that the attack would not be a violation of the ceasefire if it was launched before 7:00 AM, even if the battle continued after that hour, since the Arabs were the ones who chose when to start the war and when to call for a ceasefire. Israel also claimed that the ceasefire did not apply to \\"mopping up\\" operations that were altering the rear areas and not the front line. Intelligence knew of a commando battalion, two infantry battalions and an antitank missile company. Since Egyptian soldiers had been mostly surrendering during the previous two days, Adan assumed the defenders of Suez would not resist.Rabinovich (2005), p. 466-467 An armored brigade, under the command of Colonel Aryeh Keren, had set up its headquarters west of Suez. Keren was in charge of the attack and ordered Yossi Yoffe to lead the attack with his reserve paratroopers using nine captured Soviet APCs, and drive up the main street of the town. He said the confidence based on which he was being sent was groundless. He said he had only one small map and had seen no air photos and asked for time to draw a plan. Adan pressured Keren to capture Suez before the arrival of the observers, and Keren told Yoffe that \\"in the armored corps, we take our orders while we're on the move\\", and gave thirty minutes to organize. A tank battalion, under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Nahum Zaken was to lead the attack with its own infantry detachment, while Yoffe was to follow and leave platoons to secure the intersections.Rabinovich (2005), p. 468-470 BattleAmbush= At 10:50 Zaken's column, stretched for over a mile, started moving up the main street, an extension of the Cairo-Suez highway. His battalion was divided into three groups, each containing eight tanks, each tank followed by an APC or halftrack. Zaken had three miles to go before reaching a large square on the bank of the Gulf of Suez. Along the way, he saw Egyptian soldiers, mostly unarmed, and some of them raised their hands in surrender when they saw the Israeli column. All the Israeli tank and APC commanders were standing in their turrets.Hammad (2002), p. 498 Meeting no resistance, the column reached the second intersection at the Al-Arba'een square. A member of the militia, Mahmoud 'Awad, fired two RPG rounds at the lead tank. One round caused superficial damage, and the other missed. Further ahead, the militia had set up another ambush. Ibrahim Suleiman, positioned in a hideout between Cinema Royal and Cinema Egypt, heard the explosions, and asked his comrade, Mohamed Sarhan, to prepare an RPG round. At a range of 12 meters, Suleiman fired his RPG, hitting the turret ring. The tank blew up, and its cannon tilted to the ground. Moments later, Sarhan fired an RPG round against the APC trailing the lead tank. The APC, carrying paratroopers inside, caught fire. At this point, masses of civilians and soldiers began moving towards the square from the adjacent buildings and from roads leading to the square. The column came to a halt, and began receiving heavy small arms fire, also coming under attack by hand grenades. Within minutes, twenty out of the twenty-four Israeli tank commanders were hit.Herzog (1975), p. 249 The Israelis panicked, and began disembarking their vehicles and taking cover in nearby buildings. One group of soldiers tried to enter Cinema Royal, but were repulsed at the entrance. One of the APCs that were hit was carrying the brigade's intelligence group. The group abandoned the APC, and all nine men entered a nearby building, where they were presumably killed.Hammad (2002), p.498-499, 504 The remainder of the battalion turned around to retreat, which was disorderly. The retreating forces came under attack by small arms, grenades and Molotov cocktails. Four tanks came up behind Sidi Al-Arba'een Mosque, but were ambushed by soldiers from the 19th Division, forcing the tanks to retreat.Hammad (2002), p. 499 Zaken, in the second tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to keep moving to get out of the ambush and fire all weapons. The battalion made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 470‚Äì471 The casualties were transferred to an APC which surprised the Egyptians as it drove back up the main street, and managed to make it through. The APC crew left the casualties at an aid station and tried to drive back and rejoin the battalion. Halfway through the APC was hit by an RPG, which killed one man and wounded almost all the others, but the driver managed to get out of the city again. A second APC carrying dead and wounded tried to make a dash out of the city and was stopped by heavy fire, but the driver heard on the radio that the paratroopers were on their way.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 471‚Äì472 =Trap= The paratroopers started going down the avenue and came under fire. They could not distinguish where the enemy fire was coming from. Yoffe's APC was hit by an RPG, killing four of his men and wounding him as well as others. The vehicles pulled over and the soldiers took cover in adjacent buildings, most of them entering Al-Arba'een Police Station, a two-story building surrounded by a tall brick wall. In a very brief firefight the paratroopers wounded two and captured eight policemen. Ten minutes later the second floor was cleared. Lieutenant David Amit, the ranking unwounded officer, organized the defenses of the fifty paratroopers inside. He posted men at windows and behind the brick wall in the front of the building to block the entrance. A room was used as an aid station. Five men positioned themselves on the roof an adjacent building and began firing on the surrounding Egyptians. The policemen launched two attempts to break into the police station and rescue those held inside. In one of the attempts, the Egyptians broke into the building from a side entrance and advanced toward the aid station, and the battalion doctor and his medics opened fire on them. Yoffe's leg had been badly ripped but he refused morphine in order to stay alert. When the Egyptian fire stopped, he told his men that the Egyptians were preparing for an attack. The building was then attacked by RPGs and grenades, and the second floor caught fire. Yoffe told the doctor to burn the maps and papers that might help the Egyptian intelligence. Having lost much blood, he kept losing consciousness. The fire was eventually doused and the attack repulsed. Both attempts failed had cost the Egyptians another eight policemen killed.Rabinovich (2005), p. 472Hammad (2002), p.500 & 505 Outside the police station, both sides were still firing on each other. A few wounded Israelis who were unable to take cover in the nearby buildings lay stranded on the streets. The Egyptians concentrated their fire against the paratroopers in the building. The Israelis decided to release a police officer to inform the Egyptians of their desire to surrender, provided the Egyptians guaranteed they would not be harmed. The police officer left the building and told Sarhan that the Israelis wanted to surrender. Sarhan took the officer to Colonel Fathy 'Abbas, head of intelligence in the southern sector of the canal. 'Abbas met both men before noon that day, and was enthusiastic to accept the Israeli surrender and end the fighting, especially considering the potential intelligence gains. 'Abbas asked both men to go back to the police station and negotiate terms of surrender with the Israelis. They were unable to enter the building however, as the shooting would not stop and there was no overall commander in control of the militia surrounding the police station. The police officer, an old man, lost his nerve and would not come near the building. Consequently, no negotiations took place and there would be no Israeli surrender.Hammad (2002), p.500-501 The armored forces made several failed attempts to break through to the building. When one force approached, they threw furniture out the window to signal their location, but the vehicles' hatches were closed and drove pass the building, all the while under small arms fire.Hammad (2002), p.505 The armored force noticed another paratroop group, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Yaakov Hisdai, with eighty men, most of them wounded, which followed Yoffe's battalion. All but sixty men were rescued. At around 4:00 pm, Ibrahim Suleiman and three others tried to break into the building. Suleiman went around the building and climbed a pole, hoping to take the Israelis by surprise. However, he was spotted and killed. Two others were killed while trying to break in from the front, after coming under massive fire from the paratroopers in the second floor. A few Egyptians climbed up to the rooftop adjacent to the police station where five paratroopers positioned themselves. The rooftop was cleared and all five Israelis were killed after vicious close quarter combat involving hand-to-hand fighting.Hammad (2002), p.501 Mahmoud 'Awad, fearing the Israelis might try to recover their abandoned armor, resolved to completely destroy the fifteen tanks and APCs, all damaged or destroyed, that lined the streets leading to the square. At midnight, he poured considerable amounts of gasoline on them and set them on fire.Hammad (2002), p.502 =Escape= As darkness fell, Adan ordered the armored forces out of the city. They were evacuated along the gulf shore, which had been cleared. Adan learned that another force was also meeting stiff resistance in the green belt north of the town, and could spare only one battalion, in addition to another battalion from near Shalufa. Zaken's battalion had eighteen men killed, thirty-five wounded and three disabled tanks which were abandoned. Adan ordered the paratroopers to get out of the city on foot. Hisdai and Keren spoke in the Hebrew equivalent of pig latin to confuse the Egyptians, and Hisdai asked to have tank projectors beam lights toward the sky to indicate the location of the nearest Israeli unit. He checked the route and returned to lead his troops out.Rabinovich (2005), p. 473 Yoffe's troops were over two miles into the city and after dark others also joined him in the police station, totaling ninety men, twenty-three of them wounded. They made several dashes to their vehicles to bring ammunition, medical supplies and water. Keren tried to convince Amit to lead the men out, but Amit preferred to wait until morning. Eventually, he agreed to send the men in small groups. Keren objected, saying that they must move in one group in order to be able to carry the wounded and defend themselves if attacked. Hisdai also asked Amit to move. Gonen also spoke to Amit and, having heard his explanation, told Keren to make a rescue attempt in the morning. Keren called Adan, who called Gonen and told him that a rescue attempt would be too costly. Gonen then called Amit back and told him to leave on foot. The exchange went on for four hours. After Amit was convinced, Gonen found the location on an enlarged air photo of Suez and planned an artillery box in the center of which Amit could move.Herzog (1975), pp. 249-250 He asked Amit to take out a pen and paper, looked at the air photo and dictated to him the route out. Halfway through, Amit stopped writing, deciding that the route would be tough even by day and with a map, and that the area south of the building, through which Gonen's route was to pass, was filled with Egyptian troops. Despite that, he kept answering \\"Yes sir\\", and asked for artillery bombardment around the police station, although not in the rest of the city, where Amit preferred to move quietly. He organized his men into squads so that each squad would carry three wounded men.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 473-474 The squads were ordered to keep distance but not lose eye contact. As they were getting ready to move, lookouts reported activity in the nearby buildings and said Egyptian troops had taken positions down the street. Amit ordered all his men back into the building.Rabinovich (2005), p. 474 The paratroopers concluded that they would not be rescued, and that the Egyptians would not take prisoners. Some of them contemplated committing suicide before the Egyptians broke in. At 2:00 AM, Gonen called, asked for Amit, and ordered him \\"Move out. Report implementation in ten minutes. Out\\". Amit woke Yoffe up and Yoffe agreed that moving out would be the best solution. Yoffe got up and tried to make a few steps before saying \\"I can't walk\\". Other wounded men got up to see if they could. Amit ordered his men out, two of whom had to be carried out on stretchers, while some had to be supported by others. They came out under artillery cover, with the leading squad not carrying any wounded. They did not follow Gonen's route, instead opting to go north across the broad avenue and then turn left on a parallel side street. They could not move quietly because of broken glass and other debris. Egyptian soldiers passed by several times, occasionally passing through gaps in the column, but did not challenge them, perhaps believing they were Egyptians. After almost two hours, they reached the Sweetwater Canal, outside the area under Egyptian control. They followed its inner face toward a vehicular bridge marked on the map, but a few score yards before it they reached a railroad bridge, which did not appear on the map. They could hear that the vehicular bridge was guarded by Egyptians, but the railroad bridge was not and they crossed it. Shortly before dawn, they reached Keren's force outside the city.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 474-475 Aftermath The IDF casualties in the battle were 80 dead and 120 wounded.Rabinovich (2005), p. 475 Israel made two more probes into Suez, one on the 25th and one on the 28th, but both were repulsed. On the 28th the UN observers were taking positions west of Suez.Dupuy (2002), p. 542 The Egyptian Chief of Staff, Saad El Shazly, noted that on October 27, the Israelis refused to let the UN Emergency Force contingent into Suez, and also blocked an Egyptian column of 109 trucks and 20 ambulances.Shazly (2003), p. 285 The battle of Suez was the last major battle of the war. When the ceasefire came into effect on October 24, two divisions under the command of Adan and Magen were sealing off the Third Army. The IDF was also holding a corridor on the east bank of the Suez Canal, with three bridges across it, and occupying an area of 1,600 square kilometers inside Egypt as far south as Adabia.Herzog (1975), p. 250 On October 28, Israel accepted the ceasefire.

Early life and family Sivakumaran was born on 26 September 1950. He was the son of Ponnuthurai, principal of Urumpirai Hindu Tamil Vidyasalai, and Annalakshmi. Sivakumaran's father and mother were both supporters of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and its leader S. J. V. Chelvanayakam which influenced Sivakumaran's own political beliefs. Sivakumaran had two brothers and a sister. He was educated at Urumpirai Hindu College and Jaffna Hindu College. After school he joined Kokkuvil Junior Technical College but dropped out after two months. Militancy Sivakumaran became a supporter of an armed struggle. In 1969 a small group of militant Tamil youths from Valvettithurai formed an underground group. The group was known as the Thangadurai Group and was led by Thangadurai and Kuttimani. The group would later be known as the Tamil Liberation Organisation (TLO). Other members of the group included V. Prabhakaran, Sri Sabaratnam, Sivakumaran, Periya Sothi, Chinna Sothi, Chetti and Kannadi. In 1971 Sivakumaran joined the Tamil Student Federation (Tamil Manavar Peravai) (TSF), which had been formed in 1970 by Ponnuthurai Sathiyaseelan. Sivakumaran later left the TSF and formed his own group which was known as the Sivakumaran Group. Whilst speaking at an event at Colombo Hindu College in July 1970 Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs Somaweera Chandrasiri, a Sinhalese politician, claimed that Sinhalese and Tamil cultures were linked. Sivakumaran was angered by this. In September 1970 Sivakumaran tried to assassinate Chandrasiri as he visited Urumpirai Hindu College. Sivakumaran placed a time bomb under Chandrasiri's car and quietly slipped away but when the bomb exploded no one was in the car. No one suspected Sivakumaran. Mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah was a member of the governing Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its chief organiser in Jaffna District. Tamil militants considered Duraiappah to be a traitor and government collaborator. In February 1971 Sivakumaran tried to assassinate Duraiappah by throwing a hand grenade on to Duraiappah's car which was parked on Second Cross Road in Jaffna. Duraiappah was not inside the car at the time. This time the police found out that Sivakumaran was involved and started a manhunt for him. In 1972 and 1973 the police arrested many Tamil youths suspected of being militants. As a result, Sivakumaran's militant activities slowed down. In January 1974 nine civilians were massacred by the police at the World Tamil Conference in Jaffna. Tamil militants blamed the government and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Chelliah Kumarasuriar for the massacre. Sivakumaran however blamed Duraiappah and ASP S. K. Chandrasekera for the massacre and sought vengeance. Fearing torture if he was arrested, Sivakumaran started carrying cyanide pills. On 4 June 1974 TSF militants including Sivakumaran attempted to rob the People's Bank in Kopay. As the bank's police guards gave chase, a cornered Sivakumaran swallowed a vial of cyanide, dying instantly. Sivakumaran became the first Tamil militant to die in such a manner and the first Tamil \\"martyr\\". A large public funeral was held which was attended by senior Tamil politicians. Sivakumaran's body was taken in procession from Jaffna hospital to Urumpirai. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam leader V. Prabhakaran would later claim that Sivakumaran's death was the inspiration for LTTE cadres carrying cyanide capsules as standard equipment. A bronze statue of Sivakumaran was put up in Urumpirai but during the 1977 anti-Tamil riots the statue was destroyed by the police. The edifice was demolished by the army during Operation Riviresa. The statue was re-built in 1999. 5 June is commemorated as Tamil Students' Day of Uprising or Sivakumaran Day in the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora.

History Established in 1929 as a local association of 152 dairy farms, until 2009 the creamery production was entirely based on 50 relatively small family dairies located on coastal lands of Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. It was one of only two dairy operations in the United States to have \\"free-farmed\\" certification, a designation related to the extraordinary quality of life attributed to cows who live in pastures. While most of the massive dairy operations in the Central Valley have grain fed cows, this coastal operation could boast that their cows ate fresh green grass nine months a year, causing them to live twice as long and produce significantly more butterfat. The co-op produced as much as 10 million gallons of ice cream annually in addition to milk, butter, cheese, and other products under its own label and a variety of other labels, and was the sole producer of Costco premium ice cream. This contract and purchases in 2004 of several other ice cream companies made it one of the largest ice cream producers in the western United States. The co-op originally provided fresh milk for local markets, and converted production in excess of local demand to butter and powdered milk for export. Production shifted from butter to ice cream when butter prices dropped following collapse of the Soviet Union. The organic label and related regional success helped the company prepare to go national in marketing at the end of 2008 at which time it was owned 75 percent by local farmers and 25 percent by Dairy Farmers of America. Financial problems came to light after the abrupt resignation of 12-year veteran CEO Rich Ghilarducci on February 20, 2009. Bankruptcy was filed two months later, resulting in the sale of assets of the Humboldt Creamery at auction on August 27, 2009, to Foster Farms Dairy for $19.25 million. The former CEO pleaded guilty to changing the values of the Creamery's receivables and payables for three years between 2005 and 2008. He was sentenced to 30 months in Federal prison and ordered to pay $7 million restitution for a \\"single count of making false statements to an agricultural credit bank\\". The bankruptcy proceedings and sale resulted in many changes for the company. Primary storage and production facilities remained at the original site in Fernbridge, California, and frozen products were still based in a Stockton, California, facility. However, under order of the Santa Rosa bankruptcy court, a more recently acquired facility in Los Angeles and older property located in Loleta, California, were divided off for separate sale. The operation and all of its products had always been free of synthetic or added rbST hormone.

Development The Silk 700S was launched in 1975 and featured a new engine based on the two stroke engine from the Scott Flying Squirrel in a specially designed steel tubular frame made by Spondon of Derbyshire, who also made the forks. At a cost of ¬£1355 it was more expensive than most other production motorcycles of the time. Right from the start the Silk 700S featured state of the art electronic ignition and had a power-to-weight ratio combined with excellent handling that enabled it to compete with some of the best road bikes of the time. Top speed was an impressive 110 mph. The bike did not have an electric start; the kick-starting technique took some practice. The 700S continued to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time. 200px As a precision engineering company, Silk were able to make the piston port twin-cylinder engine in-house at their Derbyshire workshops. The pressed up, four roller bearing crank had the primary drive taken from the crankshaft centre, to an inverted Velocette Venom four-speed gearbox. The two-stroke engine ran on a 50:1 petroil mix, with a separate oil tank reserved for main bearing lubrication fed by Silk's own design of oil pump. When the rider opened the throttle the oil flowed faster, ensuring best possible lubrication. The engine's claimed 48 bhp was developed at 6,000rpm, giving good touring performance, and peak torque was at 3,000rpm, comparable to the Suzuki GT750. Twin siamesed exhaust pipes fed an Ossa silencer. The wheels on early models were 18 inch Borrani alloy rims, replaced with six-spoke Campagnolo cast wheels on later Silks. The final drive chain was enclosed for longer life. The engine had no water pump, using instead a thermo-syphon cooling system. Coolant in the cylinder jackets absorbed engine heat and rose convectively via a rubber tube to the radiator. The cooled liquid was denser and returned through another tube to the base of the cylinders. The radiators on the early models were either from Scotts or Velocette LE's. The Silk Engineering company was taken over by the Kendal based Furmanite International Group in 1976 who continued production of the Silk 700S and in 1977 it was upgraded to the 700S Mk2, which Silk called the Sabre. Improvements from the Mk 1 included finned cylinder barrels, a redesigned seat, instruments, and rear light nacelle. In 1978 the 100th Silk motorcycle was produced and production continued until December 1979 when Silk realised they were losing ¬£200 with every motorcycle sold. In all, 138 Sabre's were sold.

Taxonomy Chrysomya albiceps is considered conspecific with Chrysomya rufifacies by some authorities. The two species have a similar biology and the morphological differences are slight (prostigmatic:File:Housefly anatomy-key.svg bristle present in C. albiceps absent in C. rufifacies (but not all rufifacies so this character is unreliable)).There are minor differences in larval morphology. The taxonomy of C. rufifacies is therefore not completely clear, and its relation to C. albiceps has not been fully determined. Distribution This species was originally spread in the African continent, southern Europe Fauna europaea and Asia. From the seventies it began to spread also in neo-tropical regions such as Colombia, Argentina, Peru and Paraguay. It is a very common species in the Mediterranean regions, and it is present in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Pakistan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Turkey. Habitat C. albiceps is a subtropical to temperate species. It is present at altitudes of , but it is more abundant at an elevation of above sea level. Description Chrysomya albiceps feeding on a flower of Dittrichia viscosa Chrysomya albiceps can reach a length of . In these blow flies, thorax and abdomen are metallic blue to green. Wings are completely hyaline. Thorax bears a row of thick bristles on the meron and greater ampulla and the head shows plumose arista. The third antennal segment is dark-grayish. In males frons of the head is very narrow and the eyes are very close to each other. Frons of females have a dark brown to black color. Biology Adults feed on many things including decaying matter, excreta, and flowers. This insect normally reproduces within carcasses of dead animals,James, Maurice. 1947. The Flies that Cause Myiasis in Man. Misc Publication 631 USDA. p 66-75 leaving eggs inside, usually together eggs of other species. Thus, although the first larvae feed on nutrients of decomposing tissues, the second and third series of larvae become predators, feeding on larvae of different species and even practicing cannibalism. Although eggs are normally deposited in decomposing tissues, they may, however, also be found in wounds of living tissues, both in animals and in humans. The ideal heat range for egg laying is 25¬∞ to 27¬∞o C. The duration of the larval stage may differ as a result of temperature. This species plays also a significant role as a voracious predator of other dipteran larvae during the maggot stage. At temperatures between 20 and 30 ¬∞C the life cycle of Chrysomya albiceps from egg to adult lasts about 66 days.  Human relevance Chrysomya albiceps is of great medical and sanitary importance, being associated with myiasis in Africa and America. It is also of importance in forensic science and forensic entomology because it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion due to their ability to smell dead animal matter from up to ten miles (16 km) away. C. albiceps belongs to the same genus as the other myiasis-causing flies Chrysomya bezziana and Chrysomya putoria. Bibliography * Erzinclioglu, Y.

The CLP was founded in 1974 and disbanded in 1993. The League of Revolutionaries for a New America was then founded by CLP members. During its lifetime, the CLP was frequently critical of the US Communist Party and the Soviet Union and refused to become closely aligned with other foreign communist parties. Established as a traditional industrial union party, the CLP began to reexamine its focus as the industrial workforce in the United States started declining in the 1980s. By 1993, CLP members had decided that the party could no longer grow in its present form and decided to disband it. History Communist League = In 1958, the Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Party (POC) split from the Communist Party of the United States. In 1968, Nelson Peery and his wife, Sue Ying Peery, led a small group out of the POC and formed the California Communist League (CL).. In California, several Mexican American groupings joined the CL. A group of African American autoworkers in Michigan, from the League of Revolutionary Black Workers merged into the CL. The CL organized forums with different left groups and individuals to develop a new communist party. These forums were held in several cities around the United States . Due its policy of advancing into leadership women, national minorities and workers, the CL had a leadership grouping different from other groups on the left. =CLP formation = In September 1974, CL members founded the CLP at a Congress in Chicago, Illinois. The newspaper of the CL, the Peoples Tribune/Tribuno del Pueblo, became the newspaper of the CLP. The CL's theoretical journal, Proletariat, was also continued by the CLP. In addition, the Western Worker, published by the CL was continued by the CLP. Nelson Peery was appointed leader In the \\"Documents of the First (Founding) Congress of the CLP(USNA), the preamble to the Party Program stated > \\"Basing ourselves on the ‚ÄòCommunist Manifesto‚Äô and the ‚ÄòProgram of the > Communist International,‚Äô the Marxist-Leninists of the USNA set out to rally > the revolutionary working class around the following program.‚Äù In the > program is the germ of the future analysis of the Party: \\"The trend toward > shifting the economic base from mechanics to electronics has not only > increased the reserve army of unemployed but also created a huge > qualitatively new army of permanently unemployed, especially amongst > national minority proletarians.‚Äù = Member requirements = The CLP required all members to study Marxist theoretical writings at weekly study sessions. Many members attended \\"cadre schools‚Äù which lasted for eight weeks, studying the Marxist classics full- time, six days a week. One of the CLP's fundamental positions was independence for the so-called \\"Negro Nation\\". They defined the Negro Nation as all people living in the Southern United States, including both African Americans and whites. The argument was that all those living within the boundaries of a nation were members of that nation. = Ethiopian relationship = In 1974 a military-led revolution installed a new regime in Ethiopia. For several years the CLP maintained relations with Ethiopian political activists and wrote reports and articles on developments in Ethiopia and Africa. The Soviet Union supported the new Ethiopian government. However, the CLP was critical of Soviet policies. Given the close relationship between the Ethiopian government and the Soviet Union, the CLP position in Ethiopia was quite precarious. Eventually the CLP had to leave and return to the US. =2nd Congress (1975)= The CLP held its 2nd Congress in November 1975. The Political Resolution at this Congress stated, \\"The struggle within the socialist camp is increasingly taking a national form ‚Äì a form that makes ever more difficult the militant expressions of solidarity of the revolutionary proletariat within the socialist sector.‚Äù And, \\"Our Party ‚Ä¶ does not choose national sides in this ... struggle that is taking place within the socialist camp. Our Party unconditionally supports revolution and conditionally supports states.‚Äù This Political Resolution also discussed globalization, with the CLP viewing it as a the consolidation of an international bourgeoisie. Just before the 3rd Congress, ten members left the CLP. Called the \\"action faction,‚Äù this faction wanted the CLP to become more active in and \\"build the movement.‚Äù The CLP position was that the time was not right for direct action. Instead, the CLP needed to spend more time building class consciousness.. Tension between these two perspectives continued throughout the life of the CLP. =3rd Congress (1980)= The third congress of the CLP was held in November 1980. The Political Resolution stated that \\"The tremendous production which was made possible because of World War II had become a tremendous overproduction.‚Äù The Resolution also stated that \\"The emphasis in the international class struggle is shifting from the national colonial struggle to the open collision of classes.‚Äù The CLP was focusing on what it termed class warfare in the United States as national liberation in other nations.. =1980s= In March 1981, the CLP published the first issue of Rally, Comrades! as the \\"official organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Labor Party.‚Äù Its purpose was to \\"rally the ideological leaders of the workers in order to rally the workers for the final conflict.‚Äù Rally, Comrades! was circulated internationally. During the early 1980s, Rally, Comrades! published a series of articles analyzing and criticizing the political leaders of the Soviet Union. The Peoples Tribune and the Tribuno del Pueblo continued to be published by the CLP but spoke to a broader audience. All papers were bilingual (English and Spanish). With the economic recessions of the 1980s the CLP became active in labor union struggles against contract concessions and in aiding undocumented workers and the homeless. The CLP also participated in the mayoral campaigns of Harold Washington in Chicago and the Jesse Jackson run for the 1988 presidential election. =4th Congress (1986)= The Political Report to the Fourth Congress (Nov. 1986) stated \\"For the first time there is a possibility of building a truly revolutionary party on the basis of the objective communist movement. That movement is nothing less than the galvanizing struggles of 50 million dispossessed, hungry, homeless and unemployed‚Äîthe most oppressed and exploited workers. This must be the firm foundation of our Party.‚Äù Here the CLP begins to clearly move away from the 3rd International conception of the industrial workers as the foundation of the communist party. With the application of electronics to the productive process, which accelerated in the 1970s and 80s, the industrial workers began to disappear from the workforce. Many left groups moved to base themselves in whatever unions remained, in spite of the fact that both public and private sector unions were radically declining in membership. The CLP began to seriously grapple with the transformation that was occurring within the working class. In the pamphlet, \\"Documents of the Fourth Congress,‚Äù the article \\"Explanation of the Party Program‚Äù quotes an 1890 letter written by Engels: \\"It is far more important that the movement should spread, proceed harmoniously, take root and embrace as much as possible the whole American proletariat than that it should start and proceed, from the beginning, on theoretically perfectly correct lines. There is no better road to theoretical clearness of comprehension than to learn by one‚Äôs own mistakes. And for a whole large class, there is no other road, especially for a nation so eminently practical and so contemptuous of theory as the Americans. The great thing is to get the working class to move as a class.‚Äù The Program of the Fourth Congress states, \\"We agitate to politically shake up the proletariat. The aim of our agitation is to draw the maximum number of workers into the political struggle. Communist propaganda is scientific, theoretical, political education. Our propaganda exposes capitalist production relations as the root cause of the social destruction rampant today. The class struggle is a political struggle; our propaganda convinces the workers that society cannot be organized to meet their basic demands without their seizing political power.‚Äù The Political Report to the Fourth Congress also sharply criticized the politics of the Communist Party (USA) focusing on the CP's advocacy of left-center unity. \\"For the CPUSA the most important goal is ‚Äòunity of the working class in the battle against the corporations.‚Äô By disregarding that imperialism objectively has split the working class‚Äîa phenomenon which Lenin identified over 75 years ago‚Äîthe CPUSA proclaims the lofty goal of uniting the working class. Towards this end it sacrifices all, including the interests of the most revolutionary sections of the working class.‚Äù Here the CLP is referring to Lenin‚Äôs statement that the super-profits from the exploitation of the colonial peoples are used to bribe a sector of the working class in the imperialist country and turn this sector into an ally of the ruling class against the non-bribed sector of the working class. And further, \\"... the increasing economic crisis has forced the so- called \\"center‚Äù to the right and with it the CPUSA has moved to the right as well.‚Äù =5th Congress (1991)= The most important document published by the CLP was a 30 page pamphlet entitled, \\"Entering an Epoch of Social Revolution.‚Äù It was written by Nelson Peery. However, it went through several revisions after discussions and comments from CLP members. It was first published in June 1989. The final version was published in April 1991, retaining the title, \\"Entering an Epoch of Social Revolution,‚Äù and issued as the \\"Political Report to the Fifth Congress of the Communist Labor Party.‚Äù In the pamphlet, the CLP stated that \\"Today‚Äîbecause the economic revolution is throwing workers out of the productive process‚Äîthis struggle tends not to be between worker and employer. It is between workers and various elements of the state: the police, welfare offices, federal agencies, school boards or public hospital bureaucracies.‚Äù The \\"Epoch‚Äù pamphlet also pointed out the fundamental problems in the Soviet Union. \\" =International Conference (1990)= \\"In November, 1990, CLP representatives met in London with the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Communist Party of Turkey . They agreed to publish an Information Bulletin and to actively seek out other parties to participate in this exchange of information.‚Äù (from Rally, Comrades! January 1991) The group issued a statement after the meeting which noted, \\"Today we are entering a qualitatively higher stage in the epoch of social revolution based on profound changes in the productive forces. The delegates discussed the main characteristics of these developments. These included the general aspects of the period of counter-revolution and reaction caused by the collapse of the world socialist system and the disintegration of the world communist movement. These are direct consequences of developments in the Soviet Union, not least its inability to cope with the continuing revolutionization of the productive forces.‚Äù One issue of an \\"International Information Bulletin‚Äù was published by the group before the CLP withdrew over political differences and the group disbanded. =6th Congress ‚Äì CLP disbands (1993)= On January 31, 1993, at the Sixth Congress, the CLP voted unanimously to disband. This proposal was thoroughly discussed leading up to the 6th Congress. While many members initially had serious questions about the move to disband, they were eventually won over. One of the main arguments was that the CLP had failed to recruit new people grow. Members believed that the organizational form of the CLP was not conducive to the further development of the revolutionary process. The \\"Call for the 6th Party Congress‚Äù (Rally, Comrades! Nov. 1992) raised the question, \\"What is the proper organizational form for revolutionaries in this quantitative stage of the revolution?‚Äù The Call states, \\"‚Ä¶ this is not a time of preparation for the seizure of power. This is the moment to organize and politicize the social revolution. This is a time to struggle for the unity and political clarity of the millions who are in the diverse and daily struggle for jobs, health care and the other necessities of their lives. =National Organizing Committee/League of Revolutionaries for a New America (1993)= In the January 1993 issue of Rally, Comrades! \\"An Open Letter‚Äù calling for a new organization was signed by Marian Kramer, President of the National Welfare Rights Union and General Baker, a UAW member and founder of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. In the same issue of the paper a \\"Call to form Organizing Committees to establish an organization to educate, organize, and finally lead the masses in the inevitable transformation of our society‚Äù was published. It was signed by five activists: Abdul Alkalimat, Nacho Gonzalez, Ethel Long-Scott, John Slaughter and Leona Smith. Also in that issue was a statement by the CLP supporting the Call. The new organization was initially called the National Organizing Committee and later became the League of Revolutionaries for a New America.

From 2007 to 2008, he served in the Azerbaijani Armed Forces forces in the Aghjabadi District, before being transferred to the Central Sports Club of the Ministry of Defence due to his status as a promising sportsman. Aghayev's father encouraged a love of sports in his three sons, and thus, Aghayev always intended to pursue a career in athletics. His oldest brother Ruslan trained in Judo, and his second oldest brother Rustam is a boxer. At 7 years old, he became involved in football, and at the same time, began training in karate under the instruction of his first coach Rafael Mammadov, going on to train for several years. Participating at the first national competitions, he was noticed and invited to train in one of the famous sports clubs of the Republic, Budokan, under the leadership of Fizuli Musayev. Career At the first championship of the Republic, Rafael won an overwhelming victory over all his rivals and was noted by the President of the National Karate Federation, Yashar Bashirov, who saw great potential in him and his unusual fighting tactics. Aghayev was very diligent and had a will to win, but he lacked international experience. He first took part in the National Team in 1997, at an open World Cup in Miskolc, Hungary. At the international level competitions, his first performances were not successful, but the next year he won the Open Championship of England and from then on performed very well. At his first World Championship among Cadets and Juniors, which was held in 2001 in Athens Greece, he won 3rd place in the team event, and the following year became the European Champion. Thus, up to this day, he holds the lead in his weight class. Despite his young age, he managed to achieve all of the highest sporting victories in karate; he is a multiple European Champion and repeated World Champion. Astonishingly, at one World Championship he was able to win two gold medals. This happened in 2008 at the 18th World Championship in Tokyo, when he won in the 70 kg weight category and in the open category. The President of the World Karate Federation, Antonio Espinosa called him the \\"Diamond of the Karate World.\\" Hidayat Shabanov, a senior team coach, played an important role in Aghayev's career. For more than 8 years, Shabanov trained him and shared in his victories. For outstanding sports achievements at the international arena, Aghayev has repeatedly received awards from the National Olympic Committee, the Ministry of Youth and Sport of Azerbaijan Republic, and for several consecutive years he ranked amongst the ten best sportsmen of the country. From the official sponsor of the Federation, the International Bank of Azerbaijan, he received the keys for a new apartment in one of the elite areas of the city, as well as an Audi Q7. Currently, Rafael Aghayev is captain of the Azerbaijan Team, and is continuing to train and perform under the guidance of new senior coach Rahman Hatamov. In June 2015, Azerbaijan was the host country for the inaugural European Games. Competing in karate, more specifically Kumite for 75 kilograms, he earned a gold medal. Outside Karate Despite all the merits and achievements in sports Rafael in everyday life is very unpretentious and conducts a plain living. His zodiac sign is Pisces. He spends his spare time watching movies, playing soccer and chatting with friends. Rafael has an amazing character, in any company he becames a leader and knows how to find the correct way out of difficult situations. The leadership of the National Karate Federation created all favorable conditions for training and performances at international competitions. Rafael receives a monthly scholarship for financial stability. Rafael's calendar is very eventful because he has many fans around the world, who are waiting for his arrival with great impatience. Practically every month he receives invitations from different continents and countries of the world to conduct various educational and training seminars, team practice sessions, and tournaments. The invitations also come from countries that favor the sport of karate, such as France, Germany, Spain, the United States of America, Canada etc., where the best specialists are studying scrutinizing the style and tactics of martial arts followed by Rafael. Despite this, Rafael Aghayev remains unconquerable.

By measuring the amount of time an animal spends in an area that has been associated with a stimulus, researchers can infer the animal's liking for the stimulus. This paradigm can also be used to measure conditioned place aversion with an identical procedure involving aversive stimuli instead. Both procedures usually involve mice or rats as subjects.Campbell J., Wood R., Spear L. (2000) Cocaine and morphine-induced place conditioning in adolescent and adult rats. Physiol Behav 68:487‚Äì493Adriani W., Laviola G. (2002) Spontaneous novelty seeking and amphetamine-induced conditioning and sensitization in adult mice: evidence of dissociation as a function of age at weaning. Neuropsychopharmacology 27:225‚Äì236. This procedure can be used to measure extinction and reinstatement of the conditioned stimulus. Certain drugs are used in this paradigm to measure their reinforcing properties. Two different methods are used to choose the compartments to be conditioned, and these are biased vs. unbiased. The biased method allows the animal to explore the apparatus, and the compartment they least prefer is the one that the drug is administered in and the one they most prefer is the one where the vehicle is injected.Prus, AJ., James, JR., Rosecrans, AJ.(2009). Methods of Behavioral Analysis in Neuroscience. Augusta, CRC press. This method allows the animal to choose the compartment they get the drug and vehicle in. In comparison, the unbiased method does not allow the animal to choose what compartment they get the drug and vehicle in and instead the researcher chooses the compartments. Humans have also been shown to develop conditioned place preferences; for example, people taking therapeutic doses of amphetamine develop a CPP for where they consumed the drug. Conditioned place preference apparatus Different floor textures in conditioned place preference Conditioning procedure Conditioned place preference protocol As in Pavlovian conditioning, an initially neutral stimulus, in this case environmental cues, is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally produces a response prior to conditioning (the unconditioned response). Over time and pairings the neutral stimulus will come to elicit responses similar to the unconditioned response. In conditioned place preference the unconditioned stimulus could be any number of things including food pellets,Spyraki C, Fibiger HC, Phillips AG (1982) Attenuation by haloperidol of place preference conditioning using food reinforcement.

The initially neutral environmental cues become associated with the motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus leading to either approach or avoidance of the environment. Often in practice there is a control and treatment group used to strengthen the ability to make causal claims from the results. The treatment group is administered the unconditioned stimulus while the control group is given saline or nothing to control for all elements of the procedure.Cunningham, C., Gremel, C. & Groblewski, P. (2006). Drug-induced conditioned place preference and aversion in mice. Nature Protocols, 1(4), 1662-1670. =Apparatus= The conditioned place preference protocol makes use of an apparatus that contains two or more compartments or areas. These two compartments are designed so that the animal can discriminate between them. Differently patterned walls or floors or different types of floor texture may be used to ensure the animal can discriminate between the compartments. =Steps to conditioning place preference or aversion= Conditioned place preference involves three phases: habituation, conditioning and preference testing. Habituation In the habituation procedure the animal is given a chance to explore the apparatus. This is done to reduce the effects of novelty and usually consists of one five-minute trial. Conditioning In the conditioning phase the unconditioned stimulus (e.g. morphine) is administered to the animal (usually a mouse or rat) in the treatment group. In this phase of the procedure the animal is only allowed access to one compartment of the apparatus.Bardo, M. & Bevins, R. (2000). Conditioned place preference: what does it add to our preclinical understanding of drug reward? Psychopharmacology. 153, 31-43. This compartment will become associated with the motivational effects of the unconditioned stimulus. The environment will come to elicit approach or avoidance-withdrawal depending on the nature of the unconditioned stimulus. The conditioning procedure usually consists of eight or more five-minute sessions. Preference testing In the preference testing phase, the animal is allowed unrestricted access to all compartments of the apparatus. During the test, the time a subject spends in each compartment is measured in seconds. Modern protocols utilize commercial automated tracking systems to measure the time; however, manual measurement is also used. Statistical testing is used to determine whether a significant difference in time is present when compared to either a control group, or the pre-conditioning time of the same group (baseline value). Strength of conditioning is inferred by the magnitude of the difference or in the amount of time taken for the response to show extinction. =Outcomes= In the standard conditioned place preference procedure, when the unconditioned stimulus is rewarding, rodents will be more likely to approach the compartment that contains cues associated with it. Alternatively, when the unconditioned stimulus is aversive, rodents will be more likely to escape and avoid the compartment that contains cues associated with it. Timing of presentation of the unconditioned stimulus can determine whether place preference or aversion will be conditioned. For example, in trials testing drugs of abuse, if the animal experiences the initial pleasurable effects of the drug while in the conditioning context, the result will likely be conditioned place preference. However, if the animal is given the drug and then the experimenter implements a sufficient delay so that the animal is experiencing the negative after effects of the drug, conditioned place aversion is more likely to occur. The timing of these events can be manipulated by the experimenter in order to condition place preference or avoidance. Advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages= There are numerous advantages of the conditioned place preference and aversion protocol. It is methodologically simple and only requires two to three weeks to perform all steps of the procedure. In some cases conditioning can occur with two stimulus-context pairings.Cunningham, C.L., Tull, L.E., Rindal, K.E. & Meyer, P.J. Distal and proximal pre-exposure to ethanol in the place conditioning task: tolerance to aversive effect, sensitization to activating effect, but no change in rewarding effect. Psychopharmacology 160, 414‚Äì424 (2002). It allows both rewarding and aversive effects to be tested and it provides unique information about the motivational effects of unconditioned stimuli. Although the protocol is most often used with mice and rats, it can be adapted for use in other species such as birds and other rodents.Hughes RA, Baker MR, Rettig KM (1995) Cocaine-conditioned place preference in young precocial domestic fowl. Exp Clinical Psychopharmacology 3:105‚Äì111.Meisel, R. & Joppa, M. (1993). Conditioned place preference in female hamsters following aggressive or sexual encounters. Physiology and behaviour, 56(5), 1115-1118. In drug testing the conditioned reward or aversive effects can be tested in a drug-free state where the animals will not be impaired due to drug use. The testing is also sensitive to the effects of low drug doses. Conditioned place preference is well suited to measure the temporal profile of drugs (the pattern of rewarding and aversive effects) as well as the aversive effects of withdrawal. This can be done by varying the time of drug administration in relation to presentation of the to- be-conditioned context.Cunningham, C.L., Okorn, D.M. & Howard, C.E. Interstimulus interval determines whether ethanol produces conditioned place preference or aversion in mice. Anim. Learn. Behav. 25, 31‚Äì42 (1997); Fudala, P.J. & Iwamoto, E.T. Conditioned aversion after delay place conditioning with nicotine. Psychopharmacology 92, 376‚Äì381 (1987). The procedure also can be utilized to measure the neural circuits involved in drug reward.Carr, G.D., Fibiger, H.C. & Phillips, A.G. The Neuropharmacological Basis of Reward. (ed. Copper, J.M.L.S.J.) 264‚Äì319 (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1989). =Disadvantages= The conditioned place preference and aversion protocol is subject to several disadvantages and limitations. Perhaps the most significant disadvantage is that despite experimenters' best attempts to habituate animals to the procedure before conditioning, novelty seeking effects can skew the data.Hughes RN (1968) Behavior of male and female rats with free choice of two environments differing in novelty. Animal Behavior 16:92‚Äì96; Bardo MT, Bowling SL, Robinet PM, Rowlett JK, Lacy M, Mattingly BA (1993) Role of D1 and D2 receptors in noveltymaintained place preference. Exp Clinical Psychopharmacology 1:101‚Äì109. Another limitation of the procedure is the distinction between a biased and an unbiased CPP-apparatus. Some authors indicate the importance to declare in the publication, which type of CPP-box has been used.Cunningham, C.L., Ferree, N.K. & Howard, M.A. Apparatus bias and place conditioning with ethanol in mice. Psychopharmacology 170, 409‚Äì422 (2003); Bevins, R.A. & Cunningham, C.L. in Tasks and Techniques: A Sampling of Methodologies for the Investigation of Animal Learning, Behavior, and Cognition (ed. Anderson, M.J.) (Nova Science Publishers, Inc., Hauppauge, NY, in the press). Thus a pretest is needed to define a possibly existing preference to one compartment. In a biased context, it is to show an absolute CPP to the initially non-preferred place. Otherwise, for instance when anxiolytic drugs are used as the rewarding agent, we can interpret an only relative place preference to be derived from the anxiolytic effect of the drug. On the other hand, with a biased design, we can distinguish between the anxiolytic and antiaversive effects of drugs independently from potential genuine rewarding effects.Tzschentke T.M. in Progress in Neurobiology (1998): Measuring reward with the conditioned place preference paradigm: A comprehensive review of drug effects. Recent progress and new issues. p.216-217 In addition, individuals who will be handling animals must be trained to do this consistently so as to minimize stress to the animal. It has been shown that stressful handling in rodents can weaken conditioning.Bechtholt, A.J., Gremel, C.M. & Cunningham, C.L. Handling blocks expression of conditioned place aversion but not conditioned place preference produced by ethanol in mice. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 79, 739‚Äì744 (2004). There is debate over whether or not the results obtained from drug studies can be generalized to drug reward in humans. It has been claimed that since the animal passively receives the drug, it cannot be compared.Dworkin, S. & Smith, J. in NIDA Research Monograph (ed. Harris, L.S.) 266‚Äì274. (US Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD, 1988). Extinction and reinstatement proceduresExtinction= Extinction in the conditioned place preference paradigm is the process by which the association of the place compartment with the paired aversives or appetitive stimulus is greatly reduced, thus diminishing the place preference or aversion.Cherry, K. (2012). What is extinction?. Retrieved from http://psychology.about.com/od/eindex/g/extinction.htm Extinction occurs when the conditioned stimulus is presented on repeated trials without the presence of the appetitive or aversive stimulus. For example, if the animal had been given a reinforcing food stimulus when in one place compartment and established a preference for this place, the extinction process would be implemented by placing the animal in the compartment but not giving it the reinforcing food stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) while it was in the compartment. The extinction process can be used with knockout mice to establish whether certain receptors are particularly involved in the extinction process. Extinction is also used by researchers to study different forms of reinstatement.Bahi, A. (2012) The selective metabatropic glutamate receptor 7 allosteric agonist AMN082 prevents reinstatement of extinguished ethanol induced conditioned place preference in mice. Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior. 101, 93-100. =Reinstatement= Reinstatement is a method used in animal testing procedures including CPP and self- administration. It is often used to model the behavior of drug relapse in humans, although its validity is a topic of debate. Reinstatement is the rapid reacquisition of an extinct behavior, which is caused by either the presentation of the unconditioned stimulus, by stress, or by context cues. This shows that the process of extinction does not completely eliminate an association, since the association between the UCS and the CS can be rapidly reacquired.Bouton, M.(2007). Learning and Behavior. A contemporary synthesis. Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers. In the context of conditioned place preference, after a place preference has been extinguished, the behavior is said to be reinstated when the animal quickly reacquires their place preference after repeated extinction trials have caused the preference to be extinguished. This has implications for research on drug relapse. There are two main modes of action for which reinstatement is often tested in the conditioned place preference paradigm. One is by introducing the animal (generally rats or mice are used) to stress. The other is by giving them a small dose of the unconditioned stimulus. In the case of CPP, when drugs are used to establish conditioned place preference, this is called drug priming.Tzschentke, T.(2007). Measuring reward with the conditioned place preference(CPP) paradigm: update of the last decade. Addiction Biology. 12, 227-462. Primed induced reinstatement Primed induced reinstatement is a test in CPP whereby the unconditioned stimulus is given to the animal after the association between the UCS and CS has been extinguished. Administration of the UCS primes the association with the CS (place compartment) and stimulates the reacquisition of the place preference. Drugs of abuse such as cocaine and heroin have a particularly strong ability to be reinstated through priming, which is known as drug-primed reinstatement. Drug primed reinstatement is thought to renew the incentive value of the place compartment because of the motivational effects of the drug.Brown RM, Short JL, Lawrence AJ (2010) Identification of Brain Nuclei Implicated in Cocaine-Primed Reinstatement of Conditioned Place Preference: A Behaviour Dissociable from Sensitization. PLoS ONE 5(12): e15889. Drug-primed reinstatement has been tested in CPP primarily with psychostimulants and opiates. Reinstatement with drug primes depends on the dose of the drug that is given to the animal. Small administrations of the drug-prime will generally not produce reinstatement whereas higher doses will. One area of the brain that is linked to reinstatement of place preference through drug priming is the lateral habenula Drug-primed reinstatement of cocaine has shown to also be reinstated by administration of similar psychostimulants including methamphetamine and methylphenidateItzhak, Y., Martin, J.(2001). Cocaine-induced Conditioned Place Preference in Mice: Induction, Exctinction and Reinstatement by Related Psychostimulants. Neuropsychopharmacology. 26(1), 130-134. All three of these psychostimulants increase the amount of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens by blocking reuptake of dopamine, which is presumed to mediate the drugs rewarding effects. This is also the case with morphine. Administration of morphine, heroin and cocaine induce reinstatement or morphine induced CPP.Lu, L., Xiu, NJ., Ge, X., Yu, W., Su, WJ., Pei, G., Ma., L.(2002). Reactivation of morphine conditioned place preference by drug priming: role of environmental cues and sensitization. Psychopharmacology. 159, 125-132. Stress induced reinstatement In the conditioned place preference paradigm, stress has been shown to reinstate conditioned place preferences in rats after the preference had been extinguished. This has implications for research on addiction because of the effect that stress has on human relapse behavior. Stress induced reinstatement in CPP occurs when the animal is exposed to stress after a place preference has been extinguished. This exposure leads to reinstatement of the place preference. Common stressors used in these paradigms include foot-shock and noiseLu, L., Shepard, J., Hall, F., Shaham, Y. (2003). Effect of Environmental stressors on opiate and psychostimulant reinforcement, reinstatement, and discrimination in rats: a review. Neuroscience and Behavioral Review. 27, 457-491. Some studies have shown that when drugs of abuse are used as appetitive stimuli, exposure to stress can reinstate place preference that has been extinguished over two weeks.Wang, B., Luo, F., Zhang, W., Han, J.(2000). Stress or drug priming induces reinstatment of extinguished conditioned place preference. NeuroReport. 11(1221), 2781-2784. When rats experience stress in the form of foot-shock or noise, changes occur in the norepinephrine system and the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis. These changes have a high impact on the reinstatement conditioned place preference. Stress stimulates the release of corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) from the rat's hypothalamus which leads to a series of changes through the pituitary gland in the brain to release glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands. CRH also stimulates the release of neurotransmitter in the hypothalamic regions of the brain to mediate stress-induced changes in brain activityErb, S., Salmaso, N., Rodaros, d., Stewart, J.(2001). A role for the CRF-containing pathway from central nucleus of the amygdala to bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rats. Psychopharmacology. 158, 360-365. This system plays a key role in the reinstatement of conditioned place preference. CRH acts as a neurotransmitter in regions of the brain including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the amygdala. Reinstatement of conditioned place preference has shown to be blocked when antagonists for CRH receptors are injected into the BNST. In other words, the effects of stress on reinstatement can be inhibited by blocking the receptor sites for CRH in certain areas of the brain. The neurotrasmitter noradrenaline also plays a role in stress induced reinstatement.Mantsch, J., Weyer, A., Vranjikovic, O., Beyer, C., Baker, D., Caretta, H.(2010). Involvement of the noradrenergic neurotransmission in the stress- but not cocaine-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine induced conditioned place preference in mice: Role of b-2 receptors. Neuropsychopharmacology. 35(2), 2165-2178. Blockage of certain noradrenergic receptors inhibit stress-induced reinstatement. Furthermore, disinhibition of areas of the brain which inhibit the release or noradrenaline also nullify the effect of stress-induced reinstatement. Together, the noradrenaline and CRH systems play a key role in the stress-induced reinstatement of conditioned place preference and provide knowledge of the neurochemical basis of stress- induced relapse. =Relapse= Research on stress and drug-primed reinstatement has implications for treatment of addiction research in humans. Reinstatement studies on stress and drug primes provide evidence for their role in relapse behavior in humans.Katz, JL, Higging, ST(2003). The validity of the reinstatement model of craving and relapse to drug use.Psychopharmacology.168, 21-30. In addition to conditioned placed preference, animal testing using self-administration procedures have also been used to examine potential causes of relapse in humans. Stress and drug-primes have also shown to contribute to relapse behaviour in humans.Stewart, J.(2000). Pathways to relapse: the neurobiology of drug and stress-induced relapse to drug taking. Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience.25(2), 125-136. With the knowledge that stress and drug primes contribute to relapse behavior, measures to avoid stressful situations can help addicts avoid returning to their addictive behaviors. Drug priming is thought to induce relapse in humans because of their effects on the reward circuits of the brain. Repeated drug exposure is thought to sensitize the rewarding effect of the drug and exposure to the drug after extinction can reintroduce this rewarding effect. These effects play a key role in the persistence of drug-seeking behaviors. Researchers use the reinstatement procedure to test the ability of certain drugs to inhibit these different types of reinstatement. One such drug that has been shown to have attenuating effects on reinstatement is mecamylamine. This is a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist which, if administered after extinction trials, can block the reinstatement of the conditioned place preference for nicotine and opiates.Biala, GG., Staniak, NN., Budzynska, BB.(2010). Effects of varenicline and mecamylamineon the acquisition, expression, and reinstatement of nicotine conditioned place preference by drug priming in rats. Naunyn-Schmied Arch Pharmacol. 381, 361-370. Although direct causal linkages cannot be assumed between reinstatement in the conditioned place preference procedure and relapse in humans, it provides a solid first step in the process of creating drugs that may one day be used to treat relapse in humans. Knockout mice Knockout mice are used to demonstrate behavioural or physiological differences Knockout mice are genetically modified mice that have had certain genes selectively removed. The removal of certain genes allows researchers to study the effects of certain genes missing and the implications of missing genes on physiology and behaviour. =Cocaine= Genetic knockouts of the dopamine transporter failed to eliminate the conditioned place preference of cocaine, implying there may be different mechanisms of cocaine's reinforcing properties.Sora, I., Hall, F.S., Andrews, A.M., Itokawa, M., Li, X.F., Wei, H.B., Wichems, C., Lesch, K.P., Murphy, D.L., & Uhl, G.R. (2001). Molecular mechanisms of cocaine reward: combined dopamine and serotonin transporter knockouts eliminate cocaine place preference. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98, 5300‚Äì5305. Mice lacking the noradrenaline transporter and serotonin transporter separately or at the same time demonstrated an enhanced conditioned place preference. No conditioned place preference was found in knockout mice lacking serotonin receptor 5-HT1B.Belzung, C., Scearce-Levie, K., Barreau, S., & Hen, R. (2000). Absence of cocaine-induced place conditioning in serotonin 1B receptor knock- out mice. Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behaviour, 66, 221‚Äì225. =Nicotine= Genetic knockouts of nicotinic receptor subunit Œ≤2 in mice resulted in a lack of conditioned place preference.Walters, L., Brown, S., Changeux, J., Martine, B., & Damaj, M.I. (2006). The Œ≤2 but not Œ±7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is required for nicotine-conditioned place preference in mice. Psychopharmacology, 184, 339-344. This further compiling information of the importance of the nAChR subunit Œ≤2 in nicotine's reinforcing properties. Studies also show a lack of conditioned place preference in CB1 receptor knockout mice,Castane, A., Valjent, E., Ledent, C., Parmentier, M., Maldonado, R., & Valverde, O.

But Lisa does and tries to plot and scheme between Fabian and Judith, so she can have him for her own. When Judith finds out, that Fabian slept with Lisa, but doesn't want anything to do with her, she is very disappointed in him and believes that he only uses women. Meanwhile, Constantin von Lahnstein (Milan Marcus) gets interested in Judith. But when he discovers that Judith only can't be together with Fabian because of Lisa's schemes, he tells Judith the truth. Judith finds herself in the middle, when she is confronted with her flirtation to Constantin and her still deep feelings for Fabian. She finally works things out with Fabian and they come together.

Judith is conflicted at first about the relation to her ex-boyfriend, but is then fine with it. But David only sees Judith as a good friend and no matter what she does, David doesn't fall for her. She tells Constantin about her lovesickness and doesn't guess about his feelings for her. Instead, Constantin tries to be a good friend and help her to get over David. But Judith tries the opposite and wants to make herself to David's dream girl. Constantin tells her over and over again, that she shouldn't do that for anyone and just be herself. When Judith finally realizes that Constantin feels more for her than just friends, she confronts him. Constantin confesses his love for her and also that he well knows she doesn't feel the same thing for him. After that, the friendship between them gets very complicated.

But later Constantin visits her to say goodbye before returning to London. He can't hide his feelings and the two end up sleeping together. After that, he tells Judith that he lied and that he hasn't a girlfriend waiting for him. He was just afraid, knowing that the two would have no future with Constantin in England. Judith then admits to Olli (Jo Weil) that she's over Constantin and agrees with him to be just friends. But they both can't stop thinking about each other. Constantin spends Judith a surprise visit, where he asks her if she missed him. Judith confesses that she was just thinking about him. He doesn't know if that's enough, but he asks her to come with him to London anyway. Judith is happy, kisses Constantin and agrees to go with him. They just pack one bag, before saying goodbye to Olli and Christian and leaving D√ºsseldorf. When Constantin came back, he told his friends that he and Judith had recently broken up.

Horror is one of three popular genres into which most Cambodian films can be loosely grouped, the other two being period pieces and melodrama/romantic drama. The fledgling Cambodian industry of the mid 2000s looked to capitalize on the world-wide popularity of Japanese horror films which have heavily influenced Cambodian horror films. Common themes are ghost or spirit hauntings, possession, folk mythology and revenge by supernatural means. The storytelling takes a slower pace than Western horror and relies on suspense, a pervasive sense of doom and dread, and psychologically disturbing events and situations. Unlike its Japanese counterparts however, many Cambodian horror films also feature over the top gore as seen in Western horror. History One of the earliest successful Cambodian Horror movies was the 1970s film The Snake King's Wife by Tia Kim Kon. Other films followed such as Crocodile Man, The Snake King's Wife Part 2, The Snake girl and My Mother is Arb. These films found success both in Cambodia and abroad. Although the Cambodian Civil War was being waged in the provinces during this era, there were up to 33 cinemas operating in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Always full of viewers, the theaters provided an escape from the realities of war and taxes imposed on the brisk ticket sales provided the weakening government with a source of revenue with which to fight the encroaching Khmer Rouge. As the war began to threaten Phnom Penh in 1974, cinemas began to close and movie production all but halted. When the Khmer Rouge gained control of the government in 1975, the new regime abolished institutional establishments such as currency, education, markets and private property. Movie production in Cambodia ceased to exist as artists, producers, actors and singers were executed to \\"get rid of any Western legacy of the capitalist ideology\\". After the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia ended Khmer Rouge rule in 1979, cinemas began to open again, but only showed foreign films (specifically from Vietnam, the USSR, and Soviet Bloc countries) due to lack of both human and material resources to make movies locally. Despite these films being mostly propaganda vehicles with some from the romance genre, moviegoers starving for entertainment flocked to the hot, overcrowded theaters, standing in line for hours for a chance to buy tickets or bribe security guards to get in. This public enthusiasm led to the revival of the native Cambodian film industry in 1987. Horror films were still not allowed, however, as financial backing came primarily from Vietnam and the USSR and movies could not offend the Vietnamese-backed government. The new themes introduced by the Cambodian- produced films, including romance stories and tales of hardship under Khmer Rouge rule, were widely popular which resulted in 215 production companies and almost 40 theaters in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Battambang. Yet, once again, this revival was short-lived, as the 1991 withdrawal of the Vietnamese from Cambodia and the subsequent United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia opened the markets to massively copied high budget foreign films from Hong Kong and serialized television soaps from Thailand. Most Cambodian film companies were forced out of business but the competition from television and foreign markets also raised the standards of the few remaining companies and a couple movies were produced that presaged the rising popularity of the Horror genre. The 2003 Phnom Penh riots, aimed at Thai institutions and ostensibly caused by anti-Cambodian comments allegedly made by a Thai actress, resulted in the banning of Thai soap operas and films which by that time had represented the majority of screen time in Cambodia. This allowed Cambodian producers to once again fill the vacuum and just happened to coincide with the worldwide popularity of J-Horror (Japanese Horror films), spurred on in part by the success of the US remake of Ring. Modern films Modern Khmer producers have catered to the young public's taste for movies within the horror genre but domestic production companies typically have low budgets and employ weak special effects. Nonetheless, these horror movies, after decades of absence, have been very successful with local audiences, especially among the younger demographic groups. Korm Chanthy, the manager of FCI Productions, which made the popular 2004 Nieng Arp, said \\"We make movies to suit the domestic market and the demand of our youths and they like to watch horror movies because they make them feel excited, thrilled and terrified\\". Between 2004 and 2006, the domestic producers made nearly 20 horror films per year. Since 2004, almost 50% of Khmer films were of the horror genre. The most prolific producers of these horror films were FCI Production and Campro Production, a company founded in 2003 by young producer and computer entrepreneur Heng Tola and several friends. Although Campro Production closed in 2007, these two companies provided the Cambodian market over 15 horror films as of 2011. Budgets were typically very small and special effects were often lackluster compared to foreign horror movies. Making an entire movie took Campro about three months and cost an average of US$30,000, including $1,000 for the lead actor. The 2001 Thai-Khmer joint film The Snake King's Child, a retelling of 1971's The Snake King's Wife, was recognized as the first Cambodian horror film to be released since before the Khmer Rouge era. The movie was a comparatively tame film, adapted from an old folk tale and not displaying the characteristic elements of the later, post-2003, horror films. The popularity of The Snake King's Child inspired a sequel, The Snake King's Grandchild, which involved a ghost story based on the mythology of the ap (Thai: krasue) legend. In early 2003, the film Kohak Kmorch Tek Snech Asara Peak, a period ghost film was released. A psychological thriller, The Weird Villa, produced by Angkor Wat Production and written by Pan Phuong Bopha, achieved some box office success and was considered one of the outstanding films of the year. It was followed by several major grossing horror films including Nieng Arp (English title: Lady Vampire), also centered on the popular ap legend, and Ghost Banana Tree, produced by Campro Production. Films developed after 2003 featured several remakes, mostly of foreign films, including Neang Neath, Neang Pomiry, and the 2006 hit The Killing Phone which is a remake of the Thai movie 999-9999 and includes homages to Ringu and One Missed Call.·ûó·û∂·ûñ·ûô·üí·ûè·ûì·ûÅ·üÇ·üí·ûò·ûö·ûä·üÇ·ûõ·ûÖ·üÜ·ûõ·ûÑ·ûñ·û∏·ûî·ûö·ûë·üÅ·ûü, A Movies and The culture around The World. Top grossing and award winning horror films from this era include The Crocodile, a tale about the heroism of a man who killed the beast responsible for the deaths of several people in his village. Released in 2005, The Crocodile cost over $100,000 to make, the highest budgeted Cambodian production to date, won several awards and was re-released in 2007 due to its popularity. Other notable 2005 releases were The Forest, a graphic film which won an award for best special effects, and The Haunted House, both produced by Campro Production. Governmental criticism In the Third Khmer film festival which was held in late 2007, horror films were banned from competition on the grounds that too many horror movies had been made. , Naraths. The Khmer Culture and Film ministry suggested that Khmer film makers should decrease their production of works in the horror genre despite their immense popularity with local audiences, especially the younger generation. In addition, a recent downturn in the domestic film market has left some producers believing the horror genre is serving to keep Cambodian cinema alive. According to Heng Tola, the current popularity of horror movies is waning in favor of \\"a more serious\\" emerging trend, both fueled by and feeding into the bitterness many Cambodians still hold on to regarding their country's recent history, specifically the humiliation of colonialism and losing territory, respect and political, economic and military prestige to powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam. Themes Cambodian horror films, like those of Thailand, are heavily influenced by popular Japanese and Korean horror films but also display elements from Western (American) horror as well. The plot of Cambodian horror films generally center on a ghost story, physically or psychologically violent revenge, spirit hauntings or possessions, or myths taken from Cambodian folk religion such as the ap. , Movies Culture Religions Belief Entertainment around The World. Films featuring ghost stories, mythology and blood rituals include Ghost Banana Tree and The Kantong Kiev Witch. One film, The Haunted House, is loosely based on an actual urban legend surrounding a supposedly haunted house in Kampong Chhnang Province. Similar to more widely known Japanese movies, the more popular films rely on storytelling that takes a slower pace than Western horror, building suspense and focusing on the characters' suffering and anguish. A pervasive sense of doom and dread is maintained by portraying psychologically disturbing situations and events. In a departure from the East Asian formula, however, Cambodian films often feature over-the-top gore and cheaply overdone effects. Popular horror films in this modern vein that emphasize psychological terror include The Weird Villa, Secret Well (from √Ångkor Wat Productions), and Heart Talk, a 2008 Khmer Mekong Films production written by British novelist and screenwriter Matt Baylis., Naraths. Films with revenge motifs are usually based on unrequited or betrayed love and often feature the offended person, who either is killed or commits suicide, rising from the dead either as a ghostly apparition or a spirit that can possess other bodies. The plots are usually resolved only after sufficient revenge has been taken or when the ghost or spirit is defeated by a holy man (an Achaa, Ruesi, or Khru) or a Buddhist Monk. Popular revenge-themed movies include Villa Horror, Annoyed and Moheagita. Cambodian \\"monster\\" films are another subgenre of horror. Although considered a relatively new subgenre, these movies are just extensions of the older folk mythology type films with different monsters. Similar to the older Snake King films, these low-budget monster films employ lots of outdoor cinematography and amateurish special effects. The characters in monster movies are usually groups of teens on outings or cross country journeys without adult supervision. Well known examples of monster films are The Forest, Queen of Cobra and People eating Lizard. Slasher films haven't been very common but a few have been made in Cambodia. Most portray many adolescent victims killed in a typically random, unprovoked fashion usually within a single night. The first slasher film produced by a Cambodian company was The Waterfall of Death, which has noted similarities to the American murder thriller I Know What You Did Last Summer and the Thai psychological killer film Scared.

Moustapha was dismissed from the government on 18 June 1983.Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 20 (1983), page 6,864. When multiparty politics was introduced in 1990, Moustapha was a founding member of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP), an opposition party, and he became that party's National Vice-President. He was elected to the National Assembly in the March 1992 parliamentary election as a UNDP candidate in Diamar√© constituency.List of deputies elected in 1992, National Assembly website . After Paul Biya won the October 1992 presidential election, he appointed Moustapha to the government as Deputy Prime Minister for Urban Planning and Housing on 27 November 1992.Milton H. Krieger and Joseph Takougang, African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads (2000), Westview Press, page 161. This appointment, which Moustapha accepted, was made without the approval of the UNDP's leadership and was denounced by UNDP President Maigari Bello Bouba,Joseph Takougang, \\"The Nature of Politics in Cameroon\\", The Leadership Challenge in Africa: Cameroon Under Paul Biya (2004), ed. John Mukum Mbaku and Joseph Takougang, page 83. but Moustapha was not expelled from the party at that time. Some believed that Biya intended for real power in the government to be exercised by Moustapha and the other Deputy Prime Minister, Andze Tsoungui, and not by Prime Minister Simon Achidi Achu. Moustapha and Tsoungui were francophones, while Achu was an anglophone.Joseph Takougang, \\"Cameroon: Biya and Incremental Reform\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 171. After Moustapha and Issa Tchiroma again accepted positions in the government as part of a July 1994 cabinet reshuffle, Bello Bouba said on 23 July 1994 that this would mean the end of their membership in the UNDP. Subsequently, while visiting Maroua on 30 July 1994, Moustapha's car was attacked at the Makabaye bridge by people throwing stones at it. As a result, the car went off the road, with one person being killed and a number of others being injured.\\"Northern Cameroon: Attacks on Freedom of Expression by Governmental and Traditional Authorities\\" , Article 19, July 1995. 28 UNDP members were arrested for the attack.\\"U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 1994 - Cameroon\\" , 30 January 1995. The UNDP denied responsibility and blamed the government for the attack, saying that it was used as a pretext for a crackdown on the UNDP. Moustapha and Tchiroma challenged their removal from the party, but they were expelled by the UNDP Central Committee in January 1995.African State and Society in the 1990s, page 199. Following their expulsion, Moustapha and Tchiroma established their own \\"authentic\\" faction of the UNDP, rejecting Bello Bouba's leadership. This faction then became the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress (ANDP), a new party featuring a slight alteration of the UNDP's name, and it was legally recognized on 31 August 1995;List of political parties in Cameroon . Moustapha became the ANDP's National President. Despite their creation of a new party, Moustapha and Tchiroma still legally contested Bello Bouba's leadership of the UNDP. The ANDP has been allied with the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC) since its formation, and it supported Biya in the October 1997 presidential election.\\"More Parties Rally Behind President Biya\\", Cameroon Tribune, September 2004. Moustapha remained in his post as Deputy Prime Minister until December 1997, when he was dismissed from the government by Biya. Following the June 2002 parliamentary election, Moustapha and four other notable northern politicians released a statement in July, in which they alleged electoral fraud and announced the formation of a \\"resistance front\\". They warned that the RDPC was moving the country back to single-party rule and called on politicians \\"to transcend any divergence, selfishness and personal ambition in order to create a movement capable of saving Cameroon from collapse\\".\\"Five former Cameroonian ministers allege vote rigging\\", Panapress, 15 July 2002.

Teams scored ‚Äúgoals‚Äù by kicking a round ball between two goal posts on a goal line. The ball was advanced by kicking it, although passes to players in front of the ball were not permitted. Under the 1863 Association rules, any player could catch a ball that had been kicked or had bounced only one time but could not run with the ball. Following such a catch, that player could pass the ball to another player or have a free kick from that spot. If a ball passed the goal line without going between the posts, the team whose player touched it first was awarded a free kick. If that team was the defending team, the free kick was taken from the point on the goal line closest to where the defending team touched the ball. If that team was the attacking team, it took the free kick from the spot that was 15 yards from the point on the goal line closest to where the attacking team touched the ball. The Association rules left certain fundamental rules of the game unspecified. The rules did not specify the size of each team, the duration of a game or whether play would be subject to breaks. These and other matters were agreed by teams (or stipulated by the home team) prior to each game. As such, the Association rules introduced a certain uniformity to the rules of football, but much like football played in English public schools at the time, the actual rules applied varied somewhat game-to-game. Season summary On Saturday November 5, Rutgers beat Columbia 6‚Äì3 on the Rutgers‚Äô campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey. A week later, on November 12, Princeton defeated Rutgers 6‚Äì2 on the Princeton campus in Princeton, New Jersey, in a rematch of 1869‚Äôs two-game series. Princeton was the only one of the three teams that did not suffer a defeat in 1870 and is thus able to claim to have had the first undefeated season, albeit having played only one game. Although it would be several decades before the idea of a ‚Äúnational champion‚Äù would take hold, the NCAA has recognized three poll selectors ‚Äì the Billingsley Report, the National Championship Foundation, and Parke H. Davis ‚Äì that retroactively awarded Princeton the 1870 college football national championship. Intramural football Although only three teams participated in intercollegiate football in 1870, football was played, as it had been for many years and with varying degrees of acceptance, at other schools in the north- eastern United States. At Vermont, the annual football game between the freshman and sophomore classes was held on 5 October. At Dartmouth, the faculty initially banned the sport in autumn 1870, but reversed course in late October. On October 29, the faculty permitted a football match to be held, for which the school furnished the balls, made the regulations and appointed an umpire. Other schools, such as Yale and Harvard, banned the game outright. On 31 October, a Yale student was arrested after a group of sophomores were caught playing football on New Haven Green. Following the arrest, a group of 200 students gathered outside the police station and one student, Arthur Wilson, was seriously injured after being clubbed over the head by a policeman (Officer Kelly). A committee of students complained to the Police Commissioners who split 2‚Äì2 (the Mayor abstained) on bringing charges against the officers.

Background Glamorgan Building (previously Glamorgan County Hall) Glamorgan County Council created Glamorgan Record Office in 1939 (the second county archive in Wales) with Emyr Gwynne Jones becoming Wales' first full-time archivist. The Record Office was based in the Glamorgan County Hall in Cathays Park, Cardiff.

Logo of Glamorgan Archives In the 2000s plans were made to move the archives to a new site. A proposed move to a new building near Callaghan Square fell through in 2006. In 2007 a site was found off Sloper Road, part of the new Leckwith Development which included the new Cardiff City Stadium. The new Glamorgan Archives building was completed in 2009 and officially opened in Spring 2010. An appeal against Glamorgan Archives' business rates backfired in 2010, resulting in the rates bill increasing from ¬£150,000 to ¬£400,000 per year. Glamorgan Archives were forced to reduce from 17 to 14 staff to be able to pay the extra cost.

A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrying two 3‚Äì4-megaton Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process. The pilot in command, Walter Scott Tulloch, ordered the crew to eject at 9,000 feet (2,700 m). Five crewmen successfully ejected or bailed out of the aircraft and landed safely; another ejected, but did not survive the landing, and two died in the crash. Information declassified in 2013 showed that one of the bombs came very close to detonating. Accident The aircraft, a B-52G, was based at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro. Around midnight on 23‚Äì24 January 1961, the bomber had a rendezvous with a tanker for aerial refueling. During the hook-up, the tanker crew advised the B-52 aircraft commander, Major Walter Scott Tulloch, that his aircraft had a fuel leak in the right-wing. The refueling was aborted, and ground control was notified of the problem. The aircraft was directed to assume a holding pattern off the coast until the majority of fuel was consumed. However, when the B-52 reached its assigned position, the pilot reported that the leak had worsened and that of fuel had been lost in three minutes. The aircraft was immediately directed to return and land at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. As the aircraft descended through on its approach to the airfield, the pilots were no longer able to keep it in stable descent and lost control. The pilot in command ordered the crew to abandon the aircraft, which they did at . Five men landed safely after ejecting or bailing out through a hatch, one did not survive his parachute landing, and two died in the crash. The third pilot of the bomber, Lt. Adam Mattocks, is the only person known to have successfully bailed out of the top hatch of a B-52 without an ejection seat. The crew's final view of the aircraft was in an intact state with its payload of two 3-4-megaton Mark 39 thermonuclear bombs still on board; however, the bombs separated from the gyrating aircraft as it broke up between . The aircraft wreckage covered a area of tobacco and cotton farmland at Faro, about north of Goldsboro. Three of the four arming mechanisms on one of the bombs activated after it separated, causing it to execute many of the steps needed to arm itself, such as charging the firing capacitors and deploying a parachute. Bomb recovery The first bomb that descended by parachute was found intact and standing upright as a result of its parachute being caught in a tree. Lt. Jack ReVelle, the bomb-disposal expert responsible for disarming the device, stated that the arm/safe switch was still in the safe position, although it had completed the rest of the arming sequence. The Pentagon claimed at the time that there was no chance of an explosion and that two arming mechanisms had not activated. A United States Department of Defense spokesperson stated that the bomb was unarmed and could not explode. Former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg has claimed to have seen highly classified documents indicating that its safe/arm switch was the only one of the six arming devices on the bomb that prevented detonation. In 2013, information released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request confirmed that a single switch out of four (not six) prevented detonation. EOD personnel work to recover the buried Mk. 39 thermonuclear bomb that fell into a Faro, North Carolina field in 1961.262px The second bomb plunged into a muddy field at around and disintegrated without detonation of its conventional explosives. The tail was discovered about below ground. Pieces of the bomb were recovered. Although the bomb was partially armed when it left the aircraft, an unclosed high-voltage switch had prevented it from fully arming. In 2013, ReVelle recalled the moment the second bomb's switch was found: > Until my death I will never forget hearing my sergeant say, \\"Lieutenant, we > found the arm/safe switch.\\" And I said, \\"Great.\\" He said, \\"Not great. It's > on arm.\\" 262px Excavation of the second bomb was abandoned as a result of uncontrollable ground-water flooding. Most of the thermonuclear stage, containing uranium and plutonium, was left in place, but the \\"pit\\", or core, of the bomb had been dislodged and was removed. The United States Army Corps of Engineers purchased a circular easement over the buried component. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill determined the buried depth of the secondary component to be .  Consequences to B-52 design  Wet wings with integral fuel tanks considerably increased the fuel capacity of B-52G and H models, but were found to be experiencing 60% more stress during flight than did the wings of older models. Wings and other areas susceptible to fatigue were modified in 1964 under Boeing engineering change proposal ECP 1050. This was followed by a fuselage skin and longeron replacement (ECP 1185) in 1966, and the B-52 Stability Augmentation and Flight Control program (ECP 1195) in 1967.  Later analysis of weapons recovery  Lt. Jack ReVelle, the bomb disposal expert responsible for disarming the device, claimed \\"we came very close\\" to a nuclear detonation that would have completely changed much of eastern North Carolina. He also said the yield of each bomb was more than 250 times the destructive power of the Hiroshima bomb, large enough to create a 100% kill zone within a radius of . In a now-declassified 1969 report, titled \\"Goldsboro Revisited\\", written by Parker F. Jones, a supervisor of nuclear safety at Sandia National Laboratories, Jones said that \\"one simple, dynamo- technology, low voltage switch stood between the United States and a major catastrophe\\", and concluded that \\"[t]he MK 39 Mod 2 bomb did not possess adequate safety for the airborne alert role in the B-52\\".\\"Goldsboro Revisited,\\" The Guardian, 20 September 2013, accessed 20 September 2013. However, Michael H. Maggelet and James C. Oskins, authors of Broken Arrow: The Declassified History of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents, dispute this claim, citing a declassified report. They point out that the arm-ready switch was in the safe position, the high-voltage battery was not activated (which would preclude the charging of the firing circuit and neutron generator necessary for detonation), and the rotary safing switch was destroyed, preventing energisation of the X-Unit (which controlled the firing capacitors). The tritium reservoir used for fusion boosting was also full and had not been injected into the weapon primary.

It claims to have the second longest aisle, and the largest West Window of any parish church in the country. It was part of the abbey complex and originally was one of three large churches in the town (the others being St James, now St Edmundsbury Cathedral, and St Margaret's, now gone). History The present church is the second building to stand on the site, the first being built in the 12th century by Mr Hervey. However, nothing survives of the Norman church and the oldest part of the existing building is the decorated chancel (c. 1290). There was a major renovation between the 14th and 16th centuries and it is at this point that the nave, its aisles and the tower were built. It is also at this time that Mary Tudor, favourite sister of Henry VIII, died and was buried in the church. Her tomb is in the sanctuary directly to the north of the Lord's table. The church, however, is dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and not, as some mistakenly believe, to Mary Tudor. During the 16th century, John Notyngham and Jankyn Smyth, two wealthy local benefactors, died and left large amounts of money to the church. These funds contributed to building the north and south quire aisles, now the Lady Chapel and Suffolk Regimental chapel, two chantry chapels and a north and south porch. The south porch was removed during a restoration in 1830s, and St Wolstan's chapel was added on the north-west side. The interior has been updated with modern utilities since then as well. The church is awarded three stars by Simon Jenkins in his 1999 book England's Thousand Best Churches.Jenkins, S. (1999), England's Thousand Best Churches, London: Penguin Books, Jenkins writes: > The interior has one of the largest and most exhilarating naves in the > country. Arcades of ten majestic bays march towards the chancel, each rising > on continuous mouldings with only the tiniest of capitals. The unusually > wide hammerbeam roof is a marvellous survival. Eleven pairs of angels guard > the space below, attended by lesser angels on the wallplates and by saints, > martyrs, prophets and kings, 42 figures in all. On the frieze a medieval > menagerie takes over, with dragons, unicorns, birds and fish. ... The south > chapel is littered with pleasant brasses. The north aisle by the tower has > its memorials spectacularly displayed. They climb up the wall to the > ceiling, a valhalla of Bury worthies. The Choirs St Mary's Church has a traditional Anglican choir of boys and gentlemen, with a history dating back to as early as 1354, after which there are many references to singers and ‚Äòchild‚Äôs with a surplys‚Äô. This tradition is believed to have remained untouched even during Puritan times. The choir has more recently toured Spain, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel and Malta, France, Belgium and Germany, and has sung evensongs at cathedrals including Canterbury and St Paul's. The Choir is affiliated to the RSCM, and choristers are trained using the RSCM ‚ÄòVoice for Life‚Äô scheme. 2010 saw the inception of St Mary's Ladies' Choir, and the Girls' Choir began in 2015. Although they are quite separate from the Church Choir, they join together for large services, namely Easter, Harvest, Advent and Christmas. Organs and Organists There is evidence for an organ in St Mary‚Äôs as early as 1467, in the will of John Baret which states that ‚Äòye pleyers at ye orgenys ( to be paid) ij d‚Äô. Another bequest from 1479 grants the organist 10d. The main organ is a four-manual instrument with 79 speaking stops. Built initially by John Gray of London in 1825, rebuilt and enlarged in 1865, 1885 and 1898 by J W Walker. Later rebuilds by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1931, John Compton in 1959 and Kenneth Canter in 1988, the latter included providing a mobile console. A separate four-stop chamber organ, possibly by John Harris (c. 1677 - 1743) is placed in the Royal Anglian Chapel and is ideal as a continuo instrument where the main organ would be inappropriate. More details of the main organ can be found at the National Pipe Organ Register or on the St Mary's choir website. The current Director of Music and Organist is Adrian Marple, former Organ scholar of Hatfield College, Durham. The assistant Director of Music is Christopher Moore.

Biography  To 1950 = Fraenkel was born to Jewish parents in 1921 in Danzig (then an independent territory, thus allowing him a stateless status) now in northern Poland. He began by fighting for extreme-left Zionism under Hashomer Hatzair, where Marxist ideology mixed with Jewish nationalism. Arriving in France in 1938, to study agriculture at Nancy, he moved to study chemistry and in 1940 joined his mother at Grenoble, where he just missed being raided by the Gestapo. He then fled to Switzerland and was interned in the Gierenbad camp in Z√ºrich, where he met the novelist and philosopher Man√®s Sperber, the future Racine specialist, Lucien Goldmann, and Aby Wieviorka, a major translator from Yiddish in Paris.Le Monde, 6 June 2001. Despite the very difficult conditions, he managed to take a course in political economy in the camp and there for the first time in a clandestine cell of a Trotskyite party, joining with Jost von Steiger (nephew of conseiller f√©d√©ral Eduard von Steiger, then chef du d√©partement de Justice et Police). Expelled from Switzerland in 1949 for participating to a conference on Marxism and Judaism, he was assigned to the French police at Grenoble. He then took several jobs, such as secretary to the painter Sonia Delaunay and as an organiser for CEMEA, where he met his wife Denise Salomon. = 1950‚Äì79 = An \\"intellectual without a work\\", Fraenkel passed his life reading, translating and popularising theses by authors such as Reich, Marcuse (\\"Eros et Civilisation\\"), Luk√°cs, and Trotsky. He met the philosopher Herbert Marcuse, with whom he had an intellectual conversation marked by mutual respect. Organiser of the Partisans review, edited by Fran√ßois Maspero, he was one of the founders of the Internationalist Communist Organisation in 1958 at the time of the Trotskyite secession. He was expelled from it in 1966 by Pierre Boussel alias Lambert, for having published texts by Wilhelm Reich without having gained the copyright for them. In 1966, he translated the La Lutte sexuelle des jeunes (Young people's sexual struggle) with Jean-Marie Brohm, announcing one of the themes highlighted in May 1968. On 22 March 1967, at Nanterre, he set up a conference entitled Jeunesse et sexualit√© (Youth and Sexuality) within the university, marked by its successes in May 1968. On 9 June 1968 the police tried to expel him to West Germany, which refused to take him and denied him German nationality since his birthplace of Danzig no longer existed as a state. He found himself put under house arrest at Sarlat in Dordogne (he was freed thanks to a protest campaign launched by Fran√ßois Maspero). To accelerate his release, Denise married him on 25 December 1969. In the course of the 1970s he began to retire. During the 1960s and '70s Fraenkel crossed the path of many persons who became public personalities - politicians such as Alain Krivine and Lionel Jospin, university lecturers such as Jean-Marie Brohm and Georges Vigarello, as well as many journalists. = 2001‚Äì06 = Fraenkel re-appeared in public life in 2001, when he affected the French presidential campaign by revealing (as he had already done in 1997) Lionel Jospin's Trotskyite past. Jospin had been introduced to him by Robert Lacondemine, one of his comrades in Dugny's cell (other members were Fraenkel, Denise and the historian Pierre Brou√©, who located him at a wedding in Burgundy and referred to Fraenkel as \\"a young intellectual with a happy air who joined the ENA\\"). Fraenkel told the Nouvel Observateur: In 2002 he decided to join the Ligue communiste r√©volutionnaire \\"to break his isolation\\", but was disappointed by it and did not long remain a member. Boris Fraenkel committed suicide on 23 April 2006 by jumping into the Seine from a bridge near Gare de Lyon. His body was found two days later at the level of the 8e arrondissement de Paris.

He was arrested and sentenced to death, and was killed in the 1983 Welikada prison massacre along with the other TELO leader Nadarajah Thangathurai. Early activism and TELO Selvarajah Yogachandran along with Nadarajah Thangathurai inspired several Tamil student radicals to rise against Sri Lankan state terror and founded the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization in the late 1960s. The group formally constituted itself into an organisation in 1979, inspired in part by the LTTE and the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS). Soon, it had become the most effective of the Tamil militant groups except the LTTE. Kuttimani was a firm believer that only a free, independent country for the island's Tamils in their traditional homeland will protect their legitimate rights. Kuttimani, Nadarajah and many others would later be arrested in 1981, in a brutal and intensive government crackdown of most of the Tamil liberation groups and activists. Nomination to the parliament Before his death, Kuttimani was officially nominated to the Vaddukoddai constituency in 15 October 1982, when the then sitting member of TULF party, T.Thirunavukkarau died on 1 August 1982. However the legal sources, then under the control of President J. R. Jayewardene, ruled that Kuttimani's nomination as a member of parliament was invalid. The then Prisons Commissioner Priya Delgoda announced on 16 October 1982 that Kuttimani would not be released from prison to take his oaths at the parliament. Kuttimani's appointment was gazetted while he was under a sentence of death. In a statement issued to explain the reasons for nominating Kuttimani to the vacant parliamentary seat, the TULF officials included five. Among these are two prominent reasons: (1) Kuttimani's nomination is a token protest against the state terrorism perpetrated from time to time through the agencies of the police and military personnel especially on the young Tamils of the country. (2) It is a protest against the death penalty imposed on Kuttimani and Jegan. Subsequently, on 4 February 1983, Kuttimani's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment under the general amnesty proclaimed by President Jayewardene. After this, Kuttimani resigned his Vaddukoddai seat in the parliament, to which he was nominated. Imprisonment, death and martyrdomDeath sentence= Kuttimani was arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on 5 April 1981 and was charged with an array of \\"criminal acts\\". The Sri Lankan court sentenced him to death. The presiding judge said that when he sat down he would pronounce his verdict as required by law. However, before that, he wanted to state that he did not view Kuttimani as a common criminal. He further said that if one day the president was to grant a reprieve to Kuttimani he would be happy to hear of it. Kuttimani's reply showed the world his yearning for a free country (Tamil Eelam) for his people. This was his reply: Upon his death sentence, Kuttimani was sent to the Welikada (Welikade) maximum-security prison to wait for his execution. There were both Sinhala and Tamil prisoners. The Sinhala prisoners were convicted of criminal offences such as murder, rape, robbery, etc. The Tamil prisoners were all militants. The Sinhala and Tamil prisoners were kept apart all the time to avoid racial clashes between them. =Murder= Kuttimani was brutally murdered during the 1983 Anti-Tamil pogrom in the island. Sinhalese mobs as well as personnel belonging to the Sri Lankan forces went on a rampage in Tamil areas, torturing and murdering Tamil men and children, raping, torturing and murdering Tamil women and girls, and looting and burning Tamil residences and businesses. Police and army (which were almost exclusively Sinhalese) either participated in this orgy of violence against the Tamils or kept a blind eye. On 25 July, the second day of the pogrom, the Tamil inmates of the Welikada prison, who almost all of them had been detained without any trial, were brutally murdered by the Sinhalese convicts with the assistance of the prison guards. According to Amnesty International, some of the Sinhala prisoners were given alcohol and then were encouraged to attack the Tamil prisoners. A large number of the Sinhala prisoners, with knives and other sharp weapons, stormed into the building where some 35-37 Tamil prisoners were lodged. They stabbed, beat and tortured the Tamil prisoners. Genitals of a few prisoners were mutilated. Both the eyes of Kuttimani as well as Jeganathan were mutilated and gouged out with iron bars, since he had dreamed of seeing with them, through another person after his execution, an independent Tamil state. One version has it that Kutimani's tongue was cut out by an attacker who drank the blood and cried: \\"I have drunk the blood of a Tiger.\\" He was then murdered and his body was disposed in front of a statue of the Buddha in the prison yard.

Since the early 1900s the hill and the surrounding precinct has been mainly used for military purposes with extensive buildings now present. It has been under the control of the Department of Defence. The area is known by the indigenous Whadjuk people as Dwerda Weelardinup, meaning \\"place of the dingo spirit\\" and the peak is also referred to as Walyarup, meaning \\"sea-eagle nest\\". The site includes the last remaining stand of pre- European settlement Rottnest Island pine (Callitris preissii) on the mainland of Western Australia. Site Cantonment Hill from the air, showing the Navy warehouse, signal station, and Tuckfield Oval. The Cantonment Hill site consists of a number of properties, lots 600, 601, 604 are owned by the Commonwealth Government lot 601 is the site of Army Museum of Western Australia, lot 603 is privately owned. Lot 602 which consists of two parts totalling , lot 50 is between these two parts covers an area . The approximately site is bounded by Canning Highway, Queen Victoria Street, Burt Street and Tuckfield Street. There are a number of buildings within the site besides those of the Army museum: there is the heritage listed former defense housing on Queen Victoria Street, the heritage listed Naval Store (1935) on the Corner of Queen Victoria Street and Canning Highway, and a signal station built for the Fremantle Harbour Trust in 1956. In the mid 1990s a group of local residents formed the Cantonment Hill Residents Action Group for the return of site to the City of Fremantle as per the original gift of 1892. In this Lot 50 was set aside as a Bush Forever site previously identified in 1981 by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1989 and again in 1996 surveys of the area identified 20 native plants and 27 weeds. Included in the native plants is the only remaining natural occurrence of Rottnest Island pine (Callitris preissii) on the mainland. The 1989 survey also identified 16 bird species and 2 reptile species. History For many thousands of years before European settlement, Cantonment Hill was a place of significance to the local Whadjuk people who are part of the Noongar people. They told stories about the site, and camped there. The site was known as Dwerda Weelardinup, meaning \\"place of dingo spirit\\". Other families also called the site Walyarup which means Sea Eagle nest. In 1829, Europeans established the Swan River Colony and the town of Fremantle. It is from the cantonment established nearby that its common name is taken. The site was a popular destination for picnics for the settlers due to the views over Fremantle, the river and ocean. When the Colonial Government established Rottnest Island as a prison for indigenous people, their families would gather on Sundays to send signals to those on the island using fire. These fires also aided those who attempted to escape from the Island. In 1830, Ensign Robert Dale, who was working for Surveyor General John Septimus Roe, sketched Fremantle from Cantonment Hill. This is one of the earliest depictions of Fremantle. Cantonment Hill remained relatively unchanged during Fremantle's early development, though in 1877 some limestone was quarried from the hill. In 1833, the hill was the site of Western Australia's only duel. During the 1880s, residents of the Fremantle area urged the Fremantle Municipality to request the land be vested from the Crown for public space. In 1892 it was given by the Crown to the City of Fremantle in perpetuity \\"for the purposes of a public garden\\". The Artillery Barracks in Burt Street were built on the site between 1910 and 1913 for Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, who manned the coastal defence batteries at Fort Arthur Head and Fort Forrest (North Fremantle). During World War I the site was used as a rehabilitation hospital for injured soldiers returning from the Western Front and later as an internment camp and as a quarantine station. In 1931, as part of the City of Fremantle's employment for sustenance to those left unemployed by the Depression, a section of the land was cleared and levelled to make a park. Additionally a path was provided for the residents of Tuckfield, giving them direct access to Queen Victoria Bridge. This area is eastern lot 602, known as Tuckfield Oval and used as playing fields by schools until the 1990s. During World War II further development at the site saw construction of a tunnel network to an underground control room and a large warehouse on the north-eastern side. This latter was constructed after 1935 and bears US Navy insignia and the motto non sibi sed patri√¶, but is not listed among the facilities used by that navy during World War II. By the early 1950s, the property ceased to be used as military barracks but remained under Defence control. The artillery barracks buildings were used from 1948 onwards as a training venue for the Army Reserve and in 1995 the Army Museum of Western Australia moved to the site, where they currently remain. The barracks are the oldest continuously occupied defence site in Western Australia. =Signal station= Signal station, with mural by Nami Osaki In early 1929 a signal station was constructed on the peak of Cantonment Hill to replace the station that had operated at Arthur Head. The station opened on 8 May 1929 when at signalman Edward Ray raised the first ball for the . Signalman Ray would go on to retire in 1941 after 44 years service, 39 of them at Fremantle. This station was replaced with a masonry building by the Harbour Trust in 1956 providing commanding views across to Rottnest Island. The signal station closed in 1964 when it was replaced by the Port of Fremantle's new building on Victoria Quay. Return to public ownership In 1989 the Department of Defence mooted plans to dispose of the property. Options considered have been the sale of the property to Notre Dame University and a transfer to the Government of Western Australia by way of a Centenary of Federation of Australia gift from the Federal Government. Progress in negotiations was stalled however, as the parties have requested the Commonwealth to provide funding to reinstate the site to a usable condition‚Äîthen Premier Geoff Gallop announced in September 2003 that the Government had formally declined the offer. Since 1997, a community-based Cantonment Hill Residents Action Group has lobbied for its return to the City according to the original gift and its restoration and retention as public property with full public access. On 21 January 2010, the Prime Minister announced that Cantonment Hill, including Tuckfield Oval, would be sold back to the people of Fremantle. The Council was to reportedly pay $76,000 for the land, and had plans to rehabilitate the vegetation and build walking paths and picnic facilities. The signal station was to have been turned into a caf√© and Aboriginal interpretive centre. The handover was to have been completed by March 2010. In December 2012 the City of Fremantle re-established the Cantonment Hill Working Group, consisting of councillors including the mayor Dr Brad Pettitt, a representative of the City's CEO and five residents. This same group was responsible for the development of a master plan for the site as well previous works to clean up the area along restoration of the area. At the beginning of February 2015, it was reported that Fremantle Sea Rescue would likely become based in the signal station. This drew criticism from members of the Cantonment Hill Working Group who had developed the master plan for the site which the City of Fremantle had previously given assurances to implement. In late March 2015 draft plans were presented at a council meeting detailing the creation of a convention center and restaurant for the site, with the FSR suggested as being a medium-term occupant while this larger plan came to fruition. A mega mural was installed on the top floor of the signal station in March 2015; the mural is part of the City of Fremantle's cultural development plan. The mural by artist Nami Osaki depicts a girl and dingo in a Japanese manga style reflecting the site's indigenous history. It wraps around the whole building, with the girl positioned so as to be peering out over the river while she sits with her dingo at a camp fire.

Mixing elements of punk, jazz and psychedelia, the band were critical favourites throughout their lifetime and played support slots for a wide variety of underground and mainstream bands, although this did not translate into substantial commercial success. The Transmitters are also notable for featuring future members of Loop Guru and Transglobal Underground and for sharing two members with cult pop band Furniture, as well as a guest stint by Glaxo Babies vocalist Rob Chapman. Their sound was compared to (among others) The Fall, XTC, Gang of Four, This Heat and Magazine. (This band should not be confused with the other British indie band called The Transmitters, who are a more conventional indie rock band with an entirely different line-up, and were formed in 2006.) History1970s Transmitters=Formation and early releases The band formed in Ealing, West London in 1977. The original line-up was John Quinn (vocals ‚Äì also known as \\"John Clegg\\", \\"John Grimes\\" or \\"John X\\"), Sam Dodson (guitar, aka \\"Sam Dodds\\"), Simon \\"Sid\\" Wells (bass), Amanda de Grey (keyboards), Jim Chase (drums) and Dexter O'Brian (lyrics ‚Äì real name Christopher McHallem). Guitarists Steve Walsh (Manicured Noise) and John Guillani (from O'Brian's other band The Decorators) also stood in as live members at various times. The band's debut single was \\"Party\\", released on Ebony Records in 1978. This was followed in the same year by the album 24 Hours. On 29 December 1978, the band played a concert at the Electric Ballroom, Camden, supporting The Police. On 15 February 1979, they supported an early line-up of The Human League at the Nashville Rooms, West London. (Other bands played with during this period include Scritti Politti, The Birthday Party, Dolly Mixture, The Slits, Alternative TV, The Fall and Blurt.) A concert at the Greenwich Theatre on 18 March 1979 was reviewed by both NME and Record Mirror Review. Writing in the latter, Chris Westwood said \\"The Transmitters were, as is their forte, unpredictable, uncalculatedly comic, inspiring and brilliant... The sound is open, free, off-the-cuff, bound together through all the stumbling, fumbling chaos that their approach entails. \\"The One That Won The War\\", par example, a personal favourite, damn near falls apart at the seams, with clattering whining guitar thrashes mating with probably the most essential bass phrase this side of any other Transmitters number you care to name.\\"Record Mirror review of 1979 Transmitters concert at Greenwich Theatre by Chris Westwood ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' MySpace page. Retrieved 29 December 2008 NME's Paul Morley described the music as \\"feverish and jumpy\\" and stated \\"The Transmitters are the cheekiest group I've seen since The Mekons; the wackiest I've seen since Public Image (and almost as sinister). They were, of course, great. Naturally, their music is of Velvets' ancestry; deceptively nonchalant, barely controlled, repetitive, erratic and intoxicating, presented with an odd, wry condescension.\\"NME review of 1979 Transmitters concert at Greenwich Theatre by Paul Morley ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' homepage. Retrieved 29 December 2008 The same reviews paid plenty of attention to the band's stage presence, in particular that of the charismatic John Quinn. Describing Quinn as \\"inscrutable\\", Morley also claimed that he had \\"the comedy timing of a Dave Allen, the detachment of a Devoto, the amused poise of a Mark Smith, the cool of a Sinatra.\\" Meanwhile, Westwood was entertained by the group's ramshackle presentation ‚Äì \\"A serious set? That may have been the intent, but one look at John, the vocalist, and a crowd can crack up. He stumbles around, fag in mitt, flanked by a drunken bass player (Simon Wells), a drunken guitarist (Sam Dodson), a workmanlike drummer (Jim Chase), and the strangely sombre on-stage persona of keyboardist, Amanda De Grey.\\" During 1979, Dodson (along with de Grey and Wells) sometimes performed in The Good Missionaries ‚Äì the art rock band led by Mark Perry, which had evolved out of Perry's previous band Alternative TV. Perry occasionally returned the favour by playing with The Transmitters. First Peel Session, further releases and initial split Gaining the attention and approval of DJ John Peel, the band recorded a Peel Session in 1979, following which Dexter O'Brian left the band. (Under his real name of Christopher McHallem, he would retrain as an actor and spend three years in the BBC soap opera \\"EastEnders\\", playing the character \\"Rod Norman\\" between 1987 and 1990, before branching out into screenwriting.) In September 1979, The Transmitters released two singles within the same month. The first was their last release on Ebony Records, \\"Nowhere Train\\", of which Lenny Kaye (in Melody Maker) commented \\"The Transmitters, in an eerie, dronal tune, call up the ghosts of serpent power, a neat bit of seance, just following tracks‚Ä¶‚Äù The second of the September singles was the four track EP \\"Still Hunting for the Ugly Man\\" (on new label Step-Forward Records) which reached Number 2 in the Our Price New Wave Charts. In NME, Paul Morley described it as \\"an obsessive, frustrated record. Consistently effective and annoying, it rummages restlessly out on lunatic fringes. It's difficult, discomforting and oppressively manic, but worth exploring.\\" Morley also drew comparisons to The Fall, noting that \\"both groups are cynics and critics. Both groups are fronted by hurried, mocking inciters. Both groups deal with instabilities, abnormalities, ambitious truths... and make demented shell-shocked music.\\"NME review of \\"Still Hunting For The Ugly Man\\" by Paul Morley ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' homepage. Retrieved 29 December 2008 The Transmitters played a pro-National Abortion Campaign benefit gig at the Hope & Anchor, Islington, London on 28 October 1979. Reviewing the concert in Sounds, Nick Tester reflected \\"The Transmitters were a useful choice for a movement (all about choice) fighting a pitiful and regressive male intrusion. They borrow from a wide source ‚Äì early psychedelia, Beefheart, through to even Essential Logic ‚Äì but furrow the influences into a style which demands to be taken on its own merits. Comparisons are so limited that I find it hard to avoid the much mistaken and inflexible term 'progressive'. Further to this, their music, whether cautious or dissipated, is always underlined by a devilishly impulsive awareness and wicked streak of unpredictability. They play a serious game of musical hide and seek‚Ä¶ In a set that switched with as much consistency as a knackered fluorescent light the Transmitters were always compelling and somehow evaded a possible self-destructive urge.\\"Sounds review of 1979 Transmitters concert at Hope & Anchor by Nick Tester ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' MySpace page. Retrieved 29 December 2008 The Transmitters broke up in 1980. =Transmitters Presumed Dead= Soon after the split a new Ealing-based band emerged, called Transmitters Presumed Dead. As the name implied this was a merger between members of Transmitters (Dodson, Wells and Chase) and members of the similarly defunct band Missing Presumed Dead (Mikel Lee and Dave Baby). Tim Whelan (one of the two singers of Furniture) was recruited to sing lead vocals. Chris Westwood reviewed the new band's concert at the Trafalgar, Shepherds Bush in Record Mirror, concluding \\"The ramshackle remnants of The Transmitters and Missing Presumed Dead have assembled in the name of fun, chaos and roo-beat enterprise. The end ‚Äì and beautifully unrehearsed ‚Äì result is a temporary six piece, sax and flute and guitars and drums, that quite honestly asks questions of all our established and revered leaders. Why is everyone else so sober? We're working on a smale scale here; in a Shepherd's Bush pub with people being silly, playing sloppily but with undeniable width, stamina, ingenuity. Mikel (Presumed Dead) sings and dances, spins tinny guitar in the path of writing saxophone (Dave, Presumed Dead) and more jarring, clashing guitar (Sam, presumed drunk) while the conglomorate stagger from number to number: \\"Q-Tips\\" and \\"Catholics\\", \\"Kill the Postman\\" and \\"Change Gear\\". There‚Äôs even a ska-like destruction of \\"Sugar Sugar\\", where everything is so bad but brilliant ‚Äì guitars out of tune, vocals all over the shop ‚Äì but the actual point of TPD lies not in their affected clumsiness but in transforming clever and demanding music into a touching, entertaining sort of hobby.‚ÄùRecord Mirror review of 1980 Transmitters Presumed Dead concert at The Trafalgar by Chris Westwood ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' homepage. Retrieved 29 December 2008 =1980s Transmitters=Launch of second line- up and second album Transmitters Presumed Dead soon transformed into the second Transmitters line-up of Sam Dodson (guitar), Sid Wells (bass), Dave Baby (saxophone) and Julian Treasure (drums, ex Fish Turned Human) with Mikel Lee leaving and Rob Chapman (lead vocals, ex Glaxo Babies) replacing Tim Whelan. This band recorded a second Peel Session in 1981, as well as releasing the second Transmitters album ‚Äì And We Call That Leisure Time ‚Äì on Bristols' Heartbeat Records later in the year. (In parallel, Mikel Lee (guitar, vocals), Julian Treasure (drums), Tim Whelan (guitar, vocals) and Ian Hawkridge (bass) came together as a reinvented Missing Presumed Dead, gigging and recording their own John Peel Session in the same year which was produced by Bob Sargent and included a strong version of the original Transmitters song \\"0.5 Alive\\".) Transmitters in transit (1982‚Äì1987) The line-up of The Transmitters continued to change over the years. Baby, Wells and Treasure all left at various points during the 1980s; Treasure was replaced by the returning Jim Chase, and Whelan also returned to the line-up (replacing Chapman). Several more musicians passed through The Transmitters during this period ‚Äì including guitarist Vince Cutcliffe and keyboard player Bob Sargeant (aka \\"the Hand of Borgus Wheems\\"). Live performances were augmented by several other \\"floating\\" members ‚Äì Joe Sax and theremin player John Woodley. In 1985, a Transmitters song called \\"Sheep Farming\\" became the first song to be remixed by a new worldbeat outfit called Loop Guru (which happened to be led by head Transmitter Sam Dodson). Final line-up and recordings The band's final line-up (between 1987 and 1989) was Dodson, Whelan, Chase, James McQueen (bass), Dave \\"Mud-Demon\\" Muddyman (keyboards/accordion/sampler, ex-Birdloom) and Whelan's Furniture colleague Hamilton \\"Hami\\" Lee (drums, sampler). This line-up recorded tracks for a third Transmitters album which was not released during the band's lifetime. This music finally saw the light of day as Count Your Blessings (1987/89), which was released as a free download album in 2006 by Portuguese digital record label You Are Not Stealing Records. Reviewing a gig at Subterrania, London in 1988, Melody Maker's Chris Roberts claimed \\"Tim Whelan is the most restless man alive and demonstrates this by dancing like a young Jackson, pacing like Mark E Smith, and hurling himself at the floor like any-age Iggy. He spits forth his topical angst (\\"there's a hole in the world\\") while his lanky henchmen beat manifold drums, extract Haitian war chants from keyboard thingies, and scratch shrill guitars like jaguars assaulting sandpaper. They tangle with the Velvets' \\"Ferryboat Bill\\" quite swimmingly and, all things assimilated, are a cathartic anglepoise on the heart of darkness. Highly wrecked and mended.\\"Melody Maker review of 1988 Transmitters concert at Subterrania by Chris Roberts ‚Äì hosted on The Transmitters' homepage. Retrieved 29 December 2008 The Transmitters released a 12-inch single, \\"The Mechanic\\", on yet another label (9CC/Craving Co Productions) in 1989. Writing in Music Week, Dave Henderson described it as \\"like Stump never happened, wanton artiness, expressing-yourself tendencies and other such angles are exposed.‚Äù The band split up for the second time later in 1989. =Post-split=Tim Whelan and Hamilton Lee (Transglobal Underground) Whelan and Lee continued to write and play with their other band, Furniture, until 1990. They launched their own worldbeat project Transglobal Underground two years later in 1992. Sam Dodson and Dave Muddyman (Loop Guru etc) Dodson and Muddyman (under the pseudonyms of \\"Salman Gita\\" and \\"Jamuud\\") continued with their worldbeat project Loop Guru), launching the project in full in 1992. Dodson also teamed up with Loop Guru singer Linda Finger, Damned's drummer Rat Scabies, Psychic TV's Jim Daly (aka \\"Jym Darling\\") and jazz singer Liz Fletcher to form Slipper, an electronica-and-vocal project with elements of gospel and jazz. Described as \\"Portishead with a sense of humour\\" the project released two albums (2000s Invisible Movies and 2002's Zoon Sandwich, both on Rephlex Records) and a mini-album called Earworms (released on the Mechanism label in 2002). Another Transmitters player, theremin player John Woodley, was a frequent contributor. Dodson and Daly also teamed up as Thaw, another electronica project blending urban trance techno with ancient vocal chants and \\"tribal rhythms\\". Thaw released the Holy Cat album on Dodson's record label Elsewhen in 2005. Most recently, Dodson has teamed up with Neil Sparkes (ex-Transglobal Underground and a current Temple of Sound member) to form Loungeclash, whose debut album Dread Time Story was released on Warlock Records/Sony Red USA on 19 February 2008. In addition to his Loop Guru membership, Dave Muddyman is currently a member of Hoopy Froods, Round Way Wrong and MuudMap.

Westenhanger Castle is a fortified manor house once owned by royalty, located next to Westenhanger railway station and the grandstand of Folkestone Racecourse in Kent. The castle has endured a period of steady decline to near ruination in recent years, but the current owners have engaged a programme of consolidation, conservation and restoration to the castle and adjoining buildings. It is now being used as a conference and wedding venue. History In its heyday, Westenhanger Castle was a fortified 14th-century quadrangular manor house reflecting the opulence of its owners at that time. However, its history began almost 1,000 years ago, in 1035, when King Canute owned the estate. The de Criol family, descendants of Bertram de Criol, were initially responsible in 1343 for the building of a permanent structure on the site. The castle stayed in the family until the Wars of the Roses when Sir Thomas de Criol or Kyriell was beheaded the day after the Second Battle of St Albans by order of Queen Margaret of Anjou. Sir Thomas de Criol had no sons, and Westenhanger came to his son-in-law, Sir John Fogge. The manor house at the time contained 126 rooms. Westenhanger has a rich history with royalty and nobility, being connected with Henry II, Rosamund de Clifford, Edward Poynings, Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth I, Customer Smythe and Lord Strangford. In 1588, under the ownership of Customer Smythe, Queen Elizabeth used the castle as the command centre for Kent‚Äôs 14,000 troops who were to defend the south coast from the Spanish Armada. In 1656, the exiled Charles II was persuaded to return to England, and Westenhanger, ideally located close to the English coast. Thousands of armed men were instructed to hide in the surrounding woodlands and when the King entered the house, word would be given for them to rush in and murder the King and his followers. However, the King was forewarned as he was about to leave for England. Current Through the centuries, the castle has been reduced in size and suffered serious neglect. Since the mid-1990s, the current owners have been working with English Heritage to consolidate the stonework and prevent further deterioration of the manor house, castle walls and associated buildings. The impressive medieval barns which stand intact outside the curtain wall have recently been reunited with the castle under one ownership and work is ongoing to restore these barns to something near their original state. It is now being hired out as a conference and wedding venue. Access is via the entrance to the racecourse, off the Westenhanger segment of Stone Street. Colonisation of America Westenhanger Castle is now home to a replica of the Discovery, one of the three ships that entered Chesapeake Bay on May 13, 1607. Sir Thomas Smythe, the founder of the expedition, was the son of Thomas ‚ÄòCustomer‚Äô Smythe, who was granted Westenhanger (or Ostenhanger, as it was then) as a reward for his service as the Queen‚Äôs collector of imports. The younger Thomas commissioned the construction of Discovery for the East India Company in 1600 and, along with the Susan Constant and Godspeed, the ship sailed for Virginia on December 19, 1606 under captain John Smith, arriving on May 13 the following year. As a result of this expedition, the first permanent English-speaking settlement in the New World was subsequently established at Jamestown, Virginia, forming a base for what would later become the United States of America. On December 19, 2008 the replica of the Discovery was presented to Westenhanger Castle by the Jamestown UK Foundation, a charity set up to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in 1607.

Early militancy In 1969 a small group of militant Tamil youths from Valvettithurai formed an underground group. The group was known as the Thangadurai Group and was led by Thangadurai and Kuttimani. The group would later be known as the Tamil Liberation Organisation (TLO). Other members of the group included V. Prabhakaran, Sri Sabaratnam, Pon Sivakumaran, Periya Sothi, Chinna Sothi, Chetti and Kannadi. The group would hold secret meetings at a professor's house in Point Pedro, collect weapons and build crude bombs. The group carried out various arson attacks and attempted assassinations and formed close ties with Tamil Nadu politicians and the Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence agency. In April 1971 Thangadurai and 15 others were making explosives at a school in Thondamanar when a bomb exploded, seriously injuring Chinna Sothi. The following year Thangadurai, Prabhakaran, Chinna Sothi and Vythilingam Nadesathasan (Nadesudasan) were burnt in a similar explosion. In March 1977 Thangadurai and Jegan shot dead police informant Thadi Thangarajah at his house in Kokuvil. At a meeting in a Hindu temple in Thondamanaru in September 1977 Thangadurai formally established the organisation as the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), together with its military wing Tamil Eelam Liberation Army (TELA). As the violence increased the Sri Lankan government declared a state of emergency in the Jaffna Peninsula in late 1979 and sent in more troops. Thangadurai, Kuttimani, Prabhakaran and others fled to Tamil Nadu. Neervely bank robbery On 25 March 1981 a People's Bank van returning to Jaffna after collecting cash in Vadamarachchi was robbed of Rs. 8 million on the Jaffna-Point Pedro Road in Neervely by a group of TELO including Thangadurai and Kuttimani. Thangadurai, Kuttimani and Selvadurai Sivasubramaniam (alias Devan) were arrested in Mannalkadal on 8 April 1981 as they tried to escape to India by boat. Thangadurai, Kuttimani, Devan, Navaratnarah (Nadarajah) Sivapatham (alias Sivapalan Master) and Nadesudasan were charged in connection with robbery. Sabaratnam was charged in absentia. The trial at Colombo High Court commenced on 2 November 1982 and on 24 February 1983 all six defendants were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Death Thangadurai, Kuttimani, Devan, Sivapatham and Nadesudasan were kept at Welikada Prison whilst their appeal was waiting to be heard by the Supreme Court. On the night of 24 July 1983 an anti-Tamil riot started in Colombo. The following day the riot spread to Welikada Prison, Sinhalese prisoners attacked Tamil prisoners using knives and clubs, killing 39. Amongst the victims were Thangadurai and Kuttimani. Survivors reported that the pair were forced to kneel whilst their eyes were gouged out with iron bars (an allusion to Kutimani's statement in court) and that one of the attackers cut out Kutimani's tongue and drank his blood, crying \\"I have drunk the blood of a Tiger\\". Survivors also claimed that the prison officers allowed their keys to fall into the hand of the Sinhalese prisoners.

The project was a Depression era public works scheme to carry potable water from just below Canning Dam through the hills around and above Roleystone and Kelmscott to a screening, fluoridation and pumping station near Gosnells by following the natural contours of the Canning Valley‚Äîhence it was entirely gravity-fed. Where a tributary valley needed to be crossed, suspended or siphoning pipelines were used. From Gosnells, the water entered the city's pipeline distribution system. The channel supplied drinking water to the metropolitan area of Perth from 1940 to 1975 before becoming redundant after the construction of the Canning Tunnel in the mid-1970s. Until the construction of Serpentine Dam in 1961, Canning Dam and the channel were the main sources of water supply for Perth. Large sections of the disused channel and associated infrastructure remain and provide useful bush-walking routes. In 1950 a section of the channel collapsed at Araluen, causing severe water restrictions in Perth for several weeks. Course The Channel enters a pipe near Contour road, Roleystone Pipeline crossing the Turner Road valley The channel starts at a stilling chamber on the north bank of the Canning river, just below the Canning Dam. After just over 200 meters, it enters a siphon to cross the Canning river. It then flows alongside McNess Drive down the Canning valley. A siphon is used to cross McNess Drive near the junction with Bristol Road and it also crosses the Canning river to the North bank. The channel flows to the north of Croyden Road into Roleystone to a point above Brookton Highway, which is crossed with a siphon. The channel continues west, then north-west to cross Peet road between Knuckey Drive and Beales Crescent. It follows Contour Road to the west, and uses a siphon to cross Slab gully. Further channels and siphons continue west to cross Canning Mills Road near Martin Street, and then north, crossing Turner Road on its way to its destination in Martin on Mills Road. Construction It was built by the Public Works Department for the Metropolitan Water Supply and was designed under the direction of several prominent engineers of the era: Russell Dumas, E. W. Tindale, Victor Munt and Don Munro. Engineers E. H. Oldham and J. W. Allen supervised the construction project. This was the same team which had overseen the design and construction of the Canning Dam and which was completed in 1940. Construction commenced in June 1935 and was completed in January 1937. The project was a considerable technical achievement which required a high degree of manual labour due to the hilly terrain which made it difficult to access with mechanical equipment. Most of the construction was carried out by unemployed men on relief work. Prior to completion, water from the partially filled Canning Dam and the pipehead dam below was conveyed to Perth through a pipeline to Kelmscott and a pipeline from there to the storage reservoir at Mount Eliza in Kings Park. Once the dam wall was completed and the dam had filled the pipeline was discontinued. A pipeline carried the water from Gosnells to Cannington where it was diverted to Fremantle and King's Park. Three hundred and twenty men were laid off when construction was completed and the total cost of the project was ¬£125,000, less than the estimated ¬£155,000. The typical profile of the Channel is a culvert approximately wide at its base with raking sides at 45 degrees banking up to the natural ground level where the top of the channel is approximately wide with a depth of approximately . The channel was cut from the natural ground or rock and then lined with concrete made from Western Australian made cement mixed with locally sourced oolithic laterite aggregate. Pipework across shallow gullies was typically cast iron of varying diameters, joined by lead seals. Deeper gullies were crossed using steel pipes joined by welding. A separate contour channel ran north from Canning Dam to allow Mundaring Weir to be replenished with water from Canning Dam. This is now inaccessible as it is within the Dam's water catchment areas. Another channel ran from Kangaroo Gully near Karragullen into Canning Dam to augment the water catchment.

They catch Alec, Seregil and Micum on Tam√≠r's Road with the help of the local retha'noi and Seregil manages to strike a bargain with them. Their leader, Rieser goes with them over to Riga to get the books and Sebrahn remains as a hostage. They take board Green Lady and Thero creates a pair of brands for each of them, while Seregil forges warrants of ownership for Micum. On the port they recognize Ulan's Virr√©se ship and guess that he has come on the same errand. Unfortunately, he gets ahead of them and steals the books from Yhakobin's house the morning before the planned theft. Seregil spots Ilar and makes Alec remain outside while he ventures in Ulan's Riga house. Ilar spots him and begs him to forgive him, despite Ulan order that he turn Seregil in on sight. Instead he allows himself to be tricked into revealing the hiding place of the books before Seregil knocks him out. He meets Rieser, Micum and Alec and they all speed toward the port, hoping to elude the chase, which they do, for a while. When they find out they cannot burn the books, Seregil cuts them in two and each of them takes half. The soldiers find them again and they make a stand at a cottage near the shore. Seregil sneaks out and, after encountering captain Rhal, he returns to the cottage and they all break through, but Rieser catches an arrow in his collarbone. Back in Skala, H√¢zadri√´n heals him and he announces that he will leave Alec alone as he doesn't believe he'll let himself be caught once again. This is received with anger by the retha'noi who resolve to destroy Sebrahn, which they call an abomination. He calls upon the owls, who blind the retha'noi archers while Sebrahn himself kills the witches. In the aftermath, Alec understands that he has to give up Sebrahn as he cannot care for him and he seems to need the presence of the other tayan'gil. They return to Rh√≠minee, and resume their Watcher lives.

It first flew on 11 October 1960, and was deployed as an operational ICBM from September 1961 until April 1966. Following retirement as an ICBM, the Atlas-E, along with the Atlas-F, was refurbished for orbital launches as the Atlas E/F. Background The SM-65E Atlas, or Atlas-E, was an operational variant of the Atlas missile. It first flew on 11 October 1960, and was deployed as an operational ICBM from September 1961 until April 1966. Following retirement as an ICBM, the Atlas-E, along with the Atlas-F, was refurbished for orbital launches as the Atlas E/F.Encyclopedia Astronautica - Atlas The last Atlas E/F launch was conducted on 24 March 1995, using a rocket which had originally been built as an Atlas E. As fully operational ICBMs, the Atlas E and F, which differed only in guidance systems, had upgraded engines and inertial control instead of the Atlas D's radio ground guidance. The ignition system was also different from the one used on the D-series, which used a \\"wet\\" start, meaning that the propellants were injected into the combustion chamber prior to ignition, and a hypergolic igniter on the fully developed version. The Atlas E/F for comparison used pyrotechnic cartridges and a dry start (ignition coming before propellant injection) for an extremely rapid ignition that required no hold-down time on the pad to prevent combustion instability. The booster engines had separate gas generators unlike the Atlas D which had one gas generator for both engines. The launcher system used for the E and F series was also different than the D series, eliminating the hold-down arms in favor of a mechanism that would immediately release the missile as thrust built up. Atlas-E launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11 and 13, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at OSTF-1, LC-576 and SLC-3. 1960-61 The Atlas E testing program commenced on October 11, 1960 when Missile 3E was launched from Cape Canaveral's LC-13. At around 40 seconds into launch, the sustainer hydraulic system lost pressure. After booster jettison, the missile lost attitude control, tumbled, and broke up at T+154 seconds. On November 30, the second attempt, Missile 4E, repeated the same failure except that the missile remained structurally intact until impact in the ocean. Both of these failures were traced to radiated heat that caused a failure of the sustainer hydraulic rise-off disconnect, which ruptured and allowed the hydraulic fluid to escape; they resulted in shielding being added to protect the rise-off disconnect.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 4E Convair December 14, 1960\\" Missile 8E on January 24, 1961 lost roll control due to aerodynamic heating shorting the vernier pitch control servo, a problem that had not occurred since the early Atlas A tests. Missile 9E on February 4 experienced problems with the propellant utilization system and prematurely depleted its fuel supply, however the warhead landed only a few miles short of the target, so the flight was considered a success. Missile 13E (March 14) experienced a similar problem, but with a much earlier sustainer cutoff and the warhead missed its target by almost 2000 miles. Missile 16E (March 25) depleted its supply of helium control gas early, making it impossible to jettison the booster section. The missile was dragged down by the weight of the spent booster engines and fell short of its intended range, also the propellant utilization system malfunctioned again and caused the engines to run fuel rich. The failure was traced to two mistakenly transposed wires which caused spurious venting of the control helium out the vernier engines.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 16E Convair April 8, 1961\\" Missile 12E (May 13) and Missile 18E (May 26) both performed well. Testing now began at VAFB on the West Coast, but the first attempt ended ignominiously when Missile 27E lifted from OSTF-1 (Operational Silo Test Facility) on June 7. Almost immediately at liftoff, the B-1 engine experienced rough combustion, causing a fire in the thrust section that led to the explosion of the missile only four seconds after launch. The failure, a near-repeat of two Atlas D accidents the previous year, severely damaged OSTF-1 and put it out of use for months. Postflight examination of the missile hardware found extensive damage to the B-1 engine, particularly the injector head, which was almost completely destroyed. Afterwards, copper baffles were installed in all injector heads and the engine start sequence changed to wet start (an inert fluid kept in the engine tubes to reduce shock at ignition). The downside of this was adding 40 pounds (18 kilograms) of additional weight as well as slightly reduced engine performance. The ARMA guidance system on 27E also experienced erratic behavior due to an intermittently shorted diode; had the flight continued, it's possible that the missile would not have achieved a proper trajectory.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 27E Convair June 21, 1961\\" The next Atlas E test, from Cape Canaveral, was also a failure. Missile 17E on June 23 experienced a malfunction of the pitch gyro, which was apparently running at half speed. The missile began to oscillate in the pitch plane starting at T+15 seconds and eventually the excessive pitch rate exceeded the missile's structural limits. It broke up either from aerodynamic loads or heating 101 seconds after launch. After this debacle, all remaining Atlas E/F R&D; flights had the SMRD (Spin Motor Rotation Detector) system installed.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 17E Convair July 7, 1961\\" Atlas E tests at VAFB were curtailed until OSTF-1 could be repaired, and for the remainder of 1961 all testing took place from the Cape. Following two successive flights ending in explosions and an incinerated launch stand, the successful flights of Missiles 22E and 21E during July, followed by the first Atlas F flight in August, came as a relief. On September 9, Missile 26E lost sustainer thrust following BECO and tumbled, falling into the Atlantic Ocean almost 2000 miles short of its target. Two E-series flights in October, 25E and 30E, were both successful. On November 10, an attempt to launch a biological mission (Missile 32E) with a squirrel monkey named Goliath ended in disaster as the Atlas's sustainer engine shut down almost immediately at liftoff, while the verniers failed to start at all. The booster engines managed to retain attitude control until a fire broke out in the thrust section and caused the B-1 engine to shut down at T+22 seconds. Telemetry data became erratic at this point. The Atlas began tumbling uncontrollably and was destroyed by Range Safety at T+35 seconds, the B-2 engine continuing to operate until missile destruction. The nose cone impacted in the ocean about 20 seconds later. Goliath, who was in a padded container with no restraints, was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean three days later. A postmortem examination of the monkey found that he had died of multiple head injuries probably caused by impact with the ocean rather than separation of the capsule from the booster. Had the flight succeeded, Goliath would have been sent on a 5000-mile (8045 kilometer) suborbital lob and recovered in the South Atlantic. The capsule had no instrumentation or medical monitoring of the monkey, only a TV camera to record his actions during the flight. The sustainer engine was pulled from the ocean floor and examined, which found that a pressure transducer had accidentally been installed on the test port of the LOX regulator. This resulted in near-total LOX starvation of the sustainer engine. Strong vibration in the gas generator from the shutdown ruptured low-pressure ducting and started a propellant leak that led to a thrust section fire. The vernier engines never activated due to their startup timer being set to activate following sustainer start (which failed, thus preventing the start signal from being sent to the verniers). Despite these mishaps, the Atlas E was declared operational that month. The failure of Atlas 32E caused momentary concern over Project Mercury, but NASA reassured the public that the flight used a different model of booster and that the accident had no relevance to Mercury. The sustainer malfunction on Missile 26E had been traced to a gas generator failure which occurred during the staging sequence, but the exact reason for it was unclear, in part because of the normal momentary telemetry blackout that occurred at booster jettison due to ionized engine exhaust gases impinging on the telemetry antenna. When telemetry returned, the sustainer gas generator temperature was over 1000¬∞F (537¬∞C), suggesting a LOX-rich shutdown.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 26E Convair September 23, 1961\\" Ed Hujsak, assistant chief engineer of mechanical and propulsion systems for the Atlas program, believed that the location of the propellant lines on the E/F missiles was causing LOX and RP-1 ejected from the spent booster engines following staging to mix and explode, possibly damaging valves or plumbing. As evidence of this, he pointed to telemetry data from flights indicating a momentary pitching motion of the missile after booster jettison, which could be the result of the energy generated by exploding propellant. The conclusion was that such an event had ruptured low pressure ducting on Missile 26E and caused loss of fuel flow to the sustainer gas generator, or else propellant residue had obstructed the ducting. Hujsak proposed that additional cutoff valves be added to the propellant lines in the booster engines that would be closed just before jettison. This upgrade had to be retrofitted to missiles that had already been shipped, but Air Force officials argued that they only needed to add valves to the LOX lines on the grounds that the RP-1 could not detonate without oxidizer. On December 6, Missile 6F suffered a leak in the sustainer hydraulic system at BECO, resulting in eventual loss of hydraulic pressure and failure to achieve the planned range. After this debacle, the Air Force relented and agreed to install cutoff valves for the RP-1 lines as well, and this failure mode did not repeat itself. 1962 The final Atlas E test from CCAS was Missile 40E on February 13, 1962. With OSTF-1 back in operation, Missile 66E launched on March 1. Shortly after liftoff, a thrust section fire started in the vicinity of the fuel fill/drain valve. It continued until approximately T+50 seconds and then disappeared, but apparently resulted in damage to the thrust section, as the helium control gas leaked and resulted in vernier engine shutdown as well as no booster jettison. After BECO, the sustainer engine was left dragging the dead weight of the booster section. This combined with the loss of roll control from vernier shutdown caused the missile to tumble and finally break up at T+295 seconds. The exact reason for the thrust section fire was not determined. In addition, an erroneous signal from a pad umbilical threw open the LOX boil-off valve at liftoff, causing a gradual decay in tank pressure during ascent, although this was a secondary failure that did not contribute to the eventual loss of the missile.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 66E Convair March 14, 1962\\" The Atlas test program during 1962 mainly consisted of Atlas D and F flights, and only one other E-series flew during the year, when Missile 64E lifted from OSTF-1 on December 18 and self-destructed 40 seconds into launch when the B-2 engine shut down, resulting in a yaw maneuver that exceeded the missile's structural limits. The failure was traced to a pressure pulse at liftoff that caused the B-2 insulation boot to be jammed upward and snag on the drain valve for the turbopump lubricant oil tank. During ascent, the oil escaped until the pump ran out of lubricant and seized up, causing engine shutdown and loss of the missile.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 64E Convair January 3, 1963\\" Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, several Congressmen voiced their concern about the reliability of the ICBM arsenal and whether it would actually work if called upon. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara thus decided to carry out a test launch of an Atlas missile to verify its operability. The serial numbers of all currently deployed Atlas missiles were written down on pieces of paper, placed inside a hat, and one would be pulled at random. The winner turned out to be Missile 65E, then located at Walker Air Force Base in Kansas. This would be the first launch of an active duty ICBM from an operational silo facility, the Mk IV nuclear warhead would be replaced with a dummy unit and the guidance program changed to fire the Atlas into the Pacific Ocean instead of over the North Pole into the Soviet Union. However, the project quickly met with opposition from Kansas governor John Anderson as well as politicians from neighboring states who protested the idea of a missile flying over populated areas, especially since on-duty ICBMs lacked any Range Safety destruct system in the event of a malfunction. Even if the Atlas flew perfectly, the booster section would still have a high chance of landing in a populated area. Secretary McNamara eventually agreed to transport Atlas 65E to Vandenberg and have the Walker AFB crew launch it there. Even with this change to a safer launching locale, Congress still argued over the geopolitical implications of such a test. A failure would damage US prestige, a success would send a needless provocation to the Soviet Union especially coming on the heels of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Atlas 65E was eventually launched on April 25, 1963 from OSTF-1 at Vandenberg, as a R&D; flight carried out by a Convair team rather than the Walker missileers. The flight was completely successful and the Atlas flew 6000 miles downrange, missing the target point by only a few hundred yards.http://www.cdphs.org/deer-park-atlas- ibm.html 1963 Seven Atlas E flights took place during 1963. The first three, including 65E, were entirely successful. Atlas 24E on July 26 experienced an accidental sustainer shutdown at T+101 seconds due to electrical shorts in the Range Safety system which sent a spurious manual cutoff command. The cause of them was unclear, and GD/A could not offer any solution except improved prelaunch checkout procedures. Atlas 70E launched from 576-C on July 30 and was successful, as was 72E, launched on August 24 from OSTF-1. Atlas 71E, the last flight of the year, launched from 576-C on September 25 and experienced a sustainer hydraulic line rupture at staging, leading to missile tumbling and failure of the mission. 1964-68 Three Atlas Es were launched in 1964. The first of these was 48E on February 12. The guidance system timer failed due to liftoff-induced vibration, resulting in premature discreet cutoff signals being issued. The booster engines were shut down at T+96 seconds, the sustainer at T+240 seconds, and the verniers at T+300 seconds, causing an impact only 285 miles downrange. Missile 5E on February 25 was successful. Missile 57E on August 27 fell 60 miles short of its planned range when a malfunction of the guidance system accelerometer caused the sustainer and vernier cutoff signals to be issued early. The Atlas E and F were phased out of use as operational ICBMs in 1965 and replaced by the hypergolically-fueled Titan II. Decommissioned Atlas missiles were then used for military satellite launches from Vandenberg AFB well into the 1990s, sometimes with solid-fueled upper stages, sometimes not. These Atlases should be not be confused with the Atlas H which flew five times during the 1980s and was a standard Atlas SLV-3 (descendant of the original Atlas D) flown with solid upper stages. During 1962-74, the Air Force conducted many dozens of test flights of reentry vehicles and Nike/Zeus target missiles. Most of these were on Atlas D or F missiles, however six of them used Atlas Es. After 1964, only three Atlas Es were flown during the remainder of the 1960s, all of them successful ABRES tests in 1968. No Atlas Es were launched between 1969 and 1979. 1980-95 On December 9, 1980, Missile 68E was used to launch a NOSS ELINT satellite from VABF's SLC-3W. Shortly before staging, the B-1 engine shut down, causing the booster to perform a 180-degree loop and plummet back towards Earth. The Range Safety destruct command was sent, resulting in a high-altitude explosion. The failure was attributed to corrosion in a piece of ducting that resulted in loss of lubricant to the B-1 turbopump. The ducting in the Atlas could have been easily replaced, but the Air Force elected not to do so on the grounds that the space shuttle would be replacing expendable launch vehicles soon. In addition, the converted Atlas missiles still had various ICBM hardware features which were unnecessary for space launches and added more complexity and failure points. These included attachment ducts so that the lubricant oil tank could be mounted either horizontally or vertically during preparation for a silo launch. As a result of the postflight investigation for Atlas 68E, it was decided to inspect all existing launch vehicles for corroded plumbing and also remove unneeded ICBM hardware. The last-ever failure of an Atlas caused by the booster itself, as opposed to the upper stages or other external factors, was an attempted launch of a military GPS satellite on December 19, 1981 using Missile 76E. The B-2 engine shut down seconds after liftoff, causing the Atlas to pitch over and nosedive into the ground. The Range Safety officer sent the destruct command moments before impact, leaving a burnt crater only a few hundred feet from Launch Complex SLC3E. Investigation of the booster debris quickly pinpointed the cause of the problem; a botched repair job on a metal O-ring that caused sealant to plug up ventilation holes in the gas generator, which overpressurized and ruptured shortly after ignition. Escaping flames then burned through a LOX feed line, cutting off the flow of oxidizer to the gas generator and causing B-2 engine shutdown. On September 17, 1986, Atlas 52E successfully launched NOAA-G, a weather satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The launch had been intended for the summer of 1985, but was delayed by more than a year due to endless technical problems and the need to use the Atlas pads at VAFB for DoD launches. After a frustrating series of problems with the Atlas's LOX tank and the booster turbopumps, liftoff took place at 7:52 AM PST. The launch went perfectly and inserted the weather satellite into a 507x493 mile orbit; it was considered a \\"huge relief\\" after a year of multiple disasters for the US space program, and it orbited a badly needed satellite after the loss of GOES-G four months earlier. The final Atlas E launch (Missile 45E launched on March 24, 1995) successfully carried a weather satellite aloft for the Air Force. A total of 64 Atlas Es were launched between 1960 and 1995, thirty of them being space launches. Sixteen launches failed.

They are carnivorous ray-finned fish with venomous spines that lives on reef bottoms, camouflaged as a rock. They are one of the most venomous fish in the world, and are often included in private and public aquariums. Description Cleveland Zoo The maximum length of the species is up to 60 cm (2 ft). It is drab in colour, brownish to reddish brown, which aids in its ability to camouflage itself among the rocks of many of the tropical reefs. It shares many characteristics with Synanceia verrucosa, but has more elevated eyes than that species. It has a sedentary habit, operating as an ambush predator, but can quickly open its mouth to gulp in its prey. It eats mostly small fish, shrimp and other crustaceans, waiting until its prey swims nearby. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766. Distribution and habitat The species is coastal areas of the Indo-West Pacific: India to China, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Australia, and is also recorded in Vanuatu. Its main habitat is on or near coral reefs or in estuaries, in marine or estuarine waters. It camouflages itself around dull coloured plants, near and about rocks, or found dormant in the mud or sand.

It is located in Dhule taluka of Dhule district on Maharashtra State Highway 10 (MH SH 10). It is located 98 km towards North from District headquarters Nashik.Ajmer Soundane ( 4 km ), Bhakshi ( 6 km ), Mulane ( 6 km ), Morenagar ( 6 km ), Arai ( 6 km ) are the nearby Villages to Chaugaonhttps://soki.in/chaugaon-baglan- nashik Etymology There are four villages with the name \\"Chaugaon\\" in Dhule district, which are located in the talukas (administrative districts) of Dhule, Sindkheda, Sakri, and Shirpur. The village in Dhule taluka is commonly referred to as \\"Chaugaon-Gotane\\" to differentiate it from the others. Geography Chaugaon has a total area of . of land are used for agriculture, of which are irrigated and rainfed. Another are forested, and the remaining area comprises buildings, roadways, paths, streams, and rocky outcrops. The geography is a mixture of hills to plains. Hills are present in the forest areas, which also contain plateaus and numerous streams. The cultivated areas are made of level fields to facilitate flood irrigation; some of the rainfed land is undulating. Soil types vary from vertisol (known as \\"black cotton\\") to laterite. Soil is generally vertisol in flatter areas and reddish to buff in colour along gentle slopes. The soils tend to be reddish, with a high proportion of laterite in areas that are exposed. In both these soils and steep slopes, underlying rock is exposed. The depth of the soil varies from a few centimetres to . Minor irrigation tank on the Iraas river at Chaugaon The village is located near several bodies of water: the Iraas, a small river known as the \\"Hiraasan\\" in state records; and two small streams, the Waghad and the Bhalkhai. There is a small irrigation reservoir on the Iraas river and two percolation reservoirs on the Waghad and Bhalkhai streams. The stored water has little volume and questionable quality, but is considered acceptable for drinking and other domestic uses. The total forest area is , of which is assigned to the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) of Chaugaon. Compartment numbers in the forest records identify the parts of the forest area like survey numbers in land records. Chaugaon's JFMC number is 173. The entire forest area is vested in the state government of Maharashtra. Small populations of wild animals such as blackbuck, fox, hare, hyena, wolf, and wild boar live in the forest. There were leopard sightings reported during 2013 and 2014, and villagers living along the forest boundary have reported leopard attacks on their cattle. Killings of large domestic animals like bulls, buffaloes, and their young are reported to have increased since early 2018. Although the state government compensates people for loss of property, villagers rarely make claims due to the remoteness and non-availability of local staff, and bureaucratic complexities.  Climate  Chaugaon has three distinct seasons during the year: summer, winter, and the rainy season. The average annual maximum temperature is , and the yearly average minimum is . In the summer months of April, May and June, the daytime temperature reaches a maximum of ; May is the hottest month. Dusty and hot winds are common during the summer months, but there are no storms. Winter is from November to mid- February when the temperature drops to a minimum of . There is no snowfall, but mild hailstorms occur approximately once per decade. The rainy season occurs from mid-June through September. The average annual rainfall is , most of which falls over 60 days. The nearest rain gauge station is at Dhule. Rain precipitates from monsoon winds, and showers from northeast monsoons are occasional during the winter. Dew occasionally forms on very cold days during the winter season. Chaugaon rarely faces the problem of water scarcity for many villages in Dhule taluka. The most recent drought in Maharashtra state was during 2012‚Äì2013, and the most recent drought year before that was 1972. During the southwest monsoon season, the humidity is generally about 70%, but the air is dry for the rest of the year. In the summer season, the relative humidity is about 20% at noon. The skies are heavily clouded during the monsoon season but mostly clear for the rest of the year. Winds are generally light to moderate, with some strengthening in force during the summer and monsoon seasons. During the southwest monsoon season, winds are mainly southwesterly to westerly. In the post-monsoon season, winds are light and variable. In the winter and summer seasons, winds mostly come from the southwest and northwest. Demographics At the time of the 2011 census, Chaugaon had a population of 4,639 with 2,390 males and 2,249 females. There was an average literacy rate of 59.0%; 70.2% of males were literate, and 47.1 of females were literate. One in every six members of the population was under seven years of age. Government and politics Chaugaon has a gram panchayat (\\"village council\\") for its day-to-day administration, which is grouped with the administration of Hingane, a hamlet located to the south of Chaugaon. The gram panchayat was established on 11 April 1952. The headquarters of both the district council, called the zila parishad, and the block council, called the panchayat samiti, are in the city of Dhule. Chaugaon has no banks, but there are an agricultural cooperative, a non-agricultural cooperative, and three other credit societies.Government Of India 2001 Census Website: Administration Data for Village Code - 00157800 Chaugaon has a Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) founded to protect, conserve, develop, and manage adjoining forests. Economy One of Chaugaon's main industries is agriculture. Traditional crops include millet, coconut, cotton, peanuts, sorghum, onion, and wheat. The villagers have created a water supply for irrigation by digging wells and pumping water up to their farms. Water is available at a distance of up to from the village. During the 1990s and 2000s, farmers from Chaugaon engaged in land development works without the support of government funding to bring more fallow land under cultivation. This activity, which was still ongoing in 2010, included land leveling, terracing, bunding, nalla (the modification and creation of small streams), and training. Use of advanced farming techniques like improved seeds, drip irrigation, and chemical and organic fertilizers have led to an increase in agricultural output. In recent years, horticulture has been used for growing sugar-apple, pomegranate, and papaya. The increased prevalence of irrigation in farmed land has led to a shortage of farm labourers, which has led in turn to a rise in wage rates. Labourers from adjoining villages such as Padalda, Ajnale, and Mehergaon have been recruited to overcome the labour shortage. There is also a greater demand for farmyard manure because many farmers practice organic farming. Dairy farming is another major economic activity of the village. For decades, this was traditionally the profession of the Gawali community, but other communities have also taken it up. Buffaloes are reared for their milk, which is mostly sold to traders from Dhule, who also finance the purchasing of the buffaloes. = Village cottage industries = Historically, in Maharashtra, certain professions or village level services were community assigned. There are 12 such professions assigned to the 12 communities. These professions are called the 12 balute, and these communities are called 12 balutedars, which provided village-level services or labour. Through this system, the balutedar provides services of routine nature to the farmers throughout the year. Under the balute system, farmers had to make payment in kind, mostly in the form of a fixed volume of grains and other agricultural produce of food value every year after the harvest. Internal exchange of services was common. However, variations in profession have greatly increased in the 21st century with the spread of education, and economic development. There are other village industries in which all communities can engage themselves. Tailoring has been the traditional occupation of the Shimpi community in Chaugaon. However, changes in the socio-economic conditions of the people and the increased availability of professional training mean that people from other communities have also taken up this occupation. A number of women of other communities also tailor, specializing in women's garments. Carpentry is an important cottage industry in Chaugaon, as farmers require their services for the manufacturing and repairs of new agricultural implements. Broom-making is the hereditary and traditional occupation of the Mang community.  Culture and tourism  Buffalo fight at Chaugaon Tagatrao Mahadev mandir (temple) at Chaugaon During the Diwali festival, villagers have a custom of gathering on the river banks to watch Helyachi Takkar (male bulls' head fights). The farmers raise male buffaloes to enter these fights. The population of Chaugaon is made of various communities: Kunabi, Mali, Gawali, Bhil, Koli, Sutar, Shimpi, and Harijan. Each individual community has constructed a separate temple for its own faith or deity in or around the village settlement. The communities hold festivals that take place almost every year. Most of the other communities and sometimes other villages attend each of these festivals. These gatherings last between one day and a whole week. They include Bhajan (devotional songs), Kirtan (saint-led religious discourse), and Bhandara (community-sponsored lunch). The Shimpi community's temple of Sant Namdev in Chaugaon Chaugaon has an annual two-day fair in the month of Chaitra (March/April) of the Hindu calendar in reverence to the goddess Bhavani maata. Festivities include a tagatrao (country-made chariot), which is pulled by a pair of bulls to the temple of the goddess. Wrestling competitions are also held. On the second day there is a Tamasha, a local countryside performance of folk dance and drama. There is also an annual community stand-alone drama performance. =Dress= In Chaugaon, like elsewhere in Maharashtra, the dress of both men and women consists of two pieces, one that covers above the waist and the other below the waist. In men, the pattern and styles of dress differ slightly between communities, but the differences are more apparent in women. Within a single community, dress varies with sex and age, while attire patterns differ between the elderly and young generations. Men wear a type of shirt known locally as a kurta, sadra or angee that covers the body above the waist. Elderly men across all communities wear a dhotar (commonly called dhoti in Hindi), which is a long white cloth generally 4 metres long and 1.2 metres wide. Wrapped around the waist and legs, it is typically wound and tied at the waist with a knot at its corner. However, the dhotar is becoming less common among the younger generation, which prefer to wear shirts, trousers, and pajamas or pants. The kurta shirt (also called sadra or angee) has undergone changes due to fashions and styles over the years; the material has changed from coarse cotton to synthetics and blended fabrics. It is generally half- open at the front from neck to chest with buttons and half or full sleeves. Most elderly men wear full-sleeved Nehru shirts and Gandhi caps. Women across all castes invariably wear a saadi (commonly called sari in Hindi), with a parkar (a type of petticoat) underneath and a choli (country blouse). There are two types of saadi, one 9 metres in length, preferred by the elderly, and the other 6 metres in length, preferred by the young. The manner of wearing the saadi varies considerably between different castes. Young people wear other Indian and western-style attire. Boys wear half or full pants and shirt, with or without underwear. Girls wear North Indian-style clothing, the salwar (trousers) and kamiz (tunic), or a western-style skirt and blouse or shirt. =Jewellery= Women of all communities wear glass beads, glass bangles, and gold and silver items of jewellery. Heavy silver ornaments for women are crafted by the village goldsmith, but villagers often purchase items from Dhule, where well-crafted decorative items are available in a variety of designs. Most expensive gold ornaments are seen in rich families. Along with irrigated agriculture land, valuable items of jewellery are considered to be greatly important for a family's security because they are considered insurance for times of financial crisis. Jewellery containing pearls or precious stones is never seen in Chaugaon. Less affluent girls and women tend to wear cheap costume jewellery with bright sparkling beads and earrings. Men's ornaments Men wear gold or silver rings of different styles and designs, sometimes embedded with semi-precious stones. Some men also wear gold chains called sonsakhali around the neck, which are generally considered an indicator of wealth. Another decorative item worn with kurta or sadra is chain-woven buttons. Some young men wear a kade, an armlet made of copper or brass. Another ornament is a bhikabali, an earring generally worn in the upper part of the earlobe on the right ear. It denotes the accomplishment of navas, a vow to the Hindu deities for the fulfilment of a prayer. Also, it is acquired not from one's own money but by using funds contributed by others as donations or gifts. There is a similar ornament worn by a few men around the ankle, called a bedi. Another item called a kargota, a work of fine silver weaving worn around the waist, is very rarely seen in modern Chaugaon. Women's ornaments Since the year 2000, there has been an increasing trend for women to wear gold jewellery from head to toe. This fashion has grown along with wealth, and some of the ornaments worn by Hindu women are linked to marital status. The parts of the female body that may be adorned with items of jewellery are the hair, nose, ears, neck, wrist, hand, waist, ankle, and foot. Hair is decorated with hairpins and clips with floral or other designs, traditionally made of silver but now mostly steel or plastic. Girls and women wear nasal ornaments on the left side of the nose, where a fine hole is pierced in the nostril. The piercing is generally made before a young girl reaches the age of ten. Girls wear nose rings made of gold, silver, or glass, with pearls on the outer surface, while adult women wear nath, nathani, and fuli. A nath is a large decorative nose ring with a distinctive shape, usually worn at ceremonial events like marriages and festivals; the nathani is a miniature version of the nath; and the fuli is a spikelike ornament with the top studded with a sparkling stone. The communities that wear nath are Kunabi (Hatkar Patil), Mali, Sutar and Nhavi, while the fuli is worn by the Gawali, Lohar, Koli, Mahar, Mang, Chambhar, and Bhil communities. Almost every woman and girl is seen wearing some kind of earring. Older women favour traditional earrings, locally called bugadi, killu, dharani, khutaalaa, karnful, and hujur, while younger women can be seen wearing contemporary jewellery like plain or bead-laced earrings. Ornaments with real or artificial stones are fashionable among teenage girls, who also wear simple earrings called balyaa. Earrings may be worn either individually or in pairs. The culture considers the most important piece of jewellery worn by a married woman as the mangala sutra, a gold necklace that comes in a variety of styles and designs. This is the most revered cultural item to be worn, according to Hindu tradition. Among poorer women, the mangala sutra is made of silver rather than gold. Widows are generally forbidden to wear this item of jewellery. There are various alternative gold ornaments that can adorn the neck, which are also fashionable and decorated with different artwork and designs, including the chapalahaar, ranihaar, putalyaa, wajratik, mohanmaal, and sari necklaces. The hand is laced with silver ornaments and also decorated with bangles and rings, which come in many different designs. These are mostly fashioned from gold or rarely silver and are made by skilled craftsmen. Items of jewellery worn on the upper arm are called kade, velya, or vakya, which can be worn in addition to the baju band. For the wrist, there are ornaments called got and patlyaa. These are worn all the time in some communities, but in others they are reserved for special occasions. The ornaments worn round the waist are called kambar patta, kambarband, aakadaa, and lachcha. Decorative items are also worn on the ankle and the foot: ornaments specifically for the ankle are paijan, kalla, tode, and saakhali pattya; and toe rings called bele, masolya, and virode are also worn, but these are only meant to be worn after marriage. = Food and dietary habits = The food of the villagers of Chaugaon is invariably spicy. The staple foods are millet and sorghum; millet is consumed more. The grains of millet and sorghum are consumed by a way of preparation called Bhakari (thick baked bread). Legume also form the important part of food; horse gram, Toor dal, Moog dal, Chawli, and Udid are consumed. Rice is available in the open market and through the government-controlled Public Distribution System (PDS). In the 20th century, the high cost of rice caused it to be a sign of wealth. Cooked rice is called Bhaat. Blends of rice called Kichadi or Khichadi are prepared from rice and the legume Toor or Moog with spices and oil. Vegetables and legumes are part of the daily menu. They are either grown locally or bought from weekly markets at Kusumba or Dhule. Tomatoes, brinjals, onions, Methi, okra, Gawar, and Ambaadi, are grown locally. Potatoes and cauliflower are never grown in the village and are obtained from outside. The vegetables are cooked into a preparation called Bhaji or Shak and eaten with bhakari, a type of bread. Legumes are cooked into a preparation, Daal (Pulses) or Aamati. Daal is simply prepared and generally slightly spicy. Aamati is very spicy. Both are eaten with bhakari or cooked rice. Consumption of fruits like bananas, pomegranates, papaya, watermelon, muskmelons, and chikoo is occasional. Other minor and seasonal fruits consumed are Karwand, jambhul, and bor. Bananas, pomegranates, papaya, and bor are grown locally. Milk and its products like curd, buttermilk, butter, and ghee form an important part of the vegetarian diet, as milk is plentiful in the village. Consumption of non-vegetarian food is less common. Non-vegetarian food consists of mutton, eggs, goats, and chicken. Fish is less common. Fresh fish is occasionally eaten, but dried fish called Bombil that comes from outside the village is also consumed. The majority of the population is strictly vegetarian; notable among them are the Brahmin, Gawali, and Mali communities. Non-vegetarians consume meat at celebrations or once a week. All villagers take tea in the morning and in the afternoon. The use of milk and sugar in tea preparation is profuse. Kadhi, a preparation made from buttermilk, salt, and spices is a favourite item in Chaugaon. Chatani is another item eaten by the villagers. It is a preparation of ground chili powder and salt. Other favourite items include homemade mango pickles and paapad. Paapad is a food made from red millet, white millet, black gram, mung bean, and rice. It is either roasted or fried. The daily meal consists of Bhakar (bread), Bhaji or Daal or both, split onion, and groundnut chutney. All communities in the village take three meals a day. Nyahari (breakfast) is taken early in the morning before going out to work, generally before 10 A.M. The afternoon midday meal is taken at about 2 P.M. Dinner is at night between 6 and 9 P.M. Festivals are celebrated with sweets like Puran poli, puri, shira, khir, fried paapad, kurdai, bhajee, and pakoda. At the Diwali festival, Karanji, Anararse, Ladoo, Chivada, and shev are prepared. For the Akshay trutiya festival, aamras and puran poli are eaten. Every community has its own preparations for festivals.

After retiring from his playing career, during which he played for C√¥ng football club (also known as the Army club) and the Vietnamese national side, V∆∞∆°ng turned to coaching and coached a number of Vietnamese football clubs. Playing career V∆∞∆°ng Ti·∫øn D≈©ng joined C√¥ng football club in May 1965, and two years later traveled to North Korea for nearly a year of training. After returning to Vietnam in May 1968, he was selected for the North Vietnamese national squad. V∆∞∆°ng retired from professional playing in 1978. Coaching career After ending his playing career, V∆∞∆°ng spent the years from 1978 to 1983 studying at the University of Military Sport in the Soviet Union. Upon his return to Vietnam, he pursued a career training young players, and in 1998 he took up the job of coaching his old team, C√¥ng. With C√¥ng, he won the Vietnamese league championship in 1998, and in early 1999 they went on to win the Super Cup after defeating the Vietnam Police football club in H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City. That same year, he took the team to the Vietnamese Under-21 championship. But he left shortly afterward, after an apparent fall out with the military. After leaving C√¥ng, V∆∞∆°ng went on to manage a number of clubs in the top two tiers of Vietnamese league football. In 2001, he was managing C·∫ßn Th∆°, but the next year he moved back closer to his family home to manage the Vietnam Airlines football club in Hanoi (which had been formed from the former Hanoi Police football club, after the aviation corporation became independent). After his spell at Vietnam Airlines, in 2003 he signed a coaching contract with Thanh H√≥a F.C. In July 2004, V∆∞∆°ng moved on to coach B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng football club. During his first championship in charge, he took the team to the top spot, but by the end of the season B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng had dropped back to the bronze medal position. The team's biggest defeat, losing 5-0 to ƒê√† N·∫µng at the Chi LƒÉng stadium, led to V∆∞∆°ng's resignation after only a year with the club. Just a month later, Vuong signed a contract with H√≤a Ph√°t H√† N·ªôi, although many other teams were keen to attract him. At the end of the 2006 season, H√≤a Ph√°t H√† N·ªôi were in 11th place out of 14, but were surprise winners of the Vietnam Football Cup. After this achievement, Vuong was elected the Vietnam newspapers' Football Coach of the Year for 2006. However, a disappointing 2007 season saw the team only manage to finish in 12th place out of 14, and they were eliminated in the quarter finals of the cup. This led to Vuong's resignation. Two months later, Vuong accepted an invitation to move to Hai Phong Cement football club, where he led the team to third place in the 2008 championship. Although that was the club's best finish for many years, Vuong's contract was not extended, and the club brought in Austrian manager Alfred Riedl as coach the following year. After a short spell back at his original club, Cong, Vuong resumed the coaching position at Hai Phong Cement football club in September 2008.

Appointed at the age of 38, he remains one of the youngest civil servants to have headed a British Government department.Geoffrey-Lloyd, \\"Bullock, Sir Christopher Llewellyn (1891‚Äì1972)\\", rev. Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004Grey, C. J., A History of the Air Ministry, 1942Joubert, Air Chief Marshal Sir Philip, The Third Service, p. 107Chapman, Richard A., Ethics in the British Civil Service, 1988 , p. 144 Early years The son of Rev. L. Bullock and his wife Cecil, granddaughter of Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney, Sir Christopher's academic achievements were considerable. He gained a classical scholarship from Rugby to Trinity College, Cambridge from which he graduated in the first division of the first class of the Classical Tripos in 1913, twice winning a Browne medal, and was offered a fellowship at Trinity. After taking first place in the open competition for the Home and Indian Civil Services in 1914, he chose India, but at the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered for service with the Rifle Brigade Special Service. He was one of three officers (and 175 men) of the battalion wounded on 6 July 1915 during a major attack by the 11th Infantry Brigade on the German trenches near the small Flanders village of Boesinghe (Boezinge), about three miles north of Ypres, following the Second Battle of Ypres. He was seriously wounded and mentioned in dispatches. Role in British aviation Returning to active service, he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, training as an observer and then gaining his wings as a pilot in Egypt before being declared unfit for flying duties in 1917. He then joined the Air Staff, beginning his work for the Air Ministry, and was appointed O.B.E. in 1919. He was appointed C.B.E. in 1926, C.B. in 1929 and K.C.B. in 1932. =Royal Air Force= In 1919, he became principal private secretary to Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for Air. From then on until 1930, he served successive Secretaries of State including Sir Samuel Hoare and The Lord Thomson, fighting with Lord Trenchard, as Trenchard's right-hand man on the civilian side, against resistance and powerful forces within Whitehall and the hostility of the Navy and the Army to the establishment of a permanent independent Royal Air Force. On 12 June 1930, the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, agreed to his appointment as Permanent Under-Secretary at the age of 38. During the 1930s, he worked with great determination under considerable pressure on the expansion of the RAF during the period in which the menace of Nazism rose in Germany. Bullock was personally committed to the policy of expansion and strove, against the pacific temper of the time, to awaken public and Parliament to the need to strengthen the RAF to meet the dangers that lay ahead.Chapman, p. 144 Even when Churchill was not in government during the 1930s, Bullock supplied him with figures on German air strength which Churchill used in attacking the Government's policy of appeasement.Chapman, p. 303Montgomery Hyde, H., British Air Policy between the Wars: 1918‚Äì1939 London: Heinemann. 1976, note p. 462. His supporters included T.E. Lawrence, who wrote in 1934, \\"Bullock is doing well. I wish he was C.A.S. (Chief of the Air Staff) and the Air Council as well!\\". His achievements have been justly recognised in the accounts of rearmament and the role of the RAF during the Second World War.Chapman, p. 174 Described as \\"a man of brilliant youthful academic achievement and manic self regard\\", and by Trenchard as \\"the man with the finest brain I ever met with\\" and one of his own chief advisers, Bullock made powerful enemies ‚Äì \\"but not in the Air Ministry!\\" ‚Äì as he sought to impose his views of the emerging power of the aeroplane on the Armed Forces and the Government. Among those who took against him was Sir Warren Fisher, the Head of the Civil Service, who was notorious for his wish to control senior appointments in the civil service and to second-guess defence policy.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp 726‚Äì727 The survival of Britain in the Second World War was largely due to the foundations that Bullock laid for the vast expansion of the RAF.Dunnett, Sir James, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Defence, Letter to R H W Bullock, 18 May 1972 Of all the Civil Servants known by Lord Hankey, Secretary of the Cabinet, Bullock made by far the greatest creative contribution to the Defence effort. For ten peacetime years, Bullock worked as if already at war. =Civil aviation= He also made a great impact on the extension of British Civil Aviation through his support for Imperial Airways and by his part in creating the Empire Air Mail Scheme, in which he went as a passenger in one of the early proving flights to India in December 1926.Montgomery Hyde p. 191 He negotiated overflight and landing rights with South Africa and other African administrations, Australia and India. In 1929, he participated in early test flights of the Government funded airship, R101, part of the Imperial Airship Scheme. He was instrumental in persuading the Secretary of State for Air, Christopher Birdwood Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson ‚Äì an enthusiastic proponent of airships ‚Äì to delay the construction of a larger and more expensive airship, R102 (which would have cost over ¬£2m at contemporary prices), until R101 had successfully completed its maiden flight to India.Masefield, Peter G., To Ride The Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101. London: William Kimber and Co. Ltd., Godolphin House, 1982. . In the event Bullock's caution was justified. R101 crashed only a few hours into its maiden flight, killing Lord Thomson and most of the crew. Shortly afterwards the Government abandoned the Imperial Airship Scheme. =Dismissal= On 6 August 1936, he was dismissed from his post by the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on the advice of Sir Warren Fisher, following the report of a Board of Inquiry into his dealings with Sir Eric Geddes, the Chairman of Imperial Airways. The Board found that he had abused his position as head of the Ministry to seek a place on the Board of Imperial Airways, at a time when his Ministry was negotiating with the company to establish an air mail service ‚Äì he had \\"interlaced public negotiations entrusted to him with the advancement of his personal or private interests\\" but also that \\"he at no time appreciated the gravity or fully realised the true nature or possible consequences of what he was doing and we consider that his failure to do so goes far to explain, though it cannot excuse, what has occurred\\".Chapman, p. 156 As far as is known, he remains the only Permanent Under-Secretary to have been dismissed from the civil service.Chapman, p. 142 After his dismissal, he received thousands of letters of support. His case was taken up in the United States by Time Magazine, which wrote: \\"Thus Sir Christopher Bullock had his career broken last week without anything specific being brought out against him. Among British aviators, the view was that Sir Christopher is easily worth ten of the men who investigated and broke him.\\"Time Magazine, 17 August 1936 \\"The gentlemen of the Air Ministry recently manoeuvred Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin into dismissing the only one of its civil servants with a practical grasp of Britain's colossal problems in air rearmament, Sir Christopher Bullock.\\"Time Magazine, 2 November 1936 On leaving the Civil Service, Bullock went on to pursue a successful career in business, being appointed to the board of a number of public companies. Recognition Within the Government doubts quickly began to be voiced about the justice of his treatment. Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their decision had been wrong.Chapman, p. 158 As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote \\"I feel it only right to say that, if I had had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did\\". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated \\"the more I think about it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime\\".S.W.Roskill, Hankey, man of secrets In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry ‚Äì the Secretary of State for Air at the time of the dismissal ‚Äì wrote privately to Baldwin \\"...[Bullock] was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did.\\"Montgomery Hyde, p. 387 In the spring of 1940, the injustice he had suffered was privately recognised when he was offered the Headship of the Petroleum Warfare Department which would have been de facto reinstatement and full restitution. Bullock declined, arguing that he was more valuable to the war effort as an industrialist.Chapman, pp. 162, 174 After the war, his case was reviewed by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, who concluded that the case against Bullock would have met if he had been allowed to resign in 1936 as no corruption was alleged ‚Äì \\"it was really a case in which his zeal had outrun his discretion\\".Chapman, p. 164 Nonetheless Jowitt advised the Prime Minister Clement Attlee that he should not alter the decision \\"after all these years\\". Accordingly, Attlee wrote to confirm Jowitt's conclusions but Bullock did not regard this as adequate redress.Chapman, p. 165 Viscount Templewood wrote, in 1957, \\"Whatever may have been the merits of the dispute in which he (Bullock) was then involved ‚Äì and I may say that I took his side, and that none of the charges in any way affected his honour ‚Äì the fact remains that by his departure the Air Force lost one of its ablest defenders\\".Templewood, Viscount, Empire of the Air, The Advent of the Air Age, 1922 ‚Äì 1929, Collins, 1957, p. 51 Despite campaigning for many years, Bullock never secured the redress he desired and died in 1972 without any official statement being issued about his treatment. Public acknowledgment that his dismissal had been mistaken was belatedly made after his death when his Memorial Service at the Central Church of the Royal Air Force, St Clement Danes was attended by representatives of the Prime Minister, (Victor Goodhew M.P.), Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (RAF), (Lord Lambton M.P.), the Home Civil Service (Permanent Under Secretary of State for the Ministry of Defence, Sir James Dunnett) and the Air Force Board (Air Chief Marshal Sir Edmund Hudleston and Air Chief Marshal Sir Denis Smallwood). The Address was given by The Rt. Hon. Lord Geoffrey Lloyd M.P. Sir William Armstrong, Head of the Civil Service at the time of Bullock's death, wrote of \\"a great personal tragedy which clouded the rest of his life\\", many considering that \\"his treatment had been unduly severe\\", there being \\"no doubt at any time about his great abilities\\".Armstrong, Sir William, Letter, The Times, 20 May 1972 Family Bullock's elder brother was Professor Walter Llewellyn Bullock. On 18 April 1917, he married Barbara May Lupton at the main Unitarian church of West London, Essex Church, The Mall, Kensington. Sir Christopher and Lady Bullock had two sons, Richard Henry Watson Bullock CB and Edward Anthony Watson Bullock, both of whom entered public service, in the Home Civil Service and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office respectively.

David Shukman, BBC News. 19 February 2018. The 1968 sinking of K-129 occurred approximately northwest of Hawaii. Project Azorian was one of the most complex, expensive, and secretive intelligence operations of the Cold War at a cost of about $800 million, or $ billion today. In addition to designing the recovery ship and its lifting cradle, the U.S. used concepts developed with Global Marine (see Project Mohole) that utilized their precision stability equipment to keep the ship nearly stationary above the target while lowering nearly of pipe. They worked with scientists to develop methods for preserving paper that had been underwater for years in hopes of being able to recover and read the submarine's codebooks. The reasons this project was undertaken probably included the recovery of an intact R-21 nuclear missile and cryptological documents and equipment. The Soviet Union was unable to locate K-129, but the US knew where to look. Based on data recorded by four Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) sites and the Adak Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) array, the US identified an acoustic event on March 8 that likely originated from an explosion aboard the submarine. The US zeroed in on the location to within . The submarine located the boat using the Fish, a towed, , collection of cameras, strobe lights, and sonar that was built to withstand extreme depths. The recovery operation in international waters about six years later used as its cover mining the sea floor for manganese nodules. The company was nominally owned by Howard Hughes who, secretly backed by the CIA, had paid for construction of Hughes Glomar Explorer. While the ship recovered a portion of K-129, a mechanical failure in the grapple caused two-thirds of the recovered section to break off during recovery.  The wreck of K-129  In April 1968, Soviet Pacific Fleet surface and air assets were observed conducting a surge deployment to the North Pacific Ocean that involved some unusual search operations. The activity was evaluated by the United States Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) as a possible reaction to the loss of a Soviet submarine. Soviet surface ship searches were centered on a location known to be associated with Soviet Golf II-class strategic ballistic missile (SSB) diesel submarine patrol routes. These submarines carried three nuclear missiles in an extended sail/conning tower, and routinely deployed within missile range of the US west coast. After weeks of search, the Soviets were unable to locate the sunken boat, and Soviet Pacific Fleet operations gradually returned to normal. The American SOSUS hydrophone network in the northern Pacific was tasked with reviewing its recordings in the hope of detecting an implosion (or explosion) related to such a loss. The Navy analyzed acoustic data from four AFTAC sites and the Adak, Alaska SOSUS array, locating the wreck of the submarine to within 5 nautical miles. The site was hundreds of miles away from the Soviet Navy search area. Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Point Sur, south of Monterey, California, was able to isolate a sonic signature on its low frequency array recordings of an implosion event that had occurred on March 8, 1968. Using NavFac Point Sur's date and time of the event, NavFac Adak and the US West Coast NAVFAC were also able to isolate the acoustic event. With five SOSUS lines-of-bearing, Naval Intelligence was able to localize the site of the K-129 wreck to the vicinity of 40.1¬∞ N latitude and 179.9¬∞ E longitude (close to the International Date Line). In July 1968, the United States Navy initiated \\"Operation Sand Dollar\\" with the deployment of from Pearl Harbor to the wreck site. Sand Dollar's objective was to find and photograph K-129. In 1965, Halibut had been configured to use deep submergence search equipment, the only such specially-equipped submarine then in US inventory. Halibut located the wreck after three weeks of visual search using robotic remote- controlled cameras. (It took almost five months of search to find the wreck of the US nuclear-powered submarine in the Atlantic, also in 1968). Halibut is reported to have spent the next several weeks taking over 20,000 closeup photos of every aspect of the K-129 wreck, a feat for which Halibut received a special classified Presidential Unit Citation signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. In 1970, based upon this photography, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird and Henry Kissinger, then National Security Advisor, proposed a clandestine plan to recover the wreckage so that the US could study Soviet nuclear missile technology, as well as possibly recover cryptographic materials. The proposal was accepted by President Richard Nixon and the CIA was tasked to attempt the recovery. Building Glomar Explorer, and its cover story Global Marine Development Inc., the research and development arm of Global Marine Inc., a pioneer in deepwater offshore drilling operations, was contracted to design, build and operate Hughes Glomar Explorer to secretly salvage the sunken Soviet submarine. The ship was built at the Sun Shipbuilding yard near Philadelphia. Billionaire businessman Howard Hughes ‚Äî whose companies were already contractors on numerous classified US military weapons, aircraft and satellite contracts ‚Äî agreed to lend his name to the project to support the cover story that the ship was mining manganese nodules from the ocean floor, but Hughes and his companies had no actual involvement in the project. K-129 was photographed at a depth of over , and thus the salvage operation would be well beyond the depth of any ship salvage operation ever attempted. On November 1, 1972, work began on the , Hughes Glomar Explorer (HGE). Recovery The recovery site of –ö-129 based on the intersection of three circles marking the distances to Long Beach, CA, Pearl Harbor, HI, and Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka. Hughes Glomar Explorer employed a large mechanical claw, which Lockheed officially titled the \\"Capture Vehicle\\" but affectionately called Clementine. The capture vehicle was designed to be lowered to the ocean floor, grasp the targeted submarine section, and then lift that section into the ship's hold. One requirement of this technology was to keep the floating base stable and in position over a fixed point below the ocean surface. The capture vehicle was lowered and raised on a pipe string similar to those used on oil drilling rigs. Section by section, pairs of steel pipes were strung together to lower the claw through a hole in the middle of the ship. This configuration was designed by Western Gear Corp. of Everett, Washington. Upon a successful capture by the claw, the lift reversed the process ‚Äî pairs drawn up and removed one at a time. The salvaged \\"Target Object\\" was thus to be drawn into a moon pool, the doors of which could then be closed to form a floor for the salvaged section. This allowed for the entire salvage process to take place underwater, away from the view of other ships, aircraft, or spy satellites. Sailing from Long Beach, California, on June 20, 1974, Hughes Glomar Explorer arrived at the recovery site July 4 and conducted salvage operations for over a month. During this period, at least two Soviet Navy ships visited Hughes Glomar Explorers work site, the oceangoing tugboat SB-10, and the Soviet missile range instrumentation ship Chazma. It was found out after 1991 that the Soviets were tipped off about the operation and were aware that the CIA was planning some kind of salvage operation, but the military command believed it impossible that they could perform such a task and disregarded further intelligence warnings. Later, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin started sending urgent messages back to the Soviet Navy warning that an operation was imminent. Soviet military engineering experts reevaluated their positions and claimed that it was indeed possible (though highly unlikely) to recover K-129, and ships in the area were ordered to report any unusual activity, although the lack of knowledge as to where K-129 was located impeded their ability to stop any salvage operation. US Army Major General Roland Lajoie stated that, according to a briefing he received by the CIA during recovery operations, Clementine suffered a catastrophic failure, causing two-thirds of the already raised portion of K-129 to sink back to the ocean floor. Former Lockheed and Hughes Global Marine employees who worked on the operation have stated that several of the \\"claws\\" intended to grab the submarine fractured, possibly because they were manufactured from maraging steel, which is very strong, but not very ductile compared with other kinds of steel. Video of the Soviet sailors being buried at sea The recovered section included two nuclear torpedoes, and thus Project Azorian was not a complete failure. The bodies of six crewmen were also recovered, and were given a memorial service and with military honors, buried at sea in a metal casket because of radioactivity concerns. Other crew members have reported that code books and other materials of apparent interest to CIA employees aboard the vessel were recovered, and images of inventory printouts exhibited in the documentary suggest that various submarine components, such as hatch covers, instruments and sonar equipment were also recovered. White's documentary also states that the ship's bell from K-129 was recovered, and was subsequently returned to the Soviet Union as part of a diplomatic effort. The CIA considered the project one of the greatest intelligence coups of the Cold War. The entire salvage operation was recorded by a CIA documentary film crew, but this film remains classified. A short portion of the film, showing the recovery and subsequent burial at sea of the six bodies recovered in the forward section of K-129, was given to the Russian government in 1992. Public disclosureThe New York Times suppresses its story= Jack Anderson has been credited as breaking the story of Hughes Glomar Explorer to a nationwide audience. Rejecting a plea from the Director of Central Intelligence William Colby to suppress the story, Anderson said he released the story because \\"Navy experts have told us that the sunken sub contains no real secrets and that the project, therefore, is a waste of the taxpayers‚Äô money.\\" In February 1975, investigative reporter and former New York Times writer Seymour Hersh had planned to publish a story on Project Azorian. Bill Kovach, the New York Times Washington bureau chief at the time, said in 2005 that the government offered a convincing argument to delay publication ‚Äî exposure at that time, while the project was ongoing, \\"would have caused an international incident.\\" The New York Times published its account in March 1975,Phelan, James. \\"An Easy Burglary Led to the Disclosure of Hughes-C.I.A.

W. Bush reported on several occasions to U.S. president Gerald Ford on media reports and the future use of the ship. The CIA concluded that it seemed unclear what, if any, action was taken by the Soviet Union after learning of the story. =Freedom of Information Act request and the Glomar response= After stories had been published about the CIA's attempts to stop publication of information about Project Azorian, Harriet Ann Phillippi, a journalist, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the CIA for any records about the CIA's attempts. The CIA refused to either confirm or deny the existence of such documents.Philippi v.

Portions of this video were shown on television documentaries concerning Project Azorian, including a 1998 Discovery Channel special called A Matter of National Security (based on Clyde W. Burleson's book, The Jennifer Project (1977)) and again in 1999, on a PBS Cold War submarine episode of NOVA.Clyde W, Burleson, author, \\"The Jennifer Project\\", 1977PBS,Nova, \\"Submarines, Secrets and Spies\\". Broadcast January, 1999. = 2010 release of 1985 CIA article = In February 2010, the CIA released an article from the fall 1985 edition of the CIA internal journal Studies in Intelligence following an application by researcher Matthew Aid at the National Security Archive to declassify the information under the US Freedom of Information Act. Exactly what the operation managed to salvage remained unclear.\\"US admits salvaging sunken Soviet submarine - The American government has finally revealed details of a secret mission to raise a sunken Soviet submarine The report was written by an unidentified participant in Project Azorian. = 2010 release of President Ford cabinet meeting = During the aftermath of the publication of the \\"Project Jennifer\\" story by Seymour Hersh, U.S. President Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger, Philip Buchen (Counsel to the President), John O. Marsh, Jr. (Counselor to the President), Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld, USAF Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft (Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs), and William Colby (Director of Central Intelligence) discussed the leak and whether the Ford administration would react to Hersh's story. In a cabinet meeting on March 19, 1975 (the same day The New York Times published the story), Secretary of Defense Schlesinger is quoted as saying, With the words \\"marvel\\" and \\"major American accomplishment\\" used to describe Operation Matador, the Secretary of Defense indicated at least some form of success that should be confirmed publicly.Document Friday: The Origins of \\"Glomar\\" Declassified, William Burr, June 15, 2012. The director of CIA, William Colby dissented, recalling the U-2 crisis, saying: The result of the meeting was to stonewall, causing the Los Angeles Times to publish a 4-page story the next day by Jack Nelson with the headline, \\"Administration Won't Talk About Sub Raised by CIA.\\" Conspiracy theory Time magazine as well as a court filing by Felice D. Cohen and Morton H. Halperin on behalf of the Military Audit Project suggest that the alleged project goal of raising a Soviet submarine might itself have been a cover story for another secret mission. Tapping of undersea communication cables (which actually did happen in the unrelated Operation Ivy Bells), the installation of an underwater equivalent of a missile silo, and installation and repair of surveillance systems to monitor ship and submarine movements are listed as possibilities for the actual purpose of such a secret mission. New eyewitness account W. Craig Reed, in Red November: Inside the Secret U.S. - Soviet Submarine War (2010), contains an inside account of Project Azorian provided by Joe Houston, the senior engineer who designed leading-edge camera systems used by the Hughes Glomar Explorer team to photograph K-129 on the ocean floor. The team needed pictures that offered precise measurements to design the grappling arm and other systems used to bring the sunken submarine up from the bottom. Houston worked for the mysterious \\"Mr. P\\" (John Parangosky) who worked for CIA Deputy Director Carl E. Duckett ‚Äî the two leaders of Project Azorian. Duckett later worked with Houston at another company, and intimated that the CIA may have recovered much more from the K-129 than admitted to publicly. Reed also details how the mini-sub technology used by the submarine Halibut to find K-129 was used for subsequent Operation Ivy Bells missions to wiretap underwater Soviet communications cables. In a documentary film titled Azorian: The Raising Of The K-129, which was produced by Michael White and released in 2009, three principals who participated in the design of the Hughes Glomar Explorer heavy lift system and the Lockheed capture vehicle (CV or claw) gave on-camera interviews. These individuals were also on board the ship during the mission and were intimately involved with the recovery operation. They are Sherman Wetmore, Global Marine heavy lift operations manager; Charlie Johnson, Global Marine heavy lift engineer; and Raymond Feldman, Lockheed Ocean Systems senior staff engineer. These three, plus others who were not on board during the recovery but were cleared on all aspects of the mission, confirmed that only of the bow was eventually recovered. The intent was to recover the forward two thirds () of K-129, which had broken off from the rear section of the submarine and was designated the Target Object (TO). The capture vehicle successfully lifted the TO from the ocean floor. On the way up, a failure of part of the capture vehicle caused the loss of , including the sail, of the TO. In October 2010 a book based on the film, Project Azorian: The CIA And The Raising of the K-129 by Norman Polmar and Michael White, was published. The book contains additional documentary evidence about the effort to locate the submarine and the recovery operation.

Projekt 629A, NATO reporting name Golf II‚Äìclass) diesel-electric powered ballistic missile submarine that served in the Pacific Fleet of the Soviet Navy‚Äìone of six Project 629 strategic ballistic missile submarines assigned to the 15th Submarine Squadron based at Rybachiy Naval Base near Petropavlovsk‚Äìcommanded by Counter Admiral Rudolf A. Golosov. The K-129s commander was Captain First Rank V.I. Kobzar and she carried the hull number 722 on her final deployment, during which she sank on 8 March 1968. It was one of four mysterious submarine disappearances in 1968, the others being the Israeli submarine , the and the American submarine . After nearly two months of silence during her patrol in the Pacific Ocean, the Soviet Navy became concerned of her status and reportedly deployed its large assets of aviation and ships to search for the vessel, but no sign or wreckage was found. With the U.S. Navy observing the Soviet efforts, the Americans also began searching, ultimately determining the exact coordinates of the wreck in August 1968. In 1974, the United States attempted to recover the submarine in a secretive Cold War-era effort named Project Azorian. The submarine's position below the surface was the greatest depth from which an attempt had been made to raise a ship; only a part of the submarine was recovered despite efforts. The cover story was that the salvage vessel was engaged in commercial manganese nodule mining. Launch and operations Project 629A submarine The keel of K-129 was laid down on 15 March 1958 at Komsomolsk-on-Amur Shipyard No. 132. It was launched on 16 May 1959, with its acceptance certificate signed on 31 December 1959. It was assigned to the 123rd Brigade, 40th Division of the Soviet Pacific Fleet at Vladivostok. On 1960, it was reassigned to 15th Submarine Squadron based at Rybachiy Naval Base in Kamchatka. On 3 April 1964, K-129 underwent modernization under project 629A at Dalzavod in Vladivostok and re-entered service following completion of modernization on 30 May 1967. In January 1968, K-129 was assigned to the 15th Submarine Squadron was part of the 29th Ballistic Missile Division at Rybachiy, commanded by Admiral Viktor A. Dygalo.  Sinking  The K-129, having completed two 70-day ballistic-missile combat patrols in 1967, was tasked with her third patrol in February 1968, with an expected completion date of 5 May 1968. Upon departure on 24 February, K-129 reached deep water, conducted a test dive, returned to the surface and reported by radio that all was well, and proceeded on patrol. Upon her final deployment, the K-129s commander was Captain First Rank Vladimir I. Kobzar and Captain Second Rank Alexander M. Zhuravin as senior assistant to the commander. She carried the hull number 722 on her final deployment. No further communication was received from K-129, despite normal radio check-ins expected when the submarine crossed the 180th meridian, and further when it arrived at its patrol area. By mid- March, Soviet Navy commanders in Kamchatka became concerned that K-129 had missed two consecutive radio check-ins. First, K-129 was instructed by normal fleet broadcast to break radio silence and contact headquarters; later and more urgent communications all went unanswered. Soviet naval headquarters declared K-129 missing by the third week of March and organized an air, surface, and sub-surface search-and-rescue effort in the North Pacific from Kamchatka and Vladivostok. This Soviet deployment in the Pacific was analysed by U.S. intelligence as likely a reaction to a submarine loss. U.S. SOSUS Naval Facilities (NAVFACs) in the North Pacific were alerted and requested to review acoustic records on 8 March 1968 to identify any possible anomalous signal. Acoustic data from four AFTAC sites and the Adak, Alaska SOSUS array triangulated a potential event location to within 5 nautical miles, a site hundreds of miles away from where the Soviet Navy had been searching. Several SOSUS arrays recorded a possibly related event on 8 March 1968, and upon examination produced sufficient triangulation by lines-of-bearing to provide the U.S. Navy with a locus for the probable wreck site. One source characterized the acoustic signal as \\"an isolated, single sound of an explosion or implosion, 'a good-sized bang'.\\"Craven, 2001 The acoustic event was reported to have originated near 40 N, 180th longitude. Soviet search efforts, lacking the equivalent of the U.S. SOSUS system, were unable to locate K-129, and eventually Soviet naval activity in the North Pacific returned to normal. K-129 was subsequently declared lost with all hands. Recovery: Project Azorian The wreck of K-129 was identified by northwest of Oahu at an approximate depth of on 20 August 1968.\\"K-129\\", in Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence, by Nigel West (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015) p183 It was surveyed in detail over the next three weeks by Halibut ‚Äì reportedly with over 20,000 close-up photos ‚Äì and later also possibly by the bathyscaphe . Given a unique opportunity to recover a Soviet SS-N-5 Serb nuclear missile without the knowledge of the Soviet Union, the K-129 wreck came to the attention of U.S. national authorities. President Nixon authorized a salvage attempt after consideration by the Secretary of Defense and the White House. To ensure the salvage attempt remained \\"black\\" (i.e. clandestine and secret) the CIA, rather than the Navy, was tasked to conduct the operation. Hughes Glomar Explorer was designed and built under CIA contract solely for the purpose of conducting a clandestine salvage of K-129. The salvage operation, named Project Azorian, would be one of the most expensive and deepest secrets of the Cold War. The recovery site of –ö-129 based on the intersection of three circles marking the distances to Long Beach, CA, Pearl Harbor, HI, and Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka. The location of the wreck remains an official secret of the United States intelligence services. However, Dr. John P. Craven points to a location nearly 40 degrees North, and almost exactly on the 180th meridian. CIA documents reveal that it sank \\"1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii,\\" and that Hughes Glomar Explorer had to travel 3,008 miles from Long Beach, California, to reach the recovery site. The International Atomic Energy Agency states that two nuclear warheads from K-129 were located in the Pacific 1,230 miles from Kamchatka at coordinates 40¬∞6'N and 179¬∞57'E at a depth of , and lists them as recovered. All three distances point to a location of , which is close to north of the Midway Atoll. The CIA gives for its approximate depth. =Media reporting= Seymour Hersh of The New York Times uncovered some of the details of Project Azorian in 1974, but was kept from publication by the action of the Director of Central Intelligence, William Colby. Months after the salvage operation was completed, in February 1975, the Los Angeles Times ran a brief story regarding the CIA operation, which led The New York Times to release Hersh's story. Jack Anderson continued the story on national television in March 1975.Project Azorian: The Story of the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a CIA declassified Secret Noforn document from the mid-1980s. The media called the operation Project Jennifer, which in 2010 was revealed to be incorrect, since Jennifer referred only to a security system which compartmentalised Azorian project data. Hughes Glomar Explorer was publicly believed to be mining manganese nodules on the sea floor. Once the real purpose of Azorian was leaked to the media, however, the Soviet Union eventually found out about what happened. According to one account, in July‚ÄìAugust 1974 Hughes Glomar Explorer grappled with and was able to lift the forward half of the wreck of K-129, but as it was raised the claw suffered a critical failure resulting in the forward section breaking into two pieces with the all-important sail area and centre section falling back to the ocean floor. Thus the centre sail area and the after portions of K-129 were allegedly not recovered. What exactly was retrieved in the section that was recovered is classified Secret Noforn or Top Secret, but the Soviets assumed that the United States recovered torpedoes with nuclear warheads, operations manuals, code books and coding machines. Another source (unofficial) states that the U.S. recovered the bow area, which contained two nuclear torpedoes,Polmar, 2004, Cold War Submarines but no cryptographic equipment nor code books. The United States announced that in the section they recovered were the bodies of six men. Due to radioactive contamination, the bodies were buried at sea in a steel chamber in September 1974, with full military honors about southwest of Hawaii. The videotape of that ceremony was given to Russia by U.S. Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates when he visited Moscow in October 1992. The relatives of the crew members were eventually shown the video some years later. =Continued secrecy= The K-129 recovery has been stated to have been a failure, recovering only a small amount of insignificant parts of the submarine. The CIA argued in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, however, that the project had to be kept secret because any \\"official acknowledgment of involvement by U.S. Government agencies would disclose the nature and purpose of the program.\\" This response has entered the lexicon of legal jargon as the Glomar response or Glomarization; \\"neither confirm nor deny\\". As of 2018 the files, photographs, videotapes and other documentary evidence remain closed to the public. A few pictures appeared in a 2010 documentary showing the K-129 wreck: the bow and the sail, with the missile compartment heavily damaged showing only one missile tube left attached to the structure.  Causes  Profiles of a Project 629A (Golf II) ballistic missile submarine like the K-129 The official Soviet Navy hypothesis is that K-129, while operating in snorkel mode, slipped below its operating depth. Such an event, combined with a mechanical failure or improper crew reaction, can cause flooding sufficient to sink the boat.Podvig, 2001, Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces, p. 290 This account, however, has not been accepted by many, and four alternative theories have been advanced to explain the loss of K-129: # A hydrogen explosion in the batteries while charging; # A collision with ; # A missile explosion caused by a leaking missile door seal; # Intentional or unintentional scuttle by crew due to K-129 violating normal operating procedures and/or departing from authorised operating areas. Reportedly, as many as 40 of the complement of 98 were new to the submarine for this deployment. K-129 was approximately midway through standard shore leave/replenishment and repair when a new mission was tasked.Sewell (2005) Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces, Center for Arms Control Studies, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, edited by Pavel Podvig =Battery malfunction= Lead‚Äìacid batteries release explosive hydrogen gas while charging. The hydrogen gas, if not properly vented, could have accumulated into an explosive concentration. Dr. John P. Craven, former chief scientist of the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office and former head of the DSSP and DSRV programs, commented: > I have never seen or heard of a submarine disaster that was not accompanied > by the notion that the battery blew up and started it all. [...] Naive > investigators, examining the damage in salvaged battery compartments, > invariably blame the sinking on battery explosions until they learn that any > fully charged battery suddenly exposed to seawater will explode. It is an > inevitable effect of a sinking and almost never a cause. At least one American submarine, , on the other hand, was lost off Norway in 1949 due to a hydrogen explosion in the battery compartment. Most of Cochino's crew was rescued and the cause of her sinking is therefore known.Sontag and Drew, Blind Man's Bluff. New York: Public Affairs (1998) pp. 12‚Äì24 =Collision with USS Swordfish= It was standard practice during the Cold War for U.S. Navy attack submarines to trail Soviet missile submarines as they departed their home ports and moved into the North Pacific or the North Atlantic Ocean. The collision hypothesis is the unofficial opinion of many Soviet Navy officers,Offley, Ed Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon (Paperback ‚Äì 24 March 2008) and is officially denied by the U.S. Navy. According to U.S. Navy sources, put into Yokosuka, Japan, on 17 March 1968, shortly after the disappearance of K-129, and received emergency repairs to a bent periscope, reportedly caused by ice impacted during surfacing while conducting classified operations in the Sea of Japan. The seizure by the North Korean government occurred in the Sea of Japan on 23 January 1968, and the U.S. Navy response to this incident included the deployment and maintenance of naval assets in the area off the eastern North Korean coast for some time thereafter. In response to Russian efforts to ascertain whether K-129 had been lost due to damage resulting from a collision with a U.S. submarine, an official U.S. statement by Ambassador Malcolm Toon to a Russian delegation during a meeting in the Kremlin in August 1993 related: A news release in 2000 demonstrates that Russian suspicion and sensitivity concerning the collision possibility, and indeed their preference for such an explanation, remains active: = Explosion due to leaking missile hatch = On 3 October 1986 the Soviet ballistic missile submarine , while on combat patrol in the Atlantic, suffered the explosion of a liquid-fuelled SS-N-6 missile in one of its 16 missile tubes. The cause of the explosion was a leaking missile tube hatch seal. The leak allowed sea water to come into contact with residue of the missile's propellants, which caused a spontaneous fire resulting in an explosion first of the missile booster, then a subsequent explosion of the warhead detonator charge. In the case of the Yankee-class ballistic missile submarine, the missiles were located within the pressure hull and the explosion did not cause damage sufficient to immediately sink the boat. It did, however, cause extensive radioactive contamination throughout, requiring the submarine to surface and the evacuation of the crew to the weather deck, and later to a rescue vessel which had responded to the emergency. Subsequently, K-219 sank into the Hatteras Abyss with the loss of four crewmen and rests at a depth of about . The Soviet Navy later claimed that the leak was caused by a collision with . There are indicators suggesting K-129 suffered a similar explosion in 1968. First, the radioactive contamination of the recovered bow section and the six crewmen of K-129 by weapons grade plutonium indicates the explosion of the warhead detonator charge of one of the missiles, before the ship reached its crush depth. The report that the forward section was crushed and that charring in the bow section indicated dieseling from an implosion (or alternatively from a fire), would indicate that the explosion occurred while K-129 was submerged and at depth. The report found in Blind Man's Bluff that the wreck revealed K-129 with a hole immediately abaft the conning tower would support the theory of an explosion of one of the three missiles in the sail (possibly missile #3). Since K-129s missiles were housed in the sail, much less structural mass (compared to the Yankee-class) was available to contain such an explosion, and loss of depth control of the submarine would be instantaneous. =Patrol deviation= According to Dr. John P. Craven, K-129 crossed the International Date Line at latitude 40 north, which was much further south of her expected patrol station: > When K-129 passed longitude 180, it should have been farther north, at a > latitude of 45 degrees, or more than three hundred miles away. If that was a > navigational mistake it would be an error of historic proportions. Thus if > the sub were not somewhere in the vicinity of where the Soviets supposed it > to be, there would be a high probability, if not a certainty, that the > submarine was a rogue, off on its own, in grave disobedience of its orders. Craven does not explain why he eliminated the possibilities that K-129 was proceeding to a newly assigned and officially approved patrol area, or using a new track to an established patrol area, nor why he concluded that K-129 was acting in an abnormal or criminal manner for a Soviet strategic missile submarine. Craven also noted: Anatoliy Shtyrov (–ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏–π –®—Ç—ã—Ä–æ–≤), a former Deputy Chief of the Soviet Pacific Fleet intelligence, has said that K-129 would normally patrol an area off the west coast of the United States but it was sent on an unscheduled combat patrol in the eastern Pacific only 1¬Ω months after returning from its regular scheduled patrol. Vladimir Evdasin (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ï–≤–¥–∞—Å–∏–Ω), who from June 1960 to March 1961 served aboard K-129, states that K-129 was sent on a secret mission in response to the massive U.S. naval force build-up off the Korean coast after the Pueblo incident. K-129s mission was in support of North Korea, which was an ally of the Soviet Union, and directed against U.S. naval operations, Pacific bases and U.S. maritime support lines to South-east Asia. Conspiracy theories Red Star Rogue by Kenneth Sewell makes the claim that Project Azorian recovered virtually all of K-129 from the ocean floor, and in fact \\"Despite an elaborate cover-up and the eventual claim the project had been a failure, most of K-129 and the remains of the crew were, in fact, raised from the bottom of the Pacific and brought into the Glomar Explorer\\". In August 1993, Ambassador Malcolm Toon presented to a Russian delegation K-129s ship's bell. According to Red Star Rogue, this bell had been permanently attached to the middle of the conning tower of K-129, thus indicating that in addition to the bow of the submarine, the critical and valuable midsection of the submarine was at least partially recovered by Project Azorian. Additionally, Ambassador Toon is quoted from the 6th Plenum of the U.S.‚ÄìRussia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs as stating, \\"Our director of naval intelligence has concluded that no U.S. sub was within 300 nautical miles of your sub when it sank\\". Red Star Rogue places K-129 at 24 degrees north latitude by 163 west longitude, less than 350 miles from Honolulu. This site is consistent with the discovery of radioactive oil reported to the Hawaii Institute of Geophysical Research at the time. The premise of Red Star Rogue is that a fail-safe device designed to be activated in the event of an unauthorised fire command of its nuclear missiles caused two catastrophic explosions (monitored by U.S. technology at the time) resulting in sinking the submarine. The 11 extra crewmen have never been satisfactorily identified, and K-129's crew manifest was listed as missing by Russian authorities. An ID photograph of a sailor found in the wreck has never been identified. Red Star Rogue claims the changing relations with China and Russia in the early 1970s, forged by Nixon and Kissinger, were enabled by the K-129 incident. Craven suggests that Project Azorian's real goal was not the nuclear weapons or the coding systems at all; rather, the project sought to determine exactly what K-129 was doing at 40N/180W \\"where she did not belong\\". Such information could be (and supposedly was) utilized within Henry Kissinger's foreign policy of \\"Deterrence Through Uncertainty\\", in order to \\"raise an unanswerable question in Leonid Brezhnev's mind about his command and control of his armed forces\\". A retired United States Navy Captain Peter Huchthausen, and former naval attach√© in Moscow, said he had a brief conversation in 1987 with Admiral Peter Navojtsev, who told him, \\"Captain, you are very young and inexperienced, but you will learn that there were some matters that both nations have agreed to not discuss, and one of these is the reasons we lost K-129.\\" In 1995, when Huchthausen began work on a book about the Soviet underwater fleet, he interviewed a Russian Navy Admiral Victor Dygalo, who stated that the true history of K-129 has not been revealed because of the informal agreement between the two countries' senior naval commands. The purpose of that secrecy, he alleged, is to stop any further research into the losses of USS Scorpion and K-129. Huchthausen states that Dygalo told him to \\"overlook this matter, and hope that the time will come when the truth will be told to the families of the victims.\\" Legacy CIA short film showing the burials of the Soviet sailors with military honors being buried at sea. In October 1992, Robert Gates, as the Director of Central Intelligence, visited Moscow to meet with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. He said: Gates's decision to bring the videotape of the funeral held for the men on the Golf was ultimately motivated by the fact that the United States wanted to inspire Russia to offer up information on missing American servicemen in Vietnam. Before that, \\"We had never confirmed anything to the Russians except in various vague senses,\\" he said in an interview. A subsequent FOIA search to find if any POWs were released as a result of this visit produced only negative results. According to Peter Huchthausen: Around the same time, Russian President Boris Yeltsin posthumously awarded the Medal \\"For Courage\\" to 98 sailors who died on K-129. However, as the complement of a diesel-electric Golf-class Russian submarine was about 83, his award acknowledges there were 15 extra personnel aboard the boat at the time of its sinking. An increase in the sub's total complement would put a strain on the logistical capabilities of a patrol because it reduces its duration. No explanation for the K-129's extra submariners has ever been provided by the Russian Navy. See also * Phantom (2013 movie), loosely based on the story of K-129.

In 1974, the ship recovered a portion of K-129, but as the section was being lifted to the surface, a mechanical failure in the grapple caused two-thirds of the recovered section to break off.Sontag et al. 1998, p. 196. This lost section is said to have held many of the most-sought items, including the code book and nuclear missiles. The recovered section held two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners, who were given a formal, filmed burial at sea.Sontag et al. 1998, p. 277.

While the ship had an enormous lifting capacity, there was little interest in operating the vessel because of her great cost. From March to June 1976, the General Services Administration (GSA) published advertisements inviting businesses to submit proposals for leasing the ship.\\"Notice of Availability for Donation of the Test Craft Ex-Sea Shadow (IX-529) and Hughes Mining Barge (HMB-1).\\" Federal Register, Volume 71, Number 178, 14 September 2006, p. 54276. By the end of four months, GSA had received a total of seven bids, including a US$2 offer submitted by a Lincoln, Nebraska college student, and a US$1.98 million offer ($ million in ) from a man who said he planned to seek a government contract to salvage the nuclear reactors of two United States submarines. The Lockheed Missile and Space Company submitted a US$3 million ($ million in ), two-year lease proposal contingent upon the company's ability to secure financing. GSA had already extended the bid deadline twice to allow Lockheed to find financial backers for its project without success and the agency concluded there was no reason to believe this would change during the near future. Although the scientific community rallied to the defense of Hughes Glomar Explorer, urging the president to maintain the ship as a national asset, no agency or department of the government wanted to assume the maintenance and operating cost.Toppan, Andrew. \\"The Hughes Glomar Explorer's Mission.\\" the- kgb.com.

Subsequently, during September 1976, the GSA transferred Hughes Glomar Explorer to the Navy for storage, and during January 1977, after it was prepared for dry docking at a cost of more than two million dollars, the ship became part of the Navy's Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet.Pike, John. \\"Project Jennifer: Hughes Glomar Explorer.\\" Intelligence Resource Program via fas.org, 16 February 2010.

Development  The P-18 early warning radar is a development of the earlier P-12 radar, the P-18 radar being accepted into service in 1970 following the successful completion of the program. The P-18 was developed by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V. I. Lenin who developed the previous P-12, the predecessor of the current Nizhny Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT). In 1979 a new secondary IFF radar the 1L22 \\"Parol\\" entered into service to complement the P-18, unlike the previous secondary radar NRS-12 (NATO \\"Score Board\\") the new interrogator was carried on a separate truck. The P-18 is still in service today and was widely exported, many companies offer upgrade options to improve the performance and reliability of the radar and to replace out-dated components. NNIIRT offers an upgrade package for the P-18 which includes the installation of a solid state transmitter and receiver, automatic jammer suppression equipment as well as PC based signal processing, test and interface equipment. These upgraded variants of the P-18 can be referred to as the P-18M, P-18-1 or P-18-2 depending on the manufacturer, modification and radar nationality. The P-18 was superseded by the 1L13 \\"Nebo\\" VHF surveillance radar in 1984. Currently, the Russian-Belarusian company Defense Systems provides upgrades for P-18 radars. Also Retia, a Czech civil and military electronics company, developed its own, fundamental modernisation of the P-18 under the name ReVEAL. It is now solid state, digitized and fitted with upgraded IFF system, while allowing to utilise also the legacy IFF. The whole equipment is repackaged into a standard container and already sold in several dozen units.  Description  P-18 receiver with digital MTI (top left) The P-18 shares many similarities with the earlier P-12NA and like the P-12 it is mounted on two Ural-4320 truck chassis. The P-18 features many improvements over the P-12 including increased performance, precision and reliability. The radar was developed to work independently or as part of a C3 system directing SAM and aircraft to hostile targets, the truck mounted design provided the radar with high mobility. The P-18 uses a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception. The antenna is composed of sixteen Yagi antennas mounted in sets of eight with one set above the other. The radar antenna is mounted on the truck used to transport it improving mobility and the radar also features a mechanism which allows the antenna height and elevation to be altered during operation. Azimuth is scanned mechanically by the antenna with a rotation of 10 r.p.m, the original P-18 used three indicators, including two plan position indicators in addition to a back-up A-scope. Like the P-12 the radar features automatic frequency control with four pre-set operating frequencies, moving target indicator to eliminate passive clutter and active jamming, the radar could also display tracks from another radar it was paired with. The original P-18 used a coaxial cavity resonator transmitter, vacuum tube receiver with transistor based preamplifier and a vacuum tube/pin diode based duplexer. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-18, either the NRS-12 or the later 1L22 \\"Parol\\". Variants There is few modification and variants of P-18 radar that allow him to be still in use and most of them substantially extend original capabilities. =Lithuania= P-18MLP-18ML on LiTak-Tak site ‚Äì ground-based long-range VHF surveillance radar P-18ML is offered as the modernized follow-on to its prototype, the analogue P-18.

Design (The following description is primarily related to the Class 628.4, and is largely valid for the other variants as well) Each coach rests on two twin-axle bogies. Only the bogie at the close-coupled end of the coach is driven. Power transmission from the motor is achieved using a Voith hydrodynamic transmission system with a converter (Wandler) and a T 311r coupling. Up to Class 628, a T 320 double- converter transmission was used. Motor and transmission are suspended elastically under the lightweight coach body. The operating brake is an automatic compressed air KE disc brake with automatic load braking and electronic anti-skid protection. In addition, for rapid braking, electromagnetic rail brakes are used; these can also be activated separately if required. Coupled running enables up to four coupled pairs of coaches to be driven from one driver's cab. The control panel resembles that of the DB's standard driving consoles. Safety equipment includes the dead man's switch system, Sifa, which is mandatory in Germany, as well as PZB 90 based on the I60R (Class 628.4) or I60 with ER24 recording device (Class 628.2) and train radio. Class 628 units have proved to be reliable and economical in practice. Now that newer vehicles have appeared, though, passengers on the 628s will miss a number of refinements, especially air-conditioning, but also modern passenger information systems and easier, more accessible, disabled-friendly doors, because immediately behind the doors (one double or single door in the center and one single door next to each driver's position) there are two steps in order to reach low platforms. On some 628s, new passenger information systems with automatic announcements and displays for the next stop have been installed and in many regions ticket machines have also been fitted, as had been planned in the design. Over the years the vehicles have not been completely free of technical problems, but the list of deficiencies is very short. For example, the coolant has a tendency to overheat on hot days if the radiators are not thoroughly cleaned. When traction conditions are poor, the 628 may not reach the speeds required by the timetable due to its low adhesive weight. Because the vehicles by today's standards are quite underpowered, its use on hilly routes results in long journey times. On newer vehicles, such as the Desiro (642), the Talent (643 and 644) or the LINT (648), which have partly replaced the 628s, two power cars have been used and the higher resultant costs accepted. Single-unit class 650 (Regio-Shuttle) has received two engines, so all axles are powered. HistoryClass 628.0= 628.0 on the Ausserfernbahn line near Sch√∂nbichl (A) The development of the Class 628 began as far back as the early 1970s, when the Class 795 and 798 railbuses were reaching the end of their estimated useful life. The Bundesbahn's central office (Bundesbahn-Zentralamt) in Munich, in cooperation with the Waggonfabrik Uerdingen, began with the concept of a Class 628 local, passenger, multiple- unit, that were to replace the railbuses, the accumulator railcars of Class 515. The new vehicles were also to be capable of being used on main lines, which required an increase in their top speed, stronger brake systems and greater comfort compared with the railbuses, but which were not to be more expensive to run than a railbus. In 1974, only 2 years later, Waggonfabrik Uerdingen and MaK demonstrated the prototypes of the two-unit Class 628.0 and also a single-coach variant, the Class 627, for use on routes with lower numbers of passengers. The vehicles were tested and proved themselves exceptionally well, even though the lack of the power from the engines was already apparent on occasions. Initially it did not go into production, because for political reasons local passenger rail services were just being reorganised and it was not yet clear, which and how many vehicles would be needed. So the Class 628 project stalled for almost four years. Design and technical data=Motor= The following diesel motors are used on the Class 628.0 diesel multiple units: MAN D 3256 BTXU *Installed in Class 628.0 (628 001/011 to 628 005/015) *Type: Four-stroke diesel engine with turbocharging and water cooling *Layout: 6-cylinder in-line motor (horizontal) *Usable power: *Rpm: 2,100 rpm *Stroke x Bore: *Total weight: KHD V 12 L 413F *Installed in Class 628.0 (628 006/016 to 628 010/020, on 628 006 to 008 other motors now fitted) *Type: diesel motor with air cooling *Layout: V 12, 90¬∞ *Usable power: *Rpm: 2,100 rpm *Stroke x Bore: *Total weight: For the Charlevoix tourist train * Daimler-Benz * Usable power: =Transmission= Voith T 320r transmission systems are installed in these railcars. Experimentally some vehicles were fitted with an H-brake. Technical data for the transmission: *Two hydraulic fluid drives *Reversing with electro- pneumatic actuation *Primary influence by primary control and lubricating pump pressure *Transferable power: Class 628.0 = at 2,100 rpm The reversing gear is combined with the fluid drive and serves to change the direction or running. Reversing can be achieved during idling and also when the motor is switched off, but only when the vehicle is static and the drive has been emptied. It is activated with compressed air. =Class 628.1/928.1= 628 103 Behind the scenes, engineers continued to develop the railcar apace. In 1981 they demonstrated the Class 628.1. The most important difference was that the second power car was dropped, because the remaining one was strong enough to move the coupled pair. The second unit could therefore be used as a driving car (designated the Class 928.1). Together with a few other changes, such as a simplified electrical system, the omission of one of the two toilets and one of the four entrances each side, and the installation of equipment to enable one-man operation, the new variant was even more economical. In addition there was a single-coach version again, the Class 627.1, of which 5 prototypes were procured. The new vehicles were tested for two years and, like their predecessors, proved to be outstanding, so that nothing stood in the way as the two-car version went into production. The single-unit variant did not, however, as it had only a few more seats than a bus and could not be deployed economically. Coach number 628 102 is unusual in being the only one of this small batch with a 1st class compartment. =Class 628.2/928.2= 628.2 in traffic red at Lorsch Before it became widespread, however, a number of short- term requirements from the future production Class 628.2 units were integrated, including a 1st class open compartment, better ventilation and a dividing wall between the driver's cab and the passenger compartment. Externally the front and back were more angled, the triple headlamp was moved down and a train destination display added in order to improve the vehicle's appearance and to keep passengers better informed. In all, 150 of these units were procured between 1986 and 1989. At the Kiel locomotive depot (Betriebswerk) several of these railcars were driven for a while at up to 140 km/h, but because this seriously increased wear and tear, these express duties were soon terminated again. The Class 628.2 with the DB's Regionalbahn in Schleswig-Holstein was given a redesign with new seats, new interior decor, wheelchair ramps etc. Several years before, a Karlsruhe 628.2 had also been given a fundamental modernisation of its interior. A few units were sold to private operators in the Czech Republic. =Class 628.4/928.4= 628.4 in peppermint green and white alongside its predecessor, the Uerdingen railbus in 1997 at Erndtebr√ºck Reupholstered interior of a 628.4 in current DB design The second series was able to benefit from the everyday experience that had been gained in using the railcars. In 1992 D√ºwag (formerly Waggonbau Uerdingen) proposed the Class 628.4 railcar, which once again had technical improvements and other refinements. The power of the diesel engine was increased by about 20% by using \\"charge cooling\\". The lower window panes on the doors were omitted as they had occasionally been broken on its predecessors, the Class 628.2, by flying stones. In order to install a double door at the close- coupled end of the two coaches in the multiple, they were both extended in length by about 50 cm each. Between November 1992 and Januar 1996 a total of 309 railcars were built, of which several were delivered to other railway companies, including those in Luxembourg (see Operations) and Romania. The first vehicles in the regions of Rhein-Ruhr and the Southwest were given a modernisation of the interior. The railcars were matched to the current DB interior design. The seats have blue cushions and arm rests made of beech wood, the walls are silvery, the luggage section completely white, the windows are equipped with emergency hammers. The colour of the entrance area is white, and in some cases larger bicycle sections were installed in the centre of the carriage. On some of the units, the doors were also fitted with sensors. =Class 628.9/629= A special variant based on Class 628.4 was procured for duties on the hilly Alzey‚ÄìMainz railway. Five multiples were bought, both coaches in each pair being motorised. These trains were designated as Class 628.9/629, but apart from having two power cars were identical with the Class 628.4. Due to their higher maintenance and operating costs there is no likelihood of the 628.9/629s being procured for use on lines which are predominantly level. The 628.9/629s do not need double the fuel of a 628, because the two power cars have shorter periods under load. A sixth set has been procured by motorising a driving coach. Another set was formed in 2004 from two 628.4 sets whose driving trailers were damaged in accidents. This set has no first class accommodation, as the internal layout has not been changed. Two more 629s appeared in 2004 based on former 628.2s, that work with another 628.2 instead of a driving car. Two sets have been stationed at Ulm Hauptbahnhof with running numbers 628/629 340 (629 340 ex 628 341) and 628/629 344 (629 344 ex 628 349). Since 8 August 2008 Regio S√ºdwest also has a set numbered 628 301/629 301 (629 301 ex 628 257), which should follow the other two. =Private railways= VT 153 of the EVB Because in the early 1990s hardly any other railcars were available, several private railways also bought railcars of this type. In 1993/94 Eisenbahnen und Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser (EVB) took delivery of five 628.4/928.4 sets, in 1994 Frankfurt-K√∂nigsteiner Eisenbahn (FKE) bought one 628.4/928.4 and, in 1995, two 628.9/629s. In 1995 Westerwaldbahn GmbH took over the Daadetalbahn line with one DB 628.4/928.4 (628 677); it added a 628.4 from FKE in 2008. OperationsClass 628.0= All the Class 628.0 prototype vehicles were finally homed at the depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) in Kempten im Allg√§u. From there they were deployed to all the lines in the Allg√§u region until the end of 2002. From 2003 they reduced their radius of action to the Ausserfernbahn, and in January 2005 the last vehicle of this class (628 008/018) was finally withdrawn. Several have already been scrapped, others sold to Poland, where they have been repainted and were placed in service again in the winter of 2005/2006 for the Koleje Mazowieckie. =Class 628.1= The three multiples of the transitional class, 628.1 (628 / 928 101, 102 and 103), were all stabled at Kempten im Allg√§u from the outset. From here they were used until 8 December 2007 in regular services on the Ausserfernbahn and on the Illertalbahn. Until the timetable change in 2006 they also ran to other destinations in the Allg√§u, e.g. on the line from Augsburg to F√ºssen. At their last general inspection in 2001/2002 the vehicles underwent a number of modifications in order to standardise them with the sub- class 628.2. In early 2008 all 628.1s were withdrawn and, in that year, they were transferred to Hamm. In 2012 two units - 628 102 and 103 - were sold to the Sodema Inc. Soci√©t√© de gestion des √©quipements publics de CharlevoixSODRMA INC. in Canada where they operate in the Charlevoix region as the Charlevoix tourist train.Histoires de trainR√©seau CharlevoixVideo of 628 103 at CharlevoixEisenbahn-magazin 2/2011, p. 18 =Class 628.2/.4= Driver's cab on a Class 628.4 Multiple units of sub-classes 628.2 and .4 are used across virtually the whole of Germany, on main lines as well as branch lines. Currently multiples comprising two, coupled, Class 628 power cars work the Worms‚ÄìBingen Stadt railway as well as lines in the area around Ulm and which are thus different from the 628.9/629 compositions on the Alzey‚ÄìMainz railway. In particular they can be told by the lack of a 1st class compartment and the two toilets in the centre of the train. There are also no folding seats as found in the driving cars or in the 629. The Luxembourg State Railways, CFL, owns two 628.4/928.4, which are numbered as per the DB system (628 505-0/928 505-7 und 628 506-8/928 506-5). These are identical with their counterparts in the DB apart from the company logo at the front: initially painted in peppermint green and white, but since 2001 in red livery. They ply between Trier and Luxembourg (as do German 628s; on this route mostly in double traction together) as well as providing passenger services within Luxembourg itself.

He spent most of his career at Oxford University as a fellow of Nuffield College and finished his career as Foundation Professor of Economics at the University of Lancaster. He made his name with his detailed case study investigations of business behaviour and analysis of manufacturing firms, which he characterized as intensely competitive and oligopolistic.Earl, Peter (1987), The New Pagrave Dictionary of Economics, Palgrave Andrews advocated for the use of empirical business case studies to advance industrial economics. From 1944 until his death in 1971 he worked and published with Elizabeth Brunner.  Economics  Andrews has been summarized as follows. He rejected the concept of individual firm equilibrium in favour of what he describes as the 'steady state' in the industry. That at the heart of Andrew's story is his argument that manufacturing industry tend to be both oligopolistic and rather competitive in the long run. Also that actual or potential entry sets a limit to the price in each industry. Price is arrived at by adding a 'costing margin' to estimated average direct cost with this margin being calculated on the basis of estimates of 'normal' output and the profit-that can be obtained without long run loss of custom due to competition. If there is an 'equilibrium', about which doubts are raised, it is the equilibrium price in the industry price rather than an equilibrium for an individual firm's output at a level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The share of the market share of each firm will depend on dynamic factors that determine the amount that the firm is able to sell at the going industry price. Thus, although large firms are thought likely in fact to be multiproduct each industry is analysable independently of the number of other industries in which a firm is active.Devine, P. J.; Jones, R. M.; Lee, N.; Tyson, W. J (1974) An Introduction to Industrial Economics, Unwin  Interpretations  Rather than viewing Andrews as having denied profit maximisation Devine suggests that one should view his work as having raised 'the possibility that our existing method of theorizing may give wrong clues as to how profits maybe maximised.' For Devine the main thrust Andrew's argument is directed against 'the influence of atomistic methodology, which it is easy to argue from but difficult to argue to'. This is the methodology that, from Andrews's point of view, misleadingly focuses attention upon the equilibrium position of the firm. In the long run, Andrews argued, it is 'possible to question the analytical independence of cost and demand functions, which marginal equilibrium theorists take for granted and which, indeed, is essential for the formal validity of their work'. Post-Keynesian economists draw on his work.

It first flew on 8 August 1961, and was deployed as an operational ICBM between 1961 and 1966. Following retirement as an ICBM, the Atlas-F, along with the Atlas-E, was refurbished for orbital launches as the Atlas E/F.Encyclopedia Astronautica - Atlas The Atlas E and F also differed in their launch facilities; Atlas E utilized the same coffin silos as Atlas D missiles, with the missile stored horizontally and raised upright for launch. Atlas F for comparison used a vertical silo with an elevator similar to the Titan I. The Atlas F was originally conceived when the Air Force decided that the coffin silos used for the Atlas D and E were too exposed and vulnerable to enemy attack. Atlas E and F used the MA-3 propulsion system which had a separate gas generator for all three engines, unlike the Atlas D where one gas generator drove both booster turbopumps. In addition, they used pyrotechnic cartridges for rapid starting and the gas generators and pumps were mounted on each booster engine instead of being placed in the central thrust section. This setup was designed for ease of service and engine swapping in the field, while the Atlas D's simpler configuration was considered preferable for space launches. Total thrust of the MA-3 was 375,000 pounds. Atlas E/F used the ARMA inertial guidance system rather than Atlas D's radio ground guidance; some IOC (Initial Operational Capability) Atlas D flights tested the ARMA system instead of the standard GE Mod II radio guidance. Aside from minor differences in the ARMA on the Atlas E and F, the major difference between the two consisted of differently-placed quick fill lines for the two silo systems used. Most refurbished Atlas F space launches used solid-fueled upper stages, a notable exception being Missile 23F which launched Seasat, a NASA oceanography satellite, on June 27, 1978, the very last Atlas-Agena vehicle flown. The final Atlas F launch took place on June 23, 1981 when Missile 87F successfully placed a NOAA weather satellite into orbit. Atlas E/F space launchers were given an extensive tear-down and rebuild by Convair and the ARMA system replaced with the GE Mod II guidance system. 1961-62 The first two Atlas F flights were Missile 2F on August 8, 1961 and Missile 4F on November 22, both from LC-11 at CCAS. Both tests were entirely successful, and on December 12, Missile 5F launched from LC-11. This test was a partial failure; an electrical short in the guidance system caused an early SECO command to be sent and the missile fell short of its planned range. On the 21st, Atlas 6F lifted off of LC-11 carrying a rhesus monkey named Scatback. This was the third launch of a primate on an Atlas in the past month - the first was Mercury-Atlas 5 which successfully lofted a chimpanzee on a two- orbit mission while the second, an Atlas E test, malfunctioned shortly after liftoff and had to be destroyed, claiming the life of the squirrel monkey it was carrying. Atlas 6F performed acceptably until after booster jettison when a hydraulic failure caused loss of sustainer thrust. The capsule separated and splashed down near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, however the tracking beacon failed to operate and recovery crews could not locate it. They gave up the search and Scatback was officially lost at sea. The failure was traced to combustion of spent propellant following booster jettison which was damaging valves and/or ducting; it was solved by the installation of cutoff valves in the booster section.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 6F Convair January 4, 1962\\" So far, the Atlas F test program had gone well and nobody was prepared for the upcoming disaster on April 9, 1962 when Missile 11F exploded only one second after liftoff from LC-11. Examination of recovered missile parts found that some sort of explosion or detonation in the sustainer turbopump had occurred. The sustainer engine had shut down almost immediately at liftoff followed by loss of its telemetered engine parameter data. The booster engines operated satisfactorily until missile destruction at T+3 seconds.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 11F Convair April 23, 1962\\" On May 13, Missile 1F erupted in flames and exploded on the test stand at Sycamore Canyon at the start of a planned 40 second test run. Investigation found that the sustainer LOX turbopump had experienced a detonation much like that of 11F. The LOX feed system was ruptured, leading to an intense LOX-fed fire. An automatic shutdown command was sent to the propulsion system, but damage to wiring resulted in no B-2 shutdown and that engine ran at 100% thrust until the final explosion. The investigation team concluded that a slight delay opening the HS valve in the sustainer engine had occurred; the turbopump was spinning at its maximum speed of 10,000 RPM which resulted in excessive stress on it. The pump shaft vibrated and caused the blades to rub against the casing, causing a friction spark and explosion. The eventual solution to this problem involved adding a plastic liner to the inside of the turbopump. Testing now began at Vandenberg and Missile 15F flew successfully from 576-E on August 1. Nine days later, Missile 57F launched from OSTF-1 and failed to perform its roll maneuver. The pitch sequence was executed properly, but the lack of the roll program prevented the missile from attaining the correct trajectory and it was blown up by Range Safety 67 seconds into the launch. An open circuit in the programmer was found to be the cause, although the specific failure point was not determined. The roll signal had been extremely weak and barely enough to have any effect, as a consequence the missile's flight path was about 53¬∞ to the right of the planned trajectory.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 57F Convair August 24, 1962\\" The next test launch took place from the now-repaired LC-11 at the Cape two days later and all subsequent R&D; flights went without a hitch except for 13F on November 14 which experienced a thrust section fire at liftoff that led to sustainer shutdown. The booster engines retained attitude control until BECO, at which point the absence of sustainer thrust resulted in immediate missile tumbling and loss of the mission. The cause of the thrust section fire was unknown, however a fuel leak was suspected. The next launch, Missile 21F, successfully concluded the R&D; phase of the Atlas F program. 1963-64 Atlas F tests achieved a high degree of success during 1963, and eight flights took place through the year. Missile 52F (March 24) exploded 91 seconds after launch, however the reason for the failure was not determined because the vehicle was intended to demonstrate flying an Atlas ICBM to the maximum possible range and thus it did not carry a telemetry system. On October 4, Missile 45F suffered a stuck engine valve during an operational test from VABF's 576-G, preventing B-2 engine start. The missile tipped over and exploded on impact with the ground. An ABRES test from LC-11 at Cape Canaveral on October 28 using Missile 136F failed when the sustainer engine lost hydraulic pressure at staging and tumbled. The last F-series flight of the year was on December 18 when 576-G hosted the successful flight of 109F, the last Atlas R&D; launch. Five Atlas Fs were flown in 1964. Missile 137F flew from LC-11 at the Cape on April 1 and performed a successful flight. Two days later, Missile 3F flew from 576-G at VAFB and repeated the same failure as 45F. The B-1 engine experienced a stuck main fuel valve and did not start, once again the missile fell over and exploded on impact with the ground. Damage to the silo facility was more extensive than had been the case with 45F, and 576-G was not used again for six months. Investigation of the two failures found that hardened hypergol residue had been responsible for the stuck valves on both Atlas vehicles, which had accumulated from repeated test firings, and that on 3F, the fuel valve did eventually open, but too late for engine start to be possible. GD/A issued a service bulletin to all Atlas silo crews to make sure missiles were properly checked and free of hypergol residue. Three more Atlas tests during the year were all successful. 1965- On January 8, 1965, the final Atlas ICBM test, Missile 106F, successfully launched from 576-G. That year, the Atlas was retired from service as an ICBM and remaining missiles used for suborbital and orbital launches over the next few decades. This included tests of ABRES, RMP, and BMRS reentry vehicles at Vandenberg. The OSTF silos were converted into dedicated launch pads for these and Nike/Zeus target missile testing (the latter were never launched with Atlas Fs). Sixty-five such tests took place between 1965 and 1974, roughly half of which used Atlas Fs. Some had a Trident solid upper stage and there were several failures, the most notable being a 1967 test where the Atlas's RSO charges were ignited by static electricity at RV separation, after which cork insulation was added to the RV to prevent a recurrence of this failure mode. There were two major failures during the 20 years as a satellite launcher. One was an attempted launch of an unknown military test payload in April 1975 on Atlas 71F. A glob of LOX/kerosene gel fell into the flame pit at ignition, exploded, and damaged the Atlas's sustainer engine. The launch vehicle continued to operate for over two minutes, but the sustainer and verniers eventually shut down and the range safety destruct command was issued at T+303 seconds. Since the LOX gel explosion also damaged wiring in the base of the booster, the telemetry system lost power and no data was returned during launch, making it difficult to determine the exact cause of the engine failure. It was believed that damage to a piece of plumbing was the most likely explanation. The other was a launch of a NOAA weather satellite on May 29, 1980 using Atlas 19F. Performance appeared normal until booster jettison when the trajectory was discovered to be off-course. The sustainer engine kept burning 50 seconds past its normal cutoff time. When the satellite finally separated, it was inserted into a useless elliptical orbit. The failure was caused by a seal jostled loose by the rapid-fire pyrotechnic cartridge ignition system used in the Atlas E/F missiles, flooding the B-1 turbopump with fuel and slowing down its rotation speed, cutting thrust levels in the engine to 80% and considerably reducing booster velocity and fuel consumption. The Atlas's onboard computer tried to compensate first by extending the booster engine burn time, but eventually a backup command forced booster shutdown and jettison. After BECO, the computer still tried to compensate by extending sustainer burn time until it went nearly a minute past what would have been normal cutoff. Following SECO, the booster also had to execute vernier solo mode for another 11 seconds. However, for simplicity reasons, the NOAA satellite had no electrical interface with the Atlas which caused it to fire is posigrade rockets at a preset time. Since it was still attached to the Atlas, it was impossible for the small thrusters to align the spacecraft correctly and thanks to the extended burn time, SECO would now take place at T+377 seconds, but at T+370 seconds, the timer on the NOAA automatically activated the solid fueled kick motor with the Atlas's sustainer engine still operating. The LOX tank dome was then blown off the Atlas, which registered on telemetry readouts as an instant loss of tank pressure. The NOAA separated, but ended up in a useless orbit and had to be abandoned. Atlas F launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11 and 13, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at OSTF-2, LC-576 and SLC-3. A total of 55 Atlas F missile tests were conducted between 1961 and 1974, the post-1965 launches all being tests of reentry vehicles as Atlas had been retired from ICBM service, along with 39 space launches during 1967 to 1981. There were 16 failures.

At his prime, Su√°rez made $400 million annually, was one of the major suppliers of the Medell√≠n Cartel as well as the leader of the largest Bolivian drug empire, and was considered to be the biggest cocaine producer in the world. Born to a prominent family, Su√°rez entered the drug trade and made millions from cocaine in the 1970s and 1980s. He is known for financing the 1980 coup d'√©tat, known as the \\"Cocaine Coup\\", and was a major supplier of cocaine for various criminal organizations. Su√°rez was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was released after serving half his sentence. He died in July 20, 2000, from a heart attack. Early life Su√°rez was born on January 8, 1932 to a wealthy cattle-ranching family in the tropical Beni Department of Bolivia. His parents were Nicomedes \\"Cattle King\\" Su√°rez Franco and Blanca G√≥mez Roca. Su√°rez was the descendant of the Su√°rez brothers \\"rubber barons\\", famous for expanding the rubber trade worldwide, expanding westernization in the Bolivian northern Amazon, and for singlehandedly financing the Columna Porvenir, during the Acre war with Brazil. He was also the great-grandson of Nicol√°s Su√°rez Calla√∫. Criminal career In the 1970s, Su√°rez first entered into the cocaine trade, conducting business with the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Later he recruited Bolivian coca producers into his company \\"La Corporaci√≥n\\" (the Corporation). Su√°rez had a fleet of aircraft, primarily the Cessna 206 and the Douglas DC-3, which flew cocaine shipments from the Bolivian Amazon to Colombia, selling the cocaine at $9,000 per kilogram. Su√°rez's wife Ayda Levy recounted in detail that Fidel Castro and Raul Castro contacted Su√°rez and Escobar in January 1983 and invited them to Cuba. Upon visiting the island nation, Castro had planned to use drugs as a weapon against \\"Yankee imperialism\\". Fidel and Raul charged millions of dollars per day in exchange for giving coverage to cocaine trafficking and the use of airports for refueling airplanes. In self-defense against the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Su√°rez established his own private air force, as well as a private army of 1,500 soldiers and Libyan-trained bodyguards.Naylor, R.T., p. 170 With aid from the Argentine military dictatorship, Su√°rez financed the military coup and bankrupted the government, which collapsed. The coup installed a dictatorship in 1980, in which Luis Garc√≠a Meza would be President and Su√°rez's cousin Luis Arce G√≥mez was Minister of the Interior, and so he received political protection for his enterprise Arce G√≥mez ordered the killings of many Bolivians, including union leaders and intellectuals such as Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz. During the 1980s, Su√°rez' relationship with Escobar slowly deteriorated because of Escobar's murderous activities, which contrasted with Su√°rez's use of violence only as a last resort. In 1981, Su√°rez's favored son Roberto \\"Robby\\" Levy was arrested in Switzerland and was extradited to the United States. In a letter to Ronald Reagan in 1983, Su√°rez offered to pay Bolivia's foreign debt of more than $3 billion if he and his son received amnesty. Arrest and release On July 20, 1988, Su√°rez was arrested by the Bolivian National Police and his hacienda was raided; more than one and a half tons of cocaine was found. He was sentenced to 15 years in the San Pedro prison for drug trafficking but served only 7 years. He was released in 1996 due to accounts of good behavior and declining health, having suffered two heart attacks in prison. His nephew and successor, Jorge Roca Suarez (known as \\"Techo de Paja\\"), was also serving a 30-year sentence in the United States for drug trafficking. During his time in prison, Su√°rez was said to have shown regret for his crimes, had found religious faith in jail and preferred to be photographed next to images of Jesus Christ. Su√°rez had lost most of his fortune, spent on the construction of buildings and other philanthropic activities.http://www.clarin.com/mundo/Rey-Cocaina-fundo-primer- narcoestado_0_817118384.html He spent the remaining years of his life managing his hacienda. Personal life Su√°rez owned various lavish homes in Bolivia, including a hacienda known as \\"El Mosquito\\" (\\"The Mosquito\\"), in northern Bolivia and an armored palace in Santa Ana del Yacuma.Streisland, Dominic, p. 249 His family owned more than 16 million acres of farmland, which he used for cattle ranching, farming and sometimes airstrips. He gained popularity by building churches, hospitals, streets in rural villages and soccer fields. In his hometown province of Beni, Su√°rez was most popular around the locals and often called \\"Robin Hood\\". His Robin Hood image gained popularity and protection from the Bolivian government and the Roman Catholic Church. Su√°rez married Ayda Levy Mart√≠nez in 1958 and had four children; Roberto, Gary, Heidy and Harold Su√°rez Levy. The couple split after Levy discovered his involvement in the drug trade but remained on good terms. Su√°rez was heavily involved in politics. Su√°rez's son, Roberto \\"Robby\\" Levy, was killed by Bolivian police and DEA agents on March 22, 1990, in Santa Cruz. Death and legacy On Thursday evening, July 20, 2000, Su√°rez died from a heart attack in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Weeks before his death, in a TV interview, Su√°rez expressed remorse for his crimes and stated \\"The worst mistake I ever made in my life was to have gotten involved in cocaine trafficking\\". Su√°rez was buried in a small niche in Cochabamba. The character Alejandro Sosa in the 1983 American crime film Scarface and the 2006 video game Scarface: The World Is Yours was inspired by Su√°rez. On November 21, 2012, Su√°rez's ex-wife Ayda Levy published an account of his life, entitled \\"The King of Cocaine: My Life With Roberto Su√°rez And The Birth Of The First Narco-State\\".

Born in North Melbourne, Whitfield was recruited by South Melbourne from Victorian Football Association (VFA) side Coburg Football Club and made his VFL debut in Round 12, 1939 against Carlton at Lake Oval, South Melbourne's home ground. A wingman, Whitfield was considered a live wire, both on the ground and off, who appeared \\"to march to a different drum.\\" Part of his match preparation was to drink six beers every Saturday morning before a game, followed by another at half-time, a habit he had been following since he was sixteen and as it had served him well thus far, Whitfield was in no mood to change it.Shaw, p. 133 Whitfield was also in the habit of wearing his football gear under his street clothes to the ground to save time getting changed before the game, although one time when he was particularly late he explained to the coach he had been entertaining a lady friend and had let time slip away. He was forced to change in the back of a taxi on the way to the ground but claimed that the lady friend was able to greatly assist him as she had plenty of experience removing his clothes in the back seat of a car. Whitfield enlisted in the Australian Army on 28 August 1941, gaining the rank of Gunner and serving with 115 Australian General Hospital until his discharge from the services on 19 June 1942.WWII Nominal Roll Whitfield, Edward Carlyle Accessed 27 December 2008 (dead link) This led to his absence from VFL football for the best part of three seasons, until his return to South Melbourne in 1944. Never one to shy away from a fight, Whitfield was reported a number of times throughout his career, including in three separate matches in 1945. However, Whitfield was one of South Melbourne's leading players in 1945 and was a key reason for South Melbourne's dominance of the competition throughout the season. In the 1945 VFL Grand Final, a spiteful match known as The Bloodbath, Whitfield was reported for attempting to strike field umpire Frank Spokes, using abusive language and for kicking the ball away after a free kick was given against him.Shaw, p. 211 When the umpire attempted to report Whitfield, he pulled his jumper over his head and ran down the other end of the field to stop the umpire taking his number, later claiming he thought he had heard the final siren and was running off to swap guernseys with his opponent.Shaw, p. 169 Whitfield, who declined to attend the tribunal hearing because he had already bought a ticket to a Cabaret Ball held the same night, was suspended for twelve months plus two games and then informed by South Melbourne that not only was he no longer required as a player, but he was barred from the Lake Oval as a spectator; Whitfield was eventually welcomed back to South Melbourne, becoming a member of the Past Players' Association in the 1960s.

History  Man Must Die was formed in May 2002, with John Lee, Alan McFarland, Danny McNab and Joe McGlynn. The band members were known throughout the Scottish metal scene through other bands such as Regorge, Confusion Corporation, Co-Exist and Godplayer. They released a four-track demo, The Season Of Evil, in 2003 which attracted label Retribute Records who released their debut album ...Start Killing, in 2004. They released their second studio album through Relapse Records, titled The Human Condition. In 2007, Man Must Die parted ways with John Lee who was replaced by Matt Holland, the former drummer of Inversus, Zillah, Sons Of Slaughter and Madman Is Absolute. And in 2012, Matt Holland was replaced by Australian drummer Todd Hansen, of Canadian band Amplitusion, Australian bands Headkase, Rome, F.U.C., and formerly of The Berzerker. In 2009 Man Must Die released their third studio album, entitled No Tolerance For Imperfection through Relapse Records.

This will include 2 covers and the \\"Slave to the Animal\\" single and will be released in 2019.  Musical style  Man Must Die are known and praised for their highly energetic music style, with early releases containing elements of technical death metal, melodic death metal and even influences from old-school hardcore punk. Later releases show much more melodic elements coupled with a deathgrind-based sound. Vocalist Joe McGlynn deploys a vast variety of techniques. Ranging from harsh death growls to a high-pitched shriek and even the occasional spoken word more akin to the aforementioned hardcore genre. The lyrics deal with religion, murder, death, hate and warfare, usually written in a very aggressive fashion.

Exceptions include some streetcar, subway and rapid transit systems, mining and tunneling operations, and some narrow-gauge lines particularly in the west, e.g. the isolated White Pass and Yukon Route system, and the former Newfoundland Railway. As well as the usual reasons for having one gauge i.e. being able to operate through trains without transfer arrangements, the North American continent-wide system of freight car interchange with rolling stock having the same standard gauge, couplings, and air brakes meant that individual companies could minimise their rolling stock requirements by borrowing from other companies. Peak demand periods varied over the continent, with seasonal requirements e.g. for grain shipments occurring at different times in different areas so that freight cars could be redistributed to cover peaks as required.  Barbados  The Barbados Railway, the only railroad operated on Barbados, was regauged once in its working life from to in 1898.  Bermuda  The Bermuda Railway was standard gauge common carrier that operated from 1931 to 1948.  Canada  The first railroads in Canada in the 1830s were built to and in 1847 the first gauge line was built. After a Royal Commission, in 1851 the broad gauge, called the Provincial gauge, was adopted by the Province of Canada government as the standard gauge. However, in the 1870s, most Canadian railroads (apart from some narrow-gauge lines, e.g. on the island of Newfoundland) were changed to standard gauge to facilitate interchange with U.S. railroads. The last broad-gauge line closed in 1911. The Toronto subway and streetcar system use a broad-gauge of .

Nowadays only the ship handling trains along the Panama Canal, called mules, still have the 150 cm / 5 ft track. United States In 1886, the southern railroads agreed to coordinate changing gauge on all their tracks. After considerable debate and planning, most of the southern rail network was converted from gauge to gauge, then the standard of the Pennsylvania Railroad, over two days beginning on May 31, 1886. Over a period of 36 hours, tens of thousands of workers pulled the spikes from the west rail of all the broad-gauge lines in the South, moved them east and spiked them back in place. The new gauge was close enough that standard gauge equipment could run on it without problem. By June 1886, all major railroads in North America were using approximately the same gauge. The final conversion to true standard gauge took place gradually as track was maintained.Southern railfan Now, the only broad-gauge rail systems in the United States are isolated rapid transit, light rail, and streetcar systems as well as some heritage railways and hill railways.

The monastery has a notable design, with striped walls of white, dark red and gray, colors unique to the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Below the monastery itself is the famous Derge Parkhang (Printing House), built in 1729, where the Buddhist scriptures the Kangyur and the Tengyur and other Buddhist works are still printed from wooden blocks in traditional handwork. The printing house, run by monks of the monastery, continues to use ancient techniques and uses no electricity. The roof is used for drying the printed sheets. It houses some 217,000 engraved blocks of scriptures from all Tibetan Buddhist sects including the Bon and about 2,500 pages are hand-produced each day by monks in the traditional manner. Upstairs in the same building older printers produce prints on both cloth and paper. Workers carve new wooden printing blocks in the administrative building opposite the monastery which is protected from earthquakes and fire by the goddess Drolma, an emanation of Tara. Tangyel Lhakhang is a secondary temple to the west of Gonchen Monastery's main temple. History Gonchen Monastery was founded by Thang Tong Gyalpo (or Tangton Gyelpo) (1385-1464), a Buddhist yogi and polymath, physician, and treasure finder, renowned for founding of Ache Lhamo, the Tibetan opera, and the numerous iron suspension bridges he constructed throughout the Himalayan region. He is said to have made 108 of them, the most celebrated being the one over the Yarlung Tsangpo near modern Chushul. He is often shown in murals with long white hair and holding some chain links from his bridges.Tibet. (2005) 6th Edition, p. 26. Bradley Mayhew and Michael Kohn. Lonely Planet. .

The Ministry of Defence is headed by the Minister of Defence, a cabinet-level head who reports directly to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Beneath the Ministry of Defence are four subordinate military components: The Nigerian Defence Headquarters, the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Navy and the Nigerian Air Force. Military operations and training are coordinated and managed by these components. Its main mission is ‚ÄúTo provide administrative and support services, timely and effectively to enable the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to build and maintain a modern, compact, strong, professional, mission-capable and mission-ready Armed Forces, for the defence of National territory, maritime interest, airspace and the protection and defence of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to contribute to peacemaking and peace-keeping duties worldwide under sub-regional and global organizations of which Nigeria is a member.‚Äù  History  The Ministry of Defence came into being on 1st October 1958, when the War Office granted control of the armed forces to the national government - earlier discussions have made that made the establishment of Ministry of Defence. In 1956, at the time of the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, the Nigeria Regiment was renamed The Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment, Royal West African Frontier Force as a mark of allegiance to the Queen of England. On 1 May 1958, the Naval Defence Force (NDF) was legally established as a force and re- designated Royal Nigerian Navy (RNN). On 1st June, 1958, the British Army Council in London relinquished control of Nigerian Military Force (NMF) to the Nigerian Government. Upon its creation, the ministry was given responsibility over the two branches of the military in existence at that time the Royal Nigerian Army and the Royal Nigerian Navy and later oversaw the founding of the Nigerian Air Force in 1964.  Responsibilities  The aims and objectives of the Ministry of Defence which are derived from the National Defence Policy are as follows: * Maintaining men of the Nigerian Armed Forces in a state of combat readiness on land, sea and air. * Maintaining a proper balance in arms and men to meet the needs of internal and external security; * Making provision for the welfare of the men of the Armed Forces in terms of training, accommodation, health care and other benefits aimed at boosting their morale. * Enhancing the capability and sophistication of the country‚Äôs Defence Industries in order to reduce the country's dependence on foreign sources of supply. * Ensuring security in the African continent by the promotion of a collective defence system through bilateral, sub-regional and continental co- operation to ward off external aggression and to attain the African objective of the national foreign policy; and * Contributing towards peace and stability in the world as a whole through the United Nations, African Union (AU) and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).  Organisation  Headquartered at the Ship House in Abuja, Federal Capital Territory. The organizational structure of the Ministry is made up of the civilian and military components. The Minister of Defence, appointed by the President of Nigeria with the consent of the Senate, is the political head of the Ministry of Defence. The Minister is sometimes assisted by the Minister of State. The Permanent Secretary is the Accounting and Chief Administrative Officer of the Ministry. He coordinates and directs the activities of the Departments and Units in the Ministry. = Military organization = The Armed Forces Services Headquarters of the Ministry comprise the following: * Defence Headquarters Nigeria - Chief of the Defence Staff * Nigerian Army Headquarters - Chief of Army Staff * Nigerian Navy Headquarters - Chief of Naval Staff * Nigerian Air Force Headquarters - Chief of Air Staff The control of the Armed Forces, their joint operations and training rest with the Chief of Defence Staff Nigeria who coordinates the three Services while the three Service Chiefs are responsible for the day to day running of their respective Services. = Civilian organization = The civilization cell are nine operational departments within the Ministry: Joint Services, Army Affairs, Navy Affairs, Air Force Affairs, Human Resources, Planning & Statistics, Finance & Accounts, Procurement and Legal Departments each headed by a Civilian director.

Toronto Star, March 16, 2010. was well known as a Canadian ice hockey player who competed in the 1960 Winter Olympics. He was born in Oshawa, Ontario, to Ernest and Marietta Attersley. During his lifetime he owned and operated several businesses and having a political career which extended to being the mayor of Whitby. Early life He was first employed by General Motors, and also held the position of president of the Young Conservative Party of Oshawa. He subsequently moved to Whitby. Hockey career Attersley played on bantam and midget hockey teams in Oshawa and then proceeded onto Junior B. Eventually reaching Major Junior 'A' hockey in 1950-1951, he first played for the Oshawa Generals. He remained with the Generals for a total of three seasons, receiving the Red Tilson Trophy as the Ontario Hockey League's most valuable player in 1952-1953. In hopes of signing him, he was invited by the Boston Bruins to their training camp at Hershey, Pennsylvania in 1953. While considering the offer made by Boston, the Generals lost their arena to a fire. This fire not only took their home, but all their equipment as well. This forced the team to split up, names were put into a hat and divided between the remaining teams. This landed Attersley with the Guelph Biltmores for a year at the same fee offered by Boston. Other than playing exhibition games with the Bruins he remained with the Guelph Biltmores. With the contract to the Guelph Biltmores coming to an end, Attersley joined the team the Oshawa Truckmen. Because of the loss of the Oshawa arena, the 1953-1954 season was played in Bowmanville. At this point Attersley made his way back to Whitby with the then Oshawa Truckmen, which changed its name to the Whitby Dunlops. With his centre position secured for the Whitby Dunlops, Attersley went on to win the scoring championship in the league for four of the five seasons. In 1956-1957, he went on to win the Allan Cup with the Whitby Dunlops in their first year as a Senior \\"A\\" club. He also managed to set two records during his time with the Dunlops. A record of 70 assists in the 1956-1957 season and in 1958-1959 a record for total points at the end of a season, 95. In 1958 he earned the right to represent Canada at the World Hockey Championships in Oslo, Norway with the Dunlops. In the final game, Attersley scored two goals and one assist. In the 1958-1959 season, the Whitby Dunlops won the Allan Cup. In the following year the Whitby Dunlops disbanded, leaving Attersley to join the Waterloo Flying Dutchmen to represent Canada for a second time. This time it was at the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California. Following the Olympics Attersley went on to join the Kingston Frontenacs of the Eastern Professional Hockey League, until leaving hockey in 1962. =Recognition= He received two major forms of recognition for his many years playing hockey. On August 14, 1981, the Whitby Dunlops were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. Attersley's and Harry Sinden's sweaters were placed in a glass case as part of a display of World Championship teams Canada has produced since the Second World War. In 1986 Attersley was also recognized for his years with the Generals, when he was inducted into the Oshawa Sports Hall of Fame. =Return to hockey= Attersley returned to hockey in 1989 when, along with Wren Blair, he purchased the then Kingston Raiders. The new owners kept the team in Kingston and restored the old Frontenacs name. Business career After working for General Motors, Attersley became supervisor of maintenance at the new Dunlop Tire plant towards the end of 1954. On April 1, 1960 he opened his first Attersley Tire store and expanded into the commercial truck area of expertise by the year 1964. He continued to expand himself across many areas of commerce and in 1981, and was recognized by the Whitby Chamber of Commerce naming him \\"Business Person of the Year.\\" Political career Attersley's political career began to 1964 when he was first elected to the town council of Whitby. He served as a councillor from January 1964 until August 1966 when the reeve of Whitby, Everett Quantrill, resigned. At that point the deputy reeve George Brooks took his place and Attersley took over as deputy reeve and finance committee chairman. He stayed in those positions until the end of 1969 when he retired from council. He returned to council from 1971 to 1973 following the resignation of Hugh O'Connell, and again in 1977. In this latter term, he also served on Durham Regional Council. =Mayor= In November 1980, Attersley ran for mayor unchallenged. In his first year as mayor, Attersley faced a large challenge when in the summer of 1980 one of Whitby's largest industries, Firestone, had closed bringing with it a loss of 650 jobs and $65,000 in taxes. Another duty that Attersley assumed as mayor in 1980 was to serve as one of the Regional Council's representatives on the then named Durham Police Commission. He spent a total of 11 years on the commission, nine as chairman (1983‚Äì1991), unchallenged for each of those years. While on the Durham Police Commission he was responsible for the introduction of the Crime Stoppers program into Whitby. He took a major role in modernizing police equipment and introducing a computer system. A major goal of Attersley's as mayor was to increase commerce in Whitby. He realized tourist promotion to be a necessity for the welfare of Whitby and established a temporary Tourist Information Centre. On June 29, 1982, a permanent Tourist Information Centre was opened with financial assistance from Len Cullen, owner of Cullen Gardens. In an attempt to increase industrialism, brochures were made up in English, French, German and Japanese to promote Whitby. In times of a recession for Ontario, Whitby posted record numbers for building permits, industries and stores being opened, and a population increase. In July 1982, Attersley ran, again unchallenged, for a second term as mayor. Whitby received global attention when it was visited by 15 Japanese mayors on July 9, 1984. It was the only Canadian stop by the mayors, who wanted to see how a town like Whitby operated. On August 25, 1984, Attersley presented Anne Ottenbrite with the Key to the Town of Whitby and named a swimming pool in her honour. He also later unveiled a plaque at Camp X in memory of Sir William Stephenson. Attersley served as mayor until the 1991 municipal election. Attersley was appointed Honorary Colonel of The Ontario Regiment in July 2001.

For example, it is normative for the secondary theme of a minor-mode sonata to be in either the key of III or v. If a composer chooses to break this norm in a given piece, that is a deviation that requires analytical and interpretive explanation.Hepokoski, James and Warren Darcy. Elements of Sonata Theory: Norms, Types and Deformations in the Late Eighteenth Century Sonata. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. The essentials of the theory are presented by its developers, James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, in the book Elements of Sonata Theory, which won the Society for Music Theory's Wallace Berry Award in 2008. Although the theory is particularly designed to treat late-eighteenth-century works such as those by Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, many of its principles are applicable to works in sonata form from later centuries. Methodology Rather than attempt to prescribe a set of rules to which all pieces in sonata form must adhere, sonata theory seeks to demonstrate that sonata form is \\"a constellation of normative and optional procedures that are flexible in their realization.\\" A work in sonata form is expected to accomplish certain goals; how it goes about this task is to be understood in relation to a set of background stylistic tendencies. The theory, then, understands the sonata as an example of dialogic form: the compositional choices that create an individual piece of music are in dialogue with generic norms and expectations. A large component of the theory is therefore a reconstruction of what these norms were based on an extensive study of the late-eighteenth-century repertoire. Central to this undertaking are the notions of defaults and deformations. At any point in a sonata movement, such as at the beginning of the secondary theme or the end of the development, a composer had various choices for how to proceed. The most typical option, or the first level default, might be bypassed in favor of a second (or lower level) default. For example, developments most frequently begin by recalling the exposition's primary theme in a new key, but a development might also begin episodically by introducing new material, which Hepokoski and Darcy posit \\"may be a second-level default option.\\" On the other hand, a composer might choose for this moment of the piece to behave in a genuinely atypical way. This is what Sonata Theory terms a \\"deformation\\" of normal practice. The term deformation is not meant to suggest an aesthetic judgment (along the lines of \\"malformed\\") but rather is intended as a technical term indicating a significant deviation from ordinary practice. Indeed, deformational moments are often the most unusual, interesting, and pleasing aspects of a work: \\"Deformations are compositional surprises, engaging forays into the unexpected. But the paradox of art is that the nature of the game at hand also and always includes the idea that we are to expect the unexpected.\\" A central part of the analytic and interpretive work of Sonata Theory lies in recognizing these deformations and default choices and understanding how they affect the progress of a piece as a whole. From the perspective of the theory, sonata form engages two principal levels of compositional design: tonal and rhetorical. The tonal layout of sonata form has frequently been described by theorists, and involves a motion from the tonic to a secondary key in the exposition, answered by a return and solidification of the tonic later in the piece (usually in the recapitulation). The rhetorical form, on the other hand, concerns the manner in which themes, textures, and musical ideas are presented; it \\"includes personalized factors of design and ad hoc expression: modular and textural layout, selection and arrangement of musical topics, varieties of structural punctuation, and so on.\\" A key consideration of the theory in this regard is the rotational layout of the usual sonata design. An exposition usually presents a number of differing musical ideas in a specific order. Later sections of the piece (such as the development, recapitulation, and coda) usually revisit these ideas in the same order‚Äîthough not necessarily touching on every one‚Äîas if rotating through a pre-set sequence, like hours on a clock or channels on a television dial. Key concepts Sonata Theory understands the rhetorical layout of a sonata as progressing through a set of action spaces and moments of \\"structural punctuation.\\" These action spaces largely correlate with the \\"themes\\" or \\"groups\\" of the sonata, though each space is differentiated primarily by the unique generic goal that the music pursues within that particular space. The exposition lays out each space, establishing a rotational order which the recapitulation also follows. Frequently the development will only articulate a subset of these action spaces, moving only through a partial rotation, although fully rotational, entirely episodic, and non-rotational developments also occur. The primary theme (P) zone or space presents the initial musical material of the sonata, excluding an optional introduction which is not considered part of the sonata form proper. One function of this space is to define the main (or tonic) key of the piece, usually confirming it with a cadence at the end of the theme. Generically, however, the sonata is required to depart from this home key for the later action spaces, so the tonic proposed by P is only provisional; one of the main generic goals of the following sonata form is to eventually affirm this key with a more definitive cadence. A second function of P material is to signal the initiation of one of the sonata's rotations. As P falls at the beginning of the rotational layout and usually consists of distinctive musical material, every subsequent occurrence of that material suggests the beginning of a new rotation. The transition (TR) follows P, sometimes emerging seamlessly out of it. The chief goal of TR is to build up energy, although TR also frequently modulates away from the tonic to prepare the sonata's secondary key. The most common goal for the transition's energy gain is to drive to the first moment of \\"structural punctuation,\\" the medial caesura. If this option is chosen, a Two-Part Exposition is produced; if not, TR leads directly to the essential expositional closure (described below), producing a Continuous Exposition. The medial caesura (MC or ‚Äô), if present, is an abrupt gap in the musical texture, either a complete gap in sound or covered over by light \\"filler\\" material. The MC is often triggered by repeated, declamatory (\\"hammer blow\\") chords and follows either a half cadence or authentic cadence in the tonic or secondary key. (The first level default is to build an MC around a half cadence in the new key; by far the least common option is to set the MC up by an authentic cadence in the tonic.) This moment of punctuation serves one purpose: to announce the impending arrival of the sonata's secondary theme. According to Sonata Theory, a piece cannot have a secondary theme without an MC to prepare it (except in highly deformational circumstances): the medial caesura is a necessary generic marker of the second theme. This is the meaning of the term \\"Two-Part Exposition:\\" sonata expositions including a medial caesura are articulated into primary and secondary themes. Those without proceed \\"continuously\\" from beginning to closure. If prepared by a medial caesura, the secondary theme (S) begins in the exposition's new key (normatively V for major mode sonatas and III or v for minor mode ones). Often, and with increasing frequency in the nineteenth century, (but by no means exclusively) the secondary theme is marked by a quieter, more lyrical character than the energetic TR that preceded it. The main objective of the S action space, however, is to confirm the new key with a perfect authentic cadence. This cadence is the overarching goal of a sonata exposition, and its equivalent moment in the recapitulation is the chief goal of the sonata form as a whole. Thus S space is often characterized by dramatic methods of delaying this cadential arrival. (One common manner in which this is accomplished is the articulation of an apparent second medial caesura, producing what Sonata Theory terms a Trimodular Block.) The authentic cadence that S-space strives for is the essential expositional closure (EEC), the second main moment of structural punctuation in an exposition. (The equivalent moment in a recapitulation is the essential structural closure (ESC).) Usually, the EEC is provided by the first perfect authentic cadence articulated after S-space has begun, although this can be undermined in various ways (such as repeating previously heard material from S, implying that the previous cadence was somehow insufficient and S-space needs to \\"try again\\"). Thus the EEC is conventionally defined as \\"the first satisfactory perfect authentic cadence that proceeds onward to differing material.\\" The EEC confirms the new key proposed by S; it is the generic goal of the exposition as a whole. Likewise, the ESC in the recapitulation confirms the key of S in the recapitulation, which is now the tonic. Thus the ESC confirms the piece's tonic as a whole, solidifying the tonal promise first made by P in the exposition. In approaching the ESC in the recapitulation, the crux' will appear as the rejoining of expositional material within the TR or S zones. This usually happens after alterations (recompositions) in the P or TR zones. The crux will be signified by correspondence measures (measures that parallels the exposition). The crux may, however, appear in the subdominant, or simultaneously with S or the ESC. The entire sonata form, therefore, is understood as a dynamic trajectory toward the ESC, the basic plan of which is foreshadowed by the exposition's approach to the EEC. This teleology is central to Sonata Theorys conception of the dramatic and expressive potential of sonata form as a whole. The crux is the part of the recapitulation where the S zone secures itself in the home key and significant changes compared to the exposition no longer occur. Following the EEC or ESC, a composer can append a closing (C) zone that reinforces the key of the cadence. Often this involves further authentic cadences after the EEC, even ones that are more rhetorically forceful, but they serve only to reinforce the closure attained by the EEC. By the definition of the \\"essential closure\\" cadences, C must involve musical material that differs from what was heard in S. In fact, C space often includes distinctly new thematic material. The entire layout of a Two-Part Exposition is thus often represented as: P TR ‚Äô S ‚Üì C (Arrows are frequently used in Sonata Theory notation to represent authentic cadences‚Äîin this case the EEC.) Sonata types One fundamental choice that composers had in constructing a sonata form was how many rotations to employ. Sonata Theory recognizes five different Types of sonatas based on their rotational distribution. (The selection of sonata type is independent of the piece's internal rotational layout: a sonata of any type might have either a Continuous or a Two-Part exposition, for example.) The Type 1 Sonata is a bi- rotational structure: it includes only an expositional rotation, followed immediately (or perhaps after a short link) by a recapitulatory rotation. This type, frequently employed in slow movements, therefore lacks a traditional development section. The Type 2 Sonata is also bi-rotational, but the design of its second rotation is more complicated. (The first rotation is usually a standard exposition.) Instead of beginning the second rotation with the P-theme in the tonic, setting off a normal recapitulation, Type 2 sonatas replace the beginning of the rotation with material that seems like a traditional development (although, like most developments, this material is often based on P). At some point, this developmental material segues back into the normal rotational sequence, usually at some point during TR, but occasionally as late as the MC itself. Thus it often happens that the restoration of the tonic key in Rotation 2 is accomplished by the arrival of S. This has led other analysts to apply the term \\"reversed recapitulation\\" to this sonata type. Sonata Theory, in contrast, reserves the term \\"recapitulation\\" for instances in which the beginning of a rotation coincides with the return of the tonic key. Thus, the arrival of S in the middle of a Type 2 second rotation functions as a \\"tonal resolution\\" but not as the beginning of a recapitulation, because it does not initiate a new rotation. The Type 3 Sonata is the traditional textbook design, including full exposition, development, and recapitulation, each of which has its own independent rotational design (although developments are often only half- rotational). The Type 4 Sonata describes structures that others have referred to as sonata rondos. The key aspects of this sonata type include a retransition (RT) that concludes every rotation (following C space), a second (developmental) rotation that begins with P in the tonic, and an obligatory P-based coda following the recapitulatory rotation. The Type 5 Sonata is the design employed by the first movement of most eighteenth-century concertos and is the most complicated sonata design. Although great variation exists between individual Type 5 movements, the most characteristic features of the Type 5 are an extra, initial, non-modulatory rotation for the orchestra alone and an alternation between blocks of music for the soloist and for the orchestra.

Cotton lies a few miles to the east of the Great Eastern Main Line and to the west of the A140. Nearby villages include Mendlesham and Bacton, and the parish also includes the small hamlet of Dandy Corner. Its precise location is 4¬Ω miles north east of its post town, Stowmarket, and 2¬Ω miles north west of Mendlesham. In 2005 its population was 510 and according to the 2011 census, the total population had increased by 16 to 526. In the 1870s, Cotton was described as :\\"a parish in Hartismere district, Suffolk; on the Eastern Union railway, 1¬Ω mile S of Finningham r. station, and 6 N by E of Stowmarket. The church is good; and there is a Wesleyan chapel, a parochial school, and charities.\\" Population 1881 Census Data ‚Äì 'Occupations of Males and Females in the Division and its Registration Counties' Between 1801 and 2011, according to UK Census data, the population of Cotton has fluctuated quite a lot. In 1801, the population of the village was 441; it continued to rise until it reached its peak population in 1831 of a population of 585. It then began to steadily decrease for several decades until 1951 where the village reached its lowest recorded population of 363. This could have affected the economy and industry of Cotton, as the workforce was dwindling. However, after this point in 1951, the population began to gradually increase again and in 2011 it was recorded to be 526. Religion Cotton appears to be a one religion parish, of the 526 people living in Cotton in 2011, 368 declared themselves as being part of the Christian religion, only 1 Buddhist and 159 either of no religion or not stating their religion. In 2001, there were 489 people living in Cotton, and of these, 420 were of a Christian faith. There were no other religions declared in the 2001 census, only 69 people who either didn't state their religion or had no religion. Church St Andrew's Church, located on Church Street is the local place of Church of England worship for Cotton, which is classified under the Diocese of St Edmundsbury & Ipswich. It is a listed building which holds services twice a month and several other special services throughout the year. Housing In 2011, there was a recorded 225 household in Cotton. This had increased since 2001 where it was recorded to be 205. The most common type of household in 2011, according to the Census data was married couple households with no dependent children. This type of household accounted for nearly half of the total households. Occupation St Andrew's Church In 1881, there was a large male and female divide concerning choice of occupations. The most popular occupation for males was working in the agricultural industry and the most popular choice for females was working as part of the domestic services or in offices. With a population of 506 in 1881, 77 males worked in agriculture and 16 females worked in domestic services. In 2011 there was 263 people between the ages of 16 and 74 who were in employment. 34 were in a managerial occupation, 34 in a professional career, 55 in the skilled trade industry, and just 18 people operating plant machinery. This is very different to the 1881 career distribution, as it has shifted from an agricultural-based workforce to a more service-based workforce, in both men and women. Land The total area of the parish is 7,556.35m2. The vast majority of the land use in Cotton is greenspace, with 7,111.22m2 of land being green, agricultural area. Domestic land use ‚Äì i.e. residential areas ‚Äì comprise 29.55m2 of the parish and 19.18m2 is non-domestic land use.

Netherlands, 1935. A child getting a filling at the dentist. Malm√∂ National Dental Service 1989. Pediatric dentistry (formerly pedodontics in American English or paedodontics in Commonwealth English) is the branch of dentistry dealing with children from birth through adolescence. The specialty of pediatric dentistry is recognized by the American Dental Association, Royal College of Dentists of Canada, and Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons.Paediatric dentistry (requires log-in) A little girl's trip to the pediatric dentist examining children's teeth. Pediatric (also paediatric or p√¶diatric) dentists promote the dental health of children as well as serve as educational resources for parents. It is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that a dental visit should occur within six months after the presence of the first tooth or by a child's first birthday. The AAPD has said that it is important to establish a comprehensive and accessible ongoing relationship between the dentist and patient ‚Äì referring to this as the patient's \\"dental home\\". This is because early oral examination aids in the detection of the early stages of tooth decay. Early detection is essential to maintain oral health, modify aberrant habits, and treat as needed and as simply as possible. Additionally, parents are given a program of preventive home care (brushing, flossing and fluorides), a caries risk assessment, information on finger, thumb, and pacifier habits, advice on preventing injuries to the mouth and teeth of children, diet counseling , and information on growth and development.  History  In 1909 Minnie Evangeline Jordon established the first dental practice in the United States devoted only to pediatric patients. In 1925 she published the first textbook on pediatric dentistry, titled Operative Dentistry for Children.\\"M. Evangeline Jordan- Pedodontics\\" Sindecuse Museum, University of Michigan School of Dentistry.M. Evangeline Jordon, Operative Dentistry for Children (1925).Alma Whitaker, \\"Fame Won as Dentist by Woman\\" Los Angeles Times (April 7, 1933): A5.  Education  Pediatric dentistry is one of the ten dental specialties recognized by American Dental Association. Other specialties include dental public health, endodontics, oral and maxillofacial pathology, oral and maxillofacial radiology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, periodontics, and prosthodontics. The first step would be obtaining a college degree in biomedical science, health science, or social science. While in college, one can explore the profession by shadowing in a pediatric dental office or children hospital, or by working on academic research that studies oral health of children. Second step would be attending a dental school for 4 years of education and training. One can graduate with Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). Both degrees are equivalent and involve the same training. It just depends on the specific school one goes to. During the first two years of dental school, dental students will take didactic classes on biomedical sciences and learn hand skills(dental procedures) in a pre-clinical laboratory setting. Third and fourth year of dental school focus on clinical care under the supervision of an attending faculty who is a licensed dentist. Before graduating, all dental students must pass National Board Dental Examination part I and part II, as well as clinical skill exams (e.g., ADEX, WREB, etc) to become a licensed general dentist. In order to specialize in pediatric dentistry, one can seek additional training in an accredited postgraduate residency program. Pediatric dentistry residency program can be 24 months or more in length. At the end, resident dentists are awarded a certificate in pediatric dentistry with or without a master's degree depending on the program they attend. Specialized training covers all aspects of oral health care from infancy through adolescence, encompassing behavior management, preventive dentistry, restorative dentistry, sedation dentistry, oral trauma management, interceptive orthodontics, oral medicine and pathology. A large part of residency training is spent on treating pediatric patients in a dental clinic or hospital operation room. Following successful completion of post-graduate training, one becomes Board eligible for the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry(ABPD) examination. The first part of the Board exam is a written exam. Once passing the written exam, one moves on to the second part, which is an oral examination testing on clinical knowledge and skills. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomate status in the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry that allows one to practice as a Board-certified pediatric dentist.  Job Description  Responsibilities of a pediatric dentist include: * Diagnose oral diseases. * Promote oral health for children and adolescents(healthy, sick or those with disabilities) * Formulate treatment plans to restore oral health of pediatric patients. * Interpret x-rays and diagnostic tests. * Monitor growth and development of the teeth and jaws. * Correct malocclusion through interceptive orthodontic treatment. * Perform surgical procedures on the teeth, bone and soft tissues of the oral cavity. * Treat dental caries and odontogenic infection. * Manage dental trauma, including fractured, displaced, and knock-out teeth. * Treat pediatric patients under various stages of sedation(minimal, moderate, or deep). One of their main concerns is tooth decay prevention. Not only do they work with the teeth, pediatric dentists also look at the gums, throat muscles and nervous system of the head, neck and jaw, the tongue, and salivary glands. They do this to check for pathology and other anomalies. Another duty of theirs is to test for oral cancer and perform biopsies, if needed.  Career Outlook  It has been reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics job growth for pediatrics dentist will increase about 20% from 2014-2024. The median salary for a pediatric dentist is about $175,000 a year. As of Oct 6, 2019, the average annual pay for a Pediatric Dentist in the United States is $245,671 a year. Most pediatric dentists owns their own private practices or work as an associate. There is also an option for them to work at dental schools to teach and train pediatric residents.

Shartsang Kaldan Gyatso established the first monastic college, Tsennyi Tratsang, in which Buddhist dialectics, vinaya, Madhyamika philosophy, Prajnaparamita, and Abhidharma are still currently taught, in 1630. Following multiple subsequent re-incarnations, the 7th incarnation of Shartsang Rinpoche, Lobsang Trinley Longtok Gyatso, increased the number of colleges to the present: the Tsennyi Tratsang, the Gyamat Tratsang (tantric College, where tantric scriptures and practices are taught) and the Duikor Tratsang, a monastic college of the wheel of time that is also known as the College of Kalachakra, the 10 syllable mantra.

These services are typically provided by the local, publicly operated hospital, and funded by the government of Poland. In a number of cases, the hospitals contract these services to private operators. In addition to publicly funded services, there are also a variety of private-for-profit ambulance services operating independently, as well. StandardsOperating system= At the moment, the operating system of Polish EMS is similar of the Austrian- Franco- German-Spanish delivery model, and is physician-led and an Integrated EMS of Public Health (IEMS). Physicians (usually anaesthetists) respond to most emergency calls, and a great deal of definitive care and even simple physician consultation and discharge occur at the scene. These physicians are often referred to as Emergency Physicians. Emergency medicine has been recognized as a medical specialty since 1999. Due to shortage of specialists in emergency medicine, selected other medical specialists (anesthesiology and intensive care, internal diseases, general surgery, pediatrics, pediatric surgery, orthopaedics and traumatology) are allowed to work in the system until 2020. Unlike the German system, the physicians do not respond in separate vehicles, instead staffing the appropriate types of ambulances directly. Transportation to a hospital may, or may not, be an outcome depending on the decision of the MICU Physician. The variation occurs in that the physician may be supported by either paramedics or nurses, or some mix of the two roles. Each ambulance also has a dedicated Ambulance Technician who drives, with minimal medical training. As the system evolves, however, it will be changing. Paramedic-led ambulances will respond to most emergency calls, as in the Anglo-American model, with physicians being \\"sent\\" only to those calls where there is a potential critical threat to life. =Vehicles and equipment= Poland has voluntarily adopted the majority of the specifications for ambulances of European Standard CEN 1789. Ambulances and equipment used do comply with the technical standards outlined. While design and technical standards are voluntarily complied with, there is virtually no compliance with the visual identity standards described in the Standard. There are also no immediate plans to do so. While plans are in place for the restructuring of some aspects of the EMS system, these are mostly related to staffing configurations and deployment, which are not covered by the technical Standard. It appears unlikely that the proposed changes will have any effect on Standard compliance. =Training= Since 2006, the evolving legal standard of training for Polish paramedics is a three-year bachelor's degree. As an option, those with substantial prior experience may proceed to a degree, following two years of additional study. This program is available in a number of Polish universities, and will completely replace the prior training standard, which consisted of an assortment of short courses. Short courses of various types continue to be offered, but these are now essentially the typical short courses found elsewhere in EMS, including Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support, among others. System configuration  Ratownictwo Medyczne service delivery units = *Pa≈Ñstwowe Ratownictwo Medyczne (EMS stations) *Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (LPR) (Air ambulance stations) *Fire Brigade - In the Polish system firefighters provide a level of tiered response to assist Polish EMS in exceptional circumstances, including fires and motor vehicle accidents. The training provided to Polish firefighters is limited to first aid and what might be described as ABC (medicine). As a result, their participation in emergency medical responses is less common than what those in North America would be accustomed to. =Vehicles=Land ambulance The vehicles of the Polish EMS system come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As a member of the European Union, Poland has decided to ratify most aspects of the requirements of European standard CEN 1789 for ambulances, as reflected in the Polish EN 1789 (Classes A-C) Standard. The visual identity requirements of the European standard for ambulances are not yet being followed. The three major types of vehicle are: *The patient transport ambulance (T), which is smaller, conforms to European Class A, and contains fewer staff and less equipment. *The ambulans specjalistyczny (S) (English: specialised ambulance), is a larger van used for serious emergencies. This unit type is the first choice for response to emergencies that appear to be immediately life-threatening. The crew of this type is minimum two paramedics (or emergency nurses) and a physician. While some CEN 1789 Class B vehicles are still present in the system, the objective is to ultimately ensure that this type of ambulance is always a Class C. *The ambulans podstawowy (P) (English: basic ambulance), is a van-type ambulance used for less severe emergencies. The crew of a basic ambulance is minimum two paramedics (or emergency nurses). It is currently the most common type. These vehicles conform to the CEN 1789 Class B standard, although often Class C ambulances are seen in this role. In addition, the system also operates specialty ambulances which are equipped for and dedicated to neonatal transport (Type N), which are not used for any other purpose. Air ambulance Polish Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (LPR) operates helicopter air ambulances strategically located in cities throughout Poland. In addition, fixed wing aircraft (Piaggio P180 Avanti) stationed in Warsaw are used for longer range transport. Beginning in the summer of 2011, LPR exclusively operated EC-135. LPR operated a single AgustaWestland AW109 from 2005 to 2009 when the aircraft was lost (without loss of life) in a training accident and subsequently written off.

This equipment is obligatory and represents minimal requirements: * Basic First Aid kit. * Dressings and Bandages * Spinal immobilization equipment such as Cervical collars or spine boards * Mobile medical ventilator * Basic diagnostic equipment, such as blood-pressure cuffs * Portable defibrillator * ECG monitor * Equipment for intravenous therapy * Gurney and blankets * Flexible stretcher, also called a Reeves stretcher * Rigid or collapsible transport chair (called a stair chair in the United States) * Rescue equipment =Communications= All ambulances in Poland are dispatched from centralized regional dispatch centers (Polish: Centrum Powiadamiania Ratunkowego)(CPR). The traditional standardized emergency telephone number for ambulances in Poland in the POTS telephone system is 999. The standard European emergency number, 112, also works in Poland, including mobile systems, and is gradually replacing 999. Calls are then triaged by interview process, and the closest and most correct type of ambulance resource is sent to the call. E112 is a location-enhanced version of 112. The telecom operator transmits the location information to the emergency centre. The EU Directive E112 (2003) requires mobile phone networks to provide emergency services with whatever information they have about the location a mobile call was made. This directive is based on the American Federal Communications Commission's Enhanced 911 ruling in 2001. System changes Polish paramedics in uniform =Previous systems= In Poland, there were two types of emergency ambulances, type R (now S), and type W (P), which are staffed as follows: *Ambulance type R - 3 people including a physician, paramedic a driver-paramedic. *Ambulance type W - 3 including a physician 1 paramedic, and a driver-paramedic. Or 2 people Nurses/paramedics and driver- paramedic. =Current system= The government of Poland has mandated significant changes within the EMS system. These will include more paramedic- led ambulances and less physician-led ambulances. In the proposed system Polish paramedics will perform ALS skills without a physician present. These changes are proposed to occur in 2010, with the acquisition of some 600 new ambulances by the Polish government; the result of industrial action by Polish paramedics. Patient transport ambulances (Type T) and neonatal transport ambulances (Type N) will remain in their current configurations. The new types of ambulances and staffing patterns will be as follows: *The ambulans specjalistyczny (S) (English: specialist ambulance) is a larger van used for serious emergencies. This is used only for potentially life-threatening responses. Standard personnel staffing consists of a doctor (with emergency medicine specialization), a paramedic (or specialized nurse), and a driver/orderly. The vehicle used will be in all cases a CEN 1789 Class C ambulance. The new ambulance category, Type S replaced the Type R ambulance in the \\"More ALS\\" category. *The ambulans podstawowy (P) (English: basic ambulance; in EMS squads called also paramedic ambulance) is a standard van- type ambulance used for emergency responses when a Type S unit is unavailable, and for lower priority emergency calls. Such vehicles will not be used for consultations, or for non-emergency transport. Standard staffing of personnel will consist of a paramedics (or specialized nurses) and a driver-Paramedic orderly. The new category, Type P will replace the old Type W vehicle configuration. Type P ambulances will conform to, at minimum, CEN 1789 Class B, with the option at a local level to use Class C vehicles instead. =Primary health care and non-emergency medical transport= In Poland, ambulances are also used for non-emergency transport, such as: * Ambulance N - neonatal transport team - pediatric staff * Ambulance OL - physician traveling team - 3 people including a physician, Nurse-EMT, and a driver-EMT * Ambulance T - outgoing transport team, - 2 people including EMT-nurses, and a driver-EMT  References  ","title":"Emergency medical services in Poland"},{"id":"20878027","text":"The Land Register Draft of 1950 (Matrikkelutkastet av 1950) is a listing containing rural real estate within Norway.

Background The firm have been active since circa 1993, following on from previous Aston Villa hooligan firms the Steamers, C-Crew and Villa Youth. The name 'Hardcore' reportedly arising from a Metropolitan Police officer announcing on his radio: \\"Here come Villa's hardcore\\" following the firm's emergence from a train station before an away match against West Ham United in November 1996. The Hardcore have been involved in some high-profile hooligan fights in Europe, while following Aston Villa and England. The Hardcore have clashed a number of times with the Zulu Warriors, associated with Aston Villa's fiercest rivals Birmingham City. Fifteen people were arrested in October 2002 in a series of dawn raids in connection with serious disorders committed in the Rocky Lane area of Aston before the game between Aston Villa and Birmingham City in September 2002, in what was described as the \\"Battle of Rocky Lane\\". In 2004, Steven Fowler, a Category C hooligan and member of Villa Hardcore, was jailed for six months for his part in the fight in 2002. In 2005 he received a twelve-month jail sentence and was banned from attending football matches for ten years, for his part in an organised brawl between the Villa Hardcore and Chelsea Headhunters at King's Cross in London on 27 March 2004, while five other Villa fans were also jailed. Fowler was jailed again in 2006 when he and 57 other people were found guilty of their involvement in a riot at a Handsworth pub on 22 August 2004 - the same day as Villa's Premier League clash with local rivals West Bromwich Albion. In November 2006, a planned launch of the book 'Villains' about the various Aston Villa hooligan firms, which included details of clashes with the Zulu Warriors, which was due to be held at Sensations Club in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham, had to be cancelled due to threats that the Zulus would turn up and cause trouble at the event. Members of the Zulu Warriors were said to have taken exception to the launch of the book and the presence of rivals on what they considered \\"their territory\\". In October 2008, Fowler, along with Michael Lutwyche released a book entitled 'Hardcore' about the firm. A younger wing of the firm emerged under the banner \\"Hardcore Youth\\" with two members of the firm being banned in January 2010 from attending Aston Villa matches, being in the vicinity of Villa Park on match-days, and, when Villa are playing away from home, using trains to travel the country and from entering the relevant town-centre. The pair were branded as \\"ring-leaders\\" by police and also were made to pay a fine of ¬£500 each in court. Also later on in the year another known Villa youth hooligan was handed a 3-year banning order at Warwick Crown Court whilst being held on remand after serving a 12-month prison sentence. He was handed the banning order after troubled flared outside Birmingham City's ground in 2009 after Villa won the game 1-2 with Gabriel Agbonlahor scoring a late winner. Police statistics claim that after the three leaders of the Youth faction of the Hardcore were all banned, reports of violence and potential organised clashes fell by 75%. In October and December 2010, Aston Villa played Birmingham City, at Villa Park (Premier League, 31 October) and St Andrew's (League Cup, 1 December) and in both games violence between the two sets of supporters and hooligan firms occurred, with many fans being arrested. In the first game, there were scenes of violence outside Villa Park, with Villa fans throwing a flare into Birmingham fans leaving Villa Park, there were a small amount of arrests including a Birmingham City club chef. In the second of the two games, after Birmingham had beaten Villa 2-1, Birmingham supporters invaded the pitch and confronted the visiting Villa fans. In retaliation, Villa fans ripped out seats and hurled them into the Birmingham supporters. Further, a flare was thrown from the Villa fans section into the Birmingham fans on the pitch. Villa fans have since been convicted following being picked out on CCTV after the game for offences, including the attack by Villa hooligans on a pub near St. Andrews frequented by Birmingham City supporters. There were also flash points before and after the game, the events were described as a \\"warzone\\" by a supporter who attended the game. As a result of these incidents, Birmingham City Council along with West Midlands Police decided to restrict Villa's ticket allocation for the return Premier League game at St. Andrews in January 2011. On 13 August 2011, the Birmingham Mail published an appeal for information after several Villa fans seriously vandalised a train taking Villa supporters to Birmingham New Street after Villa's friendly match away against Derby County on 3 August. The destruction included tray tables being ripped from the backs of seats, seat coverings being damaged and lights being smashed. The damage meant the train had to be taken out of service for 24 hours for repairs. On 30 October 2012, three Villa fans were arrested for violent disorder after a local derby with West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park which finished in a 1-1 draw. Flares were thrown at Albion supporters and a fourth Villa fan was arrested inside the stadium for throwing coins into the Albion fans. On 8 January 2013, known Villa hooligans were involved in scuffles with the police and rival supporters in and around The Queen pub in Bradford city centre before Villa's League Cup semi-final first leg against Bradford City in which one Bradford fan claims he was headbutted by a Villa supporter. On 28 August 2013, a group of Villa fans clashed with supporters of Rotherham United at Birmingham New Street station after the two teams met in the second round of the League Cup at Villa Park. On 25 November 2013, several Villa fans were arrested after clashes with rival fans of West Bromwich Albion at the Rose Villa Tavern in the Jewellery Quarter area of Birmingham before the two sides met in the Premier League at The Hawthorns which was later the subject of an episode of the BBC's Inside Out series. On 28 December 2013, during a match between Villa and Swansea City at Villa Park in the Premier League, three Villa hooligans were arrested by West Midlands Police after organised violence broke out between Villa and Swansea supporters near to the stadium. The violence was reported to have been similar to a scene from the film The Football Factory and at least 25 people were involved. One onlooker said her children were traumatised after seeing rival fans fight with bottles and sticks. On 10 January 2015, 11 Aston Villa supporters were arrested after clashing with rival fans in a Leicester street before a Premier League match against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium. There was widespread disorder before, during and after the match as police officers were also called to the Richard III pub on Highcross Street. It is understood that an ashtray was thrown at a group of supporters by another gang and a fight erupted, eyewitnesses said the men were hurling insults and threats at each other as the dispute spilled over into the road near the stadium, it is alleged they threw bins and cones in the violent clash before the ill-tempered game, which saw Villa's Ciaran Clark and Leicester's Matty James sent off. Footage of the violence was later released online. On 7 March 2015, a large number of Villa fans ran on to the Villa Park pitch in injury time and at full-time during Villa's 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory over local rivals West Bromwich Albion. A number of West Brom players appeared to be pushed by home fans on the pitch. Villa supporters were widely criticised in the media and the club were fined by The FA. On 19 September 2015, Villa fans were involved in a mass brawl with supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion on a train at Birmingham New Street waiting to depart to Worcester, the men involved were described as \\"white and in their mid-30s\\". Some of the suspects reportedly used their belts as weapons. On 22 September 2015, Villa met arch-rivals Birmingham City in the League Cup at Villa Park for the first time since 2010, 28 people were arrested during the day despite one of the largest football policing operations for many years. Eleven people were arrested for violent disorder and affray after trouble flared at the Manor Tavern pub in Aston before the game. Two men from Birmingham and one man from Redditch, Worcestershire, were charged with using threatening words or behaviour. Others were held for breaching bans, being drunk and disorderly and assault. A 32-year-old man from Birmingham was also charged with invading the pitch. Villa won the match 1‚Äì0. On 14 January 2017, around 35 members of the Hardcore were issued with dispersal orders at The Angel Inn in Bilston, where around 55 had gathered before a 5:30pm EFL Championship match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, and escorted back to Birmingham on a Midland Metro tram by the West Midlands Police. The Angel Inn were ordered to stop serving drinks and nearby pubs were told to lock their doors amid fears of violent disorder. The Midland Metro service was briefly disrupted as a tram was handed over to police for the purpose of transporting the fans out of the city. About 30 police officers, some with dogs, took part in the operation between 3pm and 5pm. In a statement, West Midlands Police said: ‚ÄúTo be really clear, these were a group of people we strongly believed were together to cause trouble.‚Äù Villa lost the match 1-0, and Villa fans were criticised after destroying toilets in the away section of the stadium. On 12 August 2017 after Aston Villa‚Äôs Championship match against Cardiff City F.C. at the Cardiff City Stadium, around 30 Villa Hardcore members attacked The Cornwall public house in the Grangetown area of the city where Cardiff supporters had gathered following the final whistle. In November 2017 South Wales Police released a statement in the media to reveal they had arrested 14 individuals in connection with the incident and posted images of six more men they wished to speak to regarding the violence. On 11 August 2018, there were clashes between Villa hooligans and fans of Wigan Athletic following Villa's 3-2 EFL Championship victory at Villa Park. Video footage appeared online shortly after the match finished showing two separate incidents close to the Aston Social Club on Aston Hall Road, a venue associated with Villa hooligans. One video appeared to show Villa supporters attacking Wigan fans through the open rear doors of a minibus that was transporting the Wigan supporters away from the stadium. West Midlands Police later issued a statement appealing for information following the release of video footage online. On 10 December 2018, ten Villa fans were jailed for their part in the pub brawl following the match with Cardiff City in August 2017. They received prison sentences varying between nine months and three years, three Cardiff supporters were also jailed. On 31 August 2019, disorder broke out between Villa fans in the away section at Selhurst Park, police and stewards after a late Villa equaliser on the pitch against Crystal Palace was disallowed by referee Kevin Friend. In January 2020, the Metropolitan Police released images of eight men they wished to identify following an investigation by Scotland Yard. A number of arrests were made and officers urged the public to help identify the men in the pictures. In popular culture On Sunday, 10 April 2011, an episode of Police Academy UK, a TV show aired on BBC Three, which documents 4 overseas police officers introduction to British crime and policing, was set in Birmingham and covered the violence that occurred at the game between Birmingham City and Aston Villa on 1 December 2010. In April 2011, a DVD was released with the title Aston Villa Hardcore Lads; the 70-minute-long DVD shows footage of the Hardcore involved in violence with rival hooligan firms, for example fans of Oxford United, West Bromwich Albion and various clashes with fans of Birmingham City. The DVD also includes pictures of Aston Villa hooligans and sections where Villa's rivals are ridiculed. In February 2014, an episode of the BBC series Inside Out followed officers from West Midlands Police as they attempted to combat football hooliganism at a West Bromwich Albion v Villa game in November 2013.

Plot An alien species called the Kulku demand that eight million human beings be handed over to them to produce a cure for the virus that is killing them. In return, the Kuklu promise not to wipe out the planet and take what they want. While other countries empty their prisons to try to meet their quotas, the U.S. holds a lottery. One of the 8 million humans selected is Dr. Stephen Chase's daughter, Heather. Dr. Chase tries to interfere with the Kulku's plan by joining the human resistance and killing as many of the Kulku as possible. The resistance has some success using a weapon he designs, but Heather is captured and taken to the Kulku mothership in orbit where they discover that just a little bit of her blood (rather than the entirety of it as with other human beings) is enough to cure one Kulku. Jal, the Kulku ambassador, prepares to send her to Kulku. He plans to destroy the Earth with the Kulku's \\"Raeg\\" weapon, which will allow her to travel to the Kulku homeworld alive. Meanwhile, after the Kulku start just harvesting humans, U.S. Army forces under Major General Skyler, formerly an enemy to the resistance despite being sympathetic, join forces with the resistance to stop the Kulku. Using an observatory's telescope as a modified version of Chase's weapon, the resistance prepares to use the weapon to destroy the Raeg and save the Earth, but a traitor reveals their plans to Kor, a Kulku sympathetic to humanity's plight, but unwilling to sacrifice his own race. Kor lands a strike team at the observatory to stop the resistance and Chase uses the opportunity to board Kor's ship and force him to fly him to the Kulku mothership to rescue Heather. There, they discover that Jal has slaughtered the other Kulku and plans to return to the Kulku homeworld a hero with Heather. Jal mortally wounds Kor and battles Chase after he frees Heather. Thanks to a distraction by Heather, Chase gains the upper hand and kills Jal, but they are confronted by a dying Kor who tries to detonate the Raeg in order to save his own species. At the observatory all but two of the Kulku and one of the resistance are killed. The weapon is finally ready to be fired, but the two remaining Kulku nearly kill Blair before General Skylar and his men show up and finish them off, allowing Blair to fire the weapon and destroy the Raeg at the last moment. Kor's wound finally catches up to him and he collapses and Heather finishes him off in revenge for what the Kulku did to the people of Earth. Chase manages to fly a Kulku shuttle back to the observatory where the two reunite with Blair and General Skylar. A newsbroadcast at the end reveals that nearly eight million people died as a result of the Kulku invasion and the world is now left to recover while the Kulku presumably die out of the virus on their homeworld.

There is a stone plaque with a crest above the manor entrance. Next to the stall belonging to the castle is a well with an inscription stating that it was installed in 1591. Ownership of the manor was later assumed by the Austrian Empire, which in turn deeded it to the Raƒçiƒç family for its services during its war against the Republic of Venice. The castle was nationalized after the Second World War. A tree-lined avenue formerly stood along the route from Dolsko to the manor, with heritage cultivars of pears on the right and apples on the left. It was cut down in the 1950s. The avenue was replanted with linden trees in 2012.≈Ωerjavov grad, cerkev sv. Helene, dr. Janez Jane≈æ, Drevored. Signboard in Kamnica.

He previously practised as a barrister and was a member of the first Eccentric Club in London, England. Background Charles Meredith Born at Dublin, May 9, 1809, the son of John Meredith (1784‚Äì1866), a lawyer who divided his time between Dublin and Fair View, near Avoca. Co. Wicklow; \\"a jolly looking, grey haired, hook nosed old gentleman (with a) good humoured face beaming with kindness\\". His mother, Magdalene (1785‚Äì1851), was the eldest daughter of John Redmond (1737‚Äì1819) J.P., of Newtown House, Co. Wexford & Charlemont Street, Dublin, by his wife, Anne (1743‚Äì1821), daughter and co-heiress of John Walsingham Cooke of Cookestown (otherwise Sleanagrane), Co. Wexford, who was the last male descendant of Sir Richard Cooke, Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland.Biography of Gabriel Rice Redmond (b.1763) in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps, 1911 His father's Anglo-Irish family had lived at Templerany House in Co. Wicklow since the late 17th century, while his mother's Catholic family were of ancient Norman-Irish stock, originally seated at Redmond Hall (renamed Loftus Hall), and after its confiscation, Killygowan, also in County Wexford. On his mother's side, his cousins included John Edward Redmond (1806-1865) M.P., the first of a famous Irish political dynasty; John Henry O'Byrne Redmond (1825‚Äì1866) of Killoughter, County Wicklow, created Count de Raymond of the Papal States as Chamberlain to Pope Pius IX; and, Henry Redmond, who married the only daughter of Ellen (O'Connell) FitzSimon. On his father's side he was a cousin of Sir James Creed Meredith, Chief Justice Sir William Collis Meredith and Edmund Allen Meredith. With the last two named, they headed three of the four branches of this notable family in Canada. Dublin and London From 1819 to 1823, Meredith was educated at 'Hamilton's school' before attending Dr Behan's (or Behane's) with other members of his family in Co. Wexford. On November 7, 1825, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, coming 13th in the entry examinations out of 109 candidates. In 1828, he was admitted to King's Inns, Dublin. He graduated with a B.A. in 1830 and spent that summer in London. Returning to London the following year (1831), he was admitted as a barrister to Gray's Inn and became a member of the first Eccentric Club at May's Buildings on St Martin's Lane. A few weeks after taking up lodgings in Soho, Meredith was brought before the Old Bailey as a witness to a robbery that took place there. The accused, a young servant by the name of Ann Hyde, attempted to implicate the new lodger - Meredith - as the thief of several rubies and emeralds. A constable was sent for him and his rooms and person were searched but nothing was found. Still insistent of Meredith's guilt, Miss Hyde then tried to place a ruby in Meredith's sitting room but was thwarted in her attempt to frame him by the landlord and brought to court. She was found guilty, but the jury spared her from the death penalty due to her landlord having not taken enough care to lock his valuables away. Marriage On July 3, 1831, a couple of months after his unpleasant appearance at the Old Bailey, Meredith sailed back to Dublin. Two weeks later (July 16), one of their children recorded that 'my father and mother sailed for Liverpool' from Dublin, but this seems unlikely as they were not yet married and Sarah would only have been twelve or thirteen years old. Liverpool then being a popular port for those choosing to emigrate to North America, it is possible that Meredith sailed to Canada from there, but his biographers state the year of his arrival to be 1834. His wife's family, the Peglers, came to Canada separately from Meredith and farmed across the river from him in Westminster Township, Ontario. On December 1, 1835, one year after what is generally supposed to be his arrival in Canada, John Meredith married Sarah Pegler (1819‚Äì1900), a few months after she had turned sixteen. Sarah was the daughter of Anthony Pegler (1792‚Äì1871) and Harris (1792‚Äì1873). Both her parents lived at King's Stanley, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, where the Pegler name has been found in great numbers since at least the mid sixteenth century. Her father was a farmer and butcher, and it is presumed that he was also the same Anthony Pegler of King's Stanley found in the Gloucestershire gaol register who was one of four Peglers sentenced together in 1830, though the only one not to be deported to Australia. Going by the Gloucestershire Public Records, it would seem that both Sarah's parents died in England, rather than in Canada. The Anthony Pegler with whom she lived in Canada is thought to have been Sarah's elder brother, and it is most likely that he emigrated there taking Sarah with him after their father was placed in gaol in 1830. On a visit to his cousin in 1861, the diarist Edmund Allen Meredith recorded, Bye the bye I should say that I formed a more favourable idea than I had before done of my cousin-in-law Mrs Meredith and of her eldest daughter - Mrs M., although not elegant appears sensible and a woman of some character. Annie also seems an amiable girl. Isabel was, I was told, enjoying herself very much in Ireland, and Uncle John had quite recovered from the effects of the over physicking he went through at London (England) Canada According to the London Free Press Meredith came to Canada 'seized with the wander- spirit of youth to seek his fortune farming'. Two of his first cousins, William Collis Meredith and Henry Howard Meredith (1815‚Äì1892), were then starting their legal careers in Montreal (though Henry soon after moved to Port Hope, Ontario where he rapidly became a successful land developer), but he passed them by and carried on out west. He stopped at the township of Westminster in Upper Canada, eight miles from London, Ontario, where he bought a bush farm and settled down to commence his new life. Farming did not prove to be as profitable as he had hoped, and as such soon afterwards Meredith moved the eight miles into London itself and turned his hand to business. He carefully bought land before selling it on for a profit, as well as loaning money and offering insurances to new and old settlers alike. He bought and rented out buildings on London's principal street, Dundas Street, and when the much desired position of deputy collector of customs at Port Stanley, Ontario was offered to him he readily accepted it. He also served as market clerk at London, Justice of the Peace, and finally clerk of the Division Court, a position he held until his death. * Mrs Sarah (Pegler) Meredith and one of her sons outside their house in London, c.1880 In 1846, Meredith built a substantial home for himself and his family at 565 Talbot Street, on the corner of Wellington Street and facing Victoria Park, which remained in his family for just under one hundred years before it was demolished to make way for Centennial Hall, a theatre and concert venue. The Meredith family home was described as being 'rich in cultural elements'. An article on Meredith's sons appeared in the June, 1913, edition of Maclean's magazine, which gives an account of John Meredith, > The father (JWCM), while far from being parsimonious, was a man who > understood the value of money and was exceedingly careful in handling it. He > lived simply, spent next to nothing on entertainment, joined no societies, > and kept his nose steadily to the grindstone. When he had gathered together > a little capital by the exercise of frugality, it was not difficult for him > to make it grow like the proverbial snowball. In the fifties, sixties and > seventies, what seems today an excessive rate of interest was commonly > charged on loans and Mr Meredith was not slow to collect his twenty-five per > cent on the money he advanced. He made large profits on land sold for taxes, > which he bought cheap, held and disposed of later on. When he died it was > reported that an estate valued at nearly a quarter of a million dollars was > divided among his children. The Eight London Merediths John and Sarah's daughters were said to be 'remarkable for their beauty', but all four of them died unmarried. One son, Albert Allen Meredith (1858‚Äì1863), died at a young age, but the others grew up to be collectively remembered as the Eight London Merediths, remarkable for the success they individually earned in legal, official and financial roles in London, Ontario; Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. The youngest son, Llewellyn Meredith (1860‚Äì1933) J.P., of London, Ontario, was of a more retiring disposition than his seven elder brothers, but no less distinguished in his own field. He continued his father's successful business in loans and insurance, and like him also became a Justice of the Peace. He imported horses from England and Ireland (one of his first cousins there was married to a niece of the famous Irish trainer Henry Eyre Linde J.P., of Eyrefield Lodge, on the Curragh, who Llewellyn had known well) and bred them on his farm 'Ardaven', outside London. He achieved international acclaim as a judge of thoroughbreds and twice represented Canada at the Olympia Horse Show in London, England. He was also a trustee of the Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario. ;Law Four of the eight sons had careers in law, and all four of them not only took silk, but were all offered elevation to the Bench. Two of them - Sir William Ralph Meredith and Richard Martin Meredith - went on to become chief justices for the province of Ontario. The other two - Edmund Meredith (1845‚Äì1921) and Thomas Graves Meredith - remained as Queen's Counsel's, the latter serving as City solicitor for London, Ontario. Chief Justice Sir William Collis Meredith of Quebec (father of the prominent Montreal lawyer, Frederick Edmund Meredith), was their father's first cousin. Another of their father's first cousins, Sir James Creed Meredith of Dublin, was the father of Judge James Creed Meredith. Their uncle, William Rice Meredith (1814‚Äì1888), was President of the Law Society of Ireland, and his sons (their first cousins) included: Richard Edmund Meredith P.C., Master of the Rolls in Ireland; Llewellyn Meredith (1885-1967); and Frederick Walsingham Meredith (1859‚Äì1924), also President of the Law Society of Ireland and the father of Sir Herbert Ribton Meredith, Chief Justice of the Patna High Court. ;Finance The remaining three brothers entered the financial world, the most prominent of whom was Sir Vincent Meredith, President of the Bank of Montreal. His younger brother, Charles Meredith, was President of the Montreal Stock Exchange. The third brother directly involved in finance was John Stanley Meredith (1843‚Äì1920), the number two in command (General Manager) at Canada's second largest Commercial bank, Sir Hugh Allans Merchant's Bank of Canada. Another brother, Thomas Graves Meredith, though a lawyer, was also President of Canada Life Assurance. The brother's cousins, Frederick Edmund Meredith and his elder brother, William, both served as directors of the Bank of Montreal. In Ireland, their father's uncles, Walter and John Redmond (1770‚Äì1822), founded Redmond's Bank in Wexford which was described as \\"one of the very few provincial private banks that attained a conspicuous position, had a long and successful career, and ceased, leaving a sweet savour of solvency and honourable dealing\\". ;Education Richard Martin Meredith was a founder, Chancellor and the first chairman of the board of governors for the University of Western Ontario, where he endorsed the R.M. Meredith Society. Sir William Ralph Meredith was Chancellor of the University of Toronto and Sir Vincent Meredith was a Governor of McGill University. Their father's first cousin, Edmund Allen Meredith, was the 3rd Principal of McGill University in the 1840s, and a nephew of the 29th Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, Richard MacDonnell. Their cousin, Frederick Edmund Meredith, was Chancellor of Bishop's University, and his son, William Campbell James Meredith, was Dean of the Faculty of Law at McGill University. ;Politics Unlike their father's first cousin John Edward Redmond (1806‚Äì1865) and his family, in politics the London Merediths, as a group, did not feature as prominently. Sir William Ralph Meredith was a Member of Parliament and leader of the Ontario Conservative Party. He was honorably retired after a series of electoral defeats, but later declined the invitation of Prime Minister Sir Charles Tupper to join his Cabinet. Edmund Meredith (1845‚Äì1921) was both an Alderman and Mayor of London, Ontario, but as a conservative he unsuccessfully contested for the seat of North Middlesex, Ontario. The Meredith family as a whole had a general distaste of politics and though many were encouraged to enter the political world, except for the two already mentioned, the rest declined. ;Legacy Only five of the eight Meredith brothers married. Adding to the family's wealth and influence in Canadian society, Sir Vincent Meredith married a daughter of Andrew Allan, Chairman of the Allan Line and the Merchant's Bank etc. Charles Meredith married a daughter of Richard B. Angus, co-founder of the Canadian Pacific Railway and President of the Bank of Montreal etc., and Thomas Graves Meredith married a daughter of The Hon. Sir John Carling P.C., President of the Carling Brewery etc. But, of the five brothers who married, only three of them had children, and within only one generation of the eight brothers, all of the male descendants of this family were dead. In 1916, Sir Vincent Meredith had been created the 1st Baronet of Montreal for his wartime services to Canada, but as one of the five who died without children this title became extinct on his death. The remarkable family of John Walsingham Cooke Meredith is survived today through the female descendants of Sir William Ralph Meredith. Memorials John Meredith bore an unmistakable resemblance to his mother's family, most notably seen in his cousin's grandson, John Redmond. On May 24, 1881, he died along with nearly two hundred others in the disaster that struck the Victoria steam-boat at London, Ontario. His son, Richard Martin Meredith, presented a chime of eleven church bells along with the tower clock to St. Paul's Cathedral (London, Ontario) in memory of his parents. The bells were cast in conjunction with the clock by Messrs Gillett & Johnston of Croydon, Surrey, and were first rung on Christmas Day, 1901. The inscription on the bells reads, In memory of John Walsingham Cooke Meredith, born 9 May 1809, died 24 May 1881; and Sarah, his wife, born 4 July 1819, died 12 September 1900. Along with most of his family, John and his wife were buried at the Meredith Monument at Woodlands Cemetery in London, Ontario, the plot being marked by a tall celtic cross. There are also four memorial windows to the Merediths designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany in St. Paul's which feature the names of all of Meredith's family, donated by another son, Sir Vincent Meredith, and his wife. One of the buildings at the Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario, is dedicated to his eldest daughter, Isabella Magdalene Meredith (1841‚Äì1907), and Meredith Avenue, also in London, is named after his sixth son, Thomas Graves Meredith. In Montreal, Charles Meredith House now serves as part of McGill University, named for his seventh son, and similarly, Lady Meredith House is named for the wife of his fifth son, Sir Vincent Meredith. The family is also remembered through a number of trophies, cups, scholarships and endowments donated by them.

He scored 27 victories despite being essentially one-armed. Early life and infantry service Fritz Otto Bernert was the son of a B√ºrgermeister (mayor). He was born in Ratibor, Silesia, which now is Racib√≥rz, Poland. At the time of his birth, Ratibor was German and part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Bernert was commissioned into the 173rd Infantry Regiment in 1912. He was serving with them when World War I began. He was wounded in ground combat in both November and December 1914; his fourth wound, inflicted by a bayonet, severed the major nerve in his left arm. Upon recovery, it became apparent his left arm was essentially useless, and he was invalided out of the infantry.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918, p. 70.

The fact that he wore glasses also did not bar him from service. He transferred to Kampfeinsitzerkommando Metz, a temporary grouping of pilots mostly from FFA 71, for his initial assignment to a fighter unit. By March, 1916, he had his pilot's license and was assigned to KEK Vaux.http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/other-wwi-aviation/24535-kek- vaux.html On 17 April 1916, he scored his first victory while flying a Fokker Eindecker, over a Nieuport fighter. Because KEK Vaux was an ad hoc fighter unit, it was equipped with Halberstadt D.II planes and reorganized into a full-fledged Prussian fighter squadron. It became Jagdstaffel 4 on 25 August 1916. On 6 September, Bernert scored the new squadron's first victory. He became an ace on 9 November 1916, scoring his fifth, sixth, and seventh triumphs. On 1 March 1917, he was transferred to Jagdstaffel 2. This squadron was named in honor of Oswald Boelcke, the founder of fighter aviation tactics and strategy, and was considered the premier unit of the German Air Service. Bernert scored his first victory in this unit on 19 March; on 1 April, he achieved the status of double ace with his tenth win. He scored 14 more times in April, including a record five victories on 24 April, all in a twenty- minute span, to run his total to 24. He was awarded the Pour le Merite on 24 April. On 1 May, Bernert was appointed to command Jagdstaffel 6. His final three victories came in May, with an unconfirmed 28th on 19 May. In mid-May, Bernert crashlanded behind German lines after his engine quit in mid-combat. A few days later, he landed long, ran out of airfield, and crashed next to his home aerodrome, breaking his jaw and bruising himself severely. Although unable to fly, Bernert did not give up his command. However, he did host some pilots from Austria-Hungary. On 9 June 1917, Bernert was transferred back to Jasta 2, and would command it to the end of his flying career. The previous commanding officer had scored no victories to inspire his pilots; as it turned out, because of his injuries, Bernert could do no better. However, he once again hosted several pilots from Austro-Hungary during his tenure, and thus influenced the fighter tactics of Germany's allies. He also took some leave during June and July. Bernert was severely wounded again on 18 August 1917. This wound removed him from command and kept him in the hospital for three months. It took him off flight status. He was promoted to Oberleutnant upon release from the hospital, and was transferred to Berlin as Inspector of Air. He died of the Spanish flu in his home town on 18 October 1918.

With great expansion over the years, the Department of Education moved out and on April 16, 1963 the building was renamed the Althouse College of Education. At this point the College remained only affiliated with the nearby University of Western Ontario. Turner served as Althouse College's Dean from 1965-1969. Its instruction staff consisted of a mix of veteran teacher faculty and PhD level research faculty. The College contained over 14 different departments, many for the teachable subjects (math, history, art, etc.), but also curriculum, psychology, and philosophy. In 1973, London Teacher's College (Elborn) merged with Althouse College to form the Faculty of Education at the university.

Early teacher education at Althouse required students to enrol in Philosophy, History, and Psychology as separate foundations courses. While the instructors of the latter two did not mind adjusting their purist backgrounds in history and psychology toward the educational contexts and relevance to education (History of Education; Educational Psychology), the philosophers feared that students would not receive philosophy as it should be taught because of the applied nature of education. Therefore, they did not adapt their practice to a kind of Philosophy of Education, and remained teaching purist philosophy to teacher- candidates such as logic, epistemology, and the history of modern philosophy. The students were not encouraged by this and complained the content was not relevant to their daily practice as teachers. In 1967-68, R. S. Peters, a well-known (analytical) philosopher of education from the London Institute visited Althouse College and spent several days lecturing and visiting with faculty and students. He helped change the instruction of philosophy to philosophy of education, offering several course outlines of philosophy of education courses taught at the University of London. The faculty at Althouse College also began experimenting with a new way of bringing philosophy to bear on educational practice - the teaching of philosophy of 'subjects,' e.g. philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of history, etc., but also philosophy of the elementary years for the elementary school teachers. This gave the teachers considerable foundations in the 'form of knowledge' they were tasked with instructing in the elementary and high schools, and gave them greater background in understanding their subjects to convey to their future students. The next decade, from 1967-1977, was the golden age of philosophy of education at Althouse College. When the department of philosophers of education had a member retire, they were 'promptly replaced'. Funds were plentiful and many visiting scholars were brought to the faculty to lecture and consult with faculty and students. In 1978, substantial funding issues were incurred. The philosophy of subjects method was cut and philosophy of education was consolidated and offered as a single required course in the teacher education program. Philosophy of Education faculty were also less and less replaced, their numbers diminishing. Eventually the Department of Philosophy was closed, their remaining faculty moved to the Administration and Policy Department. In 1996, Paul O'Leary, a philosopher of education who was in the faculty for 31 years, retired, leaving two philosophers of education to teach 600 students. This teaching load, especially when philosophy of education was typically taught not only with lectures in the auditorium, but also smaller seminars rooms for discussion, was 'unsustainable'.

For example, \\"No me di cuenta que hab√≠as venido\\" (\\"I didn't realize you had come\\"): compare standard \\"No me di cuenta de que hab√≠as venido\\". Que√≠smo is frowned upon by prescriptive grammar. Although the omitted preposition is typically de, other prepositions occasionally are also subject to omission by que√≠smo: \\"Insisto que te vayas\\" (\\"I insist that you go\\"); compare standard \\"Insisto en que te vayas\\". Que√≠smo may be, in some cases, a hypercorrective reaction to deque√≠smo: the insertion of de before que where it would not appear in standard Spanish, which is considered a much more serious and socially stigmatized mistake, but which is nevertheless widespread in both Peninsular and American Spanish.

It is using de que instead of que as the complementizer introducing a verbal complement clause. It can be seen as the opposite of que√≠smo, which involves using que when de que is to be used. For example, Me dijo estaba cansado (\\"He told me that he was tired\\"), is a case of deque√≠smo since the prescriptive construction is Me dijo estaba cansado. Deque√≠smo is considered peculiar to less educated speakers, most likely as an instance of hypercorrection in the attempt to avoid que√≠smo or perhaps a conflation with the reflexive use, which can sometimes be quite superficially similar: : Me alegr de que se√°is felices.

The area's \\"main drags\\" are Vestal and Conklin avenues, which, in accordance with their name, connect Binghamton with those neighbors. Due to the large differences between the east and west sections of the Southside, it is home to two neighborhood assemblies; Southside East and Southside West. Southside East Southside East can be defined as the area of the Southside of Binghamton east of Pennsylvania Avenue, stretching south and east to the Binghamton and Conklin town lines. The western section of South Side East is an urban neighborhood with blocks upon blocks of single to multiple-family dwellings. The eastern section is almost exclusively suburban in character in addition to containing some of the city's public housing developments which are composed of townhouses. The schoolchildren of the Southside East district attend Benjamin Franklin Elementary, then East Middle School. On the 2013 NY State English and Math Test scores for Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, depending upon grade, 4.2-10.8% of students met the new state standards in math and 7.2-9.5% met the new state standards in ELA. The majority of students placed in Level 1 for math and ELA. Results for East Middle School show 13.9-14.2% of students met the new state ELA standards and 6-7.6% met the math new state standards. Approximately half of the students placed in Level 1.

The Papers of Dwight D. Eisenhower: The Presidency: The Middle Way. Vol. XVI. Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University Press. 1996. p. 1786. He operated several farms that raised Angus cattle and owned the Kable News Company of Mount Morris, Illinois, a national distributor of magazines. He headed the boards of trustees of Shimer College for more than 20 years, and was also chairman of the board at Beloit College. Campbell's Mount Carroll residence, built in 1925 when he was the vice president of the Carroll County State Bank, is now part of the Mount Carroll Historic District. It was designed by architect Carroll A. Klein. Early life and education Campbell received a certificate in music from Shimer College in 1909; although it was then almost exclusively a girls' preparatory school, Shimer allowed occasional male day students. Campbell subsequently studied at Beloit College through 1913, and received a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Stanford University in 1914. On October 10 of the same year, he married fellow Stanford graduate Ileen Bullis. Career and civic life Campbell's \\"Kable News Co.\\" was listed as distributor of thirty three comic titles during the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency's investigation into a possible connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.US Congress. Senate. Committee on the Judiciary. Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency. 1955. Comic Books and Juvenile Delinquency. 84th Cong., 1st sess., S. Rept. 62. p. 48. Campbell was a friend of Holman Pettibone of Chicago, a member of the Eisenhower administration. In 1955 Pettibone arranged to have Campbell invited to a stag dinner at the White House where he met President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was invited again in 1957 for a dinner (indefinitely postponed) to be given in honor of President Ren√© Coty of France.Louis Galambos et al. The Papers of Dwight D. Eisenhower: The Presidency: Keeping the Peace. Vol. XVIII. Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001. p. 190. Eisenhower, who also had an interest in Angus cattle and who kept two herds at his farm in Gettysburg (now the Eisenhower National Historic Site), kept in contact with Campbell for the rest of the administration. Campbell was a long-time member of the boards of trustees of both his hometown alma mater Shimer College and nearby Beloit College. His service on the Shimer College board began in 1924, and he held the chairmanship for more than 20 years, from 1935 to 1956. At Beloit, he joined the board in 1938 and chaired it from 1958 to 1963. He also served as an advisor to the University of Arizona after taking up residence there later in life. A \\"Samuel J. Campbell Plaza\\" was dedicated at Beloit College in 1976.

The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996.

History The remains of a prehistoric settlement with embankments stand above the village, testifying to early settlement of the area. The remnants of a Roman building with a decorative mosaic were discovered at the Vodnik farm in 1939 while excavating the late Gothic foundations of the original church. A Roman sarcophagus was also discovered. It had been reused for an early Slavic burial and contained burial goods from the K√∂ttlach culture.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 362‚Äì363. A part-time school was established in 1899, and became a full-time school in 1929. A schoolhouse was built in 1938. During the Second World War, Partisan forces took up positions in Kri≈æevska Vas and neighboring Zagorica pri Dolskem. The Partisans retreated from the villages toward Vaƒçe when a German column approached on 18 August 1944, and evidence was collected from the school and rectory that the Partisans had been there for an extended time. Eight men from Kri≈æevska Vas and Zagorica were arrested for collaboration with the Partisans and imprisoned in Kamnik. On 24 August 1944, Russian Liberation Army troops forced the villagers from their homes and then searched and looted the houses. The people were then ordered to collect their belongings. The Russian Liberation Army forces escorted the villagers to Dolsko and then burned Kri≈æevska Vas and Zagorica. The villagers were not permitted to return home until the end of the war. Among the structures damaged in the fire was Holy Cross Church and the schoolhouse.Maƒçek, Janko. 2011. \\"Valovi nasilja v vaseh nad Sv. Heleno.\\" Zaveza 16 (22 June). Church Holy Cross Church The local church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, was first mentioned in written sources in 1526. The very first church in the village stood at a somewhat lower location, next to the Vodnik house. The current church was restored after being damaged in a fire in 1944. There is a small cemetery behind the church. The cemetery was established by the priest Anton Komlanec (1884‚Äì1966) after he was assigned to the parish.

Wrather was a founding member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. He served as Secretary-Treasurer in 1918 and as Chairman of the Research Committee from 1923 to 1933. He was a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee for the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. He also served as President of the Texas State Historical Association for seven years. In 1940, Wrather was selected General Chairman for the Dallas annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, of which he became a member in 1917 and a Fellow in 1925. In 1943, he was appointed Treasurer of the Association and he served in that capacity of 11 years. Wrather was also a First Vice President of the Geological Society of America and a President (1934) of the Society of Economic Geologists. He served as president of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers in 1948. In 1951, he was chosen to be a Life Trustee of the National Geographic Society. In 1942, Wrather came to Washington, DC to be the Assistant Chief of the Foreign Economic Administration for Metals and Minerals. In 1943, upon the retirement of Walter Curran Mendenhall, the National Academy of Sciences recommended Wrather as a potential candidate for appointment and he was selected to be the Director of the US Geological Survey. USGS career In 1943, as the Federal Government began planning for the postwar era, Director Walter Curran Mendenhall, who had served 2 years beyond then mandatory retirement age by Presidential exemption, was succeeded by William Embry Wrather. For most of his life, Wrather, a graduate of the University of Chicago who had been a Survey field assistant in 1907, had been an eminently successful consulting petroleum geologist, but when he was named Director he was Associate Chief of the Metals and Minerals Division of the Board of Economic Warfare. In the fall of 1943, Wrather was a member of the small mission sent by the Petroleum Administrator for War, Harold L. Ickes, to appraise the petroleum resources of the Middle East, and Thomas Brennan Nolan, a geologist in the Metals Section who had played a leading role in the strategic-minerals program, became Acting Director. In January 1956, after Director Wrather retired because of illness and age, Assistant Director Thomas Brennan Nolan became the US Geological Survey's seventh Director.

Free men and women, with free minds, in a free market, produce abundance and a vibrant society.\\" Hillyer received outside support from Rick Santorum, who recorded a radio ad purchased by Citizens United Political Victory Fund. He also garnered the endorsement of Citizens for the Republic, the former Ronald W. Reagan political action committee based in Alexandria, Virginia.

History  The origin of the name Doruma comes from the name Ndoromo or Ndolomo, which is the name of the Azande King who ruled the people in that area prior to the arrival of the Belgian colonialists. Doruma is known for its natural vegetations, especially its thick forests, exotic wild animals and birds. The town is a major supplier of palm oil to nearby towns; such as Ezo, Nzara and Yambio. Doruma is also known for its fragrance rice and delicious oranged-coloured mushrooms which the locals call 'Rute-Mbiro'. War During the later part of December 1990, Doruma became a hosting town for Sudanese refugees who were fleeing a civil war, which had reached the Sudanese towns of Maridi, Yambio, Ezo, and Tumbura. In 1992, the UNHCR in agreement with the Prince of Doruma and other governmental authority opened the Nambasa Refugees Camp. This camp was situated some several kilometres southward of Doruma town, and it remained opened until October 1998, when the then-rebels of Sudan, SPLA, took advantage of the war that was going on in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the time and entered both the Doruma and Dungu towns. The SPLA faced little resistance as most of the AFDL soldiers had been transported to the battle front lines such as in Kisangani and other major towns. The rebels SPLA came and told the population that the government of Congo under Laurent Desire Kabila was collaborating with the Sudanese government to transport Sudanese soldiers direct from Khartoum all the way to Dungu and Doruma in order to retake the towns that they had lost. While still in the towns, the SPLA robbed and looted the Catholic Diocese of Dungu-Doruma. They looted the diocese vehicles, motorcycles, bikes and any thing they found valuable. They also forcefully took all the refugees back with them to Sudan. Those refugees who didn't want to return to a war zone Sudan had to seek refuge again, this time in the Central African Republic. These refugees were not only under pressure from the SPLA, but they also faced harm from the Congolese population, who blamed them for being the reason why the SPLA rebels came to Doruma and Dungu. The LRA The people of Dungu and Doruma in recent times have fallen victims to Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) killing of civilians, house burning, and rape. For many years, in the Haut U√©l√© District of DR Congo, the LRA rebel group has plundered villages. Since December 2008, the Ugandan Army has supported the Congolese Army in eradicating such rebel groups. Following a strong military action from the army, rebels dispersed in the region yet continued to plunder villages in smaller numbers. This, in turn, has caused panic and sparked residents to seek refuge in the bush, a phenomenon exemplified in towns like Dungu and Doruma, or even farther south. Zande tribe refugee camp under construction outside Doruma, 2009. Since the end of December 2008, the LRA has come closer to Doruma, and its strategy shifted from the plunder of villages to kidnapping 11- to 17-year-old children to enlist as child-soldiers, to the mere massacre of local populations. 189 dead and 111 missing people have been reported before 24 December 2008, along with reports of tortured children and fires in the bush and fields, preventing the population from running away. in Portuguese In such a context, the town of Doruma, protected by the Congolese and Ugandan armies, and normally hosting around 6,000 inhabitants, came to host in one month more than 17,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from neighbouring locations, arriving deprived from any personal belonging.

He was educated at Florida State University and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Blankenship writes a syndicated column for newspapers in the Caribbean and his writings on reorganization of government can frequently be found on conservative web sites. He was often seen cruising the streets of Nassau in his State Department vehicle, with flags flying as an indication the safety of U.S. citizens was paramount and to those who participated in the illicit smuggling of narcotics, America was again active and effective in prosecuting those individuals. While serving in the Bahamas, Blankenship became best known for his emphasis on drug interdiction. Under his leadership, a record amounts of cocaine were seized and more drug smugglers extradited to the United States than in the entire relationship between the Bahamas and United States. Notable in his efforts was the added use of electronic intelligence gathering and small guerrilla actions against the cartels, which the US Coast Guard in joint efforts with the DEA had been practicing for some time ineffectively. Blankenship could often be found in the producing countries of South America coordinating operations, in the jungles or on isolated islands with law enforcement authorities. He was referred to as the \\"no nonsense diplomat\\" by the Nassau Tribune after exposing a ten-year cover-up of a Royal Bahamian Defense Force theft of cocaine used in an undercover operation. Some Mexican Government officials believe the smuggling routes thru Mexico were established because of the increased emphasis Blankenship brought to interdiction efforts in the Caribbean. It is thought Global Policy Advisers is currently involved with interdiction efforts of governments in the Caribbean and South America. It is known Global Policy Advisers has clients in Mexico and is conducting intelligence gathering, according to Mexican Police Authorities. Blankenship, located in Mexico City, would neither confirm or deny any information about Global Policy Advisers' clients. Ambassador Blankenship is also listed as the Managing Director of The Policy Advisers, a partnership providing foreign policy advice to U.S. clients.

Football careerWest Ham United= Born in Wapping, London, Shea played for the Builders Arms pub in Stratford, as well as other local teams Pearl United and Manor Park Albion, when he was discovered by West Ham United boss Charlie Paynter. He joined the Hammers in 1907, making his debut as an amateur against Norwich City in a December Southern League game. He was the club's top scorer for four consecutive seasons between 1908 and 1912, His 15 Southern League goals in were enough to record a fifth season as the club's top league scorer in 1912‚Äì13; a recently rerecruited George Hilsdon claimed the main honour with his four FA Cup goals taking him to 17 in all competitions. Now favoured to Billy Grassam, the 1908‚Äì09 season saw 20 goals in 49 appearances, including all four in a game against Plymouth Argyle, and a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì2 win over Swindon Town. His best was yet to come though; in the 1909‚Äì10 season, Shea scored 31 goals in 43 appearances. The following season, he managed 28 goals in 39 appearances, including four against Southend United on 31 December 1910. He scored twice in an FA Cup game against Nottingham Forest on 14 January 1911, although he admitted afterwards that he had taken full advantage of the dense fog: \\"I punched both goals into the net in full view of several opponents\\". In 1911‚Äì12, Shea managed another two hat-tricks ‚Äì against Brentford in a 7‚Äì4 win on 21 October 1911, and Norwich City in a 4‚Äì0 win on 5 April 1912 ‚Äì to make it 24 goals in 41 appearances that season. He formed a great partnership with Fred Harrison and together they scored 40 goals in the season. As Shea's stock continued to rise, other clubs could not fail to notice the qualities of the skilful ball player and prolific scorer, and he was described by one football writer as having an \\"uncanny ability to pass to himself\\". He transferred to Blackburn Rovers halfway through the 1912‚Äì13 season for a then-record fee of ¬£2000. Despite this, he still managed to appear as the east London club's top scorer for that season, totalling 15 goals in 15 league and cup games. =Blackburn Rovers= His time at Blackburn was interrupted by World War I, but he scored regularly and his 27 goals (together with Eddie Latheron's 13) in 1913‚Äì14 helped the club win the Football League Division One championship that season. He also gained two caps for England and represented the Football League while at the club. During the war, he returned to West Ham and made 73 London Combination appearances for the club and scored a total of 63 goals, including a run of 32 goals in 32 appearances. He also played for Birmingham and Fulham, where he scored 19 goals in 36 games. In January 1919, he made one appearance for Celtic and so renowned was Shea that Patsy Gallacher was moved to outside-right to accommodate him. He also appeared for Nottingham Forest, where he was part of the team that beat Everton 1‚Äì0 on 17 May 1919 in the second leg of the Victory Shield, contested between the winners of the Lancashire and Midland sections of the Football League. After the War, Shea continued to play for Blackburn until 1920 and gained a further two England caps in Victory International games against Scotland. =Later career= He then returned for another spell at Upton Park, but only managed 16 appearances and one goal before moving to Fulham, where he scored 24 in 107 league and cup appearances. Teammate Peter Gavigan once said of him: \\"At Fulham in 1920‚Äì21, I had as my inside-right one of the greatest ball artists who has ever played for England ‚Äì Danny Shea. His manipulation was bewildering. He was the Prince of Partners', the intellectual footballer\\". He went on to play for Coventry City and spent two seasons at Clapton Orient, before signing for Kent League club Sheppey United in October 1926. Later life and coaching career After his retirement, Shea worked as a docker and, in 1927, was working as a publican with his sister in Wapping. On 13 August 1928, he joined Swiss club Winterthur as coach, returning to England to join Woking as a trainer on 26 September 1929. He later ran a sub- post office in West Ham.

It also widened the range of tasks the Army's helicopters could be used for. However, it also created an arbitrary 5,000 pound weight restriction limit on the Army's ability to fly fixed-wing aircraft.

With the Air Force's natural inclination towards Air Superiority and Strategic (i.e., nuclear) priorities, the Army wanted some air capabilities of its own. However, this would mean the duplication of some resources between the Army and Air Force. Eventually there was a meetingA half-paragraph mention ...

The United States Air Force by Richard Irving Wolf, p. 241. that was not able to resolve issues as the 4 November 1952 MOU did. This MOU built upon the Key West Agreement.More authoritative that William's book, but also a more 'dry' read ... The United States Air Force by Richard Irving Wolf, p. 151. The agreement The agreement read: Consequences Some people credit this agreement for freeing the Army to develop the helicopter-based United States Army Aviation Branch established in 1983. From 1942 until 1983, Army Aviation assets were controlled by \\"proponent branches\\" based on aircraft and unit type. Beginning in 1942, when the Army Air Corps was re-designated as the Army Air Forces, light, single-engine airplanes were retained by the Army Ground Forces, and designated as \\"liaison\\" aircraft assigned to artillery units. As helicopters were introduced into Army aviation, cargo helicopters became under the proponency of the Transportation Corps, and eventually there were units of assault helicopters (Infantry Branch), attack helicopters and observation/scout helicopters (Armor Branch), \\"aerial rocket artillery\\" attack helicopters (Field Artillery Branch), observation/reconnaissance airplanes (Military Intelligence Branch), aerial medical evacuation units (Medical Service Corps), and signals/electronic intelligence airplanes (Signal Corps). Prior to 1983 potential Army Aviators were commissioned into a \\"basic branch\\" (i.e., Infantry Armor, Field Artillery, etc.), completed that branches' officer basic course, and subsequently requested orders to flight training (usually after at least one year of \\"branch qualifying\\" service in a unit of that basic branch). Upon designation as an Army Aviator, the new pilot was usually assigned to a unit under his \\"owning\\" branches' proponency, completed any required aircraft transition training, and began his service in Army Aviation. Warrant officer aviators were appointed into the Army \\"at large\\" (i.e., without specific branch designation). However, the career management was under the cognizance of the Army Warrant Officer Aviation Branch, which was a purely administrative branch with no distinctive branch insignia, aircraft or tactical units under its proponency. (until 2004 all Army warrant officers wore the Warrant Officer Branch insignia of a spread eagle and wreath design). Other people blame this agreement for allowing the Air Force to ignore the needs of (Air to) Ground Support, other than the A-10 Thunderbolt II or Warthog.One consequence of the MOU was a lack of enthusiasm for Close air support alternatives such as the (two-seat) N/AW A-10B Warthog: tankkiller's page with a few pictures of the N/AW A-10B Warthog and aircraftresourcecenter's page with a lot more pictures of the N/AW A-10B Warthog. The Air Force had tried to retire and/or transfer to the Reserves its entire A-10 fleet, replacing them with the F-16 Fighting Falcon, just before the First Gulf War. The First Gulf War proved the value of the A-10 in the Close Air Support (CAS) role, while also showing the limitations of the F-16 as a CAS aircraft.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The courthouse is the second building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History The first courthouse for Tama County was a two- story frame structure built in 1854 for $1,300. The present courthouse is a Victorian Romanesque style building completed in 1866. It was designed by W.R. Parsons & Son. P.B. McCullough of Toledo won the contract to build the building, however their bid was artificially low and they could not afford to complete it. H.B. Belton completed construction. The final construction cost was $22,000, but the county had accepted a $5,000 bid and that is what they paid. Architecture The courthouse is a two-story structure composed of red bricks and stone. The main facade features a large stone arch with a recessed entry. A large square clock tower rises in the middle of the same facade and it is capped with a pyramid roof. The belfry can be reached from a stairway on the second floor. The foundation is rusticated stone while the roof is corrugated iron. Gable ends rise above the roofline at various places around the building. The significance of the courthouse is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of Toledo as the county seat.

He was created by Rune Andr√©asson. Pellefant's first appearance was in Andr√©asson's book Pellefant i Gottlandet (\\"Pellefant in Candyland\\"), which was written in the 1940s, but first published in 1954. Pellefant got his own comic book series from 1965 to 1993, although Andr√©asson very early left both illustration and scriptwriting over to others, first to G√∂sta Gummesson and the Dane Gil Johansen, and also Georges Bess during his stay in Sweden. Pellefant has appeared in Finland in the 1980s and 1990s in his own comic book series, and also for a short time in the Bamse comic book.Pellefant was published in India in the early Eighties, translated to English as 'Appu the Pellephant'. The series was short-lived. Characters ; Pellefant : A small blue elephant, headstrong and priggish, somewhat like Karlsson-on-the-Roof. His way of often acting first and thinking later often leads Pellefant into difficult situations, which he always fails to realise, because he views himself as the best in the world. But his loud, trumpetous voice often helps him deal with the difficult situations. ; Pip : A small mouse who is Pellefant's best friend and often saves him from difficult situations, like Jiminy Cricket. ; Filur : Originally a small and evil wizard who often failed in his magic. After Gil Johansen took over scriptwriting, Filur became nicer and nicer, eventually becoming a bickering friend of Pellefant and Pip, or occasionally even a genuine friend. ; The liquorice troll : A large and slow- witted figure with black fur, who often causes mischief. He is Filur's companion but is often heavily exploited by him. ; Other toys : Pellefant and Pip live in a house together with a handful of other toy figures, including a cowboy doll, an Indian doll, a girl doll and a toy dog, among others.

Development The design of the P-14 2D early warning radar started in 1955 by decree of the CPSU Central Committee. The P-14 being the first high power VHF radar to be developed by the Soviet Union, the radar was accepted into service in 1959 following the successful completion of the radars test program. The P-14 was developed under the direction of V.I. Ovsyannikov by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V.I.Lenin, the predecessor of the current Nizhny Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT). The development team was awarded the Lenin prize by the Soviet Union in 1960 for the development of the P-14 radar. The P-14 was exported and is occasionally still found in service, several companies have offered upgrade options for the system, including replacement of outdated components with modern systems, such as digital MTI, modern PC based signal processing/display and solid state components. The P-14 was superseded by the 55G6 \\"Nebo\\" VHF surveillance radar in 1982. Description The P-14 was produced in three variants: the 1RL113 \\"Lena\\" (Tall King A) and 44Zh6 \\"Furgon\\" (Tall King B) static versions and the 5N84A \\"Oborona-14\\" (Tall King C). A total of 731 1RL113 \\"Lena\\" were manufactured between 1959 and 1976, 24 of which were for export. The 1RL113 static site was contained in two building (radar and generator) with the control cabin (operated by a crew of five) situated up to one kilometer away, the 44ZH6 operated in a similar fashion but could be relocated more easily. The 5–ù84A mobile version featured a folding antenna and transported on six trailers taking over 24 hours to assemble, the radar's control trailer had a crew of six and could be located up to one kilometer from the radar. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-14, either the NRS-12 or the later 1L22 \\"Parol\\". All of the P-14 variants were developed for the long-range detection and tracking of aerial targets and had similar performance characteristics between them. All used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception; the antenna was a large open- frame truncated parabolic antenna, the antenna included a heated de-icing system for extreme conditions. The radars ware capable of modulating their frequency around four pre-set frequencies to counteract active interference and used automatic coherent-compensation for passive interference; both systems able to suppress interference by up to 20 dB. In addition to jammer suppression the P-14 can use five auxiliary antennae for direction finding to locate the jammer. The P-14 can operate in four different modes: high beam with increased upper detection limit, low beam with increased range at low to medium altitudes and scan which alternates between high and low beam modes. Variants P-14MA/5H84AMAP-14MA/5H84AMA on LiTak-Tak site ‚Äì ground-based long-range VHF surveillance radar P-180U is offered as the modernized follow- on to its prototype, the analogue P-14. Produced in LiTak-TakAbout LiTak-Tak (Lithuania). Modernization of early-warning VHF radar 5N84A (5N84, 44Zh6 or P-14) offers the best (in terms of efficiency/cost ratio) alternative to restoration or repair of legacy prototypes. Modernization of 5N84A features: *metric band for \\"counter-Stealth\\" capability; *maximum use of COTS components; *option of containerized solution (two 20 ft ISO); *stable, fail- soft, modular solid-state transmitter; *built-in test equipment; *no special adjustments required during operation; *largely simplified maintenance; *engineered for minimum cost of ownership. As a result of modernization the radar's detection performance is efficiently improved. Modernized radar features automatic tracking capability as well as data receiving from other radar sensors. Data can be exchanged over a variety of communication channels in approved format. Operators The P-14 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1959 and has long since become obsolete being replaced in service by the 55G6 Nebo VHF radar.

Etymology The name is recorded in three variants by Jordanes, and an additional two by copyists: Balaber, Balamber, Balamur, Balambyr, Balamir. Balaber with omission of -m- may be a corruption of Balamber. Balamir has the Gothic onomastic suffix -mir/-mer. Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen argued that the original form of the name was Balimber and that its meaning is unknown. Omeljan Pritsak considered Balamur as the only original Hunnic form of the name. He derived it from a word akin to Mongolian , , (savage, wild, venturous, daring). Pristak thus reconstructs the name as coming from bala + mur, meaning \\"the greatest among the venturous, daring\\". Hyun Jin Kim argues that the name is simply a corruption of the name Valamir, who he argues to have been the basis of the figure in Jordanes. Kim notes that Valamir was written ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ∑œÅ (Balam√™r) in Greek. He argues that the name is of uncertain meaning but \\"seems to have an eastern origin\\" and suggests a connection to a city in Central Asia called Balaam (ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ¨Œº). History Jordanes recounts: Those events were preceded by the Huns' attack on the Alans at the Don River, who bordered the Greuthungi, and according to Ammianus Marcellinus, occurred an alliance between them. The events and names which followed vary according to Ammianus and Cassiodorus (from whose Gothic History was summarized Getica): Ammianus wrote that after death of Ermanaric in 375, Vithimiris became the king of the Greuthungi, he resisted the Huns and Alans, but was killed in battle and was succeeded by young son Videric, so they were ruled by duces Alatheus and Safrax. They managed to make a confederation of Greuthungi, Alans and Huns, who escaped from the majority of Huns, crossed the Danube in 376, and fought Battle of Adrianople in 378. Cassiodorus, i.e. Jordanes recounts that after Ermanaric's death Goths separated in Western Visigoths and Eastern Ostrogoths, the latter remained in \\"their old Scythian settlements\\" under Hunnic rule. The Amal Vinitharius retained the \\"insignia of his princely rank\\", and trying to escape from the Huns, he invaded the lands of the Antes and their king Boz for merely one year, but Balamber put an end to Ostrogoths independence. After the subjection, followed more complex Ostrogoths royal descending; Ermanaric > Hunimund-Thorismund-Berimud moved with his son Videric with the Visigoths to the West because \\"despised the Ostrogoths for their subjection to the Huns\\". Then happened forty years of interregnum and Ostrogoths decided to give the rule to Vandalaris's son Valamir, a relative of Thorismund. Valamir eventually deserted Attila's sons in c. 454. Herwig Wolfram argued the possibility that unknown river Erac could be identified with the river Phasis in Lazica. Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen denied the connection with ancient Erax, and considered Tiligul or lower Dnieper. Wolfram puts the geographical location of events after the battle in 376, in Scythia, but the term shifted more westward and actually meant Dacia and Pannonia. Maenchen- Helfen considered that Cassiodorus would not admit that the Gothic princess Vadamerca became a wife of Balamber if he was not some sort of a king. Wolfram argued that although scholars often identify \\"Vithimiris\\" with Vinitharius, and \\"Videric\\" with Vandalarius, onomatological and genealogical methods do not go along with historical events, and many difficulties arise. One of them was that Balamber lived in the time of Valamir. However, although of similar etymological names, Balamber, Wolfram related to Iranian Balimber, and as such considered them two different personalities. A number of scholars such as Edward Arthur Thompson, Hyun-Jin Kim, and Peter Heather consider Balamber's story historically improbable, and he may be a version of the better-attested Valamir, or was an invention by the Goths to explain who defeated them.

He was regarded as a saint already during his lifetime. His feast day is celebrated on May 1. Life Saint Nikephoros was a hieromonk born around 1750 in the town of Kardamyla, in the northeastern part of the Aegean island of Chios. As a child he fell seriously ill with a contagious disease. His parents vowed that if he survived he would be given as a monk to the monastery of Nea Moni. He recovered from his illness and became a monk, studying at the famous Chiote school. His mentors included Father Neophytus Kafsokalyvitis,A Jew who became an Athonite monk and later a director of the Chiote School. Father Athanasius of Paros and Saint Macarius of Corinth.Saint Macarius of Corinth had the greatest influence on Nikephoros. He was ordained and elected an abbot of Nea Moni.He resigned before his two- year term ended because he did not like handling the estate's finances and spiritual matters as his actions were met with resistance by the monks of the monastery. Although Saint Nikephoros probably died in the summer of 1821, his Feast Day is designated as May 1. He died in a home near the church of Saint Paraskeve, where he sometimes stayed overnight when he was unable to return to Resta, a hermitage where he lived after leaving the monastery. His body was brought to Resta and placed in a grave where both Saint Athanasius Parius and the monk Nilus had once been buried. The holy relics of Saint Nikephoros were uncovered in 1845 and brought to the metropolitan church of Chios. Many years later, the Guild of Tanners asked for the relics and placed them in the Church of Saint George in Resta, where they remain. In 1907, an icon of Saint Nikephoros was painted and a church service was composed in his honor.Venerable Nikephoros of Chios (OCA) He taught and wrote in Chios, leading a life of spiritual endeavor there. He loved Chios as his fatherland and as a place where piety and learning flourished. For this reason, and because no occasion arose for him to leave the island, he remained within its confines throughout his lifetime. One year after his death Chios was devastated by the Turks.

Relationships The greatest influence on his life was Saint Macarius of Corinth (April 17), whom he met even before he met Saint Athanasius. Macarius was at Chios in 1780, left for a time, then returned in 1790. Nikephoros saw Saint Macarius frequently, and learned much from him. He also met Saint Athanasius Parios (June 24), who was the director of the school in the city of Chios.

Some universities offer postgraduate degrees in general dentistry, with an emphasis on clinical research.Newcastle University - Dentistry and Dental Sciences Program details All of the programs below can be 1-year programs with an option available to continue for a second year, or they may be a two-year program from the start. They allow the new dentist to further hone his or her skills in most of the traditionally defined disciplines of dentistry while at the same time increasing one's speed and refining one's techniques. These programs also afford trainees the opportunity to learn from the attending dentists who serve a supervisory role, something generally unavailable in private practice. =AEGD= While a GPR is a hospital-based program, an AEGD is usually not and the differences between the two types of programs are generally a result of this distinction.What is the difference between a GPR and an AEGD? AEGDs are usually based in postgraduate dental school clinics. Both types of programs afford the trainee with a larger patient pool than he or she was exposed to in dental school as an undergraduate; while dental students will typically treat 2 or 3 patients a day in multiple-hour-long sessions, these postgraduate programs are constructed so that trainees may see anywhere from 8-15 patients a day, or even more. They emphasize restorative dentistry, fixed and removable prosthodontics, orofacial pain, and dental implants. =DO/GDR= Both DO and GDR programs are 1-year long commitments and are usually based in a hospital setting. These programs provide a dentist with a wide range of experiences including oral surgery, oral pathology, oral medicine, and treating medically compromised patients. =GPR= Programs will often emphasize the importance of managing comprehensive dental treatment plans and adjusting them based on the patient's medical condition. During training, residents may be faced with the task of managing patients that require dentistry in a hospital setting due to a compromised medical condition. Medical management of dental patients may be emphasized in weekly grand rounds and rotations through anesthesia, internal medicine, and the hospital emergency department. Some programs also provide rotations in family medicine and otolaryngology. These rotations not only increase the trainee's knowledge and experience, but also allow physicians, resident or attending, to see how dentistry and medicine are related, permitting a better referral relationship in future practices. This relationship is best demonstrated in tumor boards where both medical and dental residents discuss and treatment plan head and neck cancer patients. GPR residents may also become familiar with performing dental/oral surgical procedures in the operating room and managing the patient's stay while in the hospital. Rotation through the dental specialties increases the resident's ability to handle situations in private practice without referral to a specialist. =GradDipClinDent= These programs are usually 1-year in length and are designed very similar in structure to an AEGD program. Emphasis is placed on restorative dentistry, fixed prosthodontics, removable prosthodontics, orofacial pain, and dental implants. Friday, 4 October 2019 =SEGD= Emphasis is on enhanced general practice skills to allow for broader patient care to underserviced areas. Clinical experience is usually obtained from the residency clinic in the department of dentistry, and during rotations including off site rural experience. =Multidisciplinary training program= The goal of the program is to provide the recent dental graduate with a broad multidisciplinary approach to the clinical practice of dentistry. The postgraduate trainees are thus under the constant supervision and guidance of members of the attending staff. Experience is gained in general practice and specialties. The specialties represented are: Endodontics, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orthodontics, Periodontics, Prosthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry. In general, GPR, DO/GDR, and MPT programs pay higher stipends than do AEGD, SEGD, and GradDipClinDent programs; this is because the former residents take call and answer consults.

This is the same village in which St. Markella was martyred in 1462. The Church celebrates her memory on October 20, and the finding of her head on July 15. Life Saint Matrona was born in the village of Volissos on Chios sometime in the fourteenth century. Her parents, Leon and Anna, were highly respected and well-to-do Christians. Mary was the youngest of seven children. From her youth, she showed an interest in monasticism. When the time came for her parents to arrange her marriage, she refused because she wanted to remain a virgin. To avoid this marriage, she left Volissos and went to an area overlooking the village, called Katavasis. Here she began her spiritual struggle by fasting and prayer. Soon other nuns joined her.'St. Matrona of Chios\\", Anthiochian Orthodox Christian Church of North America Her parents searched everywhere to find her. After locating her, they convinced her to return home. Mary complied with her parents' wishes, except for one--she refused to wed. Her parents, seeing that she still desired to lead a monastic life, gave her their consent to pursue her ambition. When Mary's parents died, she distributed the farmland she inherited among her sisters and the orphans of the community. She left Volissos and returned to Katavasis. Her food was simple and brought to her by one of her sisters. After three years she left Katavasis and went to the capital of the island, where there were many women's monasteries.Dedoussis, Christina, \\"Voice in the wilderness\\", Some Saints and Feasts of the Orthodox Christian Church Upon visiting the different monasteries, Mary found a small secluded one consisting of three nuns: a mother and her two daughters. The nuns, realizing her sincerity, immediately welcomed her into their home. At this point Mary's name was changed to St. Matrona. (When a nun reaches a high point in her monastic life and becomes a Stavrophore, a new name is bestowed upon her, symbolizing a second baptism and a new way of life). St. Matrona surpassed the other nuns in her devotion, spirituality, and understanding. Her sincerity convinced other girls to come to this monastery and lead the same type of life. The church itself was small, and so the abbess agreed with St. Matrona's plan to enlarge it and to build cells for the nuns. Any remaining farmland and personal belongings St. Matrona sold, and the monastery built a public bath with the money received from this sale so that the poor and wayfarers could bathe. These baths were very common at this time. After this, the renovation of the church began. When the church was completed (with the help of St. Artemios, to whom it was dedicated), the abbess of the monastery died. The nuns then elected St. Matrona as the new abbess. She showed charity to the poor, and was able to heal the sick. After the Genoese conquered the island of Chios, they plundered the island and the monasteries, including the monastery of St. Matrona. When one of these foreigners attempted to attack the nuns of the monastery, the saint prayed for divine help. From the heavens bolts of lightning fell to the ground, killing the assailant. The foreigners, seeing the destruction, fled from the island in fear. After these events, St. Matrona dreamt of her own death. She suffered from an illness for seven days. In the seven days she advised the other nuns as a mother would advise her children. She received Holy Communion sometime before 1455. She was buried in the monastery's church, in which she had spent the greater part of her life. To honor this great saint, Miracles are said to have occurred after her death. Many people with all manner of afflictions came to the church and were cured. In the village of Katavasis, there was a church built to honor the place where St. Matrona had first started her spiritual struggles. Later, a larger church was built and the smaller one was used as a cemetery chapel. Monastery of St. Matrona The Holy Monastery of St. Matrona was built by the noble Roidis in 1470 near the village of Mesa Didima. He originally intended to build a summer villa; however, St. Matrona appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to build the monastery instead.\\"St. Matrona\\", Discover Chios His sisters were the first two nuns to enter the monastery. The abbot of the monastery during the Turkish Occupation was the Holy Nikephoros of Chios. Nikiforos wrote the 24 Hymns of Agia Matrona. Today, four nuns dwell in the monastery. The monastery celebrates the saint's feast day on October 20 each year.

Criticism PropertyGuys.com's 2008 national radio advertising campaign, which singled out \\"Joe Schmo\\" real estate agents, was found to be offensive by some real estate agents for its dismissive portrayal of an agent's role in real estate transactions.

She joined National Public Radio (NPR) in 1977 and worked, variously, as the network's arts producer, sports director, features reporter and garden expert. From 2000 through 2008, she was senior correspondent for the NPR program Morning Edition. At the end of that year, due to cutbacks at the network, Levine was laid off, while working on a documentary series about Americans coping with economic stress and job loss. Her final NPR broadcast was about how she, herself, had just lost her job. Broadcast career Levine's academic background was in music and communications. Her first job in broadcasting was at the full-time, non-commercial classical music station WMHT-FM in Schenectady, NY. She moved to Washington, D.C. in 1977 to work at NPR, where she produced the arts magazine, Voices in the Wind. In 1979, she became part of the original staff of Morning Edition, where she remained until moving to London to report for the BBC World Service. While abroad, she also freelanced for NPR, CNN and the BBC domestic service. She returned to NPR full-time as its arts reporter in 1986. In 1990, she took up studies in horticulture, began her own landscape and design business, and in 1992 became NPR's horticultural reporter, the \\"Doyenne of Dirt\\", broadcasting for the next ten years on NPR's Weekend Edition with Scott Simon. During this time she was also a contributing writer for Horticulture Magazine, a features writer for Martha Stewart Living and a contributing writer for The Oregonian. In 2000, she published 'Plant This!' (Sasquatch Books, 2000). In 2000, Levine became a senior correspondent for Morning Edition. In 2007, she expanded her horticultural reporting with the year-long special program, \\"Climate Connections\\". She also produced and reported for the series, \\"Take Two: People Reinventing Themselves Through Their Work\\", and at the time of her dismissal, was producing and writing a series documenting the effects of the economic crisis, \\"American Moxie: How We Get By\\". Levine's career with NPR ended on an ironic note when she was one of 64 people laid off in December 2008, as she was producing the \\"American Moxie\\" series. In her last series installment, she reported about her own layoff. Horticultural career Levine studied at the George Washington U School of Landscape Design. She began her own business, Hortus Landscaping, in 1991, then later began a career writing about horticulture, botanizing, and lecturing for garden clubs, botanic gardens and arboretums. After moving to Portland, OR in 1996, she became the northwest regional correspondent for Horticulture Magazine and a contributing editor for The Oregonian. Her newspaper plant profiles were published in the book, Plant This! (Sasquatch Books, 2000). Levine's own garden has been featured in several magazines, including Portland Monthly. A profile of Levine and her garden was published in the February 2011 issue of Sunset Magazine. Animal rescue Following her layoff from NPR, Levine pursued a lifelong interest in animal welfare. She began writing for the Humane Society of the United States and working for the Portland office of In Defense of Animals (IDA). In September 2010, she became the volunteer creative and communications director for The Animal Rescue Association of the Americas, the first professional association for animal rescue groups. she was in Ecuador pursuing local animal rescue efforts.

American Airlines Flight 77 According to U.S. State Department cable of February 2010, released by WikiLeaks in 2011, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori, who had associated with three Qatari citizens who had flown from Washington to London on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the World Trade Center and the White House. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the information about the four men was \\"just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges\\". An official added, however, that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. Eleanor Hill, the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways. The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on Sept. 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day, but did instead fly from Los Angeles to Qatar, via London.

A connection between the two networks allows access for engineering purposes. The Metro was constructed between 2005 and 2007 at cost of ‚Ç¨312 million. Line M1 terminates at UIB University of the Balearic Islands station, with services from Palma calling at seven intermediate stops in the city's northern suburbs. Line M2 runs east alongside the main line and serves seven intermediate stations before terminating at the suburban station of Marratx√≠. On both routes trains operate daily from approximately 0630 to 2200, with a 15-minute service during the day; reducing to 30 minutes in the early morning, late evening and on Sundays. = Main line = Train at Inca Remote Enlla√ß station Services to Manacor and Sa Pobla via Marratx√≠ and Inca start from Platforms 5-10 at Palma Intermodal Station. This modern facility lies beneath the Parc de ses Estacions, which occupies land formerly used by the former surface level lines. The landscaped gardens contain several former railway buildings, and the original station buildings also survive alongside Pla√ßa d'Espanya. Today the main line runs below ground until just after Son Costa/Son Fortesa station. It is grade separated along its entire length, aside from some very minor level crossings in remote rural areas. The section from El Ca√ºlls (Festival Park) to Inca offers excellent views of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range to the north. The line is double-track from the capital to the remote halt at Enlla√ß, where the branches to Manacor and Sa Pobla diverge. The line to Manacor has passing places at Sineu and Petra, but the shorter Sa Pobla branch is single track throughout. Between 0545 and 2320 there are two trains each hour in each direction alternatively providing connections to the two eastern termini, whilst a third service operates only as far as Inca. From Monday to Saturday in 2013, Manacor trains operated non-stop as far as Marratx√≠. On Sundays and public holidays, only two trains per hour operate in each direction, providing stops at all stations to Manacor or Sa Pobla. In the 2017 timetable, four-car electric trains ran every half-hour between Palma and Enllac, with two-car diesel unit connections alternatively on the non- electrified branches to/from Sa Pobla and Manacor. A few rush-hour express services were also advertised. In 2013 civil engineering work had started on the extension of the Manacor line to Art√† via Sant Lloren√ß des Cardassar and Son Servera, but work on the proposed extension of the Sa Pobla branch to Alcudia had not commenced. By May 2014, there was no indication of any such work within Manacor itself which now has a relocated terminal station, adjacent to the main covered shopping centre.

Abbotskerswell Priory, on the outskirts of the village of Abbotskerswell, near Newton Abbot, Devon, England, was the home of a community of Augustinian nuns from 1861 until 1983. It has now been converted into apartments for retired people.  Abbotsleigh House  Abbotsleigh Househttp://www.thepriorydevon.co.uk/Watts, Geoffrey E. St. Augustine‚Äôs Priory: a Short History of the Priory and Other Buildings on the Site, 1998 (Record No. 56412 - West Country Studies Library, Exeter) was built on high ground on the outskirts of Abbotskerswell during 1847-48. The land had formerly belonged to the Abbot of Sherborne. The house, with about of land, was purchased by the Catholic Church in February 1860, and became the hub around which the new Priory of St. Augustine was built. During those early days it was sometimes known as Abbots Leigh Priory. Joseph Hansom was appointed to prepare plans for buildings to accommodate 50 nuns. Hansom had recently completed work on Plymouth Cathedral, but is probably better known as the designer of Hansom Cabs. Harris, Penelope, \\"The Architectural Achievements of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall and Churches of the Gothic Revival\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, His ground plan for the whole development is still available for inspection at the Priory and, although later details were completed by Benjamin Bucknall, the general layout is as he originally planned it. The convent wing was completed by the autumn of 1861 and the new Church of the Holy Ghost was completed in autumn 1863. The east, or guest, wing and the north services wing were added during the next 20 years.  The nuns  In 1794 a group of English nuns living in St. Monica's convent in Louvain, Belgium, was driven back to England by the French Revolution. They lived in Amesbury, Wiltshire, for five years but in 1800 they moved on to Spetisbury in Dorset. Here they created a boarding school for about 40 young ladies at what became known as St. Monica's Priory. In 1861 they found their final home in Abbotskerswell at the instigation of the Bishop of Plymouth, William Vaughan. Their experiences during the revolution may explain why Hansom was instructed to build two elaborate escape tunnels at the priory. At Abbotskerswell Priory the nuns lived as an enclosed order and had very little communication with the village until about 1952. As is traditional in monasteries of this kind, local people were admitted to worship in a small side chapel which was so arranged that they could follow services being conducted in the church, but could not see the nuns. Village residents recall that during the 1960s the nuns were given more freedom to associate and to sell produce such as honey and eggs from their small farm. The particular work of the community was reparation for the sins of mankind. They prayed for the conversion of sinners and the spread of the faith, especially in England. The postulants and novices were trained in singing and reciting the Divine Office. Besides taking part in the domestic work of the community they were trained in various handicrafts according to their gifts and talents. Their time was largely devoted to religious exercises, daily Mass and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and the Divine Office in Choir, the sisters each taking their appointed watch, day and night.Rhodes, A.J., Newton Abbot ‚Äì Its History and Development, 1905 (Newton Abbot Local History Library, Class 942.35) Among the relics which were preserved at the Priory was the hair shirt of Sir Thomas More, presented for safe keeping by Margaret Clements (1508‚Äì1570), his adopted daughter.Catholic Encyclopaedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14689c.htm It is now in the custody of Buckfast Abbey, near Buckfastleigh in Devon.http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2016/st-thomas-mores- hair-shirt-now-enshrined-for-public-veneration.cfm  Redevelopment  By the 1960s the buildings had started to fall into disrepair and the number of nuns slowly declined, the last three departing in March 1983. In 1985 a local company, Clennon Developments, purchased the property to develop as a retirement complex and the project was launched in April 1987. A second block, named Priory Court, was completed by the middle of 1991 and the small farmhouse and various outbuildings adjacent to Priory Road were converted into seven cottages by 1997, becoming known as Priory Yard. In 2011 the priory was purchased by Retirement Villages Ltd who continue to run it as a retirement complex.

History The Vilna Gaon museum was established in 1989 by the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture. Over the years, its collection has been expanded to include objects from other museums in Lithuania. The museum was renamed in 1997 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the death of the Talmudic scholar Vilna Gaon. The museum has five branches that focus on different aspects of Jewish history and culture. The Tolerance Center's collections include works of sacred, modern, and traditional art along with historical materials; The Green House is a Holocaust exhibit; the Paneriai Memorial is dedicated to the Paneriai (Ponary) Massacre; the Jacques Lipchitz Memorial Museum in Druskininkai exhibits his lithographs; and the former Tarbut Gymnasium displays the history of Lithuanian Jews in the interwar and Nazi period. The museum acquires and systematizes materials, issues publications, conducts research, organizes permanent and temporary exhibitions, and sponsors educational activities.

S. Parker Co. and Parker Brothers. Life and career Parker was born in Salem, Massachusetts.Cutter, William Richard (1908). Genealogical and Personal Memoirs Relating to the Families of Boston and Eastern Massachusetts. Lewis Historical Publishing Company Parker's philosophy deviated from the prevalent theme of board game design; he believed that games should be played for enjoyment and did not need to emphasize morals and values. He published his first game, Banking, in 1883 at the age of 16. Banking is a card game in which players borrowed money from the bank and tried to generate wealth by guessing how well they could do. The game included 160 cards which foretold their failures or successes. The game was so popular among family and friends that his brother, Charles Parker urged him to publish it. George approached two Boston publishers with the idea, but was unsuccessful. Not discouraged, he spent $40 to make 500 sets of Banking. He eventually sold all but 12 copies, making a profit of $100. Parker founded his game company, initially called the Geo. S. Parker & Company, in his town of residence Medford, Massachusetts, in 1883,Banking boxtop owned by Joseph Angiolillo and followed it up with two other games: Famous Men, another card game, and Baker's Dozen, a board game designed by one of his teachers.Famous Men and Baker's Dozen boxtops owned by Joseph Angiolillo In 1885, his family moved to Salem, where he published four more card games: The Dickens Game, Ivanhoe, Speculation, and Great Battlefields.Dickens, Ivanhoe, Great Battlefields boxtops owned by Joseph Angiolillo and Geo. S. Parker 1885 catalogue When George's brother Charles joined the business in 1888, the company's name was changed to its more familiar form. In 1898, a third brother, Edward H. Parker, joined the company. For many years, George designed most of the games himself, and wrote all the rules. Many games were based on important events of the day: Klondike was based on the Alaskan gold rush, and War in Cuba on the impending Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The game industry was growing, and the company was becoming very profitable. In 1906, Parker Brothers published the game Rook, their most successful card game to this day, and it quickly became the best- selling game in the country. During the Great Depression, a time when many companies were going out of business, Parker Brothers released a new board game called Monopoly. Although the company had originally rejected the game in 1934, they decided to publish it the next year.Monopoly Board Game - Parker Brothers It was an instant success, and the company had difficulty keeping up with demand.

He led the National Union party from 2008 to 2012, for whom he was a member of the Knesset, and is also the Executive Director of Beit El yeshiva Center Institutions and Arutz Sheva. Early life Katz was born 29 September 1951 in Jerusalem. He is a fifth-generation Eretz Hkodesh through his mother, while his father was an immigrant from Poland who came to Palestine in the 1930s. Katz graduated from the Bnei Akiva Yeshiva High School in Kfar Haroeh, and went on to study in Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav in Jerusalem. =Military career= In 1970, he enlisted in the IDF and volunteered to serve in Sayeret Shaked. He served under then OC Southern Command General Ariel Sharon in the 1971 campaign in Gaza. In 1972, he completed his officers' course with distinction, and commanded his own commando unit in Sayeret Shaked. In the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Katz served in a group of twelve reservists under the command of Amatzia Chen who carried out operations within the division of Ariel Sharon.Arutz Sheva, A war story, and its lessons, September 27, 2018. On the eighth day of the war, the force set out to locate Egyptian forces that had landed in helicopters in the deployment area to cross the Suez Canal. Katz suffered a serious injury to his left thigh as a result of the impact of an RPG rocket on his APC, and was severely wounded. It was during that period that he met his future wife Tami, a sociology student at Bar-Ilan University, who had volunteered to work in Beilinson Hospital helping nurse the worst wounded. Ya'akov \\"Ketzaleh\\" Katz (at left) with rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed in 1990 =Beit El= After six months in hospital, he returned, on crutches, to study four more years in Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav, under the tutelage of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook and Mazkir Bnei Akiva Shlomo Aviner. In 1977, he joined the group that established the Beit El settlement in the West Bank. In 1978, Katz, together with his Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, split with the Beit El group and founded a new settlement which was called Beit El B. Katz was one of the original members of the Gush Emunim movement.. =Later years= With the election of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1977, Katz, with wife and children, were among the first ten families to establish the Israeli settlement of Beit El in the northern Judean Hills surrounding Jerusalem. Katz founded the Beit-El Yeshiva Center, an educational center comprising myriad institutions with over 1,200 students: the Beit El Yeshiva and Kollel, Teachers' College, Har Brakha Hesder Yeshiva, Bnei Tzvi Yeshiva High School, Ra'aya Academy for Young Women (high school), Beit El Pre-Military Academy, as well as Arutz Sheva. =Bureaucratic life= Katz served as an assistant to Ariel Sharon when Sharon was Housing and Development Minister. Katz was involved in the absorption of olim from the former Soviet Union, and was responsible for building more than 35,000 housing units in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. These houses doubled the Jewish population beyond the Green Line. =Media= In 1987, Katz bought an oceangoing vessel upon which to set up a radio station, Arutz Sheva (Channel 7), as an alternative station with a national religious orientation. The station never received a license to broadcast. After the station was shut down, in 2002, he founded the weekly Israeli newspaper BeSheva. In 2003, he was convicted of operating an illegal radio station, and on two counts of perjury for having lied about the location of the broadcasts.Arutz Sheva senior personnel sentenced The Jerusalem Post, 30 December 2003 In 2006, President Moshe Katsav pardoned him. =Political career= In December 2008, Katz became chairman of the National Union alliance. In the 2009 elections, the party won four seats, and Katz entered the Knesset. Katz pledges to rebuild sovereign Jewish Gaza. In a March 2010 proposal to curb illegal immigration and the increase of illegal work aliens, Katz has suggested that a \\"special town\\" be created in southern Israel that would be \\"less convenient and glamorous\\" then the currently attractive city of Tel Aviv.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3866809,00.html He was the first MK to propose a Yom HaAliyah.http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish- News/Bill-seeks-to-establish-national-Aliya-Day-345758 It would later be passed as law and established as the fifth Israeli Secular Israeli holiday.

The operation was authorised by the British Commanders Committee East Africa on 30 January. The main objectives were to restore law and order in Zanzibar and to prevent the radical left-wing Umma Party from taking control of the government from the moderate Afro-Shirazi Party. The forces assigned to the operation included two aircraft carriers, three destroyers, a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, 13 helicopters, 21 transport or reconnaissance aircraft, a battalion of Foot Guards, a battalion of Royal Marines and an independent company of paratroopers. The plan was to launch a helicopter and parachute assault of Unguja, Zanzibar's main island, before proceeding to take the smaller island of Pemba. If it had been carried out, Parthenon would have been the largest British airborne and amphibious operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956. Parthenon was scrapped around the 20 February and replaced with Operation Boris.  Origins  The Zanzibar Revolution occurred on 12 January 1964 when 600‚Äì800 mainly African men led by John Okello and supported by the Afro-Shirazi and Umma Parties overthrew Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah and his largely Arab government. This resulted in civil disorder; looting of Arab-owned property; and organised killings of Arabs. The ASP, led by Abeid Karume, and the Umma Party, under Abdulrahman Mohamed Babu, formed the Revolutionary Council to govern the country. Following these events several western governments, who suspected the revolutionaries had the backing of Cuba, the People's Republic of China and other communist countries, made plans for the evacuation of their citizens. The United States carried out an evacuation of 61 of its citizens, including 16 NASA employees at a satellite tracking station, on 13 January.. Following the American evacuation the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence and that it would not intervene further. The US did, however, urge that Britain co-operate with other African Great Lakes countries to restore order on the island. RFA Hebe The first British military presence in Zanzibar was HMS Owen, a survey ship diverted from the Kenyan coast, which arrived on the evening of 12 January. The frigate HMS Rhyl and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship RFA Hebe joined Owen at Zanzibar on 15 January. The arrival of HMS Rhyl caused some concern to the revolutionary government as she carried a company of troops from the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment who had been sent to Zanzibar from Kenya due to inaccurate reports that security there was deteriorating rapidly. The Hebe exacerbated the situation as she had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombassa and was loaded with weapons and explosives; as a result the Royal Navy refused to allow representatives from the Zanzibari government on board to search the ship, prompting rumours that she was an amphibious assault vessel. These forces completed a partial evacuation of British citizens from the island on 17 January. Shortly after this HMS Rhyl was dispatched to Tanzania with the Staffordshire Regiment company to quell riots in the Tanzanian Army; HMS Owen collected a company of Gordon Highlanders to replace them. On 30 January the British Commanders Committee East Africa authorised Operation Parthenon, whose objective was to restore law and order in Zanzibar should the Revolutionary Council fail to do so. Specifically there was a concern that the radical left-wing Umma Party, supported by Okello's armed militia, would oust the more moderate members of the ASP from government and seize control.  The operation  HMS Centaur Operation Parthenon would have been a full-scale assault on the revolutionary forces defending Zanzibar to prevent the Umma Party from cementing its control of the island. It would have involved forces far in excess of previous plans which concentrated on the evacuation of and protection of European citizens. The Operation would have involved the landing of British land forces by parachute and helicopter on the island of Unguja to secure the airport before repeating the process on Pemba. The operation plans required a maximum of two aircraft carriers, three destroyers, Owen, 13 helicopters and 21 transport or reconnaissance aircraft. The land forces would have been provided by the second battalion of the Scots Guards, 45 Commando of the Royal Marines and one company of the second battalion of the Parachute Regiment. If it was carried out Parthenon would have been the largest British airborne and amphibious operation since the Suez Crisis. The two carriers selected for the operation were HMS Centaur and which were transferred to the region in readiness. With the revelation, around 20 February, that communist troops may have trained the Zanzibar revolutionaries the British planners decided that a different mix of forces was required for the task and Operation Parthenon was replaced by Operation Boris.

It is closely related to the notion of \\"golden rule of saving\\". In general, an economy will fail to be dynamically efficient if the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy (sum of the growth rates of population and per capita income). In the Solow growth model An economy in the Solow growth model is dynamically inefficient if the savings rate exceeds the Golden Rule savings rate. If the savings rate is greater than the Golden Rule savings rate, a decrease in savings rate will increase consumption per effective unit of labor. A savings rate higher than the Golden Rule savings rate implies that an economy could be better off today and tomorrow by saving less. In other models The Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model does not have dynamic efficiency problems because agents discount the future at some rate Œ≤ which is less than 1, and their savings rate is endogenous. The Diamond growth model is not necessarily dynamically efficient because of the overlapping generation setup. In a competitive equilibrium, the growth rate may exceed the interest rate, which entails dynamic inefficiency. This is because agents are finitely lived. However, competitive allocations are dynamically efficient if one augments the Diamond model with land as an additional factor of production.Stefan Homburg (1991) Interest and Growth in an Economy with Land. Canadian Journal of Economics 24, pp. 450-459. Are modern economies dynamically efficient? Abel, Mankiw, Summers, and Zeckhauser (1989) develop a criterion for addressing dynamic efficiency and apply this model to the United States and other OECD countries, suggesting that these countries are indeed dynamically efficient.

It was devised around 20 February to be used if the radical left-wing Umma Party attempted to take power. It replaced the earlier sea-based Operation Parthenon with a parachute assault launched from Kenya. However the operation was not required and was jeopardised by the lack of co-operation from the Kenyan government and populace for an attack on Zanzibar. Boris was replaced by Operation Finery, an amphibious helicopter assault, on 9 April 1964.  Objectives  Operation Boris was intended as an intervention to be implemented if the radical left-wing Umma Party attempted to seize control of the Revolutionary Council from President Abeid Karume's more moderate Afro-Shirazi Party. The British believed that this could be accomplished if the Umma Party gained the support of John Okello, leader of the recent revolution and Field Marshal of country's military forces. Operation Boris was designed as a replacement for, Operation Parthenon, an earlier plan that would depend on a force of Royal Navy vessels acting as the start point for an assault. Boris had been devised around 20 February 1964, when the British government was informed that communist bloc troops may have helped to train the Zanzibar revolutionaries and that a new mix of troops would be better suited to an assault.  Plan  The British had identified Unguja, Zanzibar's southern island, as the main base of revolutionary power, whilst Pemba, to the north, was less affected. Thus Operation Boris would commence with a parachute assault on Unguja's airfield, launched from pre- existing British airfields in Kenya, with troops securing Unguja before repeating the tactic on Pemba. However the success of Boris was not assured as it was recognised by the planners that any unilateral intervention by Britain against Zanzibar would cause a \\"strong adverse reaction\\" in Kenya. Britain had previously informed Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika that if they requested British intervention in Zanzibar then it would be forthcoming but no such requests were received. Furthermore, the Kenyan government had stated that its clearance for British troops to move freely in Kenya did not extend to any intervention in Zanzibar. In any case the security of British forces in Kenya could not be guaranteed if there was local opposition to the intervention and Zanzibari forces would likely be informed of any impending attack by sympathetic Kenyans. With this in mind the Defence Council replaced Boris on 9 April with Operation Finery, an amphibious helicopter assault.  References  Bibliography  *. *.

It was a replacement for the earlier operations Parthenon and Boris, amphibious and airborne assaults. Finery circumvented the reliance of the previous plans on bases in Kenya, where government and local support for intervention were not forthcoming. Instead, Finery would have utilised the commando carrier HMS Bulwark to land Royal Marines on Zanzibar to protect Karume's government. Because of delays in the deployment of Bulwark, Finery was supplemented by Operation Shed, which could be launched at shorter notice. The expected coup did not occur, and Finery was scrapped on 29 April 1964, although Operation Shed remained in place.  Objectives  The Zanzibar Revolution had occurred on 12 January 1964. Since then, British forces had kept a presence in the area to safeguard European citizens. Since 30 January, British forces had also been kept on standby to launch a military intervention in the event that the radical left-wing Umma Party staged a coup to overthrow the President Abeid Karume's moderate Afro-Shirazi Party which controlled the governing Revolutionary Council. The first operation with this objective was Operation Parthenon, which would have used two aircraft carriers, four other ships, 34 aircraft and elements of the Scots Guards, the Parachute Regiment, and 45 Commando of the Royal Marines. They would launch an amphibious and airborne assault on the main, southern island of Unguja before taking the northern island of Pemba. Parthenon remained in place until around 20 February when it became known that the forces of the Revolutionary Council may have received military training from communist troops, the British Defence Council then decided that a different mix of soldiers was required. Thus Parthenon was replaced by Operation Boris. Boris would have made use of British airfields in Kenya to launch the attack. However it was decided that secrecy could not be maintained in Kenya, where some of the population sympathised with the Zanzibaris. So, on 9 April, Operation Finery was developed as a replacement.  Plan  Finery would have involved a helicopter assault on Unguja, the main base of revolutionary power, by Royal Marines from the commando carrier HMS Bulwark. The plan circumvented the need to operate from Kenya, where secrecy could not be guaranteed, and the government did not support intervention. It would take 14 days for Finery to launch once ordered since Middle East operations required the Bulwark. To provide a more immediate response plans were put in place for a smaller scale operation which could be launched within 24 hours should evacuation of remaining British citizens in Zanzibar be required. The merger of Zanzibar with Tanganyika to form Tanzania on the 23 April may have provided the catalyst for the Umma Party to attempt a coup and so from around this date Finery was supported by Operation Shed, an airlift of a battalion of troops, accompanied by scout cars, to seize Unguja's airfield and protect Karume's government. The expected coup did not occur, and Finery was scrapped on 29 April 1964, although Operation Shed remained in place.  References  Bibliography  *. *.

It was one of a series of operations devised by the British to be implemented in the case of an attempt to seize power from President Abeid Karume by the radical left-wing Umma Party. Shed succeeded the earlier Operations Parthenon and Boris and was an alternative to Operation Finery. Shed would have involved an airlift of a battalion of troops to Unguja to provide support to Karume and to protect European citizens. The risk of a coup passed by 29 April 1964 and it was determined that any intervention would be opposed by Karume's forces and a Soviet training team. With this in mind Shed was modified on 9 June to an airborne assault by Royal Marine commandos from HMS Centaur, which would then be supported by the landing of a battalion and armoured cars from Kenya. The continuing presence of British and friendly nationals in Zanzibar complicated the matter and, around 23 September 1964, Shed was replaced by Plan Giralda.  Background  The Zanzibar Revolution had occurred on 12 January 1964 and since then British forces had kept a presence in the area to safeguard European citizens. Since 30 January British forces had also been kept on standby to launch a military intervention in the event that the radical left-wing Umma Party staged a coup to overthrow President Abeid Karume's moderate Afro-Shirazi Party which controlled the governing Revolutionary Council. Operation Shed was the fourth British plan for this eventuality, following Operations Parthenon, Boris and Finery. Parthenon and Boris had been cancelled by the time that Shed was designed and Shed was to act as a supporting operation to Finery. Finery would have involved a helicopter assault by Royal Marines from the commando carrier HMS Bulwark. However, Bulwark was required for operations in the Middle East and so Finery could only be launched following 14 days notice. In addition, the merger of Zanzibar and Tanganyika to form Tanzania on 23 April had raised concerns in the British commanders that the Umma Party would launch a coup to prevent the merger which would limit their power. Shed was designed as a contingency plan to provide a quicker response if it seemed likely that the Umma Party could stage a coup quicker than Finery could be launched or if British citizens were in immediate danger.  Operation  Shed would have entailed the airlift of a battalion of British troops to Unguja, the main base of revolutionary power, to provide support to Karume and any forces loyal to him. The primary objectives were to seize the airfield and other strategic locations, protect Karume and his government, protect British and European citizens and to disarm any forces which were a threat to Karume. The operation was planned on the basis that troops would only be sent with the agreement of Karume and that their disembarkation would be unopposed. The Commonwealth Relations Office had sought to persuade the Nigerian government to support Shed with additional troops but had been turned down.  Aftermath  HMS Centaur By 29 April the danger of a coup had passed so Operation Finery was scrapped and Shed stepped down to 24 hours readiness. On 21 May the Chiefs of Staff acknowledged that Karume's agreement probably would not be gained and that a landing may be opposed. Intelligence sources also stated that Karume's 300-strong police force were now outnumbered by other security forces of unknown loyalties and that elements of the Zanzibari Army and a Soviet training team guarded the airfield by night. The Zanzibari army was known to be in possession of light anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine guns, 120 mm mortars and 57 mm anti-tank guns. Karume's police were also expected to side with the army against any foreign intervention unless specifically ordered not to by Karume. A 300 strong Tanganyikan police unit was already on the island to keep the peace and was expected to support the British intervention, however it was of negligible use as a fighting unit. In light of this information Shed was modified on 9 June to an airborne assault by Royal Marine commandos from HMS Centaur which would then be supported by the landing of the battalion and armoured cars from Kenya. Despite these modifications the Minister of Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, stated that losses amongst British and Zanzibari forces would likely be high if the plan went ahead. The continuing presence of 87 British citizens and 40 \\"friendly nationals\\" in the country also complicated matters as British troops would be expected to protect these civilians from violence. Thus Shed was replaced by Plan Giralda around 23 September 1964.  References  Bibliography  *. *.

It constitutes a red vertical surface with a five-pointed star on its left side (a star that is common among many flags e.g., the flag of Chile). It had been a historical flag, with its first image of appearance dating from 1549, of the municipality but was replaced in 1938 with a flag similar in design to the Polish flag. To avoid confusion, the old flag was reinstated in 1994. History In 1438 the flag of Maastricht is described as being as a pigeon with olive branch on a white field, with the first historic image dating from 1545. The mentioned image was published in the Wappenbuch von Meister IK-book in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. However, in 1549, the flag is stated as being \\"yellow-white-red\\". In 1647, the white-star-on-red design had apparently returned when the Peace of M√ºnster treaty was signed. The next known design is the white-red (with the upper part of the flag being white, and the lower part being red) design similar to the Polish flag. In 1993 it was decided by the municipal government to reinstate the first design and the flag was re- inaugurated on January 1, 1994. Design Flag of Maastricht on top of the Fort Sint Pieter (Saint Peter's Fortress) alt=Fortress Sint Pieter Maastrichtthumb Flagpole on Fortress Sint Pieter The height of the white star on the flag has to measure of the entire flag. The white five-pointed star is placed so that the height above the star relates to the height under the star as 9 : 11. Furthermore, the proportions between the height and the width has to be 2:3. This design designation has been in use since 1994. The reasons for reselecting this design were varied. Firstly, there was to be no confusion with flags of other countries, provinces or cities. Secondly, the citizens of Maastricht were argued to feel more united by this design than the 1938-1994 design. Thirdly, the flag complies with the heraldric standards of the Netherlands. Finally, the colours of the Maastrichtian flag are white and vermilion, ones also used in the flag of the Netherlands. Symbolism and misconceptions * Before 1549: early flag design was a pigeon with olive branch in the canton. * First and current design (after 1549, 1647-? (1938), 1994-): this flag does not bear any symbolism towards communism, a political ideology known for using many red symbolism e.g. the red flag. * Second design (1938-1994): this flag was easily confused with the Polish flag and similar designs.

History In 1879 guards were appointed to safeguard the coins, currency and documents of the US Treasury and fell under the office of the Chief Clerk of the Treasury department. They were later renamed as the Treasury Guard Force. On 1 July 1937, the Secretary of the Treasury placed the TGF along with the Guard Force of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, under the authority of the United States Secret Service where they became the Uniformed Force of the Secret Service. On 1 July 1953 the Uniformed Force was again split in half and one half again became the Guard Force of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. After 1960 when the USSS moved out of the main treasury building the TGF became responsible for arresting and interviewing check and bond forgers and performing on-site investigations into thefts, threats, violence, and deal with mentally ill persons on Treasury property. In 1970 the TGF became the Treasury Security Force and in 1976 the Guards became Police officers after a ruling by the United States Civil Service Commission. In 1983 the TPF became the Treasury Police Force and in 1986 merged with the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service. In 1991 a decision was made to create a second currency manufacturing facility and the site was donated by Ross Perot to the city of Fort Worth who signed it over to the Federal Govt. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing Western Currency Facility was born. So that it needed to be protected, the BEP Police were assembled from US Air Force and US Navy security personnel who worked at nearby JRB/NAS Fort Worth and would be separating from service in time to start the police force.

Giralda was intended to be launched if the radical left-wing Umma Party attempted to launch a coup against the government of President Julius Nyerere's newly formed Tanzania. It was the fifth and final British plan for such an eventuality, following Operations Parthenon, Boris, Finery and Shed. Giralda would have required British Army units, Royal Marines and Royal Navy vessels from the Far East to be deployed to Zanzibar if a request was received from Nyerere. Follow on units would be sent after the main assault from the British garrison in Kenya. The operational constraints of sending troops over such long distances, the reluctance of the Kenyan government to weaken the British presence in their country, the reduction of Western presence in Zanzibar and the strengthening of the political situation in Tanzania made intervention unlikely and the plan was suspended in October 1964. The newly elected Labour government cancelled the plan in December.  Objectives  The Zanzibar Revolution had occurred on 12 January and since then British forces had kept a presence in the area to safeguard European citizens. Since 30 January British forces had also been kept on standby to launch a military intervention in the event that the radical left-wing Umma Party staged a coup to overthrow President Abeid Karume's moderate Afro- Shirazi Party which controlled the governing Revolutionary Council. Plan Giralda was the fifth British plan for this eventuality, following Operations Parthenon, Boris, Finery and Shed. The other four operations had been cancelled by the time that Giralda was put into place. Giralda was designed as a replacement for Operation Shed and was introduced around 23 September 1964. Since the revolution Zanzibar had merged with the African mainland country of Tanganyika to form Tanzania and Giralda was designed as a means of intervention in case the Zanzibar-based Umma Party attempted a coup against President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.  Operation  Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere Plan Giralda was to have used British troops from Aden and the Far East to launch a military intervention in Zanzibar. Troops from British garrisons in Kenya had been designated for previous intervention plans but they were cancelled due to security and secrecy concerns. Giralda called for an infantry battalion and a tactical headquarters unit to be shipped from Aden to the British naval and air base on Gan in the Maldives where they would rendezvous with a Royal Marines commando unit and vessels of the Royal Navy drawn from the Far East. Because of the long distances involved it was estimated that it would take 11 to 15 days for the entire force to reach Zanzibar following the initial order. Once the force had reached the island it was capable of remaining embarked and out of sight of land for up to 15 days before operational efficiency would be compromised. One of the problems facing the plan was that President Nyerere's agreement had to be given for the operation to go ahead and the 11- to 15-day delay between this agreement and the arrival of troops may have weakened his resolve for action. If, however, the troops were sent in anticipation of this agreement they could only remain on board the ships for a finite time before they would have to be publicly disembarked. Resource constraints meant that an amphibious assault force with attendant ships could not be kept permanently ready in the theatre as this capability had been ruled out in the 1961 strategy paper \\"British strategy in the 1960s\\". Giralda would have relied on follow on forces drawn from bases in Kenya or transported through Kenya from Aden to maintain security after the initial assault. The movement of these troops was subject to the agreement of the Kenyan government and so put the safety of British troops at the discretion of a foreign government. Similar political problems had affected the reinforcement of Kuwait in 1961. The support of the Kenyan government might have been difficult to obtain as the reinforcements may have come from the British garrison there which had recently been required to quell mutinies in the Kenyan army. By the autumn Western interests in Zanzibar were practically non-existent and in October the British Chiefs of Staff were informed that Nyerere was very unlikely to request intervention and as a result the plan was suspended. The October 1964 British general election brought in a Labour government which scrapped Giralda in December. The government decided not to inform Nyerere that it no longer considered itself bound to respond to any request for intervention. Giralda was the last plan for British military intervention in Zanzibar.  References  Bibliography  *. *.

Built in 1954 as the \\"Goodwood of the North\\", hence the fact the two venues had so many things in common. The track was well surfaced and relatively flat ‚Äì ranging from 15 to about 30 metres in elevation. The circuit has hosted the Formula One British Grand Prix five times, in 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1962. In addition to the Grands Prix, which were organised by the British Automobile Racing Club, the circuit also held eleven non-championship Formula 1 races, known as the Aintree 200, first won by Stirling Moss in 1954 with the last winner being Jack Brabham, in April 1964 (Brabham had made his Formula One debut at the circuit in the 1955 British GP). Aintree was the location for the famous race in 1955 in which Stirling Moss won his first British Grand Prix, driving a Mercedes. Two years later, he and Tony Brooks (sharing the Vanwall) became the first British drivers to win both the British Grand Prix and a round of the Formula 1 World Championship, whilst driving a British car, a Vanwall. The 1957 Grand Prix also took the title of Grand Prix de Europe and was the premier Formula 1 event of the season, attracting 150,000 spectators. The full Grand Prix circuit was last raced on in 1964, but part of it (the Club Circuit) is still open and was used for racing until the early 1980s, having been operated by the Aintree Circuit Club from the mid-1960s to the late 1990s. In the 1980s the 108 Car Club (St. Helens) brought rallying back to Aintree Circuit revitalising the circuit's use with new and innovative ideas. A limited amount of motor sport continues today in the form of car sprints, track days and motorcycle racing on the Club Circuit. The motorcycle events are organised by Aintree Motor Cycle Racing Club, who run six events at Aintree each year. The car events are organised by Liverpool Motor Club in the form of three sprints, in April, June and September and two track days in May and October on the club circuit. Nick Algar, the 2010 British Sprint Champion, set a new course record of 35.82 seconds on the 1847-metre sprint course on 26 June 2010 in a Gould GR55 3500cc.

He was educated at Burton Grammar School.Who was Who, OUP 2007 He was married twice, first in 1909 to Grace Lucy Kirby. They were divorced in November 1929. Just a few days after his divorce was made absolute, Newbould married Dorothy Irene Pugh by whom he already had one son, born early in 1929.The Times, 21 February 1931 Career Newbould originally joined the British Army as a trooper in the 1st Royal Dragoons and fought in the Second Boer War, but his main profession was in the developing entertainment industry, the cinema. He was a director of Provincial Cinematograph Theatres National Council of Public Morals Cinema Commission of Inquiry, The Cinema: Its Present Position and Future Possibilities; Arno Press, 1970 p ix and worked for Gaumont British as a publicist. He was also a Chairman and Director of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd; a director of London Film Company Ltd and director of Fenning's Film Service Ltd.The Cinema; Its Present Position and Future Possibilities; Read Books, 2008 p262 He was sometime Chairman The Times, 23 January 1917 and later President The Times, 1 July 1919 of the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association of Great Britain and Ireland, Chairman of the Cinematograph Trade Council The Times, 8 May 1917 and a member of the Entertainment Industry Committee.The Times, 11 September 1918 He was said to act as the Cinema Trades unofficial representative in the House of Commons.David Berry & Simon Horrocks, David Lloyd George: The Movie Mystery; University of Wales Press, 1998 p15 PoliticsLeyton West, 1918= Newbould first stood for Parliament at the 1918 general election in the east London constituency of Leyton West. As an Independent Liberal and supporter of H H Asquith he was not the recipient of the coalition ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô which went instead to his Coalition Conservative opponent, Harry Wrightson. In a straight fight between Coalition Conservative and Liberal candidates, Wrightson emerged the winner with a healthy majority of 5,668 votes. Within days of the declaration of poll however, Wrightson contracted influenza, which deteriorated to pneumonia, and he died early in 1919, aged 44, six days before the new Parliament met and so was never able to take his seat. =Leyton West by-election= Wrightson's death necessitated a by-election and Newbould was again chosen to stand for the Liberals. His opponent was another Coalition Conservative, James Francis Mason. Once again there was no Labour candidate. In the by-election Newbould's main campaign points were the abolition of conscription and a crackdown on profiteering The Times, 17 February 1919 the first policy was said to appeal to men and the second to women.The Times, 1 March 1919 Unfortunately for part of the contest he was confined to bed with a bad cold and his wife was engaged as principal canvasser on his behalf The Times, 26 February 1919 On a turnout of 42.5%, (down from the general election turnout of 49.9%) Newbould won what was seen as an important victory for the Asquithian Liberals improving his share of the vote from 32.6% at the general election to 57.3% in the by-election. According to psephologist John Ramsden, this amounted to a swing of 24.8% and was statistically one of the worst by-election reverses of the 1918-1922 government.Chris Cook and John Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press 1997, p16 =Liberal Reunion= Newbould was an advocate of Liberal reunion in the early 1920s, before the fall of the Lloyd George coalition. He co-hosted a function with John Wallace the Coalition Liberal MP for Dunfermline Burghs in June 1921 attended by about 40 MPs from both sides of the Liberal divide with the aim of stimulating the process of reunion. It was not a gathering which had the approval or endorsement of either the Independent or Coalition Liberal headquarters but an opportunity for individuals from both wings of the party to re-affirm their beliefs in Liberalism as a creed and to make public statements in support of traditional Liberal policies such as Free Trade, Ireland and the economy.The Times, 22 June 1921 However a few weeks later this particular movement towards reconciliation within the Liberal family foundered, mainly as a result of the Independent Liberals‚Äô fear that their approaches would be viewed as a willingness to become formally associated with Lloyd George and their determination to let it be known that they could not contemplate the possibility that Lloyd George might one day lead the party again.The Times, 23 July 1921 =Other Parliamentary contests= Newbould lost his seat at Leyton West in 1922 to Conservative candidate James Cassels in a three-cornered contest, with Labour candidate Alfred Smith (later MP for Sunderland from 1929‚Äì31) also entering the fray. He tried to win it back at the next opportunity in 1923 again facing a three-cornered contest with Cassels and Smith and came agonisingly close to regaining the seat, Cassels holding on by a majority of 64 votes (or 0.2% of the poll). Newbould fought Leyton West again in 1924 but this time came third in the poll behind the victorious Cassels and Smith in second place. He did not stand for Parliament again.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p171 =Other Liberal activity= In 1927 he was nominated by the London Liberal Federation to sit on a committee of the Liberal Party under the chairmanship of Lord Buxton, to look into the organisation and health of the party in London constituencies. In 1928 he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals in the Hackney North constituency at the London County Council elections.The Times, 9 March 1928 Death Newbould died at Ferring-by-Sea in West Sussex, where he had his home, aged 78 years on 25 April 1952.

Career A native of Zagreb, Cerin started playing at NK Trnje, a small local club, in the early 1970s. In 1976, he moved to another local side, the third level minnows NK Zagrebaƒçki Plavi (who later merged with NK Zagreb in 1980). In April 1976 the Yugoslavia national football team decided to play a training match against Zagrebaƒçki Plavi in preparation for their UEFA Euro 1976 qualifier versus Wales played in Zagreb. The game proved to be a turning point for Cerin as he scored a hat-trick versus the national team and their stalwart goalkeeper Ognjen Petroviƒá. Cerin instantly became sought after by top clubs. He was first invited by Tomislav Iviƒá to join Hajduk Split but the deal never materialised as Iviƒá had left Hajduk for Netherlands at the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season to take over Ajax. Dinamo Zagreb then offered him a contract and Cerin joined the club for the 1976‚Äì77 season. Cerin then had to wait for his Dinamo debut almost six months under coach Mirko Baziƒá - he scored his first goal for Dinamo in a 3‚Äì1 friendly win against GO≈†K Dubrovnik on 10 November 1976 and his league debut came a week later on 17 November in a 6‚Äì1 home win against Buduƒánost in which he scored two goals. His first goal against international opposition came in a 4‚Äì0 win against Ajax led by Tomislav Iviƒá at the Trofej Marjan international tournament played in Split on 17 February 1977. A very prolific scorer, he led the club to their first league title in 24 years in the 1981‚Äì82 season, also becoming the league's top scorer with 19 goals. In his ten seasons with Dinamo between 1976 and 1986 he also won two Yugoslav Cups (1980 and 1983) and was the club's leading goalscorer five times. He made a total of 474 appearances and scored 295 goals for the Blues, including 216 appearances and 101 goals in the Yugoslav First League, and holds the record as the club's top scorer of the Yugoslav era. Alongside players such as Marko Mlinariƒá and Zlatko Kranjƒçar Cerin is regarded as one of the symbols of one of the most successful periods in Dinamo's history, in which they also finished as runners-up in the league twice (1976‚Äì77, 1978‚Äì79) and runners-up in the cup three times (1982, 1985, 1986). However, in spite of his excellent scoring record, Cerin was constantly overlooked by national team managers and was never called up for Yugoslavia. In late 1985 Cerin had a short stint in the American Major Indoor Soccer League (where he was referred to as John Cerin) and scored a single goal in three matches for Kansas City Comets before being recalled to Dinamo by manager Miroslav Bla≈æeviƒá in the winter break of the 1985‚Äì86 season. Cerin finally left the club in 1986 and played a single season at SK Austria Klagenfurt (present-day FC K√§rnten) in Austria. He then returned to Zagreb and appeared in a handful of games for another small local side NK Novi Zagreb (present-day Hrvatski Dragovoljac) before retiring from football. Cerin then opened a pub in Zagreb which he ran into the 1990s. In 2001, he moved to Privlaka, a small town near the coastal city of Zadar, where he runs a small retirement home.

The members of TU9 mutually accredit their bachelor's and master's degrees and, therefore, support the progression of the Bologna process and quality assurance concerning university education of engineers.  Policy on higher education  Associated especially through their core subjects, the engineering sciences, the members of TU9 pay attention particularly to the public perception of topics with high relevance to these sciences. This includes analysis of statistics about third-party fundsTU9 leading in third-party funds (PDF, German) and the description of the importance of the TU9 universities concerning graduates.TU9 leading in engineering graduates and doctorate degrees (PDF, German)  Position in Germany  According to the research report 2018 of the German Research Foundation (DFG), TU9 universities are among the universities with the highest third-party funding in Germany. They received more than one-fifth (21%) of all DFG grants across all scientific disciplines. The TU Dresden received the highest number of DFG grants in electrical engineering, the TU Darmstadt in computer science and the RWTH Aachen in mechanical engineering. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research. In the profile area of engineering, almost 50% of the DFG funding volume goes to TU9 universities. Almost a quarter of all recipients of a European Research Council grant, the highest endowed science prize of the European Union, preferred one of the TU9 universities.

The review stated that the second half of the album featuring the pop songs was \\"generic\\". The review praised the \\"Definitive Edition\\" version of the album which featured the entire film score, opining that it \\"comprises some of the best science fiction-oriented film music of recent decades.\\" Reviewing the 2016 re-issue, Pitchfork gave the album an 8.5 out of 10 rating, and labeled it as one of their best new reissues.

He plays the guzheng, koto, guitar, waterphone, and percussion, among other instruments. In the late 1980s he founded the Pointless Music label, which was devoted to experimental music releases. In his solo work, and with Pointless Orchestra, he recorded and/or performed with such musicians as Jin Hi Kim, Z'EV, Amy Denio, Anna Homler, Illusion of Safety, Reed Ghazala, John Hajeski, and Barry Chabala. Mike Hovancsek's current output, which he describes as \\"multicultural chamber music,\\" includes solo recordings, solo performances, and collaborations with many notable members of the world music community. His music often combines instruments from several different cultures in unique ways. For example, on \\"Hybrids\\" (from his Temporal Angels CD) he combines the Chinese guzheng, cello, violin, and Middle Eastern dumbek. On \\"Somniloquy\\" (also from Temporal Angels) he combines koto, english horn, and choir.

Exact numbers of Romani people in France are unknown‚Äîestimates vary from 20,000 to 400,000. According to these estimates, at least 12,000 Romani live in unofficial urban camps throughout the country, with French authorities often attempting to close them. Origin The Romani people originated in Northern India,Current Biology. presumably from the northwestern Indian states Rajasthan and Punjab. The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a large part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines. More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali. Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group. According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the ·∏åoma, are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma. Population In France the Romani people are typically classified into three groups: * \\"Rroms\\", referring to Romani who come from territories from eastern Europe * \\"Manouches\\", also known as \\"Sint√©\\" (in Germany and Holland: Sinti), who often have familial ties in Germany and Italy * \\"Gitans\\", who trace their familial ties to Romani people in SpainLi√©geois, Jean-Pierre. Roma, tsiganes, voyageurs. Council of Europe, 1994. The term \\"Romanichel\\" is considered pejorative, and \\"Boh√©mien\\" is outdated. The French National Gendarmerie referred to them in an ethnic database by the acronym \\"MENS\\" (\\"Minorit√©s Ethniques Non-S√©dentaris√©es\\"), an administrative term meaning \\"Travelling Ethnic Minorities\\". However this denomination is not widely spread, since this ethnic database was secret (creating ethnic data is illegal in France). The exact numbers of Romani people in France are not known, with estimates varying from 20,000 to 400,000. The French Romani rights group FNASAT reports that at least 12,000 Romani, who have immigrated from Romania and Bulgaria, live in unofficial urban camps throughout the country. French authorities often attempt to close down these encampments. In 2009, the government sent more than 10,000 Romani back to Romania and Bulgaria. In 2009, the European Committee of Social Rights found France had violated the European Social Charter (rights to housing, right to protection against poverty and social exclusion, right of the family to protection) in respect to Romani population from foreign countries.

Repatriations In 2010 and 2011, the French government organized repatriation flights to send French Romani to Romania. On 12 April, a chartered flight carrying 160 Romani left northern France for Timi»ôoara. As in the 2010 deportations, the French government gave those Romani leaving France ‚Ç¨300 each, with ‚Ç¨100 for each child. The Romani on the 12 April flight were forced to sign declarations that they would never return to France. On 9 August, the city of Marseille in southern France forcibly evicted 100 Romani people from a makeshift camp near Porte d'Aix, giving them 24 hours to leave. A chartered flight carrying approximately 150 Romani to Romania left the Lyon area on 20 September. France's goal for 2011 was to deport 30,000 Romani to Romania. As of 2012, France sent about 8,000 Romani to Romania and Bulgaria in 2011, after dismantling camps where they were living on the outskirts of cities. The actions prompted controversy and calls for greater inclusion of Romani people. Racism Prejudiced views of Romani are widespread in France, with a 2014 Pew Research poll indicating that two-thirds of French people have unfavorable views of Romani. According to a report published by the Human Rights League of France and the European Roma Rights Centre, 60 percent of all Romani living in France were forcibly evicted from their homes in 2016, many in cold winter months. Rumors and fake news stories of a white van occupied by Romani attempting to abduct children or young women have spread across the French internet on multiple occasions. A number of violent incidents against Romani occurred in March 2019 after rumors of Romani kidnapping children spread on Facebook and Snapchat. Two people in a white van were attacked by 20 youths in Colombes on 16 March. On 25 March, 50 people attacked a Roma camp in Bobigny with sticks and knives, burning several vans, and a separate group of Romani were chased and attacked in Clichy-sous- Bois.

It was instrumental in the foundation of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh in 1822. The Institution raised funds, mostly by member subscription, to create three departments: A scientific observatory with an observer was to be under the control of the professors of mathematics, philosophy and astronomy of the University of Edinburgh, a popular observatory was to provide general instruction and amusement and a \\"physical cabinet\\" would comprise books, globes, meteorological and other instruments.  History  The first president of the Institution was John Playfair, professor of natural philosophy. The members were predominantly landed gentry, advocates, bankers, academics, clergy, etc. The City of Edinburgh provided the abandoned observatory on Calton Hill, and the popular observatory was then set up in the existing Gothic Tower. Another observatory building was demolished and in 1818 work started on its replacement, which is now known as the Playfair Building. The Institution's funds were exhausted before instruments could be purchased for the new scientific observatory. This would be a recurring problem until the Institution's eventual demise in 1847. In 1822 it presented a loyal address to George IV and the new observatory was granted the title of Royal Observatory. With Government grants and after much delay in procuring instruments it was only in 1834 that Thomas Henderson was appointed the first observer. This was now the Government-funded position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland. The incumbent would also be Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. Henderson died in 1844 and in 1846 Charles Piazzi Smyth was appointed as his successor. Due to the deteriorating finances of the Institution it was forced to hand over its property to the Government in 1847. The Royal Observatory continued on Calton Hill. After Piazzi Smyth's resignation in 1888 it moved in 1896 to its present site on Blackford Hill.  See also  * Royal Observatory, Edinburgh * City Observatory References * Gavine, D (1981).

William was one of four children (three sisters) born to Thomas Gill Halliburton and Mary Strachan Homan of Middlesex. He was educated at the University College School and later at the University College London, obtaining a BSc in 1879. On his MRCS in 1883 he was appointed Assistant in Physiology at the University College under Sir Edward Sharpey-Schafer. His MD followed in 1884, his membership of the Royal College of Physicians a year later and his Fellowship in 1892. Halliburton succeeded Gerald Francis Yeo in the chair of Physiology at King's College London in 1889. Over the period of 34 years at King's College he was deeply involved in its administration and was dean of the Faculty of Medical Science for many years. In 1923 his chronic ill-health obliged him to resign from the chair and accept the sinecure of Emeritus Professor. During his tenure at King's College, he assembled a research team, many of whom later became distinguished clinicians, including such figures as Thomas Gregor Brodie (1866-1916), Frank S. Locke, Sir Charles James Martin (1866-1955), Sir Frederick Walker Mott (1853‚Äì1926), Walter Ernest Dixon (1871‚Äì1931), Sigmund Otto Rosenheim (1871‚Äì1955) and Corrado Donato Da Fano (1879-1927). He and Rosenheim discovered that cholesterol was not pure, but contained ergosterol which led to the formation of Vitamin D under ultraviolet light. Halliburton's first laboratory was improvised in a disused corridor, but nonetheless became the meeting place of the keenest minds in the infant science of biochemistry. His early research centered on the proteins making up muscle and blood, leading to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891. Together with Walter Ernest Dixon he studied cerebral circulation and cerebrospinal fluid. During this time he helped found the Biochemical Society of which he was the sole honorary member.British Medical JournalBiochemical JournalObituary Halliburton's name was a celebrated one in the field of medical literature. His writings were detailed and lucid, resulting in textbooks which were valued by students all over the world. The first of these was his \\"Textbook of Chemical Physiology and Pathology\\" published in 1891, in which he assembled all knowledge of the subject at the time. He rewrote \\"Kirkes' Physiology\\" completely in 1896 so that it subsequently, through its numerous editions, became known as \\"Halliburton's Physiology\\" and an indispensable reference work for legions of medical students. It became popular enough for an American publisher to flout copyright laws and to publish and sell unauthorised editions.British Medical Journal, 1900 Halliburton died after falling ill on a holiday to Cornwall, which forced him to have an unsuccessful operation at an Exeter clinic.

After serving in the United States Army during the MexicanAmericanWar, Buford joined the Confederate States Army in 1862 and served as a cavalry general in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. After the war, he retired to his native Kentucky and became a thoroughbred horse breeder. Biography Abraham Buford was born in Woodford County, Kentucky, the son of Frances W. Kirtley and her husband, William B. Buford (1781‚Äì1848). He was named for his great-uncle Abraham who was a Continental Army officer during the American Revolutionary War. He descended from a Huguenot family named Beaufort who fled persecution in France and settled in England before emigrating to America in 1635. His cousins, John and Napoleon Bonaparte Buford, who grew up nearby, were generals in the Union Army during the Civil War. Buford studied at Centre College before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837. Graduating in 1841, as a second-lieutenant with the First dragoons from 1842 through 1846, he did Frontier duty in the Kansas Territory and the Indian Territory. He then served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in which he was appointed brevet captain for bravery at the Battle of Buena Vista. When that war ended, he was dispatched for further duty on the Frontier and in 1848 was part of the Santa Fe Trail expedition. In 1849, Buford escorted the mail from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the east, using, in part, the new Cherokee Trail. He was then sent to the Army's cavalry school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, but in October 1854 he resigned his commission and returned to his native Kentucky where his family owned a farm property near Versailles in his native Woodford County. =Civil War= Following the outbreak of the American Civil War, like his native State, Buford tried to stay out of the Civil War and succeeded in doing so for well over a year. In September 1862, during Confederate General Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky, Buford joined the Confederate States Army. He helped raise and took command of a Kentucky brigade and on September 2, 1862, was commissioned Brigadier General. Among his missions, Buford covered General Braxton Bragg's retreat from Kentucky, was part of the Vicksburg Campaign under General Loring, fought in the Battle of Champion Hill, a raid on Paducah, KY on 25 March 1864 under Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest, the Battle of Brice's Crossroads and was wounded on December 24, 1864, at Richland Creek during the Battle of Nashville when he covered Lt. Gen. Hood's retreat following the Confederate Army's loss. In Alabama in February, 1865, he commanded a division in Forrest's Cavalry Corps until the surrender at Selma following Wilson's Raid. When the war ended in 1865, Brigadier General Buford returned to his farm in Kentucky where he became a leading breeder of Thoroughbreds. Bosque Bonita Farm Abe Buford named his Woodford County farm Bosque Bonita (\\"Beautiful Woods\\"), a place The New York Times would call the \\"most princely residence in the Bluegrass region.\\" It was here that slave Billy Walker was born in 1860. He went on to ride Baden-Baden to victory in the 1877 Kentucky Derby. Beginning in 1852, the stallion Sovereign stood at stud at Bosque Bonita, developing into an influential sire. The next year, Abe Buford was part of a syndicate with Richard Ten Broeck, Captain Willa Viley and Junius R. Ward, who bought the then three-year-old colt, Lexington. In 1858 Lexington was sold to Robert A. Alexander of Woodburn Stud for $15,000 in 1858, reportedly the then highest price ever paid for an American horse. Buford also owned, raced, or bred a number of successful horses including Nellie Gray, Enquirer, Crossland, and Versailles. Mannie Gray, whom Thoroughbred Heritage calls \\"one of the most influential American mares in breeding history,\\" was owned and raced by Buford who sold her to fellow Kentuckian, Major Barak G. Thomas of Dixiana Farm. In 1866, Leamington's new owner, Canadian Roderick Cameron, sent him to stand at stud at Bosque Bonita for the season. Although Leamington covered just thirteen mares that year, he produced an outstanding crop of foals, including, Anna Mace, Enquirer, Longfellow, Lynchburg, Lyttleton, and Miss Alice. In 1875, General George Custer came to Bosque Bonita Farm to buy cavalry remounts before the Battle of Little Big Horn. =Later owners= Since Abe Buford's time, Bosque Bonita has been owned by such prominent horsemen as John H. Morris who had trained horses for George J. Long's Bashford Manor Stable for many years and who operated Woodburn Stud on a long-term lease beginning in 1905. John Morris still owned Bosque Bonita in the 1940s. Fritz Hawn bought Bosque Bonita Farm in the fall of 1977 from Robert A. Alexander. Two years later he sold the property to William Stamps Farish III who renamed it Lane's End Farm. Some of the famous horses who stood at the farm in recent times and are buried there include Bally Ache (1957‚Äì1960), Sovereign Dancer (1975‚Äì1994), and Fappiano (1977‚Äì1990). Family tragedies A relief of Brigadier General Abraham Buford by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson at Vicksburg National Military Park. During the 1870s Abe Buford suffered a series of financial reversals that forced him into bankruptcy with the resulting loss of Bosque Bonita Farm to his creditors. In addition, he suffered a devastating personal loss when his only son, William A. Buford, died at age twenty-three in 1872. He lost his wife Amanda Harris Buford in 1879 and on March 26 of that same year, his brother, Colonel Thomas Buford of Henry County, Kentucky, shot and killed Judge John Milton Elliott in Frankfort, Kentucky. Tom Buford surrendered to police and was jailed pending trial. Abe Buford came to his brother's aid and spent a great deal of money on legal fees for his defense. On appeal of a guilty verdict, Thomas Buford would eventually be found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Anchorage, Kentucky psychiatric hospital. In his final years, Abe Buford made a living working for racing newspapers. In 1884, following his brother Thomas's much publicized escape from the insane asylum with some newspaper headlines saying he was \\"thirsting for blood\\", Abe Buford sought some peace and went to visit his nephew Benjamin T. Buford in Danville, Indiana. There, in his bedroom, a very depressed Abraham Buford took his own life. His remains were sent back to Kentucky where he was buried in the Lexington Cemetery. The Brigadier General Abraham Buford Relief was erected November 21, 1911, on South Confederate Avenue in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Some Polska Roma also live in North America, Switzerland, Sweden, Great Britain and countries of the European Union. The term \\"Polska Roma\\" is both an ethnonym of the group and a term used in the academic literature. As such it is distinct from the terms \\"Polish Roma\\" or \\"Roma in Poland\\" which better denote the broader Roma population in Poland. Polish ethnographer Jerzy Ficowski, writing in the 1950s and 1960s used the term \\"Polish Lowlander Gypsies\\" (Polish: Polscy Cyganie Nizinni) to refer to the same group, though this terminology is no longer in widespread use. Culture Polska Roma were nomadic until the twentieth century. They have not assimilated into broader Polish society, or the non- Romani cultures of other countries where they live. They are in fact one of the most traditional Romani groups. One exception to this is that the most common surnames among Polska Roma are characteristically Polish (for example Kwiatkowski or Majewski), or occasionally Polonized-German (for example Wajs or Szwarc). Polska Roma generally have had a very strict interpretation of Romanipen cultural laws and practices. Some cultural differences arose however within the community during and after World War II because those of the Polska Roma who spent the war in areas controlled by the Soviet Union were able to hold on to orthodox practice, while those under German occupation and threatened by genocide had to compromise the strictness of their traditions in order to survive. They are closely related to Xaladitka Roma, or \\"Ruska Roma\\" who emigrated to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth together with the Polska Roma. Because the Xaladitka settled in regions of present-day Belarus, they became more affected by Ruthenian, rather than Polish, culture. HistoryOrigins= Polska Roma as a distinct ethnolinguistic group formed during the 16th century in western Poland from Roma refugees who had migrated to the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth in order to escape anti-Romani persecution in the Holy Roman Empire. The migration was a result of a wave of pogroms, persecutions and anti-Romani laws in German territories and this had a profound effect on Polska Roma culture and language. Compared to other Roma groups, such as the Bergitka Roma (Polish Carpathian Gypsies or Polish Highlander Gypsies in Ficowski's terminology) who had actually arrived in Poland earlier in the 15th century, the communities of Polska Roma are more closed and suspicious of outsiders (Gadjo), less \\"assimilated\\", and more tied to traditional Roma culture. Their version of the Roma dialect has also incorporated many German words and idioms.Adam Bartosz, \\"Nie boj sie cygana/Na dara rromesoar\\", Pograniczne, Sejny, 1994, pg. 71 =In the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth= Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, like other European states, passed anti-Roma legislation. However, unlike in most European countries, these laws were rarely enforced in large measure because the Roma found powerful protectors among the Szlachta (Polish nobility) and benign neglect. Polish nobles, magnates and landowners, placed a high value on the traditional crafts of the Roma, such as metallurgy, farming, and wheelwrighting, as well musical skills (which became a standard staple of important occasions), the Polska Roma were usually exempted from the feudal restrictions that tied Polish peasants to the land. They were free to continue the nomadic lifestyle during most of the year, as long as they arrived in the \\"home town\\" on pre-specified market days. In that respect, the Polska Roma occupied social strata above that of the Polish peasants and other Roma populations, such as the Carpathian Roma (whose mobility was restricted). In many large magnate latifundia, the communities of Polska Roma were also given the right to have a \\"king,\\" chosen to represent them in legal disputes with outsiders. However, over time, the office became a source of corruption. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the persons were often chosen from outside their group and tended to pursue personal rather than community interests. Additional anti-Roma laws were passed in Poland and Lithuania when Augustus the Strong, the Elector of Saxony, was elected king of Poland in 1697. Saxony, like most German states of the time had very strong anti-Roma legislation (Roma men were to be killed on sight, often with a bounty paid for their ears, while Roma women and children were disfigured, branded and banished) and upon Augustus' inauguration some of these laws were transferred to the Commonwealth. However, a distinction was made between the laws applicable in Augustus' home state of Saxony and the Commonwealth proper, where the most severe measures were mitigated into monetary fines or simply benign neglect of local authorities. Shortly before the Partitions of Poland, Polska Roma, like other non-szlachta classes, were granted full citizenship by the Constitution of 3rd May. However, these privileges were lost with the partitions and the Polska Roma were forced back into servile status by the foreign powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia). =During the Polish partitions= After Poland's partitions, the persecution of Polska Roma became more severe, particularly in the Russian partition. As a result, the group's population's size declined, at one point falling to as low as 1000 persons within Congress Poland. Another reason for the overall decline was that within the Prussian partition part of the group developed an identity, under the influence of German culture, distinct from those of other Polska Roma and subsequently became the Sasytka Roma. Finally, the 19th century saw an influx of other Romani into the territories of former Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly the Kalderash and Lovari. These groups competed economically against the Polska Roma within their traditional crafts and, in many places, successfully displaced them in terms of employment. =Interwar Poland= After Poland regained its independence, Polish authorities tended to recognize the Kalderash as the overall representatives of the Roma population in the country. Consequently, the \\"gypsy kings\\" during this period were chosen from among the Kalderash, and policy generally reflected this group's interests, often at the expense of the Polska Roma. Like most other Romani sub-groups within Poland who were not Kalderash, the latter did not recognize the authority of these representatives and did their best to ignore or circumvent it.

Polska Roma, along with other Romani groups in Poland were very much affected. Generally, while other Roma were usually placed in ghettos and then sent to Nazi concentration camps, the German SS usually murdered Polska Roma (as well as the Bergitka Roma) in mass executions in forests and secluded places (for example in the Szczurowa massacre). =After World War II= Roma girls near Konin, 1970 While prior to World War II a small portion of Polska Roma had become sedentary, most continued a traditional nomadic way of life. Unlike the Lovarii and Kalderash, who often engaged in cross-national Europe wide travels, Polska Roma tended to stay within the borders of interwar Poland or neighboring countries. After the war however, the communist government of People's Poland instituted a policy aimed at the \\"settling\\" of the Roma population which had survived the Holocaust. Initially, this took the form of financial incentives - including free housing and \\"settlement funds\\" - but because the policy did not achieve the goals, the communist authorities hoped for, by the late 1950s the policy evolved into one of forced settlement and outright prohibitions against the \\"nomadic\\" lifestyle. All Polska Roma had to register, \\"vagrancy\\" was outlawed, and Roma's parents were often jailed if their children failed to attend the same school throughout the year (which was impossible in the context of a nomadic lifestyle). This forced policy resulted in about 80% of the previously nomadic Roma becoming settled, while a portion of the remainder went underground. Still, others emigrated abroad. The Polska Roma poet Papusza (Bronis≈Çawa Wajs) became nationally renowned during this period, as did her nephew, Edward Dƒôbicki. Polska Roma today Edward Dƒôbicki with the Roma musical group Terno in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski in 2007. Currently, Polska Roma live mostly in southeastern Poland, in the area around Nowy SƒÖcz, in Podhale and Spisz. In June 1991 the M≈Çawa riot occurred, which was a series of violent incidents against Polska Roma that broke out after one Polish man was killed and another Polish man was permanently harmed when a Romani teenager drove into three ethnic Poles in a crosswalk, killing one, then left the scene of the accident. After the accident a rioting mob attacked wealthy Romani settlements in the Polish town of M≈Çawa. Both the M≈Çawa police chief and University of Warsaw sociology researchers said that the pogrom was primarily due to class envy (some Romani have grown wealthy in the gold and automobile trades). At the time, the mayor of the town, as well as the Romani involved and other residents, said the incident was primarily racially motivated. During the coverage of the riot, a change in ethnic stereotypes about Roma in Poland was mentioned: A Roma is no longer poor, dirty, or cheerful. They also do not beg or pretend to be lowly. Nowadays a Roma drives a high status car, lives in a fancy mansion, flaunts his wealth, brags that the local authorities and the police are on his pay and thus he is not afraid of anybody. At the same time he is, as before, a swindler, a thief, a hustler, a dodger of military service and a holder of a legal, decent job.Anna Giza-Poleszczuk, Jan Poleszczuk, Raport \\"Cyganie i Polacy w M≈Çawie - konflikt etniczny czy spo≈Çeczny?\\" (Report \\"Romani and Poles in M≈Çawa - Ethnic or Social Conflict?\\") commissioned by Centre for Public Opinion Research, Warsaw, December 1992, pp. 16- 23, Sections III and IV \\"Cyganie w PRL-u stosunki z polskƒÖ wiƒôkszo≈õciƒÖ w M≈Çawie\\" and \\"Lata osiemdziesiƒÖte i dziewiƒôƒádziesiƒÖte\\".

It is the only public high school in the Selma City School System. History Selma High School was formed in 1970 in response to court-ordered integration, merging the former white A.G. Parrish High School and the former black R.B. Hudson High School. The school was housed in the building of Parrish High, which was constructed in 1939. R.B. Hudson's building was converted to Westside Junior High School, was renamed Selma Middle CHAT Academy and, in 2012, became known as R.B. Hudson Middle School. The high school building was demolished in 2011 and replaced with a new building that opened in August 2012; the former main entrance has been preserved as one wall of the media center. In 1990, Selma High received national attention for a series of protests addressing the school's tracking procedures, which based students' class choices on \\"ability grouping\\" tracks. Ethnic minority students formed a larger percentage of the lower tracks, while the most advanced curriculum had primarily white students. In 1990, a group of students, led by Rose Sanders, a local activist and the wife of the local state senator, led protests at the high school against this policy and the dismissal of the system's first black superintendent, Norward Roussell. The protests were successful in removing the tracking programs at Selma High and in drawing larger attention to the racial disparities in these programs. During the 1989-1990 academic year an incident occurred on school grounds that resulted in one student being shot. In response, the then governor Guy Hunt ordered the National Guard and state troopers to the high school. As a result of the protests and the school shooting, many white parents withdrew their children to attend county or private schools. This led to increasing segregation in the school system, as of April 2011, Selma High had only five white students and enrollment had shrunk from approximately 1,500 to below 1,000. Athletics Selma High's sports teams compete in the Alabama High School Athletics Association's 6A classification. As of 2014, the school fielded teams in American football, basketball, baseball, wrestling, track and field, volleyball and softball. The school won the 1946 AA, 1947 AA (as A.G. Parrish High), 1977 4A, and 1994 6A state boys' basketball championship, as well as golf championships in 1949 and 1950 (as A.G. Parrish High). The school holds the record for most consecutive victories in basketball (73, including playoff games and 88 regular season games) and most state tournament appearances.

The inaugural winners were the short-lived La Rochelle club (during World War II the club was forced to merge with the town's rugby union club, Atlantique Stade Rochelais, by the Vichy Government of the time). When rugby league was legalised again at the end of the war the cup was re- instituted as the National Cup and was played between 1945 and 1962. Two now defunct clubs dominated the post war years; Facture from near Bordeaux in the Gironde won the cup five times and Lavardac from Aquitaine, which folded in the 1980s, won it on four occasions. There was no cup played from 1963 to 1976. It was relaunched in 1977 for amateur clubs and known as the French Federal Cup. From 1992 the competing clubs have vied for the Coupe Falcou, named in memory of Albert Falcou (1911‚Äì1990) who devoted his life to the cause of rugby league.

The consumption and production of marketed food are spatially separated. Production is primarily in rural areas while consumption is in urban areas. Agricultural marketing is the process that overcomes this separation, allowing produce to be moved from an area of surplus to one of need. Food reaches the consumer by a complex network, involving production, assembly, sorting, packing, reassembly, distribution and retail stages. In developing countries the linkage between the producer and the retailer is still usually provided by assembly and wholesale markets, where wholesale marketing takes place using a variety of transaction methods. Recent years have seen an expansion of wholesale marketing in European and former CIS countries. On the other hand, the growth of supermarkets in many regions has seen the development of direct marketing and a reduced role for wholesale systems.  Types of wholesale market  Wholesale markets can either be primary, or terminal, markets, situated in or close to major conurbations, or secondary markets. The latter are generally found only in larger developing countries where they are located in district or regional cities, taking the bulk of their produce from rural assembly markets that are located in production areas The distinction between rural assembly markets and secondary wholesale markets is that secondary wholesale markets are in permanent operation (rather than being seasonal in nature or dealing in specialized produce), larger volumes of produce are traded than at the rural assembly markets and specialized functions may be present, such as commission agents and brokers. Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channeled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc. Produce may also be assembled for export. In some countries, such as India and China, terminal markets also supply other parts of the country. For example, New Delhi serves as a distribution centre to the south of India for apples grown in the Himalayan foothills. The problems of terminal wholesale markets are usually ones of congestion caused by an unsuitable location or by an inappropriate mixture of wholesale and retail functions. Traditionally, wholesale markets were built adjacent to city centres, located at a focal point of the inter- city transport facilities and close to the main retailing areas. Population growth, changes in urban land-use patterns and the development of modern transport systems have all influenced the suitability and functionality of existing sites.  Transaction methods  Wholesale vegetable market in India. Wholesaling facilitates the economic function of buying and selling (usually termed as \\"price formation\\") by allowing the forces of supply and demand to converge to establish a single price for a commodity. The wholesaler may also perform storage and warehousing functions, as well as allowing economies of scale to be obtained in the transportation of produce from farm to market. The people involved in wholesaling can act simply as merchants, buying and selling produce, can be brokers dealing in orders rather than goods, or can be commission agents. Prices are normally established by negotiation but some wholesale markets use the auction system. The auction is compulsory in all wholesale markets in big cities in Japan. A comparison of the Japanese system with that in Brisbane, Australia, found that prices moved more frequently and with a greater degree of volatility in Japan than those at Brisbane.Kobayashi, K. and Vining, G. India Comparison of wholesale vegetable prices in Japan- auction market and Australia-negotiating market.  Wholesaling trends  Haikou wholesale vegetable market, China. Wholesale markets develop in a number of stages. They start as general markets, then become more specialized by trading in specific types of products. A later stage is to transact only graded and well-packaged produce. A recent trend in Western Europe and the USA is for large retailers to by-pass the wholesale market system. Direct links are created between producers and supermarket chains, often by means of contract farming arrangements or through the use of preferred suppliers. Following the collapse of the iron curtain a large number of markets were developed in Eastern and Central Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s. Examples include markets in Warsaw, Gdansk, Budapest, and Bucharest. In other parts of the world, new markets have been built in Amman, Cairo and Mumbai, among many recent developments. Very few new wholesale markets have been built in western countries in the last decades, although old markets have been relocated to new sites (e.g. the new Covent Garden Market relocated to Nine Elms in London and Rome's new wholesale market, relocated from the centre to the east of the city). Those that already exist have tended to also attract warehouses for integrated food distribution, changing their role to \\"food centers\\" (in the USA) and including other non-fresh food products. Wholesale markets still have a role in the marketing of horticultural produce but the traditional fresh meat and fish wholesale markets, particularly those dealing with wholesale live produce, are generally being closed down in major urban centres. In developing countries, changes in work patterns, particularly the employment of women, and the impact of technological innovations in post-harvest handling, food processing and storage, including the use of domestic refrigerators, tends to encourage the development of one-stop shopping at supermarkets, often on a once-a-week basis. The challenge for wholesale markets in such a trading environment is to retain turnover, both by providing new services to supermarkets and by developing services to the non-supermarket trade and the growing hotel and catering sectors.  Representative bodies  The World Union of Wholesale Markets (WUWM) aims to represent wholesale markets internationally, and promote the exchange of information between them for mutual benefit.

According to Njals Saga, he was the son of Sighvat the Red, but Landn√°mab√≥k asserts that Mord was Sighvat's grandson. Mord was the father of Unn Mordardottir, who for a time was married to Hr√∫tr Herj√≥lfsson.

Even when men were compared, and noblemen therein were pointed to, all men easily saw that Gunnhild thought that at the bottom there must be sheer thoughtlessness, or else envy, if any man was said to be Hr√∫tr 's equal.

Earlier, more prudish translations such as Sir George W. DaSent's 1861 edition merely reported cryptically that Hr√∫tr and Unn \\"did not pull together well as man and wife\\" and that Hr√∫tr \\"was not master of himself.\\" It was Mord who masterminded Unn's divorce from Hr√∫tr by advising her on procedures she could use to name witnesses and announce the divorce while Hrut was away.Byock 14-17.

It refers to itself as \\"arts enterprise software\\". History and business model Tessitura was originally developed by and for the Metropolitan Opera of New York. One of the aspects which distinguishes Tessitura from most other commercial software is the business model chosen by the Metropolitan Opera to commercialize what was originally custom software. The Metropolitan Opera maintains ownership of the intellectual property in the original software, but established a separate organization called Tessitura Network (as a not-for-profit corporation with 501(c)3 status under United States tax law) to manage the ongoing development and support of the system. The Tessitura Network now licenses users, handles management, maintenance and development of the system, and fosters an active exchange of best practices and knowledge sharing within the nonprofit arts and cultural sector. The Tessitura Network is effectively a cooperative enterprise, governed via a board elected by and from, and representative of, the licensees of the system. This business model has an obvious resonance with the not-for-profit and self-governing ethos of the arts community, and is one reason for the dominance Tessitura has rapidly achieved in the (deliberately restricted) market in which it operates‚ÄìEnglish-speaking, not-for-profit, arts organizations with a need for ticketing and fundraising systems. System functionality The Tessitura system is designed to be flexible, customizable, and open, and therefore can be tailored for each organization. Functional areas include ticketing, fundraising, constituent relationship management, Web API, and marketing tools.

Life and career Elsie Leslie as Little Lord Fauntleroy (1888), photographed by Napoleon Sarony Leslie's first role in 1884 was Little Meenie in Joseph Jefferson's production of Rip Van Winkle. In 1887, she was recognized as a star with her performance in Editha's Burglar opposite E. H. Sothern at the Lyceum Theatre in New York. She achieved further fame with her roles in Little Lord Fauntleroy in 1888 and The Prince and the Pauper in 1890. The most enduring image of Leslie is the portrait of her, posing as Little Lord Fauntleroy, painted by William Merritt Chase. Leslie lived in the rarefied kingdom of the theater. She moved amongst and conversed with people everywhere she went and her friends were not only nearly all adults, they were among the most accomplished in the nation. She had pen pals everywhere with whom she maintained a lively correspondence, including leading actors, actresses and statesmen. \\"I like to write letters,\\" she once said, \\"but I like to get the answers still better.\\"34\\\\.

Keller and Leslie met in 1890 when the latter was starring in Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper. Both girls shared a friendship with Leslie's patron, John Spaulding, and he called them his \\"two darlings\\". Leslie took a break from acting, but returned to the stage in 1898 to play parts in The Rivals, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Christian, The Taming of the Shrew, The Man on the Case in 1907, and Louis N.

Drumm (1909-1990) was a government official who specialized in U.S. government relations with private industry. Military career In June 1941 Drumm joined the U.S. Army as an enlisted man, and was commissioned a lieutenant in January 1943. He spent most of the war assigned to the Second Service Command of the Army Service Forces at Governor‚Äôs Island, New York. His job was to screen civilian applicants for sensitive positions in privately operated war plants. He also helped make arrangements for visiting dignitaries, and participated in the ceremonies associated with Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs homecoming visit to New York in June 1945. In July 1945 Drumm became an aide to General Jacob Devers, Commander of the Army Ground Forces, and worked at the Pentagon until his discharge in May 1946. Government career After his discharge, Drumm obtained a job at the War Assets Administration, an agency responsible for disposing of surplus property acquired by the U.S. government during World War II. Drumm worked as an assistant to the WAA administrator, General Robert Littlejohn, and also in the Office of Real Property Disposal, the branch of WAA that disposed of surplus industrial plants and real estate. The WAA was abolished in June 1949 and Drumm transferred to the Department of Defense. He spent the summer and fall of 1949 making a survey of management practices at the Army Corps of Engineers. In December 1949 he was sent to London, England, where he joined the staff of the North Atlantic Defense Production Board. The Board was a NATO agency that helped coordinate defense production by NATO countries. The Board was dissolved in May 1952 and Drumm was transferred to Paris where he worked briefly for the U.S. Special Representative, Europe. In late 1952 Drumm returned to Washington, D.C., and assumed a position with the Foreign Operations Administration where he worked until 1954. He then worked for the Bureau of the Budget on projects involving the disposal of surplus real property. In 1958 he transferred to the Business and Defense Services Administration, a branch of the Department of Commerce, where he served as Assistant Administrator and Administrator. In early 1962 Drumm was sent to France where he served as Counselor for Commercial Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. In this position he collected information on French business developments which he reported to the Departments of State and Commerce. He also assisted U.S. companies that were interested in doing business in France, and French companies that were interested in doing business in the U.S. In 1967 Drumm returned to the United States and served in the Office of Field Services in the Department of Commerce. This office coordinated the work of various field offices in the United States that provided information to domestic businesses. In 1971 Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce, appointed Drumm the first Ombudsman for Business. As ombudsman, Drumm helped private businesses in their dealings with various U.S. government agencies. Later career Drumm retired from government service in July 1973 and went to work for Macmillan, Inc., a New York City publishing company specializing in non-fiction and educational works. Drumm was placed in charge of Macmillan‚Äôs Washington, DC, office. He was responsible for handling Macmillan‚Äôs contacts with government agencies. He also lobbied Congress in matters regarding copyright legislation and other matters of concern to the publishing industry. In 1980 a European conglomerate acquired Macmillan, Inc., in a hostile takeover and many high-level executives lost their positions. Drumm was ordered to close the Washington office. For a few months he continued his work for the company out of his home but in November 1980 was forced to retire. External links * Papers of Thomas E. Drumm, Dwight D.

The term was introduced by Marc Aug√© in his work Non-Places, introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity.Marc Aug√©, Non-Places: An Introduction to Anthropology of Supermodernity, Le Seuil, 1992, Verso, p. 122. The perception of a space like a non-place, however, is strictly subjective: any given individual can view any given location as a non place, or as a crossroads of human relations. For instance, a shopping mall is not a non- place for a person who works there every day. The concept of non-place is opposed, according to Aug√©, to the notion of \\"anthropological place\\". The place offers people a space that empowers their identity, where they can meet other people with whom they share social references. The non-places, on the contrary, are not meeting spaces and do not build common references to a group. Finally, a non-place is a place we do not live in, in which the individual remains anonymous and lonely. Aug√© avoids making value judgments on non-places and looks at them from the perspective of an ethnologist who has a new field of studies to explore. With regard to the classification of shopping malls as non places, more recently an Italian researcher from the University of Bergamo, Marco Lazzari, developed a survey on a large sample of adolescents, and showed that the mall is a place where teens do not meet by chance, nor with the sole purpose to buy something, but to socialize, meet friends and have fun. Whereas shopping malls are (at least in Italy) yet prejudicially regarded by adults as non-places, they seem to be natively concerned with the identity of the so-called digital natives.Marco Lazzari, The role of social networking services to shape the double virtual citizenship of young immigrants in Italy, Proceedings of the IADIS International Conference on ICT, Society and Human Beings 2012, Lisbon, Portugal, July 21‚Äì23, 2012.

Plot Tallulah Bankhead in Tarnished Lady Nancy Courtney, a once wealthy socialite, has had to struggle to maintain a facade of prosperity ever since her father's death. Although she loves writer DeWitt Taylor, who is indifferent to amassing a fortune, her mother urges her to marry stockbroker Norman Cravath instead. Nancy acquiesces to her mother's wishes but, despite the fact her new husband does everything he can to please her, she is miserable in her marriage. Meanwhile, DeWitt has begun romancing Norman's former girl friend Germaine Prentiss, Nancy's long-time rival. She realizes DeWitt's relationship with Germaine is changing him into a social climber. Unaware Norman's firm has just been barred from the stock market and he is facing financial ruin, Nancy tells her husband she is leaving him. She learns of Norman's bankruptcy in the newspaper and, together with her friend Ben Sterner, she goes to a speakeasy where she proceeds to get drunk. She and Ben bring some of the bar patrons to his home, where they encounter Norman, who is waiting there to discuss a business transaction with Ben.

Rugby career Jordan first played first class rugby for Newport Rugby Club, but moved to London to study medicine. While in London he initially played for Guy's Hospital before the exile team, London Welsh was created in 1885. Jordan played in the first London Welsh game, played at the Saracen's ground against London Scottish;Jones (1985), pg 6. alongside fellow Newport player and Wales rugby legend Arthur Gould. When London Welsh took part in their first tour of South Wales, the team took in Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and a South Wales XV over a six-day period. When the team faced Newport, Jordan refereed the match rather than play as he represented both teams.Jones (1985), pg 7. Jordan first represented Wales when he was still with Newport in early 1885, when he was chosen to face England as part of the Home Nations Championship. Wales lost the game, but Jordan played well and scored two tries, one of which Gould, also appearing in his first game for Wales, converted. Jordan returned for the very next match of the tournament against Scotland in a nil-nil draw. Jordan's next game for Wales was his last and took another four years to achieve, and by this time he was playing most of his club rugby for London Welsh. The game was against Scotland and was played as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship, away from home at Raeburn Place, Wales lost to Scotland and Jordan was never selected for Wales again. In the 1888/89 season, Jordan was given the captaincy of London Welsh and the tactical changes he brought to the club during this season is seen as a major factor in changing the club into a respectable opponent in Britain.Jones (1985), pg 12. =International matches played= Wales (rugby union)Smith (1980), pg 468. * 1885 * 1885, 1889  Bibliography    References  Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Newport RFC players Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:1865 births Category:1902 deaths ","title":"Martyn Jordan"},{"id":"20881556","text":"Tan Chung (born 18 April 1929, in Matubahar, JohorChung Tan (ed.), In the Footsteps of Xuanzang: Tan Yun-shan and India (Gyan Books, 1999; ), p. 4.) is an authority on Chinese history, Sino-Indian relations and cultural exchange.

It is located on Encinal peninsula bordered by Corpus Christi Bay on the north, Oso Bay on the west, the Laguna Madre on the east and the King Ranch to the south. South Padre Island Drive crosses Flour Bluff, dividing it into an upper part, commonly known as North Bluff, (mostly occupied by Corpus Christi Naval Air Station), and a lower part, commonly known as South Bluff. The area is mostly made up of suburban development, with a population consisting mostly of lower- middle income families, with local and national businesses such as Walmart, H-E-B grocery stores, etc.  Overview  What is now Flour Bluff Drive was once a railroad branch going off Texas Mexican Railway to the Naval Air Station. Waldron Field, located on the south side of Flour Bluff, was built during World War II and since then has been used as a Navy landing airfield. One can commonly see the orange and white training planes flying around the area. Of historical interest: President George H. W. Bush was relocated at the Navy base for training classes in 1942. One of the numerous airplane crashes of future Senator John McCain was at this Navy base. According to the Historical Marker located on SH 358 eastbound, near Laguna Shores Road, just west of the JFK Memorial causeway, in the spring of 1838 France blockaded the coast of Mexico during the Pastry War, so-called because the casus belli of the war being a French pastry chef seeking reparations for his destroyed pastry shop, allegedly by Mexican officers. The strategic location of Corpus Christi Bay led to the revival of smuggling in this area. Supplies were carried overland across the Rio Grande, and the illicit trade flourished as Mexico bought sorely needed goods in Texas. President Sam Houston did not wish to antagonize Mexico. However, Mexican patrols at Corpus Christi offended many Texans. In July, 1838, authorities in Texana, Texas heard reports of Mexican activity near the bay. A captured Mexican sea captain said that his government had declared Corpus Christi a port of entry and had dispatched about 400 men to protect it. A summons was issued, calling Texans to rally at Texana on August 7 to drive the Mexicans from the Republic's boundaries. By the time the volunteers reached the area, some of the Mexicans had landed their supplies near the tip of Corpus Christi Bay and returned to Matamoros. The rest scattered, leaving behind about 100 barrels of flour and parts of a steam engine. The Texans confiscated the usable flour and other contraband, and the site became known as Flour Bluff. Education Flour Bluff is home to the Flour Bluff Independent School District. Six campuses and athletic facilities are located on a single 170 acre site which supports 5,600 students in prekindergarten through 12th grades. Flour Bluff High School came under fire in 2011 in a scandal that received national attention, due to the district's initial refusal to allow students to form a GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) on campus, despite allowing FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) factions in their high school and junior high. (FBISD initially denied the formation of the GSA due to the fact that it was a 'non-curricular' club. When it was pointed out that the FCA and other clubs were also non-curricular, and still allowed to meet on campus, all clubs were briefly suspended. Due to parent and student outrage, several clubs were reinstated.) This refusal was found to contradict the First Amendment, as well as the Equal Access Act.https://aclu- wa.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Equal%20Access%20Act%20FAQs.pdf In Spring 2011, a petition was circulated to allow the formation of the GSA. The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) sent a letter to Superintendent Carbajal on March 2, 2011, requesting the formation of the club be allowed.http://www.aclutx.org/2011/03/02/flourbluffgsa/ It was eventually decided that the GSA be allowed to form, and meet on campus. Recreation Flour Bluff is bordered on the East by the Laguna Madre, renowned for its fine Red Drum, (or Redfish) and Trout fishing. The Boat Hole, accessed from the North Bluff is an area between the Naval Air Station on the west and Dimmit's Island on the east; Corpus Christi Bay to the north and the Boat Hole flats (immediately north of the JFK Causeway) to the south provides excellent fishing. Deeper draft boats come in from the bay, while shallower boats can use the channel that parallels Flour Bluff to the north of the JFK causeway. One of Flour Bluff's many parks, Waldron Park, is also the site of a 9-hole disc golf course.

The debate as to how this should occur was first started in 2004, lasting until 2008. Three options were put forward at the start of 2008 as to what kind of education system would be best to move forward with. However, as all included the closure of large numbers of island schools, they produced a negative reaction with many local islanders, resulting in protests occurring in the main towns of Newport, Ryde, Shanklin and Sandown. A final decision was made in May, announcing which schools would be closed. The decision was made based on all three options put forward, instead of going down one definite path. The reforms were first implemented in September 2008, with everything aimed at completion by September 2010. History In 2004, the Isle of Wight Council undertook a consultative process aimed at changing local education structure, to a two tier school system which would bring the island in line with the rest of the country. The move was opposed by a lobby known as Standards not Tiers based in Upper Ventnor and the Conservatives, who, after they won the local council elections in May 2005 shelved the proposals pending further investigation. The Annual Performance Assessment of the Isle of Wight Council's Education and Children's Social Care Services 2005, carried out by Office for Standards in Education and the Commission for Social Care Inspection, found low levels of achievements for pupils in schools and a lack of significant and sustained progress over the last five years. Overall, the Isle of Wight Council‚Äôs capacity to improve its services for children and young people was judged to be 'adequate', out of the four ratings 'very good', 'promising', 'adequate' or 'inadequate'. In 2006, the regional Learning and Skills Council proposed an option which meant replacing the secondary schools' sixth forms with central provision at the Isle of Wight College. In January 2007, the authority rejected this proposal, and instead offered its own, which included a reduced number of secondary schools and the retention of Year 9 pupils in Middle schools, extending their range to form 9‚Äì14 schools and 14‚Äì19 provision at High Schools, an arrangement adopted nowhere else in the United Kingdom. The debate took on new urgency at the start of 2008, when three 'key options' were put forward by the Isle of Wight Council for public consultation, each of which meant the closure of at least half of the Island's primary schools. On 14 January 2008, the Council announced that at least 23 primary schools and one middle school (expected to be Nodehill Middle School) would be closed, whichever education pathway was chosen in March. Protests A banner campaigning to save Chale Primary School from closure. The 'biggest protest the Island has ever seen' occurred outside County Hall in Newport on 26 January 2008 at 10:00am lasting an hour until 11:00am, led by Isle of Wight Radio DJ Alex Dyke as a result of the Council's plans for education reforms. Between 1,000 and 1,250 took part in the protest, including parents, teachers and students. The Island MP Andrew Turner, with two other councillors also attended the protest, disagreeing with the plans. Later protests also occurred at Shanklin through the leader of the Isle of Wight Council, Councillor David Pugh's ward, with a silent march through the town. Later protests occurred at Sandown and Ryde, with a final protest taking place again in Newport. Final Decision It was finally announced on 23 May 2008 which schools would be closed.iwcp.co.uk, 23 May 2008 School reform plans revealed The final decision took parts of all three options, bringing the island into line with the rest of England with a two-tier system. Three primary schools will close completely, with 15 others no longer operating on their current sites. St Helens Primary, Chale CE Primary, and Weston Primary School were all announced to be closing completely, while others are amalgamated onto existing primary or middle school sites. As a two-tier system requires no middle schools, by September 2010 there will be 38 primary schools in total and six high schools. The sites of existing middle schools will either be used for new amalgamated primary schools or new sites for high schools. Forelands Middle School and Nodehill Middle School are currently the only middle school sites which will have no use after their closure. Implementation The new Christ the King College, on the former Trinity Middle School site. The first stages of implementation took place in September 2008, with the final stages aimed at being complete by September 2010. This involved ABK Middle School and Trinity Middle School merging to form Christ the King College. Although the site currently only takes years 5‚Äì8, by the time the system is fully implemented it will take a full age range. Kitbridge Middle School also merged with Downside Middle School. So far, two headteachers from both Medina High School and Cowes High School have announced they will be stepping down before the start of the new term in September, stating the education reforms as an influence to their decision.

He captained the Duke of York, bringing the first settlers to South Australia in 1836. His life in the British whaling industry has been recorded in the book The Man Who Hunted Whales (2011) by Dorothy M. Heinrich.The Man Who Hunted Whales - A Tale of Kangaroo Island and a Doomed Ship by Dorothy M. Heinrich, 2011. His diaries are held in the State Library of New South Wales. Birth Morgan was born on 13 March 1798 at Deptford, Kent in England. This is recorded in his diary. His parentage is not known. No conclusive record of his birth has been found. In his diary he does not mention his parentage apart from a few cryptic remarks. On Sunday 5 February 1837 he states, ‚ÄúI could not say that I had a praying Father or a praying mother or a Brother or Sister for I lost them young and knew little of them. I was cast on the world at the age of 11 years to walk the journey of life‚Äù. Religious awakening About ten days before sailing on his first command, he happened upon a revival meeting, and the result to him was eventful. This would have been in 1828. That revival service in Greenwich was led by Isaac English (baker and lay preacher). Before he took up his first command in December 1828 on the Sir Charles Price he had been a reckless, boisterous profligate, living without a thought of God, except to blaspheme his holy name; but Divine grace now wrought so wondrous a change in him, that when he once more went to sea the old hands amongst his crew could scarcely recognise him for the same man. He who once never gave a command unaccompanied by an oath was now never heard to swear; and such was the force of his character and the power of his example, that in a few months' time not a man of his crew dared to use a profane expression while within his hearing. The discipline of the ship was not a bit lessened, and every one was happier, from the sobriety and good feeling of which the captain set example.Sunday at Home, published 1874 and the other in the Australian Christian Commonwealth, published 1913 (both out of copyright). Robert Clark Morgan attended the West Greenwich Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, which was founded in King George Street, very close to Blissett Street, in 1816. The foundation stone of the Wesleyan Chapel in George Street was laid in September 1816 and it was opened on December sixteenth of the same year. It was capable of seating 1,000 people. The building may still be there although it has not been used as a chapel for a very long time. Wife and family On 30 December 1822, at Deptford, Kent, at the Church of St. Nicholas,St. Nicholas http://www.deptfordchurch.org/ Christopher Marlowe is buried in the Church graveyard Robert Clark Morgan married Mary Dorrington. He was 25 and she was 22. He had a lifelong devotion to her. He states that they met when very young - the choice of my youth is an expression he often used in his diaries.Robert Clark Morgan (1798-1864) His personal Diary http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au:1083/record=b1007037 The marriage was registered as: > ‚ÄúRobert Morgan Clark, bachelor of this Parish and Mary Dorrington, spinster > of ('this', written, then deleted) the Parish of Greenwich were married in > this Church by Banns this 30th Day of December in the Year one thousand > eight hundred and twenty two, by me, D.

This Marriage was > solemnised between us (signed:) Robert Morgan Clark Mary Dorrington In the > presence of { X The mark of James Gittens and {Elizabeth Dorrington‚Äù The reason his marriage was solemnised in the surname of Clark is unknown. They had seven children, most dying shortly after birth. There was a daughter, Louisa Clark Morgan, who died at 7 years of age and only one child, also named Robert Clark Morgan, survived the Captain and his wife. Both were baptised at the George Street Wesleyan chapel. Royal Navy He entered the Royal Navy at the age of eleven, his diaries state that at that age (he was) sent to sea on board a man o' war. He talks of the man o' war as \\"a place where all wickedness is committed with greediness and a place where he saw every vice man is capable of committing\\". South Sea whaling When he left the Royal Navy, in 1814 towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he transferred to the merchant marine, whaling. He began as an apprentice on , becoming an able seaman and rising to first and second Mate, and became a Master at an early age. One of the voyages on Phoenix is described in the book The Dalton Journal edited by Niel Gunson. Morgan is not mentioned by name. However, there is a reference to the second mate, which Morgan would have been at that time. Morgan was the master of the ships and Recovery, both owned by Daniel Bennett, an owner of many south sea whaling ships, and , owned by the South Australian Company. She was the first pioneer ship to reach South Australia.\\"The barque Duke of York - first pioneer ship to arrive\\", History South Australia. His whaling career in the Phoenix was: Apprentice June 1814 - June 1819, Able Seaman June 1819 - Sept 1822, second Mate Jan 1823 - Nov 1825, first Mate May 1826 - Sept 1828. Sir Charles Price, Master Dec 1828 - June 1831. Recovery, Master Dec 1831 - June 1835. Duke of York, Master Feb 1836 - Aug 1837. In his diary later in life he reminisces about his whaling experiences: > \\"Early this morning I went on deck. It was a fine beautiful morning, a clear > atmosphere and fine blue sky with the ocean with only a few rippling over > its surface. I saw a ship and went to the masthead and saw she had her boats > down. Afterwards I saw the sperm whales she was after. She had taken whales > before as she was boiling oil and the smoke was going in volleys from her > tryworks. The whales were going as nearly as fast as the ship so we kept > pace with them for 2 - 3 hours till at last one boat struck a large whale > then another struck the same whale and eventually killed it and took it > alongside. Oh how vivid did this bring back all my past experience in this > work. The days of my youth and manhood was spent in this trade. This was the > part of it I loved. A sight of a whale would make my heart jump and take > away all relish for food. How happy if when a boy I could get to be let down > in a boat and after I came to manhood how happy if I could but get to kill a > whale and I always managed to get my share.

I will not repine how > many hairs breaths escapes have I had in whaling, how many times has God > spared my life when my boat has been staven, time after time.\\" South Australia George Fife Angas appointed Captain Morgan master of . The South Australian Company had fitted her to take the first settlers to South Australia,http://Bound for South Australia - Passenger Lists for Emigrants to South Australia 1836-1851 freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dicummings/SAShips1836-1840.htm and then go whaling after that. Duke of York sailed from St Katharine Docks on 26 February 1836. Duke of York finally set sail for the sea on Saturday 19 March 1836, having been unable to get away from the English coast due to bad weather for some five weeks. She carried 42 persons including the crew. (Another source said she left England on 5 April). Some passengers, including some adults whose passage was charged to the Emigration Fund, were on board as well. The First Report of the Commissioners of Colonisation of South Australia gave the ship's complement as thirty-eight. A list compiled from the Company's records gave the names of twenty passengers and twenty-six seamen, in addition to the Captain. Several of the passengers listed had significant appointments in the service of the South Australian Company. Samuel Stephens was the first Colonial Manager, and on behalf of his employers, he established the settlement of Kingscote as a site for their projected whaling venture. From its location in relation to the mouth of the River Murray, and the Gulfs of St Vincent and Spencer, he considered it as a possible shipping port for the future. Another of the passengers, Thomas Hudson Beare, was Superintendent of Buildings and Labourers, while D.H. Schreyvogel was engaged as a clerk. Charles Powell and W. West were gardeners; Henry Mitchell was a butcher; and John Neale was an assistant carpenter. They reached Kangaroo Island in South Australia and disembarked on 27 July 1836. When in sight of the island the previous evening Captain Morgan, a devout Wesleyan, gathered the passengers for a prayer meeting. When they landed Samuel Stephens named the river Morgan; it is now called Cygnet. Soon after landing Stephens conducted a short service to give thanks for their safe arrival. This was probably the first religious service on the shores of South Australia. Most of the passengers wished to be the first to land in the new colony, but Captain Morgan settled the dispute very cleverly. He instructed the second mate Robert Russell to have some sailors row the youngest child ashore. This was two and a half year old Elizabeth Beare, daughter of the Company's Deputy Manager, Thomas Hudson Beare. Russell was instructed to carry the child through the shallow water and place her feet on the beach while the adults were at dinner. In doing so she was the first white female to set foot on that strand. When this happened the crew began to cheer and the passengers soon realised that a landing had been made without them knowing it. The Company had dispatched , , , and , with the intention that after they had delivered their passengers they commence whaling operations. After leaving Kangaroo Island Duke of York sailed on 20 September 1836 to hunt whales. She was at Hobart Town from 27 September 1836 to 18 October to refresh; from there she proceeded to the South Sea whaling grounds. On Friday, 10 February 1837 Morgan heard of the wreck of the ship Active in the Fiji Islands and they took on board its Master, Captain Dixon, Willings the mate, and Wilkey. Duke of York was whaling up the coast of Queensland when she was shipwrecked off Port Curtis (in Queensland) on 14 July 1837. Port Curtis is near current day Gladstone, Queensland. The whole ship's company got into three boats and rowed and sailed 300 miles to Brisbane, where they arrived Saturday 26 August 1837 after a most uncomfortable time. On the way down aboriginals killed an English crewman George Glansford, of Barking Essex, and a Rotumah native boy, named Bob, when the boats put in for water. There are parts of Morgan's diary that related to George's death. The Captain said that he was a young man, probably, early 20s. The Captain used to get George down to his cabin for religious instruction. He said that he recalled the Captain writing that George was not a hardened rough type. George apparently accepted his religious teaching. It seems as the captain had a sort of parental role over George. His journal that covers the period that he was master of Duke of York is water marked to attest to this experience. They finally arrive at Morton Bay and the steamer James Watt took Captain Morgan, the Mate and nineteen survivors on to Sydney, leaving the remainder to follow in another vessel. London Missionary Society On Tuesday, 6 February 1838, three days after he arrived home from Sydney, he visited the Secretary of the London Missionary Society to see if he could take command of the missionary ship Camden. On 10 February he met the missionary John Williams, who was looking to travel back to Samoa with his wife Mary. Morgan sailed in the Pacific in Camden from April 1838 till July 1843. He was with Williams in 1839 when Williams and Harris were murdered in the New Hebrides island of Erromango, now Vanuatu. The London Missionary Society invited children all over the country to contribute to buying a ship in Williams's memory so that his work could continue. Seven mission ships named John Williams were successively bought in this way. When Camden returned to England, Morgan became captain of the London Missionary Society's first such ship, John Williams, and sailed it for 3 voyages: June 1844 - May 1847, October 1847 - May 1850 and July 1851 - June 1855. In 1841 the Samoan Brethren suggested that he sit for his portrait http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/prints/viewPrint.cfm?ID=PAD3682 when next in Sydney. However, it was finally done in London. The original artwork is held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, and was displayed in the offices of the London Missionary Society. There was a copy reproduced in the journal The Congregationalist (June 1962 at p. 3) with an article about him. Retirement from the sea Captain Morgan retired from the sea at the end of the voyage in 1855. As far as can be seen in his diary that covers the period from 16 June 1861 - 29 March 1862 Diaries held by his great great grandson (Robert Hamilton Morgan) he spent a lot of his time visiting the sick. His final diary that covers the period 15 March 1863 to 31 March 1864 tells of the voyage the Captain and Mrs Morgan made to Melbourne, Australia on the Yorkshire from about 30 March 1863 to l9 June 1863. It appears they came to be near their only surviving child (Robert Clark Morgan II). The son was baptised on 10 July 1829 at the Wesleyan Chapel George St. Greenwich. In the 1851 census Robert Clark Morgan II (aged 21) was residing in England with his patents at 83A Lower Road Deptford (also in the household was Mary A Wallace, niece, aged 22, born in Greenwich, Kent). His occupation is shown as a Clerk at the East India Docks. He had lived in Samoa with his parents for a while and went to Sydney in 1849. He then went to Melbourne arriving in about 1852 at the time of the gold rush. He joined the Victorian civil service on 20 September 1852 as a Revenue Collector. He died in Melbourne, Australia at the age of 87 years a very wealthy man. Death Morgan died 23 September 1864 at Arthur St, South Yarra, Victoria, Australia, at the home of his son, aged 66. His dying words are that when he was asked by his son if he wanted anything was: ‚ÄúI want more love, more love to the Father, more love to the Son and more love to the Holy Spirit\\".Recorded in the Australian Christian Commonwealth The headstone reads: > Sacred to the memory of Robert Clark Morgan who died 23 September 1864, aged > 66.

Murray in his book, Forty Years Mission Work, said \\"I have known many eminent Christians during my not-short life, but I have never met a more lovable, a more Christian like man than was Captain Morgan\\"Forty Years Mission Work, Reverent A.W. Murray. On 12 February 1866, Mary Morgan (n√©e Dorrington) his wife, died at Arthur Street. On her death certificate it said she was born at Greenwich, Kent.The 1851 Census record it records Mary as born in Whitechapel, in the County of Middlesex.

She was the first delegate from the Distrito Federal, to win an edition of this pageant since the inauguration of the city, on 21 April 1960. Currently, she works as jewel designer, manager and philanthropist.Edited by her brother Childhood First daughter of an attorney born in Cear√° state and a manager from Minas Gerais, Jacqueline moved to Distrito Federal seven months old. Before her election at Miss Distrito Federal pageant, in March 1987, she worked in a local bank as a receptionist and conciliated that work with her modelling career. Miss Brazil win In March 1987, Jacqueline defeated other 15 contestants in a district pageant for the telecast of Miss Brazil pageant, held on 4 April on Anhembi Convention Pallace and broadcast nationally on SBT. Television career After her coronation, Jacqueline was invited to take a role in the permanent cast of popular comedy show A Pra√ßa √© Nossa, hosted and created by Carlos Alberto de N√≥brega, after his dismissal from Rede Bandeirantes, where he hosted a show called Pra√ßa Brasil. At same time, the new Miss Brazil got ready for the Miss Universe 1987, held in Singapore on 26 May and also broadcast by SBT and, worldwide, by American-based network CBS. Meirelles won the pageant's National Costume Award. It was the last great beauty contest win for the country until SBT's cancellation of Miss Brazil 1990. After that, the beauty pageant faced a lack of interest by the audience for the next decade. After her reigning ended in 1988, Jacqueline hosted a SBT Wednesday movie session top-watched called Cinema em Casa. In 1989, she moved to Rede Manchete, where acted as co-host of daytime women show Mulher 90 with a future MTV Brasil VJ, Astrid Fontenelle. She has also acted as a merchandising girl for the shows hosted by Gugu Liberato and invited by the weekly regular program Hebe Camargo, both aired on SBT. On TV Gazeta, appeared regularly on the daytime show Mulheres. In 1995, Meirelles was a host of a syndicated show called Vivendo com Classe (Living with Class), where she showcased sophisticate automobiles and their modern features. Model works Jacqueline began as a professional model in a defunct agency Jet Set, and since 1991 she is exclusive for S√£o Paulo-based firm L'Equipe. She appeared on the cover of several magazines such as Nova, Cl√°udia, Minha and M√£e.

Founded in 1917, it initially advocated responsible government for Southern Rhodesia within the British Empire, as opposed to incorporation into the Union of South Africa. When responsible government was achieved in 1923, the party became the governing Rhodesia Party. It endured until 1934, when it merged with the right wing of the Reform Party to create the United Party, which remained in power for 28 years afterwards, and was itself defunct by 1965. HistoryResponsible Government Association (1917‚Äì23)= Led by Sir Charles Coghlan, a Bulawayo lawyer originally from South Africa, the RGA was formed in 1917, and fought the 1920 election to the colony's Legislative Council. The party's main platform was one in favour of responsible government for Southern Rhodesia within the British Empire, and against incorporation into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910 by the British South Africa Act, 1909. In this campaign the RGA was allied to the Labour Party, whilst its main opponents were the Unionists, who advocated integration into South Africa. A government referendum was organised in 1922, and responsible government won the day. Southern Rhodesia was duly made self-governing and semi-independent within the Empire in October 1923. =Rhodesia Party (1923‚Äì34)= Coghlan became the first Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and the party continued as the Rhodesia Party, which had a broader base of support, including a number of former unionists in its cabinet. It remained in power until September 1933, when the party narrowly topped the popular vote, but lost the election, winning only nine of the 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new prime minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the Rhodesia Party merged with the Reform Party's more rightist members in 1934 to form the United Party. =Legacy= With Huggins at the helm, the United Party roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party in an election held the same year. The United Party thereafter remained in government for nearly three decades, with Huggins leading it until his retirement in 1956. The party renamed itself the United Rhodesia Party in 1953, soon after Southern Rhodesia was federated with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and merged with the Federal Party in 1958 to become the United Federal Party. Its leaders included Garfield Todd and Edgar Whitehead, both of whom pursued mildly reformist policies which led to expanded political participation by black Africans. It was removed from power by the Rhodesian Front's 1962 electoral victory, and was inactive by 1965. The Rhodesia Party name was revived twice. Following the UFP's electoral defeat in 1962, the opposition would regroup under the RP moniker and Roy Welensky unsuccessfully attempted to re-enter Parliament, pursuing a moderate platform in opposition to the RF government and UDI. In 1973, the name was revived again by white moderates who entered the 1974 election on a reformist platform but won no seats.

It is located in the northwest part of the city. It is located in Nueces County, in the Coastal Bend. It is bound to the north by the Nueces River, which also marks the boundary between Nueces County and San Patricio County. It is also commonly known as Five Points. Calallen has a population of 27,087. 12,998 residents are male, while 14,089 are women. History Calallen, on Interstate Highway 37 in extreme north central Nueces County, was once an independent town but is now part of Corpus Christi. It was named for Calvin Allen, who donated land for the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway. A nearby Nueces River dam is named Calallen Dam. The Calallen community received a post office in 1908 with Ira D. Magee as the first postmaster. The post office was discontinued sometime after 1960. In 1914 the town had 150 residents and nine businesses. Its population dwindled to twenty-five by 1925 but reached 100 in 1939; it was 270 by 1965. By 1966 Corpus Christi had annexed Calallen. Transportation Calallen is home to a major intersection point between Interstate 37 and U.S. Highway 77. Southbound Interstate 37 leads approximately 15 miles (24 km) into downtown Corpus Christi , while southbound U.S. Highway 77 leads 28 miles (45 km) to Kingsville , and eventually, 148 miles (238 km) south to Brownsville, in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Highway 77 is one of the two U.S. highways, along with U.S. Highway 281 in Three Rivers, that provides direct access to the Rio Grande Valley from Interstate 37. Despite Calallen being part of the city of Corpus Christi, many northbound U.S Highway 77 vehicles seeking the main city body would've turned eastward at Texas State Highway 44 in Robstown , as this is a shorter and faster route compared to turning eastward at Interstate 37. Northbound U.S Highway 77 vehicles seeking Padre Island and Corpus Christi's southeast suburbs would also rather take FM 665 eastward at Driscoll . After the major intersection, Interstate 37 and U.S. Highway 77 travel about 2 miles north before leaving the city limits and entering San Patricio County . Almost immediately after crossing the Nueces River into the Odem zip code, the two highways split, with Interstate 37 heading northwest towards Mathis (18 miles/ 29 km) and eventually to San Antonio (126 miles/ 203 km), while U.S Highway 77 leads northeast towards Sinton (12 miles/ 19 km) and eventually to Victoria (80 miles/ 129 km). Calallen is also home to the eastern terminus of FM 624, which turns northwest towards Orange Grove (20 miles/ 32 km) and eventually 115 miles (185 km) to Cotulla . Geology While the surrounding communities in the area are generally flat in terrain, many parts of Calallen is rolling due to its position on the valley of the Nueces River. Calallen experiences sea breeze often due to its proximity to the coast.

He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1982 and again from 1987 to 1997. He served as President of the Seaman and Waterfront Workers Union, the National Farmers Union, the Technical and Allied Workers Union. He was leader of the St Lucia Labour Party and the Organisation for National Enlightenment. Career Peter Josie was born in Vieux-Fort, the southernmost town of Saint Lucia. He attended St. Mary's College, the all boys' elite secondary school in Castries. He earned a bachelor's degree in Agronomy from the University of the West Indies in Trinidad. Josie is the only surviving member of the St Lucia group of delegates which discussed and negotiated independence for St Lucia from the British Government. The firebrand leftist Peter Josie was an attendee at the famous but secret meeting of leftist minds on the minuscule Rat Island in 1970, which included members of Grenada's future revolutionary leadership. At the time governments weresuspicious of the motives of these new entrants into the political fray. So fearful were they that they banned the revolutionaries from entering several territories. In one such case on April 16, 1970 S.R. Slater, the Minister of Home Affairs in St Vincent deemed Josie, together with other activists as Dave Darbeau, Geddes Granger (now Makandal Daaga) and Robert \\"Bobby\\" Clarke, to be a prohibited immigrant. He served from 1974 to 1982 as a Member of Parliament for Castries East on the ticket of the Saint Lucia Labour Party. He began his career as Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries and then Minister of Foreign Affairs. After the ill-fated Labour Government fell, he led it unsuccessfully in the General Elections of 1982. He continued with the party and won his seat as an MP for Vieux Fort South in 1987. He had originally entered the political sphere as a black power proponent and member of the St Lucia Forum, together with other well known political figures such as Hilford Deterville, Julian Hunte and George Odlum, which addressed mainly urban St Lucia on a new radical platform for St Lucia's development. It was with the latter he was always associated as they led an agricultural workers trade union and galvanised the then marginalised rural farm labourers. Josie was the perfect foil for the suave Oxford educated Odlum. Whilst Odlum deployed his oratorical skills laced with a command of sometimes stuffy but entertaining English, Josie was more direct making effective use of the widely spoken French Creole to sometimes telling incendiary effect. He was a major controversial player in the ill-fated Labour Party government which was riven by internal wrangling when it formed the government during the abbreviated term between 1979-1982. Odlum and Josie were to fall out in spectacular fashion as they acrimoniously parted ways before the fall of the government. He was thrown out of the Labour Party after campaigning against then leader Julian Hunte for the post of political leader. He switched allegiance to the ruling United Workers Party and became one of its two Ministers with responsibility for Agriculture. He failed to retain his seat in the 1997 General Elections. After the elections he formed a group, the Organisation for National Enlightenment, ONE which he would abandon in the attempt to form a National Alliance with his former arch enemies, John Compton and George Odlum. When this coalition floundered and the Alliance splintered he took to the hustings in 2001 and to make an impression in his old stomping grounds, Castries East on the platform of the National Front. He last appeared at the hustings when he campaigned for Richard Frederick in the by-election of 2005 and the General Elections of 2006. On February 11, 2012 Josie launched his autobiography, Shattered Dreams at the Bay Gardens Hotel. Josie is now closely associated with the campaign of Allen Chastanet, both in attaining the leadership of the opposition United Workers Party and in becoming Prime Minister of St Lucia.

Juran in publications, most notably Juran on Quality by Design. Designing for quality and innovation is one of the three universal processes of the Juran Trilogy, in which Juran describes what is required to achieve breakthroughs in new products, services, and processes. Juran believed that quality could be planned, and that most quality crises and problems relate to the way in which quality was planned. While Quality by Design principles have been used to advance product and process quality in industry, and particularly the automotive industry, they have also been adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the discovery, development, and manufacture of drugs.Pharmaceutical Quality by Design: Product and Process Development, Understanding, and ControlRoadmap for implementation of quality by design (QbD) for biotechnology productsDevelopment of a new predictive modelling technique to find with confidence equivalence zone and design space of chromatographic analytical methods  Juran on Quality by Design  The Juran Trilogy defines the word \\"quality\\" as having two meanings: first, the presence of features that create customer satisfaction; second, the reliability of those features. Failures in features create dissatisfactions, so removing failures is the purpose of quality improvement, while creating features is the purpose of quality by design. Juran's process seeks to create features in response to understanding customer needs. These are customer-driven features. The sum of all features is the new product, service, or process. The Quality by Design model consists of the following steps: # Establish the project design targets and goals. # Define the market and customers that will be targeted. # Discover the market, customers, and societal needs. # Develop the features of the new design that will meet the needs. # Develop or redevelop the processes to produce the features. # Develop process controls to be able to transfer the new designs to operations. It is not a statistical design method like Design for Six Sigma. = Integrated planning = Integrated planning requires a team with a leader whose sole accountability is for the total success of the new product from defining the opportunity through customer purchase, use, service, and recommendation to others. This team leader reports directly to a senior executive, or the team leader can be a senior executive. Each team member's job is to ensure the success of the new product. * In addition to organizational integration, a successful team must begin with clearly articulated common goals for the product that are measurable and authorized by the enterprise. These goals must, at a minimum, cover such elements as: * The customers or customer segments to be served by the new product * The relative and absolute quality goals * The volume of sales or revenue to be generated in an initial time period and for the long run * Market share, penetration, or sales relative to key competitors * The release date The team will follow a structured process. The structure is the common framework for all participants in launching the new product and helps ensure success. = Customer-focused optimization = Quality by Design starts and ends with the customer. Every new product introduction has some amount of trade-off involved. If there are multiple customers, they may have conflicting needs. Even the same customer may have needs that compete with each other. Capacity and speed compete with cost of operation. Capacity can compete with speed. Flexibility and feature-rich offerings may have reduced ease of use, and so on. Quality by design offers a range of tools and methods intended to make these tradeoffs explicit and optimal for the customer. Some tools are highly mathematical, and others relate more to customer behavior. Quality by Design sets strong expectations for creative approaches to functional design, product features and goals, and production design. = Control over variation and transfer to operations = Quality by design incorporates modern tools to preemptively control variation. These tools and methods begin by measuring and understanding the variation that exists by using historical data, testing, and modeling to help forecast, analyze, and eliminate the deleterious effects of variation using standard statistical techniques. Process control consists of three basic activities: # Evaluate the actual performance of the process # Compare actual performance with goals # Take action on the difference The final activity of the quality by design process is to implement the plan and validate that the transfer has occurred. Pharmaceutical Quality by Design (QbD)  The FDA imperative is outlined in its report \\"Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach.\\"Pharmaceutical Quality for the 21st Century: A Risk-Based Approach https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/cder/ucm128080.htm In the past few years, the agency has implemented the concepts of QbD into its pre-market processes. The focus of this concept is that quality should be built into a product with an understanding of the product and process by which it is developed and manufactured along with a knowledge of the risks involved in manufacturing the product and how best to mitigate those risks. This is a successor to the \\"quality by QC\\" (or \\"quality after design\\") approach that the companies have taken up until the 1990s. The QbD initiative, which originated from the Office of Biotechnology Products (OBP), attempts to provide guidance on pharmaceutical development to facilitate design of products and processes that maximizes the product's efficacy and safety profile while enhancing product manufacturability. =QbD activities within FDA= The following activities are guiding the implementation of QbD: * In FDA's Office of New Drug Quality Assessment (ONDQA), a new risk-based pharmaceutical quality assessment system (PQAS) was established based on the application of product and process understanding. * Implementation of a pilot program to allow manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry to submit information for a new drug application demonstrating use of QbD principles, product knowledge, and process understanding. In 2006, Merck & Co.'s Januvia became the first product approved based upon such an application.FDA Approves New Treatment for Diabetes 17 Oct 2006. * Implementation of a Question-based Review (QbR) Process has occurred in CDER's Office of Generic Drugs. * CDER's Office of Compliance has played a role in complementing the QbD initiative by optimizing pre-approval inspection processes to evaluate commercial process feasibility and determining if a state of process control is maintained throughout the lifecycle, in accord with the ICH Q10 lifecycle Quality System. * First QbD Approval - including design space - for Biologic License Application (BLA) is Gazyva (Roche) While QbD will provide better design predictions, there is also a recognition that industrial scale-up and commercial manufacturing experience provides knowledge about the process and the raw materials used therein. FDA's release of the Process Validation guidance in January 2011 notes the need for companies to continue benefiting from knowledge gained, and continually improve throughout the process lifecycle by making adaptations to assure root causes of manufacturing problems are corrected. =ICH activities= Working with regulators in the European Union (the European Medicines Agency) and Japan, the FDA has furthered Quality by Design objectives through the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The ICH Guidelines Q8 through Q11 encapsulate these unified recommendations and provide some assistance for manufacturers to implement Quality by Design into their own operations. ICH Guideline Q8 describes QbD-based drug formulation development and was first published in 2004, being subsequently revised in 2008 (Q8(R2)). The ICH Guideline Q9 describes Quality Risk Management plans, Q10 explains Pharmaceutical Quality Systems, and Q11 refer to the development of active pharmacological substances including biologicals. In November 2017, the ICH issued Guideline Q12 for public consultation to extend the recommendations for the Product Lifecycle Management Plan that were initially defined in the Guideline Q10. According to the ICH, Guideline Q13 will extend the previous guidelines to accommodate continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and Q2 (Analytical Validation) will be revised and extended into the guideline Q2(R2)/Q14 to include Analytical Quality by Design or AQbD. The ICH Steering Committee meets twice a year to discuss the progress of its efforts. This practical input should help ensure that quality risk management and knowledge management are used to make lifecycle adaptations that maintain process control and product quality.

He was born in Bournville, Birmingham and died at Glastonbury, Somerset. Style and personality Lobb was a tall gangling right-arm fast-medium bowler and a No 11 batsman. His fielding was the subject of amusement: \\"He changed course a dozen times while the ball trickled straight to him at long-leg,\\" wrote Somerset's historian, David Foot. His batting reflected the fact that, in Foot's words, \\"he turned ungainliness into an art form\\" and he was also a poor judge of a run. In Lobb's obituary in Wisden in 2001, the story of a run-out at Chesterfield is told by Lobb himself: \\"I once got run out by deep mid-on, who overtook me as I unwisely strolled to the other end\\". But his bowling was no joke. From a long run-up, he got inswinging movement through the air and bounce from the pitch, all delivered with a flurry of arms and legs and fair hair. Cricket career His one match for Warwickshire came in 1953 and brought him two wickets but no contract. He arrived in the West Country in 1955 with Somerset's cricket at a low ebb: bottom of the County Championship for the preceding three seasons and with bowling largely dependent on spin. He went straight into the first team for the first match of the season and stayed there, winning his county cap in his first season. Wisden reported that he \\"appeared to be the best discovery made by Somerset for some years and he headed his county's bowling with 86 wickets at 25.59 each\\". In all matches he took 90 wickets. Somerset still finished at the foot of the Championship table, however. Signs of improvement for the team as a whole came in 1956, with a rise to 15th place out of 17. In a wet summer, Lobb's swing and seam bowling was less effective and Wisden noted that he \\"would have been more effective with a reliable new-ball partner\\". He still took 82 wickets at an average of 26.75; Somerset's other non-spin bowlers managed only 38 Championship wickets between them. The 1957 season was Lobb's best: in all matches, he took 110 wickets, becoming the first Somerset pace bowler to achieve that feat since the Second World War. The average too, at 19.48 runs per wicket, was much reduced. Against Cambridge University he took seven for 63 and four for 23 for the best match figures of his career. In 1958, Lobb produced both the finest bowling and batting performances of his career. At Bath against Yorkshire he reached the for-him dizzy heights of 42 in a last wicket stand of 84 with Geoff Lomax. Then at Lord's against Middlesex he took seven wickets for 43 runs on a pitch that Wisden called \\"difficult\\". By the end of July, he had taken 51 first-class wickets at an average of 21.78. But there his season ended, through injury. Though Lobb played in the first few Somerset matches of the 1959 season, he was from this point onwards essentially a part-time cricketer, his career interrupted first by his studies at St Luke's College, Exeter and then by his career as a schoolmaster at the Edgarley Hall prep school which is attached to Millfield School. He played a few games in 1960, reappeared in 1963, then again in 1967 and 1969. As late as 1979 he was involved in warm-up matches for the Sri Lankans in advance of the ICC Trophy. He died 3 May 2000 Glastonbury, Somerset. References .

A. Boeyens (1934-2015) was a South African chemist and educator. Boeyens was educated at the University of Pretoria. He worked at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of South Africa and at Stanford University. He became a professor of chemistry at the University of the Witwatersrand and Extraordinary Professor at UNISA. He has written or co- written more than 600 scientific contributions. Some of his books are used as textbooks of theoretical chemistry all over the world. As an emeritus he wrote books challenging the current scientific consensus about the adequacy of quantum mechanics in which he presented a way to establish more accurate modern physics and chemistry without using higher mathematics by using elementary number theory.  Biography  Education and Career in Chemistry = Jan Boeyens was born 2 October 1934 in Wesselsbron, Free State, South Africa. He attended the University of the Orange Free State and in 1955 he obtained a BSc (Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics), in 1956 a BSc(Hons) (Chemistry) and in 1957 MSc (Cum Laude) (Chemistry). He was appointed lecturer in Chemistry at the University of the Orange Free State from 1958 to 1960.

He attended the University of Pretoria from 1963 to 1964 and obtained a DSc (with Honours) (Physical and Theoretical Chemistry). His postdoctoral studies were at Stanford University from 1965 to 1966 where he was a Research Associate: Physical Chemistry. He worked at the National Institute for Metallurgy, MINTEK as Chief Scientist and Director of Mintek Research Group for Applied Structural Chemistry, Rand Afrikaans University from 1971 to 1973. He was appointed Honorary Lecturer at Rand Afrikaans University from 1973 to 1975. In 1976 he was a Visiting Researcher at the University of Sussex, England. He returned to the National Physical Laboratory of the CSIR in 1976 where he worked as Head: Physical Chemistry (Structural Chemistry and X-ray Crystallography) until 1980. He was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) from 1981-1999. He was also a visiting professor at Texas A&M; University in 1984. Boeyens was appointed Head: Department of Chemistry at WITS from 1984 to 1990 and again from 1997 to 1999. From 1986 to 1999 he was the Director: Centre for Molecular Design at WITS and from 1991 to 1993 became the Dean: Faculty of Science. He was visiting professor at the Free University of Berlin in 1994, and at the University of Heidelberg, Germany in 1998, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010. He lectured as professor of chemistry and was Head, Department of Chemistry at the University of Pretoria from 2000 to 2004. In 2005 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor at the Centre for Advancement of Scholarship, University of Pretoria. = Family Life = Boeyens married Martha Hunter in 1960. They had three children, Jan, Aletta and Larisa. He died on 28 August 2015 in Broederstroom, North West, South Africa after returning home from a crystallography conference.

Publications  Boeyens authored 7 books and more than 270 other publications. His books are listed below. * . * . * . * . * . * . *  Quotes  In some of his books and articles Boeyens held some dissident views on several subjects: > Numerologists can interpret great historical and cosmic events, predict the > future and explain human nature. > Volumes have been written about the red herring known as Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat. > Without science writers looking for sensation, it is difficult to see how > such nonsense could ever become a topic for serious scientific discussion. He was also a strong believer in practical work to obtain tangible results over theoretical calculations: > All advances in chemistry happen at the bench, as it should, but without the > theoretical understanding, even of common events such as intramolecular > rearrangement. No calculation can predict chemical reactions. His book Number Theory and the Periodicity of Matter (co-authored with Demetrius C. Levendis) references the work of Peter Plichta. In it they try to replace modern quantum physics with elementary number theory, but unlike Plichta they do not question the general theory of relativity: > It is a myth that chemistry derives from quantum theory. More fundamental > than both is the periodic table that reduces the properties of matter to a > number basis, which is revealed only peripherally in the differential > equations of quantum theory.

An unprecedented rise to glory was followed by the most horrific fall. A tarnished hero fueled the nation's fury. Hansie, once South African cricket's golden boy, had been stripped of everything he had held dear: a glorious captaincy, the support of his former team mates and the respect of a nation. In its place the stinging rejection of cricket administrators and the humiliating dissection of his life on international television made his retreat into depression inevitable. Hansie's bravest moment in finally confessing his involvement with bookies had suddenly become a tightening noose around his neck.

History The need for a hospital in the New Ulm, Minnesota area became apparent in 1881, when a tornado killed more than ten people and injured several hundred. Since there was no hospital in the area, the Sisters of Christian Charity School opened their doors to treat the victims of the tornado. Father Berghold, organizer of the Catholic Church, recognized this arrangement was not an adequate long-term solution and launched a community campaign to raise money to build a permanent hospital. Berghold succeeded. St. Alexander Hospital, New Ulm Medical Center's oldest ancestor, accepted its first patient on November 1, 1883., date of article unknown In the following years, several moves, mergers and name changes ensued. The current New Ulm Medical Center was built in 1962. The New Ulm Medical Center was one of the top 100 critical access hospitals in the United States.

Although the station was intended to serve the adjacent Ricoh Arena, it was announced in August 2015 that the station will be closed for one hour preceding and following football matches, rugby matches and concerts on safety grounds: there is insufficient rolling stock to run the services necessary for spectators: while six-carriage trains could be chartered to run every half-an-hour during weekends, the fares generated would not cover the chartering cost. The then operator London Midland stated that the rolling stock restriction limited services to one train an hour using a single-coach unit, which can only seat 75 people. In September 2015 it was revealed that Coventry City Council were looking into the possibility of using converted London Underground D-trains to run extra services on match days, although this never happened. In 2019, two coach units took over the running of the service.  History  No previous station has existed at this site. However, the former Longford and Exhall station, which closed in 1949, was situated around to the north. Funding for the new station was approved in December 2011. However, a number of setbacks meant that construction did not begin until October 2014 with services projected to start in June 2015, although this was later pushed back several times. The station opened together with Bermuda Park railway station in Nuneaton on 18 January 2016. Services One train per hour calls in each direction Mondays to Saturdays throughout the day, with southbound trains continuing to and . Sunday services do not start running until just before noon, but then run on the same frequency as on weekdays thereafter until end of service (but to Coventry only southbound).

It was found for the first time in the Soller Valley in the Serra de Tramuntana of the island of Mallorca, Spain, and described by both Spanish and German botanists at the same time. The Spaniards gave it the name Asplenium azomanes. Its fronds are coriacea as plastic and the rachis is very thick, dark garnet color and brilliance. A typical feature of this fern is the existence of a small atrium at the base of the pinnae medium and lower geared towards the apex of the frond with one or two sori in its underside. Sporulation occurs from October to March. Habitat It lives among the stones of the walls of the terraces and in the crevices of limestone rocks oriented to the north and northwest. Depending on the degree of exposure to the sun, its phenotype changes a lot, becoming more coriaceous the more sunlight it receives. In the driest months of summer comes into estivation, dehydrating their fronds, reaching apparently dead. With the first rains of autumn, the fern rehydrate the dried fronds and turn green quickly. Distribution Its population is distributed in three locations separated by the Mediterranean Sea: the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Ibiza and Formentera), south of the Iberian Peninsula (Albacete, Jaen, Malaga and Cadiz) and the north of Morocco (from Chefchaouen in Western Rif until the rocks surrounding the Caves of Chameau in Mountains of Beni Snassen).

The CB200 has a chain driven single overhead camshaft parallel twin engine with dual carburetors and five- speed gearbox. It had both an electric and kick starter. A distinguishing feature is the rubber trim down the middle of the fuel tank. Depending on where in the world the bike was sold it is known as a CB200A/CB200B or CB200K/CB200T. All CB200s had a rear drum brake. Early models (CB200A - 73 and 74) had a drum front brake, later models (CB200B - 75 and 76) had a cable operated front disc brake. CL200 Scrambler 1974 Honda CL200 The CL200 Scrambler was a dual-sport made only in 1974, with a four-stroke OHC parallel twin cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed transmission. It was similar to the CB200 except the exhaust system of the Scrambler was mounted above the gearbox with both pipes on the left side of the bike, whereas on the CB200 it was mounted under the transmission gearbox on both sides of the bike. The CL exhaust pipe and heat shield were chrome. Other differences include a smaller tank than the CB200, a larger seat, braced handlebars, and different paint schemes.

She was the first female dean in the Law Faculty at Makerere University, Uganda. Education Tamale received her Bachelor of Laws with honors from Makerere University, her Master of Laws from Harvard Law School, and her Doctor of Philosophy in sociology and feminist studies from the University of Minnesota in 1997. Tamale received her Diploma in Legal Practice from the Law Development Center, Kampala, in 1990, graduating at the top of her class. Academic career Tamale has been a visiting professor at the African Gender Institute of the University of Cape Town and a visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin. In 2003 she was condemned by Ugandan conservatives for proposing that gay men and lesbians be included in the definition of \\"minority\\". Tamale was the dean of the Faculty of Law and Jurisprudence at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, from 2004 to 2008. Awards and honours From 1993 until 1997, she received a Fulbright- MacArthur Scholarship to pursue her studies at Harvard. In 2003, she won the University of Minnesota Award for International Distinguished Leadership for her work at the university. In 2004, she was awarded the Akina Mama wa Afrika Award by Akina Mama wa Afrika, an international, Pan-African, non-governmental development organisation for African women based in the United Kingdom with its African headquarters in Kampala, Uganda. In 2004, she was recognized by several women's organisations in Uganda, for her for human rights activism. On 28 October 2016, she became the first female lecturer to give a professorial inaugural lecture at Makerere University. Her lecture was entitled Nudity, Protests and the Law, inspired, in part, by the earlier-in-the-year nude protest of Stella Nyanzi at the university. In her speech, Tamale called for a revision of the Ugandan laws that discriminate against women. Sexual harassment activism  In March 2018, Makerere University selected Dr Tamale to chair a select five member committee to investigate the causes and increasing cases of \\"sexual harassment\\" at the public institution of higher learning. The report of the committee is expected in May 2018. As Dean of Faculty at Makerere University, she started the Sexual Harassment Policy, which prohibits sexual harassment on and off campus among anyone associated with the university. On May 18, 2018, Sylvia Tamale presented the first report on sexual harasement that the select committee had investigated. She reported it to students, staff, public, and private partners of Makerere University. The report was conducted by a qualitative research method, consistening of 234 interviews, with 59% of the interviewes being women. She noted the importance of the media within her speech as it was instrumental on \\"creating a spotlight on the evils of sexual harassment hence increasing the awareness on the issue.\\" Makerere University now reaffirms its zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment and is committed to creating an environment that respects all its member rights. She has spoken out in support of the traditional practice of labia stretching, arguing that any comparison to female genital mutilation is invalid.  Global feminism  Tamale's research includes work on gender and sexuality, women in politics, and feminist jurisprudence, third world women and the law, all while combining academia and activism. To her, feminism is \\"a belief/ideology in gender equity and doing something about it and overall about people's dignity and humanity.\\" She encourages other feminists to actively participate in all levels of public offices and use education as a weapon to destroy various patriachal structures of power within law, culture, language and media. She believes in the inclusivity of feminism by stating, \\"patriarchy hurts men too,\\" and \\"we must recognize that not all women are the same. Not all women experience oppression the same way.\\" She also includes religion within her inclusivity sentiments by stating, \\"you can be religious and feminist. There is a whole body of literature on interpreting the Bible to bring about gender equity\\" In 2003, Tamale was named the \\"Worst Woman of the Year\\" by a conservative bloc in Uganda. She was vilified for weeks within one of Kampala's daily newspapers, New Vision, as responsible for everything from the moral degeneration of the nation to the reason Ugandan teenagers were going to go to hell. She was attacked for suggesting that the term \\"minorities\\" should cover lesbian and gay citizens of Uganda in the Equal Opportunities Commission. She is a Working Group Member in the African Feminist Forum. The AFF brings African feminist activists to discuss strategy, refine approaches, and develop stronger networks to advance women's rights in Africa. She is an Advisory Board Member for the Open Society Foundations, an organization active in more than 120 countries that provides grants to individuals and groups toward building inclusive and vibrant democracies.  Above the Parapet  Sylvia Tamale was interviewed by Dr. Purna Sen, Director of Policy at UN Women, for part of a research project called Above the Parapet. For this project, high profile women who have had an impact on public life were interviewed in order to capture their views and experiences. The Sylvia Tamale interview was uploaded to YouTube on August 13, 2015 by London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Tamale talks about using Makerere University as a platform to get her message out there and her views on politics and the law, among many other topics. Speaking about her work, Tamale says, \\"I'm really not doing it for my colleagues. I'm doing it for the betterment of our society.\\" Tamale also speaks about being attacked for being vocal about taboo subjects such as abortion. She also speaks about being named the Worst Woman of the Year. \\"The reason why I was the worst woman that year was...because of my speaking out...always talking about issues that was seen as against African tradition...against religion...I even made a button that says 'Worst Woman 2003' and I wear it with a lot of pride,\\" Tamale said. Tamale also offered advice to any women aspiring to be in a position of power. \\"The world will try as much as possible to define who you are. Don't let the world define who you are. Define who you are yourself. Never ever shrink to fit the expectations of others. That pressure will always be there,\\" Tamale said, \\"You cannot get any rewards without working for it.

Fixed taxes like a poll tax or sin tax are often considered regressive, but could have progressive effects if applied to luxury goods and services. Since citizens share common roads, military protection, policing, and other government services, some argue that citizens should pay the same amount for basic infrastructure. Fixed taxation removes the moral dilemma of two individuals having to pay significantly different amounts in order to receive the same services, which could be argued as discrimination against economic success. It is argued that a fixed tax can save on tax compliance costs and improves privacy. Unlike proportional taxes, a fixed tax does not necessitate public insight, i.e. governments would not need to know individual income, wealth, or consumption. However, when applied as a precondition of membership in society or on products bought by the poor, it functions as a potentially extreme regressive tax in that it doesn't consider a person's ability to pay unless further adjustments are made (e.g. the way that the Australian HECS system applies tertiary education charges from a fixed schedule, but defers payments according to people's ability to pay by piggybacking payments as a progressively based surcharge on income tax). This can result in the lower income taxpayers paying much higher proportions of their incomes on taxes, incomes that are less disposable in that they must also pay a larger percentage of their incomes on necessities. Because of this, fixed taxes are better suited to funding governments which are not responsible for providing very much for the citizens and therefore do not have much to pay for.

The Banking Company of West Africa (CBAO) (French: Compagnie bancaire de l'Afrique occidentale) is a Dakar, Senegal based private bank. History The CBAO traces its history back to the 1853 French Imperial Bank of Senegal, through the 1901-1962 Bank of West Africa (BAO), to the Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale and its restructuring from a Senegalese government investment bank to an internationally owned retail bank. Renaming and Reorganization The CBAO is the result of a 1993 renaming and reorganisation of the International Bank for West Africa (BIAO), formed from the C√¥te d'Ivoire and Senegal, Niger, and several other branches of the pre- independence sections of the French colonial Bank of West Africa (BAO). Some sections in Central Africa became the Banque internationale pour la Centrafrique (BICA). The Senegalese section split from the other BIAO banks and was partially privatised in 1965, thereafter owned by the Senegalese Government and the United States Citibank company. In 1989, the BIAO Senegalese sections were liquidated into several private institutions, with a majority share of the largest going to the Senegalese MIMRAN Group.Entreprise & Developpement N¬∞43 .
