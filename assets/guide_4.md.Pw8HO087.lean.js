He is also co- founder and CEO of HDtracks, an online music store that sells high-resolution digital music. Chesky is considered a technological and musical innovator with eclectic interests. He has won Independent Music Awards and received Grammy Award nominations. He has written jazz tunes, orchestral and chamber music, opera, ballet, and a rap symphony. Beginnings At his mother's insistence, Chesky started piano lessons at the age of 5. In his teens he had less interest in rock and roll music, with its verse-chorus structure, than in classical and jazz. He liked Oscar Peterson, the Buddy Rich Big Band, George Gershwin, and the Latin music he heard while growing up in Miami. In 1974, at the age of 17, he moved to New York City to pursue a career as a musician. He studied privately with classical composer David Del Tredici and jazz pianist John Lewis. Writing, recording, and performing In 1978, he formed a jazz fusion group called the David Chesky Big Band, which included Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, and Bob James, and released the album Rush Hour. During the next ten years, Chesky made a living writing music for TV movies and commercials, continuing to learn from older composers. Another jazz fusion album, Club de Sol, appeared in 1989, his first album on his own Chesky label. His next two albums, The New York Chorinhos (1990) and The Tangos and Dances (1992), were collaborations with Brazilian guitarist Romero Lubambo in which he took traditional Brazilian forms and combined them with elements of jazz and classical music. In 1997 he created the Chesky Records Kids division to encourage children to listen to classical music. The first release was Classical Cats: A Children's Introduction to the Orchestra (1997), followed by Snowbears of Lake Louise (1998). Other works for children include the ballet The Zephyrtine (2013) and the opera The Mice War. He has written two comic operas for adults: The Pig, the Farmer, and the Artist, and Juliet & Romeo. Chesky Records and HDtracks In 1986 Chesky visited the classical pianist Earl Wild, a friend of an uncle, to learn more about writing music. Wild gave him an album of Rachmaninoff that had been recorded for Reader's Digest. Unimpressed with the quality of the recording, he asked Wild if he could hear the original master tape. After hearing better sound on the master, Chesky became interested in reissuing recordings. With his brother Norman he formed Chesky Records. Soon after, the label began producing its own albums, starting with Live from Studio A in New York City in 1988 featuring jazz violinist Johnny Frigo and father-son jazz guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli and John Pizzarelli. Chesky albums are recorded live, sometimes in churches, often with custom-made equipment, and don't undergo post-recording polishing, overdubbing, and mixing. This arrangement reflects David Chesky's desire to make albums that approximate the original performance. In 2012, he began using a technique called binaural recording, or what he called binaural-plus, in an attempt to capture the spaciousness of three-dimensional live sound. David Chesky and Norman Chesky, entered the music download business in 2008 when they opened HDtracks, an online music store that sells high-definition (HD), i.e. high-resolution, music. The Cheskys believe higher-resolution tracks sound better than typical mp3 files, which are compressed when transferred from the CD source. HDtracks sold CD-quality music files (44.1 kHz, 16-bit) before adding music with higher sample rates (88/24, 96/24, 176/24, 192/24) and other formats (AIFF, ALAC, FLAC, WAV). In 2016, Chesky Records produced Macy Gray's first jazz record entitled Stripped. Awards and honors Chesky has won two Independent Music Awards, both for best Contemporary Classical Album: String Theory (2011) and Rap Symphony (2014). He has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, Best Engineered Album, Classical for Area 31 (2005); Best Classical Contemporary Composition for Concerto for Bassoon and Orchestra on the album Urban Concertos (2007); and one Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album, The Body Acoustic (2004). He won the composer's award from the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra and was composer-in-residence for the National Symphony Orchestra of Taiwan.

Firestone Memorial is a large sculpture ensemble dedicated to Harvey Firestone, created by sculptors James Earle Fraser and Donald De Lue in Akron, Ohio. The monument was designed by architect Eric Gugler and was dedicated on August 3, 1950. It is located at Bridgestone Firestone Inc., 10 E Firestone Blvd, Akron, OH 44301, adjacent to the Research Building. The impetus to create a monument to Harvey Firestone in Akron began shortly after his death in 1938; however, the advent of World War Two temporarily delayed the project, although discussions regarding the site continued in 1944 between representatives of the Firestone company and the architect Gugler. It was during these discussions that the patron expressed the desire that the work include more than just a statue of Firestone. Gigler then developed the concept of the allegorical bas relief panels on a curved exedra. As work on the piece progressed, the elderly Fraser found doing the physically demanding work on the monumental seated figure to be more and more taxing and was aided in this process by both his wife, sculptor Laura Gardin Fraser, who represented him at the statue's dedication, and by De Lue. Inspiration However, as the dedication, timed to mark the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company's 50th anniversary, drew near, it was realized that the bronze work was not going to be finished; Fraser therefore suggested that a painted plaster version of the statue be used. Unknown to the general public, this is what was viewed at the unveiling by Firestone's five sons. The two statues were quietly switched later. De Lue's involvement in the project came about when Gugler recommended using Paul Manship, with whom he had frequently worked, to do the panels in the exedra. Fraser, \\"who felt himself to be in direct competition with Manship\\", countered by suggesting De Lue, with whom Gugler had also worked, and he was awarded the commission. For the back of the exedra De Lue produced six allegorical relief panels, Contemplation, Invention (or Inspiration), The Hours, The Years, Leadership, and Fruition (or Achievement). Vandalism Although the statue is a major work, it is one of Fraser's more obscure and misunderstood ones. The bust of Firestone that he created at the same time and currently housed in the National Portrait Gallery is mentioned in two of the standard references on the artist, The End of the Trail by Krakell and the Syracuse University exhibition catalog,‘’James Earle Fraser: The American Heritage in Sculpture” exhibition catalog, Syracuse University, Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1985 but neither one mentions the monument. On the other hand, Freundlich's The Sculpture of James Earle Fraser does discuss the memorial but attributes De Lue's relief panels, which the author erroneously places \\"on the base,\\" to Fraser . At some point in their history, prior to 2013, De Lue's reliefs were fairly seriously vandalized. Inspection reveals that noses, fingers and toes, the major elements that had been undercut in the work's carving process, had been beaten off the granite figures.

Wicksell made a key distinction between the natural rate of interest and the money rate of interest. The money rate of interest, to Wicksell, is the interest rate seen in the capital market; the natural rate of interest is the interest rate at which supply and demand in the market for goods are in equilibrium – as though there were no need for capital markets. According to the idea of cumulative process, if the natural rate of interest was not equal to the market rate, demand for investment and quantity of savings would not be equal. If the market rate is beneath the natural rate, an economic expansion occurs and prices rise. The resulting inflation depresses the real interest rate and causes further expansion and further price increases. The theory of the cumulative process of inflation is an early decisive swing at the idea of money as a \\"veil\\". Wicksell's process was much in line with the ideas of Henry Thornton's earlier work. Wicksell's theory claims, that increases in the supply of money lead to rises in price levels, but the original increase is endogenous, created by the conditions of the financial and real sectors. With the existence of credit money, Wicksell claimed, two interest rates prevail: the \\"natural\\" rate and the \\"money\\" rate. The natural rate is the return on capital – or the real profit rate. It can be considered to be equivalent to the marginal product of new capital. The money rate, in turn, is the loan rate, an entirely financial construction. Credit, then, is perceived quite appropriately as \\"money\\". Banks provide credit, after all, by creating deposits upon which borrowers can draw. Since deposits constitute part of real money balances, therefore the bank can, in essence, \\"create\\" money. Wicksell's main thesis, the disequilibrium engendered by real changes leads endogenously to an increase in the demand for money – and, simultaneously, its supply as banks try to accommodate it perfectly. Given full employment (a constant Y) and payments structure (constant V), then in terms of the equation of exchange, MV = PY, a rise in M leads only to a rise in P. Thus, the story of the Quantity theory of money, the long-run relationship between money and inflation, is kept in Wicksell. Wicksell's main thesis, the disequilibrium engendered by real changes leads endogenously to an increase in the demand for money – and, simultaneously, its supply as banks try to accommodate it perfectly. Primarily, Say's law is violated and abandoned by the wayside. Namely, when real aggregate supply does constrain, inflation results because capital goods industries cannot meet new real demands for capital goods by entrepreneurs by increasing capacity. They may try but this would involve making higher bids in the factor market which itself is supply-constrained – thus raising factor prices and hence the price of goods in general. In short, inflation is a real phenomenon brought about by a rise in real aggregate demand over and above real aggregate supply. Finally, for Wicksell the endogenous creation of money, and how it leads to changes in the real market (i.e. increase real aggregate demand) is fundamentally a breakdown of the Neoclassical tradition of a dichotomy between monetary and real sectors. Money is not a \\"veil\\" – agents do react to it and this is not due to some irrational \\"money illusion\\". However, we should remind ourselves that, for Wicksell, in the long run, the Quantity theory still holds: money is still neutral in the long run, although to do so, Knut Wicksell have broken the cherished Neoclassical principles of dichotomy, money supply exogeneity and Say's law.

The maneuver ends with a short dive as the plane gently levels out, flying in the opposite direction from which the maneuver began.  Sequence and use  Diagram of a basic wingover The aircraft makes a tight, 180 degree change in heading while covering minimum horizontal distance. The maneuver begins by making roughly a quarter loop, bringing the plane up into a vertical or near-vertical climb, allowing the airspeed to drop. Before the airplane stalls (begins to fall) the pilot applies hard rudder input, bringing the plane into a sweeping, vertical flat-turn, during which the wing swings over the top of the turn toward the direction of the nose. Both the lowered airspeed and gravity provide assistance with the turn, similar to a stall turn (hammerhead turn), except the plane never actually stalls. Instead, as the speed decreases, the plane makes a gentle, 180 degree flat-turn over the top of the climb, then dives to the original altitude along a parallel flightpath, completing a quarter loop to return to level flight at the original speed. The wingover is an energy-management maneuver. It is often used in dogfighting as an alternative to the split-s, when a fast turn-around is needed but a loss in altitude and a change in airspeed is not. Because the aircraft does not roll, it also has the advantage of keeping the cockpit facing the same direction during the turn, allowing the pilot to maintain sight of the opponent. Wingover-type maneuvers are often used to abruptly end other climbing maneuvers, like chandelles and high Yo-Yos, \\"kicking over\\" the nose when the enemy shows signs of falling or trying to dive away.An Illustrated Guide to Modern Fighter Combat By Mike Spick – Prentice Hall Trade 1987 One such maneuver was described by Major Robert S. Johnson, in an account of a battle during World War II: > Habit brought my head swiveling around to look behind me. I was just in time > to see a Fokke-Wulf bouncing, nose twinkling from the .30 calibers. My left > hand slammed forward on the throttle, my right hand hauled back on the > stick, my heart went to the top of my head and the Thunderbolt leapt upward. > I racked the jug into a tight left climbing turn, staying just above and in > front of the pursuing Fokke-Wulf.... To get any strikes on me, the [German] > had to turn inside me, and then haul his nose up steeply to place the > bullets ahead of me. The Fokke-Wulf just didn't have it. At 8,000 feet he > stalled out while the Thunderbolt roared smoothly; I kicked over into a roll > and locked onto his tail.\\"Fighter combat: Tactics and maneuvering By Robert > Shaw -- United States Naval Institute 1985 Page 121 The wingover is also a common maneuver during air shows and aerobatic competitions.Contact Flying By Jim Dulin -- Lula Press 2005 Page 164-- 165Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions By Nato -- 2008 Page 120--121Douglas A-1H Skyraider Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions By United States Navy 2008 4-16 Execution A wingover is typically executed from level flight or a slight bank in the direction of the turn. Lower-powered aircraft may begin the maneuver from a shallow dive, to increase airspeed. The pilot then pulls back on the stick bringing the plane up into a steep climb, typically not exceeding 2 to 3 g's. When the plane reaches a proper attitude (nose position above the horizon), which may be between 60 and 90 degrees, or even past vertical as much as 120 degrees, the pilot relaxes the elevator input, allowing the plane to lose airspeed as it climbs in altitude. Slight rudder will usually be applied at this time to increase the bank. In a vertical climb, the term \\"bank\\" refers to the angle of the horizon to the wingline (an imaginary line running through the center of the aircraft at the 3:00 and 9:00 positions, parallel to the wings), and the increased bank causes the fuselage to angle sideways and the nose to try dropping to one side. When performing the maneuver at transonic or supersonic speeds, extra help may be needed in slowing the airspeed, such as deploying the speedbrakes. When the airspeed is slow enough, the pilot applies hard rudder input with the pedals, bringing the plane into a sweeping flat-turn, as if pivoting on the lower wingtip while the upper wing cartwheels over the top. Because one wing is moving faster than the other, it will have a tendency to impart some roll onto the aircraft, so slight aileron will usually need to be applied during the turn to keep the plane from rolling. When the plane reaches a nose-down bank and attitude, the pilot releases rudder and dives, pulling back on the stick to level the plane out at the original altitude.Contact Flying By Jim Dulin -- Lula Press 2005 Page 164--165Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Pilot's Flight Operating Instructions By Nato -- 2008 Page 120--121 References Category:Aerial maneuvers ","title":"Wingover"},{"id":"39806612","text":"Taft Archeological Site No. 029-5411 is a historic archaeological site located at Lorton, Fairfax County, Virginia.

It was the ninth event under the Destination X chronology. Unlike the previous events, this event was not held on pay-per-view (PPV). Six matches were contested on the event, including one taped for a future episode of Xplosion. In the main event, Chris Sabin defeated Bully Ray to win his first World Heavyweight Championship in what was Sabin's Option C match, which he invoked by vacating the X Division Championship in place for a World Heavyweight Championship match at Destination X. The undercard featured first round tournament matches for the vacant X Division Championship and a match between Austin Aries and Bobby Roode in the 2013 Bound for Glory Series. Production =Background= On January 11, 2013, TNA announced that there would only be four pay-per-view events in 2013 and instead beginning pre-taped One Night Only events in place of them. Destination X was also dropped as a pay-per-view event and TNA resumed it as a special edition of its primary television program Impact Wrestling. Destination X was held by TNA as an X Division-exclusive event since the 2011 edition. Beginning with the 2012 edition, Destination X also became a staple for the X Division Champions to invoke Option C, which required them to vacate the title to earn a shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at the event. =Storylines= Bully Ray was the World Heavyweight Champion heading into Destination X. Destination X featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. At Slammiversary XI on June 2, 2013, after the Ultimate X Match where Chris Sabin won the X Division Championship, TNA general manager Hulk Hogan announced that just like in 2012, the reigning X Division champion would have the option to voluntarily vacate the title in exchange for a World Heavyweight Championship match at the 2013 Destination X special. Sabin was noncommittal as to whether he was going to cash in for the World Heavyweight title shot. On the June 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sabin lost the title in a three-way match (also involving Kenny King) to Suicide. Hogan then came out and announced that the real Suicide (T.J. Perkins) had been knocked out backstage and that the Suicide in the ring was an impostor. Hogan then gave Suicide until the end of the night to either unmask or be stripped of the championship. Suicide then unmasked, revealing himself to be Austin Aries. Aries confessed to being the person who jumped T.J. Perkins, explaining as he was the one who came up with the idea of the X Division Champion having the yearly right to exchange the X title for a match for the World Championship (and the one who traded in and won last year) and announced that he would be challenging Bully Ray for the World Championship. On the July 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sabin defeated Aries and Manik in a three-way match to regain the X Division Championship. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Sabin vacated the title in exchange for a match to wrestle for the World Heavyweight Championship against Bully Ray at Destination X. Event Before the Destination X episode aired live on television, a match took place between Joseph Park and Devon for the July 24 episode of Xplosion. Park performed a frog splash on Devon from the middle rope for the win. =Preliminary matches= The opening match was a part of the 2013 Bound for Glory Series between Austin Aries and Bobby Roode. After a back and forth match, Austin nailed a brainbuster on Roode to win the match to score seven points in the BFG Series tournament and picking up his second consecutive win over Roode at Destination X. It was then announced that three triple threat qualifying matches would take place at Destination X and the winners of the three matches would compete in an Ultimate X match on the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling. The first qualifying match pitted Sonjay Dutt against Homicide and Petey Williams. Dutt nailed a moonsault double foot stomp on Homicide for the win. In the next qualifying match, Manik took on Chavo Guerrero and Kenny King. After a back and forth action, Manik executed a Death from Above on King for the win. The final qualifying match pitted Greg Marasciulo, Rockstar Spud and Rubix. Marasciulo executed a back-to-belly piledriver on Spud for the win. The match was followed by a confrontation between the Knockouts Champion Mickie James and Gail Kim, which led to both women brawling with each other until several referees separated them to break up the brawl. =Main event match= In the main event, Bully Ray defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Chris Sabin, who invoked his Option C for the title shot. Ray's faction Aces & Eights interfered in the match on Ray's behalf and The New Main Event Mafia interfered in the match. Near the end of the match, Mr. Anderson handed over a hammer to Ray and then the referee was knocked out when Sabin performed a missile dropkick on Ray. A brawl occurred between Mafia and Aces & Eights and the two teams left the ring and then Ray tried to hit Sabin with a hammer but Sabin avoided it and then Ray tried to execute a Bully Bomb but Sabin hit him with the hammer in the head to win the title. Reception Destination X was a very successful episode of Impact Wrestling as it experienced an increase in ratings and viewership numbers. It received a 1.2 cable rating and a viewership number of 1,494,000, the largest since the January 31 episode of Impact Wrestling. Aftermath On the July 25 edition of Impact Wrestling, Manik defeated Sonjay Dutt and Greg Marasciulo in the Ultimate X finals of the tournament to win the vacant X Division Championship. Bully Ray and Chris Sabin continued their feud over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Destination X. The week after Destination X on the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, it was announced that on the Hardcore Justice special, Chris Sabin would defend his title against Bully Ray in a steel cage match, which was won by Bully Ray.

It is free for use with Windows, and previous versions are available for UNIX. It is an interactive program for image processing and computer vision.  Features  Running the CVIPtools CVIPtools can read many image formats including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, as well as raw formats. CVIPtools supports standard image processing functions such as image compression, image restoration, logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, image sharpening, Frequency transform, edge detection, segmentation and geometric transformations.  CVIP-ATAT  The Computer Vision and Image Processing Algorithm Test and Analysis Tool, CVIP- ATAT, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary function of this tool is to allow the user to explore many more algorithmic possibilities than can be considered by processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows for the automatic processing of large image sets with many different algorithmic and parameter variations. We call this the \\"front-end\\" tool because its primary purpose is to find the best algorithm to preprocess, segment and post-process a set of images for a particular application in order to best separate the most important regions of interest within the image. It has a GUI which allows the user to enter multi-stage algorithms for testing and analysis. At each stage the user can specify a number of different processes to test and a range for the processes' parameters. The user also specifies a set of images to process and a set of \\"ideal\\" output images which will be used to determine the success for each algorithm. Note that one algorithm is defined as a specific set of processes and a specific set of parameter values. tool will then automatically perform algorithms which consist of all the permutations of the values for each of the parameters for each process and all the processes for each stage. Next, the user can compare the various algorithm results to determine the best set of processes and parameters for the particular application. The tool is useful for application development where the ideal image results are available, or can be created. Additionally, it can serve as a front end development tool for image analysis to find the optimal set of processes and parameters for extracting regions of interest for further processing.  CVIP- FEPC  The Computer Vision and Image Processing Feature Extraction and Pattern Classification Tool, CVIP-FEPC, was created to facilitate the development of both human and computer vision applications. The primary application area is computer vision, but it can be used, for example, as an aid in the development of image compression schemes for human vision applications. This can be done by helping to determine salient image features that must be retained for a given compression scheme. Conversely, computer vision applications are essentially deployed image analysis systems for a specific application, so the feature extraction and pattern classification is an integral part of all computer vision systems. The primary function of this tool is to explore feature extraction and pattern classification and allow the user to perform batch processing with large image sets and is thus much more efficient than processing one image at a time with CVIPtools. It allows the user to select the features and pattern classification parameters for the automatic processing of these large image sets. CVIP-FEPC enables the user to easily specify the training and test sets and run multiple experiments in an efficient manner. Its primary purpose is to find the best parameters for a particular application in order to best classify the image objects of interest. This tool is designed to work with a set of images that have binary masks that have been created for the objects of interest – one object per image. These masks can be created manually with CVIPtools, or, many image database applications will have the masks available. In general, the user will load the images, specify the classes, select the features, select the test set, choose the pattern classification parameters and then let the program process the entire image set. An output file will be created with the results for the experiment.  CVIP Toolbox for Matlab  The CVIP Toolbox for Matlab can perform various functions: 1) Arithmetic and logic, 2) Band, 3) Color, 4) Conversion of image files, 5) Edge/Line detection, 6) Geometry, 7) Histogram, 8) Mapping, 9) Morphological, 10) Noise, 11) Objective fidelity metrics, 12) Pattern classification: classification algorithms, 13) Pattern classification: feature extraction, 14) Pattern classification: normalization methods, 15) Segmentation, 16) Spatial filters: adaptive filters, 17) Spatial filters: mean filters, 18) Spatial filters: miscellaneous, 19) Spatial filters: order filters, 20) Transform, 21) Transform filters: standard, and 22) Transform filters: restoration. The CVIP Toolbox includes a CVIPlab skeleton program, similar to the CVIPlab for the C/C++ programmer, and a utility function for batch processing. .

History The honour was first granted to Ilbert de Lacy, 1st Baron Pontefract by William the Conqueror following his participation in the Harrying of the North. His son Robert supported Robert Curthose and was banished, the Honour being transferred to a Henry Traverse. Traverse himself was murdered three days later, and the barony changed hands again to Hugh de la Val. The de Lacy family were restored as Barons during the reign of King Stephen, though records dispute over whether Robert himself was still alive to regain his title or if it was his son, Ilbert.Fox, George, History of Pontefract, in Yorkshire (London, 1827), p.88-89.

United States, 567 U.S. 343 (2012), was a Supreme Court decision that applied the rule set out in Apprendi v. New Jersey—that certain non-conviction elements of a crime must be proved to a jury—to criminal penalties. The 6-3 decision was authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.. Background Southern Union Company was convicted of storing hazardous liquid mercury without a permit, “on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004,” in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. et seq. The jury was not asked to determine the exact duration of the violation. In sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, calculated by assessing the $50,000 maximum daily fine for each of the 762 days between September 19, 2002 and October 19, 2004. Respondent appealed on the basis that the jury never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing that the jury had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that Apprendi did not apply to criminal fines. The Supreme Court reversed, holding there is no principled distinction between criminal fines and imprisonment for the purpose of Apprendi because Apprendi requires that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and determined beyond a reasonable doubt. The rule preserves the historic fact-finding function of the jury, deciding that where a fine is sufficiently substantial to trigger the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies.

It is the church for the Stranda parish which is part of the Nordre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1838 by an unknown architect. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432. Not much is known of that stave church. In 1722, the church was described as being very old. On 8 January 1731, there was a large rockslide on the nearly vertical Skafjellet mountain across the Storfjorden. This rockslide fell into the fjord and caused a small tsunami to rush across the fjord and it destroyed the church which sat on the shore. A new church was built that same year, but it was built about to the northwest on higher ground. The new church had a cruciform design. The old cemetery that surrounded the old church was maintained and no new cemetery was built by the new church. In 1838, a new church was built on the site of the old church (closer to the fjord). The 1731 church was then torn down. This new church had an octagonal design and it has stood there ever since.

He is also a former member of the Federal Judicial Police in Tamaulipas. Born in the state of Tamaulipas, Cano Flores became a drug trafficker in 2001 while still serving as a police officer. His role in Mexican law enforcement and his ties with the Gulf Cartel allowed him to recruit several other policemen into the criminal organization's ranks. As a high-ranking leader, Cano Flores served as the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Los Guerra, a town in the municipality of Ciudad Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas. He was also a leader in Camargo, Tamaulipas, where he coordinated heroin, cocaine, and marijuana shipments to the United States. In 2010 he was named in a U.S. federal indictment with 19 other high-ranking drug lords of La Compañía (The Company), a name used to describe the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as a conglomerate. He was arrested by the Mexican federal police on June 2009 and extradited to the United States while pending drug trafficking charges on 19 August 2011. Cano Flores was later sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to forfeit US$15 billion on 13 May 2013, making him \\"highest ranking Gulf Cartel member to be convicted by a U.S. jury in the past 15 years.\\" Criminal career Aurelio Cano Flores was born in Tamaulipas, Mexico on 3 May 1972. He joined the Gulf Cartel, a Mexican drug trafficking organization, in 2001, while still working in the Federal Judicial Police. As a policeman, Cano Flores was able to recruit several of his colleagues to the Gulf Cartel, where they collected the organization's drug proceeds and protected the drug shipments that headed to the U.S.-Mexico border. Within some time, he rose in the echelons of the cartel, became a high-ranking leader, and was appointed as the Gulf Cartel's boss in the border area of Los Guerra, a small town in the municipality of Ciudad Miguel Alemán, Tamaulipas, just across the international border from Roma, Texas. While in power, Cano Flores also worked with Los Zetas, a criminal organization formed in the late 1990s by ex-commandos of the Mexican Army who served as the Gulf Cartel's paramilitary wing. To keep the Gulf Cartel afloat, he reportedly intimidated and used violence against rival drug traffickers and Mexican law enforcement officers. Prior to his arrest on 10 June 2009, he was operating as the Gulf Cartel leader in Camargo, Tamaulipas and coordinated heroin, cocaine, and marijuana shipments to the United States. =Arrest and trial= Cano Flores was arrested by the Mexican federal police on 10 June 2009 while in possession of a firearm, a magazine device, and 30 rounds of ammunition. On 4 November 2010, he was indicted along with 19 other drug traffickers of La Compañía (The Company), a name that refers to the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas collectively, and charged with conspiracy to traffic over 5 kilos (11 lbs) of cocaine and at least 1,000 kilos (2204.6 lbs) of marijuana to the United States for future distribution. The United States Department of the Treasury had named Cano Flores in 2009 as a close associate of the Zeta bosses Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano and Miguel Treviño Morales, considered by the government as \\"significant foreign narcotics traffickers.\\" He was then extradited to the United States from Mexico on 19 August 2011 to face charges on drug trafficking. At the time of his extradition, U.S. authorities indicated that he faced a minimum prison sentence of ten years and a maximum penalty of life in prison for his charges. On 13 May 2013, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein sentenced Cano Flores to 35 years in prison and ordered him to forfeit US$15 billion. He was the highest drug lord of the Gulf Cartel to be convicted by a U.S. jury in 15 years. Bounty The U.S. Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Cano Flores also has two aliases: Yeyo and Yankee. Some media outlets also referred to him by another name, Efraín Sánchez Castillo. =Kingpin Act sanction= On 24 March 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Cano Flores under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with fifty-three other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. See also *Mexican Drug War Sources =Footnotes= References Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:People from Tamaulipas Category:People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ","title":"Aurelio Cano Flores"},{"id":"39807034","text":"Compass High School may refer to: *Compass High School (Grandview, Washington) *Compass High School (San Mateo, California) *Compass High School (Tucson, Arizona) ","title":"Compass High School"},{"id":"39807041","text":"Hon.

Both computers were developed by Canadian company D-Wave Systems. The computers are not general purpose, but rather are designed for quantum annealing. Specifically, the computers are designed to use quantum annealing to solve a single type of problem known as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. As of 2015, it was still debated whether large-scale entanglement takes place in D-Wave Two, and whether current or future generations of D-Wave computers will have any advantage over classical computers. Processor D-Wave Two has a CPU of about 512 qubits—an improvement over the D-Wave One series' CPUs of about 128 qubits The number of qubits can vary from chip to chip, due to variations in manufacturing. The increase in qubit count for the D-Wave Two was accomplished by tiling qubit pattern of the D-Wave One. This pattern, named chimera by D-Wave Systems, has a limited connectivity such that a given qubit can only interact with at most six other qubits. As with the D-Wave One, this restricted connectivity greatly limits the optimization problems that can be approached with the hardware. Quantum computing In March 2013, several groups of researchers at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing workshop at the Institute of Physics in London produced evidence of quantum entanglement in D-Wave CPUs. In March 2014, researchers from University College London and the University of Southern California corroborated their findings; in their tests, the D-Wave Two exhibited the quantum physics outcome that it should while not showing three different classical physics outcomes. In May 2013, Catherine McGeoch verified that D-Wave Two finds solutions to a synthetic benchmark set of Ising spin optimization problems. Boixo et al. (2014) evidenced that the D-Wave Two performs quantum annealing, but that a simulated annealing on a notebook computer also performs well. Jean Francois Puget of IBM compared computation on the D-Wave Two with IBM's CPLEX software. A D-Wave Two in the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division of Ames Research Center is used for research into machine learning and related fields of study. NASA, Google, and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) started the lab in 2013. In July 2016, computer music researcher Alexis Kirke used a harmony algorithm developed for the D-Wave Two live in a public musical performance for mezzo soprano and electronics in the UK.

It is the church for the Geiranger parish which is part of the Nordre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1842 by the architect Hans Klipe. The church seats about 165 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589, but it was not brand new at that time. The first church was a stave church that was about wide and about long. That church was torn down in 1742. Two years later, a new cruciform church on the same site was completed. The second church lasted until it burned on 2 July 1841 when it was started on fire by a deaf-mute person who was a part of the parish. The third and current church was completed in 1842, about a year after the old church burned.

Williams Agricultural Holdings' David Pearse announces the sale of Henbury Station in 2011 Henbury Station is a cattle station in the Northern Territory of Australia. In 2014 it was acquired by Ashley and Neville Anderson and David Rohan. The station is running about 6000 head of cattle. Description It is situated about south of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Henbury occupies an area of that extends from the tops of the MacDonnell Ranges, down the foothills and across the open red plains to the Finke bioregion. The Finke River runs for about through the property and has carved out many gorges containing permanent waterholes. The property encompasses the dissected uplands and the lower valleys of both the Finke and Palmer Rivers. The region is characterised by the perennial freshwater wetlands such as Running Waters, 3-mile, Snake hole and Harts Camp that are regionally significant and the oldest wetlands in Central Australia supporting the unique biodiversity of the area. There are twelve land systems at Henbury the most prevalent of which is the Simpson's system where the landscape is dominated by spinifex on sand dunes with sparse shrubs and low trees or Desert Oak over grasses on sand dunes Mulga, Coolibah or sparse low trees over copper-burr, samphire or saltbush growing in the swales. The most productive land system is Chandler's which is widespread through the property which includes mesas, low ranges, clayey stony slopes, bluebush rises and open woodlands. History The Traditional Owners of Henbury Station and surrounding lands are the Pertame (southern Aranda people). They continue to live in the region and have an ongoing relationship to Henbury Station. Parke and Walker applied for a lease for the area in 1875, naming it after their family estate in Dorset, England. The first homestead was constructed along Ellery Creek in 1877 and the was theirs. A log cabin was built along the banks of the Finke River in 1886 which became the new homestead and still stands today, the property was carrying 3,000 head of cattle in the same year. Both Henbury and Todmorden Station were owned by E. W. Parke when he died in 1901. In about 1902 the Mr. Breadon acquired the leasehold and experienced good falls of rain later the same year ensuring water and feed for stock for the next 12 months. Breadon sold Henbury and Todmorden Station to Stan Young in 1923. The Breadens had made several improvements to both runs since they were acquired, and had agreed to stay on at Todmorden for the next 12 months. Young later went bankrupt seven years later and handed the property back to the Breadens. From 1956 through to 1957 Henbury and surrounding properties were struck by drought in which Henbury lost 4,000 cattle. The drought eventually broke in late 1957 when heavy rains fell causing localised flooding. The area experienced heavy rains in 1967 which caused the Finke River to flood closing roads around the property for a week. Ross Morton and Sally Williams purchased Henbury in 1982 as part of a family partnership. They placed the property on the market in 2011, after more than 30 years there. = Carbon Farming = On 27 July 2011 it was announced that Henbury Station had been sold to R.M. Williams Agricultural Holdings, a subsidiary company to boot maker R.M. Williams, managed by David Pearse. Henbury was purchased for 13 million with 9 million of funding from the Australian Government's Caring for Country initiative. The property, which formerly had 17,000 head of cattle, was destocked, allowing native vegetation to regenerate. The property was to be protected as part of the National Reserve System. By restoring native vegetation, R.M.Williams Agricultural Holdings planned to sequester carbon and then sell carbon credits. If successful, it would have been the first company to use the carbon market to fund a conservation project. Some Indigenous Traditional Owners were opposed to the sale, saying there was a lack of consultation. They reportedly wanted representative body, the Central Land Council, to purchase back their land and continue to run the pastoral lease as a cattle station. The project also faced growing resistance from the local cattle industry. Neighboring pastoralists said the property was not being effectively managed for fire and feral animals, increasing the risk for adjacent cattle stations. Some scientists also questioned the scientific validity of carbon sequestration in rangeland regions. In October 2012, R.M. Williams Agricultural Holdings re-structured the project, partnering with carbon finance company C-Quest Capital. It said it would be changing focus to include the reintroduction of cattle on some parts of the station, producing a mixed carbon farming model. R. M. Williams Agricultural Holdings went into receivership in July 2013, with PPB Advisory appointed as receiver. Henbury Station was put back on the market in August 2013. In July 2014 Henbury was acquired by Ashley and Neville Anderson and David Rohan under trading name Henbury Unit Trust Pty Ltd for between 7-8 million. It was later revealed that a large percentage of the sale price would be recovered by the Australian Government. Former owners Ross Morton and Sally Williams claim to have lost $4.5 million in shares after the collapse of R.M. Williams Agricultural Holdings. Approximately 20% of the property is now protected under a special conservation covenant. The new covenant includes Running Waters, which is one of the largest permanent waterholes in Central Australia, as well as habitat linking Finke Gorge National Park and Owen Springs Conservation Reserve.

It was selected to be screened in the official competition at the 70th Venice International Film Festival and was an official selection of the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.First Pictures from James Franco's Cormac McCarthy Adaptation 'Child of God'. Rope of Silicon The film made its United States premiere at the 51st New York Film Festival and then was screened at the 2013 Austin Film Festival. Plot Set in mountainous Sevier County, Tennessee, in the 1950s, Child of God tells the story of Lester Ballard. Ballard is a dispossessed, violent man whom the narrator describes as \\"a child of God much like yourself perhaps.\\" Ballard's life is a disastrous attempt to exist outside the social order. Successively deprived of parents and homes, and with few other ties, Ballard descends literally and figuratively to the level of a cave dweller, as he falls deeper into madness, crime and degradation. Cast * Scott Haze as Lester Ballard * Tim Blake Nelson as Sheriff Fate * James Franco as Jerry * Jim Parrack as Deputy Cotton * Fallon Goodson as Girly * Vince Jolivette as Ernest * Brian Lally as John Greer * Boyd Smith as Mr. Fox Production On September 14, James Franco announced at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival that he was set to direct an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's third novel Child of God. In January 2012, it was announced that Scott Haze had signed on to play Lester Ballard, the film's protagonist. It was also announced that Tim Blake Nelson and Jim Parrack had signed on to play Sheriff Fate and Deputy Cotton, respectively. Production on the film began on January 31, 2012, in West Virginia. Reception The film received mixed to negative reviews, holding a rating of 42% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus states: \\"An obviously reverent adaptation that fails to make a case for the source material being turned into a movie, Child of God finds director James Franco outmatched by Cormac McCarthy's novel.\\"Rotten Tomatoes References External links * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 crime drama films Category:2013 drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on works by Cormac McCarthy Category:Films directed by James Franco Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in Appalachia Category:Films set in Tennessee Category:Films shot in West Virginia Category:Squatting in film ","title":"Child of God (film)"},{"id":"39807408","text":"René Chudeau (21 August 1864, in Angers - 1921) was a French geologist.Gautier, Emile Félix Benoît, 1864-1940 ; Chudeau, René, 1864-1921 Photographes d'Afrique (1840-1944) Formerly an instructor at the University of Besançon, from 1905 to 1914 he conducted a series of geological surveys in the Sahara (later day nations of Mali, Mauritania and Niger).

Schwartz (born August 12, 1954) is a political activist and political and social theorist. He is a Professor of Political Science at Temple University, where he served as department chair from 2000-2005. Schwartz writes and teaches in the areas of radical and socialist political thought, as well as contemporary American politics, focusing upon how the ways in which conflicts around race, class, and gender influence social and economic policy outcomes.  Biography  Schwartz received his B.A. in History from Cornell University where he was a Telluride Scholar, and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He also received his second B.A. at Oxford University (in Politics, Philosophy and Economics) as a recipient of a Marshall Scholarship. Schwartz, beginning in high school with the anti-Vietnam War movement, has long been active on the democratic left. He played a role in the United States anti-apartheid movement while a graduate student at Harvard in the early 1980s. Since then he has been active in the movement for a single-payer national health care system and in fights against cuts in social services at the state and national level. He is a member of the executive committee of the American Federation of Teachers faculty and staff union at Temple University Schwartz serves as a Vice-Chair of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and is a member of its National Political Committee.www.dsausa.org He is a frequent contributor to such popular left publications as In These Times, Dissent, and Democratic Left.  Academic work  Schwartz's work in political and social theory examines the role competing ideologies play in political life. He asserts that political theory should not speak a ghettoized, jargon-laden \\"private, academic language;\\" rather, it should inform public intellectual and political deliberation. He is a past recipient of the Temple University College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Teaching Award, Temple University's Lindback Prize for Teaching Excellence. His first book,The Permanence of the Political: A Democratic Critique of the Radical Thrust to Transcend PoliticsWorldCat(Princeton, 1995) critiques the radical longing for a society that transcends particular identity and the need for politics. While affirming much of Marx's critique of capitalism, it contends that Marx's vision of a conflict-free post-revolutionary society had negative effects on future radical theory and practice. The book won the North American Society for Social Philosophy Prize for the best book published in 1995. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 476 libraries WorldCat item record His second major work, The Future of Democratic Equality: Reconstructing Social Solidarity in a Fragmented United States (Routledge 2009) won the American Political Science Association's 2011 David Easton Award for the best book published in political and social theory in the past five years. According to WorldCat, the book is held in 461 libraries WorldCat item record In this book, Schwartz cautions against a potential new form of radical orthodoxy: that universal forms of identity are repressive and homogenizing, whereas particular identities are inherently emancipatory. The work argues that defenders of a democratic conception of \\"difference\\" must not forget that \\"difference,\\" if constructed upon a terrain of radical social inequality, yields unjust inequalities in social and political power. The book also examines whether a democratic and egalitarian politics remains possible in the era of global \\"neoliberal\\" capitalism. Schwartz has also published numerous scholarly articles on topics ranging from just war theory and the war on terrorism to the challenges neo-liberal globalization poses for egalitarian politics and policy.

Since September 2019, Thorson has effectively shut down Matt Makes Games to relaunch their team under Extremely OK Games. Early life Maddy Thorson was born on 18 March 1988 as Matt Thorson. Thorson went to college at Grande Prairie Regional College in Alberta, Canada, studying computer science, during which one summer they worked at HermitWorks Entertainment, a local video game development studio. Career =Helix Games / Matt Makes Games= alt=Text in a pixel- like font, letters of different color and shadow text, reading \\"Matt Makes Games\\" Around fourteen, Thorson's mother helped them acquire a copy of Game Maker, a software tool to help develop video games. Through working in Game Maker, they were connected to others in online forums who were also interested in making games, including Chevy Ray Johnston. They developed a number of small pay-what-you-want games through Game Maker in high school and through college, including Jumper and several sequels, FLaiL, and An Untitled Story. Several of their games were described as \\"masocore\\", masochistic games that were extremely difficult for the player to complete; Thorson felt their goal was not to make their games near-impossible but instead to make games that helped direct the player to improve themselves so that the player could beat the challenges they made for them. Early games were published under the name \\"Helix Games\\", but in April 2008, they rebranded it as \\"Matt Makes Games\\", considering the name a more important brand for their work. Thorson's goal in college was to get a computer programming degree and join up with a large game development studio, but as they progressed, they realized they could still make video games without having to be attached to a studio. Following their graduation, Thorson moved into a Vancouver apartment with Johnson where they shared game ideas. Most of these were browser games, and successfully had a few of theirs published by Adult Swim Games on its site. Thorson and Johnson were frequented by friends they had made online. During a visit by Alec Holowka, he and Thorson participated in a local game jam and came up with an idea of a single-player platformer game based on an out-of-shape archer trying to ascend a tower, collecting treasure and money to help with each attempt to climb it. They had considered pitching the idea to Adult Swim Games, but decided to expand the idea on their own, bringing in Johnson to help. The game morphed into a multiplayer battle game, where each player would try to defeat the others by shooting them with a bow-and-arrow while avoiding falling off the tower. Because of the frequent visitors to their apartment, they were able to gain feedback and improve the game to be a party-style title. This would ultimately become TowerFall, Thorson's first major commercial game. Recognizing the potential success of the title, Johnson suggested that they get a house in Vancouver to bring in others to help, which they acquired around October 2012, calling it the \\"Indie House\\" and inviting other collaborators to join them. Thorson incorporated Matt Makes Games as Matt Makes Games Inc. shortly afterwards in November 2012. Later, Holowka recognized Thorson as TowerFall main creator and relinquished his stake as a co-creator. Holowka remained on the game's development team as its composer. TowerFall was ultimately developed as an exclusive for the Ouya console. Following its initial release in 2013, the team reissued the game in 2014 as TowerFall: Ascension for most other gaming platforms with additional features. TowerFall: Ascension was critically praised, and within a month had brought in over . In August 2015, Thorson and Noel Berry, another member of Matt Makes Games, had a four-day game jam to create a PICO-8 game about climbing a mountain with difficult jumping steps. When they completed this, they recognized the opportunity to flesh out the game into a full release, forming the basis of Celeste. Full work on the game started around January 2016. The game was released across multiple platforms in January 2018. By the end of 2018, it had sold more than 500,000 copies, and received numerous industry awards. =Extremely OK Games= alt=Four stylised letters of different colours arranged in 2-by-2 grid reading \\"EXOK\\" On 5 September 2019, Thorson announced that they were effectively shutting down Matt Makes Games, while re- establishing the same team under the new name \\"Extremely OK Games\\" (abbreviated EXOK). The purpose of the change was twofold. First, the new name recognized that Thorson was not the sole creative force behind the games and ensured that the whole team was fully recognized and shared in the collective output from the company. Second, the change coincided with a move to a new set of offices in Vancouver to house the entire team, which had been previously spread across the world, including some in São Paulo. EXOK was technically founded in March 2019, but the first six months had been spent working to move these international developers into Canada and dealing with immigration requirements. The \\"Extremely OK\\" name itself came from a humorous tweet that operations manager Heidy Motta had seen that wished its readers an \\"extremely OK afternoon\\". Thorson stated that TowerFall and Celeste would remain published under Matt Makes Games, and that the team had already started the early exploratory work for their next title, codenamed \\"EXOK-1\\". With everyone in EXOK working in the same office, it had made development time faster, allowing them to test through multiple prototype games to come onto their next project within six months. Personal life Thorson is non-binary, which they announced in July 2019. By around 2020, they had adopted the name Maddy Thorson over their birthname. Legacy Thorson was named by Forbes as one of their \\"30 Under 30\\" for gaming in 2014, recognizing them for the development of TowerFall.

Dum.\\".Trailer Review – Tenaliraman – Behindwoods = Marketing = In an interview with Sun TV on 14 April 2014, Vadivelu mentioned that the idea of the King having 36 wives and 52 children was based on Ziona Chana, who lives in Baktawang village of the Mizoram state of India and who holds the world record for the world's biggest family with 39 wives, 94 children, 14 daughters-in-law and 33 grandchildren, 181 in total. Commenting on the film, the film's director Yuvaraj spoke of how much faith Vadivelu has put in him and he efforts he made in the film, \\"There are several reasons for viewers to watch this film. The first is Vadivelu sir. My film will mark his return to cinema after a two-year break. He will be seen in dual roles and both roles will make you smile. To differentiate between the two characters he plays in the film, Vadivelu sir created a different body language for one of the characters. For instance, he created a different walking and talking style for a particular character. In fact, he would blink several times more while playing this character. It was amazing to see the way he transformed himself. Vadivelu sir received several offers, but he chose my film to mark his comeback and gave me the opportunity to work with him. I am just 27 years old. When some top heroes are scared to trust youngsters, he has shown that he has immense faith in the youth of this country.\\" he saidVadivelu created a new body language – The Times of India Actress Meenakshi Dixit was aware of the fact that the film did not feature a regular hero, yet she agreed to work in the film because she didn't want to miss an opportunity to work with Vadivelu, \\"I was told by many people not to do this film but my heart was all for it. I was sure about one thing that maybe I'm not working with a regular hero but I will not get an opportunity to work with a legendary comedian. Moreover, the movie concentrates more on the content rather than just the hero. I'm very proud to be a part of such a prestigious project by a great production house. Working with him was an experience of a lifetime. I have learnt a lot from him. He is the most humble and grounded person I have ever met in my life. It was a challenge to match the comic timing of Vadivelu because he would improvise randomly on sets. I would have practiced my lines for hours and then when we do the scene, everything would have been improvised by Vadivelu. So, catching up with him was a challenge.\\" she saidDidn't want to miss working with Vadivelu – Meenakshi Dixit – nowrunning Furthermore, Vadivelu stated, \\"This is a very good film, one people must watch,\\" he said and added, \\"I am sure they will like it. I wanted to mark my return with a film that would stand out. And I chose this script after listening to several others. We have added some imaginary events to short stories we know and have shot the film in a manner that will not hurt anybody's feelings or sentiments,\\" he said. Pointing out to him that his director Yuvaraj was grateful that he had been entrusted with the task of directing a film that marked his return to cinema and he replied, \\"Today's youngsters are full of passion. This youngster was like camphor. If I began narrating a scene, he would complete it for me. He is sharp and has a bright future. He might be 26, but has the wisdom of a 62-year-old. I've realized that one must never dismiss or underestimate anybody just because they are young. In fact, I have worked as an assistant director to him in this film. My producer has placed a lot of faith in me. Despite several people trying to dissuade him from making this film, he has backed me. I am grateful for the support he has extended.\\" he said.Never underestimate a youngster – Vadivelu – The Times of IndiaVadivelu thanks producer for backing him = Allegations of depiction of historical figures = Certain Telugu associations had written to the Censor Board seeking the removal of any scene that degrades Tenali Raman, the legendary minister in King Krishnadevaraya's court. The organisations had petitioned the censor board to appoint an expert committee of Andhra historians to check the movie.Vadivelu's Tenaliraman runs into trouble It was understood that he plays the roles of Tenali Raman and his King Krishnadevaraya. In his interview to a leading National newspaper, the film's director, Yuvraj Dhayalan had clarified that Vadivelu had not acted as King Krishnadevaraya in his film. He also added that his film was not based on any real incidents and it was a summation of a few moral stories about Tenaliraman.Vadivelu is not Krishnadevaraya – Indiaglitz Commenting on the issue, the director of the film, Yuvaraj Dhayalan had said that he was ready to screen his film to any committee that had raised concerns and that they could very well ask him to show the film to them. He confirmed that there will be no scenes that will degrade Tenali Raman and that the Censor Board had looked into all the concerns posed by the Telugu associations and cleared the film with a 'U' certificate without any cuts. He furthermore said that the film has been in the making for a very long time and people knew very well that Vadivelu was acting in it and that they should have raised this concern some six months ago and not around the time of the release of the film and that the intentions of the entire team of the film was not to hurt anyone's sentiments.No scene in my film degrades Tenali Raman – The Times of India Addressing the concerns raised by the Telugu groups, Vadivelu himself also stated that there was no mention of the Krishnadevaraya in the film and that the word \\"Manna\\" only was used to address the King throughout the film.Master of gags is back – The Hindu An official statement signed by R. Rangarajan, director of AGS entertainment, which produces the film, stated that the film is an imaginary story conceived on the basis of Tenaliraman's moral stories and that the film doesn't reflect neither the life history of Tenaliraman nor that of any person with whom Tenaliraman was associated with/lived with and that the story of the film is an imaginary one reflecting the lifestyle of people who lived in the 15th century in the backdrop of the present happenings and events and that all the characters appearing in the film are fictitious.Vadivelu's Tenaliraman in controversy – The Times of India The Telugu groups moved to the High Court on Friday and also sought the intervention of the Tamil Nadu government. On Friday, two Telugu organisations filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu Government to pass appropriate orders on their representation with regard to the film. The petitioners, Tamil Nadu Telugu Makkal Peravai and Tamil Nadu Telugu Yuva Sakthi, said that the film's producer had not considered the facts about King Krishnadevaraya and that they had produced the movie with its own ideology. \\"History should not be twisted;\\" the petitioners said. At a press meet in the city, representatives of various Telugu organisations said they were also attempting to make a representation to the Chief Secretary seeking a halt to the release of the film. \\"Tenaliraman is a historic character who was a poet in the court of Krishnadevaraya, a great king.

Historically in Cumberland, it lies just to the west of Keswick and to the east of the Grisedale Pike ridge, in the Borough of Allerdale. It forms part of the civil parish of Above Derwent. The eastern end of the Whinlatter Pass road is in the village. The A66 road bypasses Braithwaite, but does not enter the village. Braithwaite is situated around Coledale Beck, a brook which joins Newlands Beck shortly after passing through the village. Newlands Beck (coming from the Newlands Valley) then flows north towards Bassenthwaite Lake. Braithwaite has a Village Shop by the Low Bridge, several pubs, including the Coledale Inn, the Royal Oak and the Middle Ruddings Hotel. Braithwaite is easily accessible due to its close proximity to the A66. It has a campsite with a caravan park, B + Bs, pubs and guest houses. It has a wide range of sports including sailing, climbing, abseiling, canoeing, hang-gliding, parasailing, orienteering, bird watching (For ospreys in the nearby lakes), photography and virtually any other outdoor pursuit all within four miles of the village. Nearby is the Hope Memorial Camp, a residential centre used throughout the year by youth groups from all over the country. The camp was the brain-child of Mr A H Hope, Headmaster of The Roan School, Greenwich (now The John Roan School) from 1916 to 1930. In 1923, with his own money, Hope bought forty acres of land to the north-west of the village and built four huts on it, to provide his South London grammar school boys with 'an opportunity of seeing mountains and lakes and of having the valuable experience of camping and living at close quarters with others.' With the aid of The Roan Foundation, the original green and white painted wooden structures were replaced in 1989 by more substantial ones using modern building materials. The Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway, now closed, called at a station in Braithwaite. Braithwaite is situated next to the fell called Barrow. A small mountain in the Newlands region which is a short walk from Braithwaite. Braithwaite is near to the Whinlatter Forest which has many walking trails of varying length.

He played college football at Texas Christian University. Early years Gibbs was a highly recruited athlete coming out of Graham High School. He accepted a football scholarship from Texas Christian University, to become part of the school's tradition at quarterback. In college, he was a highly publicized athlete, who was usually mentioned in pre-season All-American teams, but could never reach that type of success. As a sophomore, he shared the quarterback position with Donald George, recording 47 completions (second in the conference) out of 111 attempts (second in the conference) for 473 yards (fifth in the conference), 3 touchdowns (tied for fifth in the conference) and 9 interceptions. In 1961, as a junior he registered 71 completions (second in the conference) out of 137 attempts (led the conference) for 999 yards (led the conference), 6 touchdowns (tied for second in the conference) and 8 interceptions. He also played a key role in beating the #1 ranked University of Texas and received the Rogers Trophy as the team MVP at the end of the season. As a senior, he was the second leading passer in the conference with 89 completions out of 169 attempts for 1,013 passing yards, 9 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. He played in the East-West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl and the Chicago College All-Star Game. As a three-year starter, he finished with 207 completions for 2,485 passing yards and 18 touchdowns. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= With no first round draft choice in the 1962 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys selected Gibbs in the second round (18th overall) with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over. He was also selected by the Denver Broncos in the 14th round (106th overall) of the 1962 AFL Draft. In 1963, Gibbs entered the league as the tallest quarterback in NFL history (until 1991 when Dan McGwire broke the record). Being the third string quarterback, he wasn't activated for any game of the season. He also developed a close relationship with Don Meredith, where Gibbs tried to emulate his lifestyle. He was waived on September 3, 1964. =Toledo (UFL)= In 1964, he signed with the Toledo Tornadoes of the United Football League at the request of the Dallas Cowboys. =Detroit Lions= Even though he signed a three-year no-cut contract that was honored by the Dallas Cowboys, he was released before the start of the 1964 season. On October 27, 1964, because the Cowboys still held Gibbs rights, the Detroit Lions traded a fourth-round draft choice (#53-Bob Svihus) and paid over US$40,000 to be able to sign him, so he could back up Milt Plum, after Earl Morrall was lost for the year with a broken collarbone. In 1965, he walked away from the NFL, after Gibbs was told that he was going to be traded. =Philadelphia Bulldogs (Continental League)= In 1965, he signed with the Philadelphia Bulldogs of the Continental Football League. He was a backup behind Bob Brodhead, making 9-of-19 completions (47.4%) for 196 yards, 2 touchdowns and one interception. =Brooklyn Dodgers (Continental League)= In 1966, he was selected in the Continental Football League expansion draft by the Brooklyn Dodgers.

He started 4 games and went 1-3, before the club folded. He tallied 49-of-102 completions (48%) for 640 yards, one touchdown and 4 interceptions. =Charleston Rockets (Continental League)= On September 27, 1967, he was signed by the Charleston Rockets to replace quarterback Ron Miller.

In 1968, Bernard Judge was awarded a United States patent for his innovative structural system based on a four-pole, pre-cut residential module. His own home in the Hollywood Hills is based on this construction. He referred to the dome as his \\"Triponent House.\\" Early life Judge was born in New York City to Helene Chatelain Judge, a painter and anthropologist, and Joseph Michael Judge, an architect and Dean of Architecture at Penn State in the 1930s. He spent his early childhood at his family home in Fontainbleau, outside Paris; Managua, Nicaragua; and Mexico City. After completing high school in Forest Hills, New York, he served in the U.S. Naval Construction Battalions in French Morocco for four years, followed by architectural study at L’Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. He completed his architectural studies at the University of Southern California (where he was influenced by his professors Gregory Ain and Conrad Buff) in 1960. Career Judge received initial recognition in 1960 when his first project, “The Triponent House”, which he built in the Hollywood Hills, was published in several international journals. His “Triponent House”, a geodesic dome completed in 1962, was Judge’s effort to find an economically sound solution to housing using the finest technology of the day.http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675069563_a- bubble-house_erected-on-Hollywood-hillside_man-washes_men-talk He called his experimental house “Triponent” for its three intrinsic elements: the envelope, utility core, and interior spaces. The envelope consisted of a 50-foot diameter geodesic dome covered with transparent Mylar, and shaded by photo- electric cells. The utility core contained the manufactured plumbing, utilities, kitchen and bathroom appliances, mechanical and electrical systems. Interior spaces were left open for the individuals using them to design for themselves accordingly. The geodesic framework of the “Triponent House” is at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1965, Judge started his own architectural firm, The Environmental Systems Group, with the concentration of his work in residential and commercial design, preservation, and resort facility planning, with particular focus on the local environment and culture. He has conducted housing research in a dozen countries around the world, taught design and lectured on environmental design at California State University, Long Beach, California Polytechnic Institute, Pomona, University of California Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Southern California Institute of Architecture, and University of California Berkeley. Judge has been published in architectural books and design journals across the globe and has addressed the International Society for Coral Reef Studies. =Book= His environmental work with Marlon Brando producing the early 1970s master plan and architectural design for Tetiaroa, Tahiti was a defining experience both personally and professionally. Over the years, the reception Judge received from audiences responding to his talks about the project encouraged him to write the book published by ORO editions in 2011, Waltzing with Brando. In Waltzing with Brando, Planning a Paradise in Tahiti, Judge recounts his experiences from 1970 to 1975 creating a sustainable village on an unpopulated group of islands and lagoon in the South Pacific for Marlon Brando, who had recently purchased Tetiaroa. The book is an illustrated narrative about the dynamics of the architect and client collaboration on an environmentally and culturally rich atoll, investigating living in nature without despoiling the ecology, archeology, or interdependence of marine life.

This metric is useful for benchmarking, identifying trends, estimating the holding period, and controlling returns for the effect of business cycles. Overview The year of investing is an important and widely used metric to compare performance of the investments financed in the year in question against that of the investments financed in other years or against that of the general market (S&P; 500). As the external market conditions change following the overall business cycle, so does performance of investments. Therefore, returns of 50% on investments done in good years are not directly comparable to returns of 10% done in crisis years. That is why a vintage year is taken into account.Returns and IRRs – an explanation The returns are comparable if investments share approximately the same timing. Origin Most likely, the term vintage year is borrowed from the winemaking industry, where it is also used to divide wines in comparable classes.

(Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon pallidus.) It is an upright shrub with thin, spreading branches, silvery new growth and pale yellow, sometimes pinkish bottlebrush flowers. Description Melaleuca pallida is a shrub or tree growing to tall, with fibrous or papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, flat or broadly v-shaped, narrow elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrow end towards the base and with a small point at the end. There is a distinct mid-vein, 6-16 indistinct side veins and many distinct oil glands. The flowers are a shade of cream to yellow, occasionally pinkish-red and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are in diameter with 15 to 50 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 34–70 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from October to February and is followed by fruit that are woody, cup-shaped capsules, long.M. pallida in the Gibraltar Range National Park Taxonomy and naming The lemon bottlebrush was first formally described in 1816 by Aimé Bonpland, who gave it the name Metrosideros pallida and published the description in Description des plantes rares cultivées à Malmaison et à Navarre. In 1828, de Candolle changed the name to Callistemon pallidus and in 2006 Lyndley Craven changed the name to Melaleuca pallida. The specific epithet (pallida) is a Latin word meaning “pale” referring to the pale flower colour. Callistemon pallidus is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca pallida by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pallida occurs from the Border Ranges area in far south eastern Queensland, through the ranges and slopes of New South Wales to eastern Victoria. It is also present in all but the far west of Tasmania and on some Bass Strait islands. It grows in streams and wet, rocky slopes. Use in horticulture Melaleuca pallida is sometimes cultivated as Callistemon pallidus. It is a hardy plant, adaptable to many soils but needs full sun.

The riot reportedly began as the crowd got angry either after hearing an inflammatory speech or after seeing photographs of Assam violence and Rakhine state riots. The riot resulted in two deaths and injuries to 63 people including 58 police officers. Mumbai Police estimated that the riots caused a loss of 2.74 crore in damages to public and private property. Background The indigenous Bodo community of Assam alleged that the Muslim population is increasing in Assam due to the large influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, while the local Muslim community brushed it aside saying that they migrated to Assam during the British Raj. But, with the increasing population, there arose competition for lands, livelihood and power,http://www.firstpost.com/india/assam-riots-fruits-of-living-in-denial- over-bangladesh-influx-390536.html Firstpost,Jun 25,2012 which led to Assam agitation. Both the indigenous people of Assam and Bengali Muslims felt that the Central Government failed to protect both sides. This ethnic tension between the indigenous Bodo people and Bengali Muslims escalated into a riot in Kokrajhar on 20 July 2012, when unidentified miscreants killed four Bodo youths at Joypur.

Background  The Nelson Section was an isolated, 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge, government-owned railway line running south from Nelson to Glenhope in the Tasman district of New Zealand's South Island. Begun in 1876, it reached Glenhope, about 96 km south of Nelson, in 1912. Desultory work beyond Glenhope went on until 1931, but the Nelson section was never connected to the rest of the South Island rail network. While the line was profitable in its early years, falling revenues and increasing costs of maintenance resulted in closure in 1955, despite protest meetings, sit-ins to stop demolition trains, and a 12,000 strong petition calling for the re-opening of the line and an investigation of an alternative link-up with the rest of the network via a line to Blenheim.Churchman, G. and Hurst, T., 1990, ‘The Railways of New Zealand; a Journey Through History' (2nd edition 2001), Transpress New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand, , pps 172 -173  Political response  In response to the call for an alternative connection to the rest of the South Island network, Prime Minister Sidney Holland promised completion of a survey of possible northern routes from Nelson to Blenheim, and reports on other potential routes via the West Coast. A decision on a rail link would be made after the surveys and reports were completed. In the meantime, in recognition of transport problems caused by Nelson's lack of a rail connection, Prime Minister Holland announced the government would subsidise the cost of transporting passengers and goods by road between Nelson and Blenheim so that the charges to the users would be the same as if a railway already existed. So on 4 November 1957, with an eye to the imminent general election, the National government announced that between Blenheim and Nelson would be deemed by law to be a 'notional railway', connecting with the rest of the South Island network at Blenheim. Various points on the highway were designated as stations. This meant that passenger fares and freight rates from any railway station in the South Island to designated stations on the notional railway, or to Nelson, were calculated as if there were continuous railway mileage between the two points, even though in reality passengers or freight travelling on the notional railway were transported by road carriers. As rail rates for both passengers and freight were significantly cheaper than road carrier rates, this was to the user's advantage.  Costs  From the start the scheme inflicted significant costs on the government via the Railways Department, and later via the Department of Internal Affairs who took over administering the scheme in the early 1960s.Hoare, G., 1990, 'Nelson's Notional Railway: The Political Distortion of Geographical Space', Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie, Volume 81, Issue 1, pages 48–57, February 1990, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9663.1990.tb01746.x/abstract The first year of operation cost the Railways Department £105,000. However, unlike a real railway that can benefit from attracting more custom, and hence more revenue, the more patronage the notional railway attracted the greater the subsidy paid by the Railways Department or (later) by the Department of Internal Affairs – and ultimately, by the taxpayer. In the 1972 fiscal year the government paid $660,745 in subsidies to keep the notional railway in existence.Bromby, R., 2003, ‘Rails That Built a Nation: an Encyclopedia of New Zealand Railways', Grantham House Publishing, Oriental Bay, Wellington, New Zealand, , pps 111 -112  Demise  On 1 March 1960 the Labour government, elected with a one-seat majority in 1957, broke ground on a line from Nelson to Blenheim. In Nelson reclamation work was begun to create space for a new station and rail yards. However the Labour government lasted only one three- year term, and on 14 December 1960 the new National Party Prime Minister Keith Holyoake announced that all work on the Nelson–Blenheim line was to stop immediately, and the enabling legislation would be repealed in the first session of the new parliament. This ended all hopes of Nelson being connected to the rest of the railway network by a line of rail. Despite this, the Nelson–Blenheim notional railway persisted for another 19 years until the subsidy was finally abolished on 1 October 1979, by which time it was costing around $10 million a year to run.

The dialogues were co-written by Ajayan Venugopalan. Vijay Babu and Sandra Thomas produced the film for Friday Film House. It features Mohanlal in the lead role, and Baburaj, Aju Varghese, Ragini Nandwani, Mukesh, Vijay Babu, and Sean James Sutton appear in supporting roles. Arrora composed the background score and soundtrack, while Arvind Krishna and Vivek Harshan did the cinematography and editing. Jagannathan (Mohanlal), an Indian politician is good at solving problems using his wit and unorthodox ideas. To get rid of him, fellow politician Francis Kunjappan (Mukesh) offers him a task he has never done before in the United States which could give him enough money to fulfill his dream of owning a sports academy. Jagannathan ends up being the chief political adviser for a struggling candidate, John Kory (Sean James Sutton), in the California governor's election campaign and uses tactics standard in Indian politics to help win the election. Vaidyanathan got the story idea when he watched a political debate on television in the United States. He originally wrote the screenplay in Tamil and English. Ajayan Venugopalan translated it into Malayalam in 2013. The same year the film was announced, he converted it into a Malayali context. Principal photography began in mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala. Set almost entirely in the United States, the majority of the film was shot in Burbank, California. Some parts were shot in Trivandrum and Kochi, where filming wrapped in July 2014. Peruchazhi was released worldwide on 29 August 2014 on 500 screens, the widest release for a Malayalam film at the time. It was distributed in Kerala by Friday Tickets, and by Fox Star Studios in the rest of India. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. The film has a good opening at the box office. The film was released on DVD on 22 December 2014. Plot In California, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kory is trying to raise his dismal poll numbers. Sunny Kurishingal, Kory's chief adviser, is running out of ideas to ensure Kory's victory. Sunny asks Francis Kunjappan, a Public Works Department minister in Kerala and his friend, for advice on hiring a political consultant. Kunjappan, recommends his friend (and political rival) Jagannathan, hoping to rid himself of a threat to his ministerial position. Jagannathan, a young politician and sports enthusiast, knows no English but has a talent for solving serious problems prudently (as Kunjappan knows firsthand). However, Kunjappan thinks that Jaganathan’s unorthodox ideas will fail in the United States. Kunjappan meets Jagannathan and offers him the job for 30 crore (300 million), enough to realize Jagannathan's dream project of owning a sports academy. Jagannathan accepts the assignment and flies to the US with his assistants, Pottakuzhi Jabbar and Vayalar Varkey. They are met by Sunny, who explains their job and the US political system. Unlike India, there are only two major parties: Republican and Democratic. The Democratic Party is leading in California and their candidate, George Hopes, is well-liked by the public. Jagannathan must increase the Republican poll numbers, enabling them to win the election, and decides to use Indian political tactics; he influences the media, recruiting screenwriters to craft effective speeches. He meets a Chinese man, Dupli, who sells counterfeit electronic equipment. Jagannathan is also looking for a girl to marry. He meets a prostitute, Jessy, and they fall in love. Kory's poll numbers are rising rapidly because of Jagannathan's tactics. One night, though, Sunny and Kory visit him with bad news. Sunny tells him that a compromising video of Kory and a girl has been leaked; although all copies have been destroyed, the original is believed to be in Hopes' locked room. Jagannathan takes the video from Hopes' house, giving Sunny a message that the tape has been destroyed. The election campaign is declared over, and John Kory is certain to win. When Sunny learns that the campaign budget has been overspent, they decide to withhold Jagannathan's fee. Sunny promises that if he makes the campaign cost-effective, he will be considered for a cabinet post. Jagannathan asks for his fee one last time, saying that he needs it to ransom Jessy's child, but Sunny dismisses him. Knowing that he has been cheated, Jagannathan warns Sunny that he will make Kory lose the election the following day. He comes with the money, but it is not known where it came from. Kory loses the election, which is a shock to the Republican Party. Jagannathan calls Sunny and tells him that he joined Andy and Hopes, who paid his fee. With Dupli's help, Jagannathan replaced the voting machines with duplicates. The video was not destroyed; Jabbar made a copy, which was released to the media. Jagannathan and his friends return to India with Jessy, and he opens his sports academy.

It was said to be a comedy and Tamil film director Arun Vaidyanathan was to be the director, making his debut in Malayalam cinema. Vaidyanathan got the idea for the script during his stay in the United States, when he watched a debate between two political leaders on television: \\"It was fun and something unheard of in India. I thought that would make an interesting script.\\" According to Vaidyanathan, Peruchazhi is an original script, although Cho Ramaswamy's 1971 Tamil political satire, Muhammad bin Tughluq, which he considers is still relevant and ahead of its time, influenced the kind of humour used in the film. Vaidyanathan wrote two drafts of the screenplay, one in English and one in Tamil. He had no plans initially to direct the film in Malayalam. When he met Mohanlal, he had an English script. After Mohanlal signed on for the project, Vaidyanathan then planned to make it in Malayalam. Writer-director Ajayan Venugopalan, known for his Malayalam television sitcom Akkara Kazhchakal (set in the US), was chosen to translate the dialogue into Malayalam; he converted the story into a Malayali context. Venugopal said, the story was inspired by political stunts that happen in India in the name of democracy. It is \\"a spoof-cum-satirical take on what happens when an Indian politician gets to lead a Gubernatorial election in the U. S.\\" The characters are \\"larger than life\\" and the film was to be a tribute to Mohanlal with many references from his earlier films. He began the translation in 2013. The title Peruchazhi refers to the bandicoot (a rodent). Of the title Vaidyanathan said: \\"A bandicoot has its own instincts. For instance, we have no idea where it comes from and where it vanishes to. It just appears and takes what it wants in the process. Jagannathan, the character played by Lal Sir [Mohanlal], is like that. He will do anything to win.\\" He describes Peruchazhi as a spoof about how a politician from Kerala ends up being the chief political adviser to a state election campaign in California and the havoc he creates while chasing success there. Since Vaidyanathan wanted the protagonist to have international appeal, he named him \\"Ulaganathan\\" (conqueror of the world) in his original Tamil script; in Malayalam the name was changed to \\"Jagannathan\\", its meaning unchanged. =Cast and crew= According to Vaidyanathan, he was not thinking of Mohanlal while writing the screenplay, but eventually after he had finished it he thought Mohanlal would be the right actor because he considers him \\"an amazing humourist\\" with \\"great comic timing.\\" Mohanlal agreed to do the film right after briefing the script. Vaidyanathan's wife, a native of Kerala, suggested Mohanlal's name. He plays Jagannathan, a politician from Kerala, his crooked strategies gave him the nickname \\"Peruchazi\\". Vaidyanathan defined Jagannathan as a \\"gentle Chanakyan.\\" Mukesh, who plays Francis Kunjappan, was among the first actors to be signed after Mohanlal. In October 2013, American actress, and former Miss India USA, Pooja Kumar was announced as the heroine, making her Malayalam film debut. She was reported to be playing an Indian girl born and brought up in the United States. Baburaj and Aju Varghese were also confirmed playing comical sidekicks to Mohanlal's Jagannathan. However, in early March 2016, North Indian actress Ragini Nandwani was confirmed as the female lead; the makers zeroed in on Nandwani after considering several other actresses. In March 2014, Tamil actor Delhi Ganesh was confirmed to be making a cameo appearance. Poonam Bajwa was signed for an item number in a song. In early April 2014, stand-up comedian turned actor Ashvin Mathew announced through his social networking pages that he had been cast in a small comic role. At the same time, producers Sandra Thomas and Vijay Babu announced that since they were travelling with the crew to the U. S. for the filming, they would also appear in the film as a cost- saving measure. Babu plays Sunny Kurishingal. Initially the producers approached a number of actors who fit the \\"requisites of a savvy Indian- American,\\" but none of them was ready to afford the length filming schedule in the United States. Hence Babu himself took the part. Taiwanese-American actor John Wusah was cast as Dup Lee after attending an audition in the United States for the role. Shankar Ramakrishnan's role as an American Senator was confirmed in early June 2014. Aneesh G. Menon was confirmed in July 2014, playing a politician in the film. Vineeth Mohan got his first speaking role as Kunjappan's driver. Arrora (Navin) composed Peruchazhi songs and background score. Aravind Krishna was the film's cinematographer, and N. Madhusudhanan was signed to provide visual effects. M. Bawa and Julie Ziah were the art directors. Preethi S. Kanthan designed the costumes. According to Vaidyanathan, Jagannathan's dhoti (designed by Kanthan) was \\"inspired by ancient Roman design. The same border was used on the toga worn by Julius Caesar and his ministers. The leaf in the border denotes power.\\" Raymonds provided the coats for the film's characters. =Filming= At an event in September 2013, Mohanlal announced that the film would begin shooting in February 2014. In March 2014, it was reported that filming would begin in the second week of April 2014. Principal photography actually began in mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala. Two of the film's sequencesa fight and an item song, which take place in the U. S. were shot on a set created inside the compound of The Raviz Hotel, Kollam. The Kollam schedule was completed on 8 May 2014. Filming in Kollam for a film set in America, was criticised by some of the media in Kerala. Replying to it Vaidyanathan said in an interview: \\"If you are making Titanic, you don't have to build an entire ship and make it sink. The news of us shooting in the U. S. got lesser prominence in the media than the shooting in Kerala, which was there for three or four days. There are certain things that we thought would be better if we shot it here [Kollam]. What matters in the end is the content on screen.\\" Burbank, California where most of the filming took place The cast and crew travelled to the United States on 12 May 2014, on a schedule which was expected to wrap on 16 June 2016. Filming took place for around 35 days in America. Most of the crew members were from the U. S. and worked six hours per day. Los Angeles International Airport was one of the locations. Peruchazhi was filmed almost entirely in Burbank, California, near Hollywood in Los Angeles. In early June 2014, Vaidyanathan said that almost 60 percent of the filming had been completed. It is the first Malayalam film to be shot at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. The production cost was around 4.5 crore (45 million) for the U. S. schedule. Although Peruchazhi is mostly set in the U. S., the film opens and ends in Kerala, for which a number of scenes were shot in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. The film wrapped on 5 July at Sacred Heart College in Thevara, Kochi. Peruchazhi was made using the Auro 11.1 sound format, making it the second Malayalam film to use it; the first was Swapaanam (2014), directed by Shaji N. Karun. According to Sandra Thomas, Peruchazhi cost four times more than the average Malayalam film. The film's total production cost is estimated to be 10 crore (100 million). Music Naveen \\"Arrora\\" Iyer composed the film's original soundtrack and background score. Perruchazhi was Arrora's debut as a composer for Malayalam cinema. He had worked before as a flautist for A. R. Rahman. The soundtrack consists of six tracks sung by Karthik, Arrora, Bombay Jayashri, Blaaze, Jyotsna Radhakrishnan, and Andrea Jeremiah. Rajeev Nair, R. Venugopal, and Blaaze wrote the songs' lyrics. The label Think Music released the soundtrack album, on 30 July 2014. \\"Po Mone Dinesha\\" was a song that came from Mohanlal's popular catchphrase Ni Po Mone Dinesha from the 2000 film Narasimham. The song had two versions, one sung by Jyotsna Radhakrishnan, the other by Andrea Jeremiah. It was picturised with a dance sequence featuring Poonam Bajwa in belly dance attire. \\"Enthu Cheiyyan\\" is a romantic song sung by Bombay Jayashri and penned by R. Venugopal, the only melody on the soundtrack. \\"United States of Adipolica\\" and \\"Don't Mess With Me\\" are rap songs, both written by Jagannathan and rendered by Blaaze. A video of the song \\"Adichu Polikkam\\", sung by Karthik and Arrora, was released on YouTube on 28 July 2014. The song shows Jagannathan, Jabbar, and Varkey getting ready to travel to the U. S. In their review, The Times of India said, the soundtrack contains \\"trendy, danceable tracks\\". The highlight of \\"Adichu Polikkam\\" is \\"its singer, Karthik, and the track, which alternates between a soft anthem and a fast track, makes good use of his versatile voice.\\" The review described \\"Enthi Cheiyyan\\" as a \\"soothing song...quite addictive ... [that] ends with a classical bit.\\" It noted both versions of \\"Po Mone Dinesha\\" are \\"energetic and upbeat with a catchy beat all through but Andrea's version sounds more robust,\\" and said \\"Don't Mess With Me\\" was \\"stylish and catchy\\". Release The film's release date was announced in early July 2014 during the final stage of filming. Peruchazhi was released on 29 August 2014 in 500 screens worldwide, the widest release for a Malayalam film at that point. The film was distributed by Friday Tickets in Kerala and Fox Star Studios elsewhere in India. Peruchazhi was the first Malayalam film to be released simultaneously in the United States and India. PJ Entertainment distributed the film in Europe, while Achu & Achu's Creations handled distribution in Australia. The Middle East release was on 4 September 2014 — a premiere was held on the same day in the Golden Cinema theatre in Dubai. Friday Home Cinema and Empire Video released Peruchazhi on DVD on 22 December 2014. The film was broadcast on television by Amrita TV; it premiered in Vishu on 14 April 2015. =Marketing= The first-look poster for Peruchazhi was unveiled at Dreams Hotel in Kochi in April 2014, in conjunction with the 111-day celebration of the Friday Film House venture Philips and the Monkey Pen. Friday Peeps handled the film's promotion and advertising. A conceptual photoshoot was conducted separately to create the posters. The film's advertisers mounted a campaign in which Mohanlal's character gradually becomes more detailed. On 21 May 2014, Mohanlal's 54th birthday, Friday Film House released a 34-second trailer. A full-length trailer was released on 1 August 2014 which, according to Zee News, \\"created a buzz in social media.\\" It was the most viewed Malayalam film trailer receiving 150,000 views in 12 hours. Peruchazhi was promoted in train stations served by the Parasuram and Ernad Express, using wrap advertising with images, logos and posters of the film throughout the trains. The production team introduced a strategy game app, developed by Raklin, titled \\"Be a Peruchazhi\\" for the Android platform on 25 August 2014. Reception = Critical response = Nicy V. P. of the International Business Times gave the film four stars out of five, calling it a \\"clean entertainer.\\" She wrote, \\"The film has a few moments, which will take you back to good old days of Mohanlal film. If you are a Mohanlal fan, the film will be a feast for you and Arun Vaidyanathan has nailed a good political satire for this festive season.\\" Aswin J. Kumar of The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars, noting: \\"The attempt at political satire in this film is feeble, mindless and boring. It's more like a mask over disfigurement, for there is hardly any scope for satire in a narrative riddled with superfluous acts of a star who has begun to show signs of insecurity.\\" Sujit Chandra Kumar of Deccan Chronicle gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, writing: \\"Arun Vaidyanathan has packed [the film] with so much spice that even if one ingredient fails to please, there is still something else for that die-hard fan.\\" Malayala Manorama critic Arathi Kannan also awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five: \\"'Peruchazhi' is an exaggerated belief of a mediocre idea. And how it ends, reinforces the aforementioned statement! It isn’t so much a political mockery, as a political idiocy. But as for undying loyalties, the star with his 'mundu' action, alternatively 'suited and booted' is quite hoot- inspiring,\\" the director has \\"randomly put in some Mohanlal nostalgia from yonder. Once, twice, it's okay. The eleventh time, you'd start to think the movie has slowly transformed into an Onam cassette of sorts, a compilation of yesteryear Mohanlal gems.\\" Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com rated it two out of five stars, saying the film is \\"not up to the mark especially since it underutilises an actor of Mohanlal's caliber...it can easily pass off as a television programme, a tribute to the long innings of Mohanlal, one of the most mesmerising actors to grace the Indian screen...every comic sequence is punctuated by a reference to one of Mohanlal's films or lines from one of those films. This strategy becomes cumbersome after a while.\\" Writing for The New Indian Express, Pramod Thomas criticised the script, saying \\"the sequences where the intelligence of the protagonist is shown as an election-winning tactic are difficult to chew ... the screening of yesteryear scenes from the popular Mohanlal starrers seems to be okay in the beginning, but with weary repetition, even the hardcore fans will lose patience.\\" The critic from Sify called it \\"average,\\" and said: \\"In all fairness, the initial moments of the film are pretty fine and more so, when compared to the rest of the film ... Mohanlal's comic lines and sequences from his yesteryear hits are used ... in the first half, in an impressive way.\\" He described the second half as \\"boring\\" with \\"inane scenes that go on and on,\\" calling it far from entertaining. He also criticised the \\"poor\\" script. =Box office= Peruchazhi had an opening-day gross of 3 crore (30 million), the highest worldwide opening for a Malayalam film till then. According to Sify, the film's box-office receipts fell over the following weeks. The film released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2014, grossed a total of $46,265 from 16 screens in two weekends.

As well as competing as part of the Great Britain team Scott is also an able-bodied tandem cyclist, who since 2011 has acted as pilot for Paralympian Aileen McGlynn. Biography Scott was born in Birmingham, England in 1990. A keen sportsperson from a young age, her interest in cycling was sparked when her parents moved to Halesowen when she was 10, with Scott joining the local cycling club. Scott was accepted into University of Birmingham to study a degree in Sport, PE and Coaching Science in 2008. She only spent two weeks in Birmingham, leaving after being informed that she had been offered a place at British Cycling's Sprint Academy. As a member of the Sprint Academy, Scott represented the British team at national level. In 2009, she was part of the winning women's Team Sprint at the National Track Championships. In 2010 Scott joined the GB Para-Cycling Team, and was given the role of pilot to three-time Paralympic gold medalist Aileen McGlynn. In 2011 the two competed in the B1km Time Trial at the Para-Cycling Track World Championships in Montichiari, Italy taking silver. They followed this in 2012 by entering the UCI Para-Cycling Track World Championships held in Los Angeles in the United States. They took three silver medals at the Championships, in B3km Pursuit silver, B1km Time Trial and B Sprint. Scott took part in her first Summer Paralympic Games in 2012, again partnered with McGlynn. The pair entered both the Women's 1 km time trial B and the Women's individual pursuit B. In the time trial, Scott and McGlynn, took to the velodrome as the penultimate racers and posted the fastest time with 1.09.469; only for the current World Champions, Australia's Felicity Johnson and Stephanie Morton to record a Paralympic record of 1:08.919 in the last trial. In the individual pursuit Scott and McGlynn finished third in the preliminaries, setting them up for a bronze medal decider with British team-mates Lora Turnham and her pilot Fiona Duncan. Scott and McGlynn finished a second quicker taking their second medal of the games. Scott teamed up with Sophie Thornhill for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The pair won gold in the visually impaired tandem sprint when they defeated McGlynn and Louise Haston of Scotland 2–0 in the final and followed it up with a second gold in the kilo time trial.

Some efforts began during the American Colonial Period with renewed efforts during the Commonwealth, following independence, during Martial Law and especially following the People Power Revolution in 1986. The current law, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, was passed following the revolution and recently extended until 2014. History Much like Mexico and other Spanish colonies in the Americas, the Spanish settlement in the Philippines revolved around the encomienda system of plantations, known as haciendas. As the 19th Century progressed, industrialization and liberalization of trade allowed these encomiendas to expand their cash crops, establishing a strong sugar industry in the Philippines, especially in the Visayan island of Negros. =American period= The United States of America took possession of the Philippines following the Spanish–American War in 1898 and after putting down the subsequent rebellion in the Philippine–American War. The Second Philippine Commission, the Taft Commission, viewed economic development as one of its top three goals. In 1901 93% of the islands' land area was held by the government and William Howard Taft, Governor-General of the Philippines, argued for a liberal policy so that a good portion could be sold off to American investors. Instead, the United States Congress, influenced by agricultural interests that did not want competition from the Philippines, in the 1902 Land Act, set a limit of 16 hectares of land to be sold or leased to American individuals and 1,024 hectares to American corporations. This and a downturn in the investment environment discouraged the foreign-owned plantations common in British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and French Indochina. Further the U.S. Federal Government faced the problem of much of the private land being owned by the Roman Catholic Church and controlled by Spanish clerics. The American government—officially secular, hostile to continued Spanish control of much of the land of the now-American colony, and long hostile to Catholics—negotiated a settlement with the Church handing over its land. The 1902 Philippine Organic Act was a constitution for the Insular Government, as the U.S. civil administration was known. This act, among other actions, disestablished the Catholic Church as the state religion. The United States government, in an effort to resolve the status of the friars, negotiated with the Vatican. The church agreed to sell the friars' estates and promised gradual substitution of Filipino and other non-Spanish priests for the friars. It refused, however, to withdraw the religious orders from the islands immediately, partly to avoid offending Spain. In 1904 the administration bought for $7.2 million the major part of the friars' holdings, amounting to some , of which one-half was in the vicinity of Manila. The land was eventually resold to Filipinos, some of them tenants but the majority of them estate owners. =Commonwealth Period= During the American Colonial Period, tenant farmers complained about the sharecropping system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers' families. As a result, an agrarian reform program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners. An example of these clashes includes one initiated by Benigno Ramos through his Sakdalista movement, which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or haciendas, and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon in May 1935, claimed about a hundred lives Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 When the Philippine Commonwealth was established, President Manuel L. Quezon implemented the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933.Manapat, Carlos, et al. Economics, Taxation, and Agrarian Reform. Quezon City: C&E; Pub., 2010.Print. The purpose of this act was to regulate the share-tenancy contracts by establishing minimum standards. Primarily, the Act provided for better tenant-landlord relationship, a 50–50 sharing of the crop, regulation of interest to 10% per agricultural year, and a safeguard against arbitrary dismissal by the landlord. The major flaw of this law was that it could be used only when the majority of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it. Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province ever asked that the law be applied. Therefore, Quezón ordered that the act be mandatory in all Central Luzon provinces. However, contracts were good only for one year. By simply refusing the renew their contract, landlords were able to eject tenants. As a result, peasant organizations agitated in vain for a law that would make the contract automatically renewable for as long as the tenants fulfilled their obligations. In 1936, this Act was amended to get rid of its loophole, but the landlords made its application relative and not absolute. Consequently, it was never carried out in spite of its good intentions. In fact, by 1939, thousands of peasants in Central Luzon were being threatened with wholesale eviction. By the early 1940s, thousands of tenants in Central Luzon were ejected from their farmlands and the rural conflict was more acute than ever. Therefore, during the Commonwealth period, agrarian problems persisted. This motivated the government to incorporate a cardinal principle on social justice. Dictated by the social justice program of the government, expropriation of landed estates and other landholdings commenced. Likewise, the National Land Settlement Administration (NSLA) began an orderly settlement of public agricultural lands. At the outbreak of the Second World War, major settlement areas containing more than 65,000 hectares were already established. =Roxas Administration= When the Philippines gained its independence in 1946, much of the land was held by a small group of wealthy landowners. There was much pressure on the democratically elected government to redistribute the land. At the same time, many of the democratically elected office holders were landowners themselves or came from land-owning families. In 1946, shortly after his induction to Presidency, Manuel Roxas proclaimed the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 effective throughout the country. However problems of land tenure continued. In fact these became worse in certain areas. Among the remedial measures enacted was Republic Act No. 34 likewise known as the Tenant Act which provided for a 70–30 sharing arrangements and regulated share-tenancy contracts. It was passed to resolve the ongoing peasant unrest in Central Luzon. As part of his Agrarian Reform agenda, President Elpidio Quirino issued on 23 October 1950 Executive Order No. 355 which replaced the National Land Settlement Administration with Land Settlement Development Corporation (LASEDECO) which takes over the responsibilities of the Agricultural Machinery Equipment Corporation and the Rice and Corn Production Administration. =Ramon Magsaysay administration= President Ramon Magsaysay at the Presidential Study, Malacañan Palace To amplify and stabilize the functions of the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), President Ramon Magsaysay worked for the establishment of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA),Molina, Antonio. The Philippines: Through the centuries. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print. which took over from the EDCOR and helped in the giving of some sixty-five thousand acres to three thousand indigent families for settlement purposes. Again, it allocated some other twenty-five thousand to a little more than one thousand five hundred landless families, who subsequently became farmers. As further aid to the rural people, the president established the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Administration (ACCFA). The idea was for this entity to make available rural credits. Records show that it did grant, in this wise, almost ten million dollars. This administration body next devoted its attention to cooperative marketing. Along this line of help to the rural areas, President Magsaysay initiated in all earnestness the artesian wells campaign. A group- movement known as the Liberty Wells Association was formed and in record time managed to raise a considerable sum for the construction of as many artesian wells as possible. The socio-economic value of the same could not be gainsaid and the people were profuse in their gratitude. Finally, vast irrigation projects, as well as enhancement of the Ambuklao Power plant and other similar ones, went a long way towards bringing to reality the rural improvement program advocated by President Magsaysay. President Ramón Magsaysay enacted the following laws as part of his Agrarian Reform Program: * Republic Act No. 1160 of 1954 – Abolished the LASEDECO and established the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) to resettle dissidents and landless farmers. It was particularly aimed at rebel returnees providing home lots and farmlands in Palawan and Mindanao. * Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act of 1954) – Governed the relationship between landowners and tenant farmers by organizing share-tenancy and leasehold system. The law provided the security of tenure of tenants. It also created the Court of Agrarian Relations. * Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act of 1955) – Created the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) which was responsible for the acquisition and distribution of large tenanted rice and corn lands over 200 hectares for individuals and 600 hectares for corporations. * Republic Act No. 821 (Creation of Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration) – Provided small farmers and share tenants loans with low interest rates of six to eight percent. =Macapagal administration= Land Reform Code The Agricultural Land Reform Code (RA 3844) was a major Philippine land reform law enacted in 1963 under President Diosdado Macapagal. The code declared that it was State policy #To establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family-size farm as the basis of Philippine agriculture and, as a consequence, divert landlord capital in agriculture to industrial development; #To achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers free from pernicious institutional restraints and practices; #To create a truly viable social and economic structure in agriculture conducive to greater productivity and higher farm incomes; #To apply all labor laws equally and without discrimination to both industrial and agricultural wage earners; #To provide a more vigorous and systematic land resettlement program and public land distribution; and #To make the small farmers more independent, self-reliant and responsible citizens, and a source of genuine strength in our democratic society. and, in pursuance of those policies, established the following #An agricultural leasehold system to replace all existing share tenancy systems in agriculture; #A declaration of rights for agricultural labor; #An authority for the acquisition and equitable distribution of agricultural land; #An institution to finance the acquisition and distribution of agricultural land; #A machinery to extend credit and similar assistance to agriculture; #A machinery to provide marketing, management, and other technical services to agriculture; #A unified administration for formulating and implementing projects of land reform; #An expanded program of land capability survey, classification, and registration; and #A judicial system to decide issues arising under this Code and other related laws and regulations. =Marcos administration= On 10 September 1971, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed the Code of Agrarian Reform of the Philippines into law which established the Department of Agrarian Reform, effectively replacing the Land Authority. In 1978, the DAR was renamed the Ministry of Agrarian Reform. On 26 July 1987, following the People Power Revolution, the department was re-organized through Executive Order (EO) No. 129-A. In 1988, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law created the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program which is also known as CARP. =Corazon Aquino administration= President Corazon Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On 22 January 1987, less than a month before the ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the Malacañan Palace to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, 12 farmers were killed and 19 were injured in this incident now known as the Mendiola massacre. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts. In response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on 22 July 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new Congress of the Philippines passed Republic Act No. 6657, more popularly known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.\\" The law paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through just compensation but were also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land. However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to \\"voluntarily divest a proportion of their capital stock, equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries\\", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution. Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was \\"a revolutionary kind of expropriation.\\" Despite the implementation of CARP, Aquino was not spared from the controversies that eventually centered on Hacienda Luisita, a 6,453-hectare estate located in the Province of Tarlac, which she, together with her siblings inherited from her father Jose Cojuangco (Don Pepe). Critics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution under Executive Order 229. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda were transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers. The arrangement remained in force until 2006, when the Department of Agrarian Reform revoked the stock distribution scheme adopted in Hacienda Luisita, and ordered instead the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers. The Department stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead. =Ramos administration= President Fidel V. Ramos speeded the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) of former President Corazon Aquino in order to meet the ten-year time frame. However, there were constraints such as the need to firm up the database and geographic focus, generate funding support, strengthen inter-agency cooperation, and mobilize implementation partners, like the non-government organizations, local governments, and the business community. In 1992, the government acquired and distributed 382 hectares of land with nearly a quarter of a million farmer-beneficiaries. This constituted 41% of all land titles distributed by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) during the last thirty years. But by the end of 1996, the DAR had distributed only 58.25% of the total area it was supposed to cover. From January to December 1997, the DAR distributed 206,612 hectares. That year, since 1987, the DAR had distributed a total of 2.66 million hectares which benefited almost 1.8 million tenant-farmers. One major problem that the Ramos administration faced was the lack of funds to support and implement the program. The Php50 million, allotted by R.A. No. 6657 to finance the CARP from 1988 to 1998, was no longer sufficient to support the program. To address this problem, Ramos signed R.A. No. 8532 to amend the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) which further strengthened the CARP by extending the program to another ten years. Ramos signed this law on 23 February 1998 – a few months before the end of Ramos' term. =Arroyo administration= On 27 September 2004, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, signed Executive Order No. 364, and the Department of Agrarian Reform was renamed to Department of Land Reform. This EO also broadened the scope of the department, making it responsible for all land reform in the country. It also placed the Philippine Commission on Urban Poor (PCUP) under its supervision and control. Recognition of the ownership of ancestral domain by indigenous peoples also became the responsibility of this new department, under the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). On 23 August 2005, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 456 and renamed the Department of Land Reform back to Department of Agrarian Reform, since \\"the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law goes beyond just land reform but includes the totality of all factors and support services designed to lift the economic status of the beneficiaries.\\" When President Noynoy Aquino took office, there was a renewed push to compete the agrarian reform. The Department of Agrarian Reform adopted a goal of distributed all CARP-eligible land by the end of Pres. Aquino's term in 2016. As of June 2013, 694,181 hectares remained to be distributed, according to DAR. Hacienda Luisita, owned by the Cojuangco family, which includes the late former President Corazón C. Aquino and her son, former President Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III, has been a notable case of land reform.It is notable enough to have its own Wikipedia article. Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program is the current law under which land reform is conducted. Large land-holdings are broken up and distributed to farmers and workers on that particular hacienda. The crops grown on such haciendas include sugar and rice. Each farmer is giving a \\"certificates of land ownership award\\" or CLOA for their new property. Under the law, a landowner can only retain 5 hectares, regardless of the size of the hacienda. Conflict can arise between previous landowners and \\"beneficiaries\\" and between competing farmers' groups that have conflicting claims. In December 2008, CARP expired and the following year CARPer was passed. CARPer stands for \\"Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms\\". CARPer expired in 2014.

It is a blessing given to another. It is the standard response to the As-salamu alaykum () greeting. The greetings are intentional communications to acknowledge someone's presence, or to make someone feel welcomed. They are used prior to a conversation and are said to be good manners. The greeting is considered an important Islamic duty and obligation. Salam has been a standard salutation among Muslims. The greeting is regularly exchanged during Muslim lectures and sermons. The complete form is \\"Wa ʿalaykumu s-salāmu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh\\" (, \\"And upon you be peace, as well as the mercy of God and his blessings\\").  Literary meaning  \\"Salam\\" literally means \\"peace\\". The word \\"Islam\\" is also derived from it. In a wider sense \\"salam\\" means harmlessness, safety and protection from evil and from faults. As-Salaam is also one of the Names of Allah.  Use for non-Muslims  Religious scholars differ as to whether Muslims may initiate the saying of Salaam to members of other faiths. The Quran says: \\"When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally\\" [al-Nisa’ 4:86]al-Nisa’ 4:86 , Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 86 ) Ibn al-Qayyim said: if the person is certain that the Dhimmi (Jew or Christian) is clearly saying al-salaamu alaykum to him, and he has no doubts about that, should he say wa alayka al- salaam or shorten it to wa alayk? What is indicated by the evidence and principles of shareeah is that he should say wa alayka al-salaam, because this is more just, and Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well this does not contradict any of the ahaadeeth on this topic at all, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to shorten the greeting to wa alayk because of the reason mentioned above, which is that they deliberately used to say al-saam alaykum instead of al-salaam alaykum, as indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). He said, Do you not see that I say wa alaykum when they say al-saam alaykum? Then he said, If the People of the Book greet you with salaam, say, Wa alaykum.  Islamic rulings related to the use of Salam  It is also preferred to use the greeting when arriving and also when leaving. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah said “When one of you joins a gathering, let him say salaam. When he wants to get up and leave, let him say salaam. The former is not more important than the latter.” (Hasan hadith reported in Jāmi\` al- Tirmidhi) According to hadith the Islamic prophet Muhammad was asked who should \\"begin\\" the salam greeting and he said: :\\"The one who is riding should greet the one who is walking and the one who is walking should greet the one who is sitting and the smaller group should greet the larger group.\\" (Saheeh - Al-Bukhaari, 6234; Muslim, 2160)As Salaamu Alaikom? It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon the verse of the Qur'an: :\\"But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e. say: Assalaamu ‘Aleykum — peace be on you), blessed and good.\\" (Al-Noor 24:61) , Quran Surah An-Noor ( Verse 61 )  See also  * Peace be upon him * Peace be with you * Shalom aleichem * Sliem għalikom  References  Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Greeting words and phrases Category:Islamic terminology Category:Arabic words and phrases ","title":"Wa alaykumu s-salam"},{"id":"39808518","text":"Shekarpareh (sugar-candy) is a dessert in Khorasan, Iranian cuisine.

The Roots is a cross-cultural project in collaboration with French-Vietnamese jazz guitarist Nguyen Le. The duo aim to bring Vietnamese folk sounds to a wider audience with the release of two albums in 2013 and through performances at international music festivals. This project was officially launched with a concert, billed as Khởi Nguồn (The Roots- Beginning) on September 1, 2012 at the prestigious venue Hanoi Opera House. Alongside Quoc Trung and Nguyen Le, the concert featured Vietnamese pop diva Thanh Lam, traditional opera singer Kieu Anh, Tunisian musician Dhafer Youssef, and German percussion artist Rhani Krija. Judge for Vietnam Idol, the televised singing competition (season 2010 and 2012). A veteran producer and well regarded by his peers, Quoc Trung first appeared on the 3rd season of Vietnam Idol in 2010. He is since dubbed and apprehended by many contestants as Sir Difficult due to his sharp observation, keen ears and unequivocal comments. With his serious yet witty commenting style, Quoc Trung greatly contributed to the unprecedented social media phenomenon and assisted to the rise of 3rd season Vietnam Idol winner Uyen Linh in 2010. Thanh Viet Production founded by Quoc Trung in 2011, a record label and stage production company.

Thanh Viet also put together the annually concert series “Hold Hands when Summer Comes”(Cầm Tay Mùa Hè) and represent several talented young Vietnamese artists. For earlier works see Personal and Love life, Production Discography. Early life Quoc Trung is the only son of Trung Kiên, former vice-minister of Culture and Information in Vietnam, and of Thanh Nga (deceased) a stage performer. Being descendant of performers-artistes, born and raised in Hanoi, Quoc Trung is considered a late-boomer musically, his musical sensibility only became apparent in his early teens, which is uncommon for a child of similar upbringing. Academic Study His parents wanted Quoc Trung to follow the path of classical music. Despite his father's intent, young Quoc Trung rather played with his friends, and had only begun to seriously study classical piano at age 12. Quoc Trung progressed quickly with high marks. Unlike his father, a reputable tenor in classical and semi-classical, young Quoc Trung revealed an affinity for Pop music and sound-arrangement. He opted to pursuit his passion and graduated from the Faculty of Composition at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music. Quoc Trung was then sent for 2 years to National Music Academy of Sofia in Bulgaria for advanced learning. The National Music Academy of Sofia was unique and renowned musical institution of the Pop genre, in the then communist/socialist countries. Personal and Love life Quoc Trung and his wife Thanh Lam knew each other since childhood. When they fell in love they became the inspirational driving force behind each other's rising, fame and success. Upon returning to Ha Noi, Vietnam in 1991, Quoc Trung founded a music band with like-minded musicians called The Orient. Within two years of its creation, The Orient reached the top spot in the National Music Band Festival. Through Quoc Trung's leadership he transformed the band into the most popular band in North Vietnam. For over a decade, Quoc Trung and his bandmates produced and propelled singer Thanh Lam to stardom and Queen of Pop status, being the first Vietnamese female singer with own band. As the Diva’s singing performances and career gradually won over public's adulation, so grew the popularity of Quoc Trung and The Orient band from the North Vietnam to South Vietnam over the years. Unlike their art and collaboration in work that continues until today, the couple separated in 2004, after ten years. Both parted their own ways to collaborate with different entourage and artists. Ex-wife Thanh Lam bears two children s, a boy and a girl 17 and 19 as of 2015. Quoc Trung went on to build a major recording studio, produced most of Vietnam’s biggest singing stars for more than 20 years. Quoc Trung remained single father for several years after the separation with his first-wife Thanh Lam. He finally found another half and is currently happy in a relationship with a women who can make his heart sings again. Influences and Styles The distinct impression about Quoc Trung is that he possesses the ability to fuse and fine-tuning traditional Vietnamese sounds with modern electronic influences without losing his original pop and folklore identity. Quoc Trung incorporates many Vietnamese traditional strings instruments (Dan Bau, Dan Tranh, Dan Co, etc.), which he blends with digital mixers, samplers, and current Western instruments to create new revitalized tunes. As Quoc Trung gained more experience and exposure over the years in his musical journey, his style evolved and transitioned to what are now considered world/electronic/experimental/ambient/lounge all the while preserving his strong ties to the Vietnamese traditional instruments and sounds. Quoc Trung has said to be influenced by Phil Colins, Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Willie Nelson, Moby, Massive Attack, The Prodigy, Richard Bona, Björk, Air (French band) etc. Achievements Throughout his lifetime Quoc Trung has received a wide range of honours and awards. His reputation firmly established as the top producer and musical authority in Vietnam's music industry. His opinions are flag-bearers and are well respected by the public, professional musicians, artists and producers. In 2012, Quoc Trung was very vocal about the digital intellectual property copyright issue and the distribution of music on Internet websites, who freely broadcast tracks from new Albums with no regards to the artists and their copyrights in Vietnam. He admitted that this is a worldwide problem for the entertainment industry and not unique to Vietnam. His contestation proved to bring results as the Vietnam government starts to clench, regulate and apply profit sharing barometers between these online websites and recording artists. Beside working as a producer, arranger, music director for shows and festivals, Quoc Trung has also ventured in to the cinema and TV, composed soundtrack commercials, most notably for the Sony brand. He has written music for a number of Asian feature films. His music was even played in the official ads for Vietnam Airlines. Collaborators Thanh Lam, Duong Thu, Niels Lan Doky, Nguyen Le, Martin Hedin, Dhafer Youssef, Rhani Krija, Hong Nhung, Stephan Eicher, Tùng Dương, Xavier Desandre Navarre, Bui Huy Tuan, Manu Katche, Truong Anh Quan, Bent Bitte Iversen, My Linh, Tran Thu Ha, Uyen Linh and others.

Conclusion Quoc Trung is also known as a devoted recording studio builder. For many years his studio in Ha Noi were second to none, it was the dream venue to record albums and the envy of many composers/producers. Collecting and redistributing studio equipment remain his hobby and it also what keeps this veteran young at heart. As of today, Quoc Trung continues on his chosen path and he is looking forward to challenging himself on a higher level to the world audience with international artists and collaborations.

Life Marquet was born in 1869 in Moonta, South Australia, the son of a French workman painter. The family later moved to the larger town of Wallaroo, South Australia, and the young Marquet attended Taplin's Grammar School there. After school, he initially worked as a miner, before obtaining work as a printer's compositor. In that role he became skilled in process engraving. Marquet married Ann Donnell at St Mary's Church in Wallaroo in June 1891, by which time he was already an accomplished black-and-white artist. In 1897, he obtained his first work as an artist, employed as cartoonist for Quiz, a weekly magazine published in Adelaide. In the following years, Marquet sold work to a variety of magazines, including The Bulletin, Tocsin, Table Talk, The Australian Worker and Melbourne Punch. With his career taking off, Marquet moved to Melbourne in 1902 and then to Sydney in 1906. On 17 April 1920, Marquet and a companion were presumed drowned when a sailing boat they were travelling on sank during a sudden squall in Botany Bay. His body was never recovered. Following his death, an anthology of his work in The Worker was published, featuring tributes from contemporaries including Henry Lawson, Mary Gilmore and C. J. Dennis. Works \\"The Blood Vote\\" Marquet was a prolific illustrator, at times creating up to four cartoons each week. He worked almost exclusively in the black-and-white medium, using hard lines that showed up well, even given the low production standards of many of the publications of the day. Most of Marquet's work appeared in publications that supported left- wing and radical political positions. One of Marquet's best-known works is \\"The Blood Vote\\", an anti-conscription poster that was printed in great volume during the bitter second conscription campaign in Australia during the First World War. The illustration, showing a worried woman casting a vote on conscription, features a verse by William Winspear.

The words 'recruit' and 'recruiter' meant nothing more than filling a vacancy, so, the contemporary phrase recruiter member of parliament, meant a member of the House of Commons who had been elected in a by-election. During the English Civil War and Interregnum, no national or general election was held in England for twenty years, from the 1640 elections to the Long Parliament, until the 1660 elections to Charles II’s Convention Parliament. From 1645, the many vacant seats that arose in the Long and Rump Parliaments, by death and arbitrary expulsion (initially of many Royalist members, and later of many Leveller and Puritan members in Pride's military coup d'état) were filled by by-elections, or, so-called 'recruiter elections'. It seems clear that there was some stage management of the recruiter elections;David Underdown, \\"Party Management in the Recruiter Elections, 1645–1648\\", The English Historical Review, Vol.83, No.327 (April 1968), 235–264. indeed, it has been suggested that the recruiter elections during the period of the Civil War led to the change in character of elections from an Elizabethan model based on clientship and personality, to the beginning of system managed by party politics.Lawrence Stone, \\"The electoral influence of the second Earl of Salisbury, 1614–68\\", The English Historical Review, Vol.71, No.280 (July 1956), 384–400.J.

Retrieved 29 June 2013. History The church was dedicated to St Peter, probably in 1345. King Christopher of Bavaria transferred ownership to Maribo Abbey as first documented in 1451. That ownership remained after the Reformation when Maribo became a convent for women. After a period of ownership by Christian IV's Sorø Academy until its closure in 1665, the church came under the Crown until 1687. It was then transferred to Eggert Christopher von Knuth (1643-1697). As a result, it came under the County of Knuthenborg on its formation in 1714 where it remained until it became independent in 1911.

Architecture The apse, chancel and nave of this red-brick church were built in the Romanesque period, while the tower with its pyramidal spire and the porch were added at the beginning of the 15th century in the Gothic style. The north wing was completed in 1656. The Romanesque sections are decorated with corner lesenes and are topped with saw-tooth friezes. The round-arched windows have either been enlarged or bricked in. Thin vertical blank windows decorate the top of the tower. Interior and fittings Fresco of Seth at Adam's deathbed In the 14th century, star-shaped vaults were completed in the chancel and nave while the apse retained its half dome. The altarpiece, dated 1674, is rather unsophisticated baroque although the scenes in the central panel of the Last Supper and the Resurrection are somewhat earlier. The pulpit in the auricular style (c. 1650) presents cartouches of Faith, Hope and Charity. Investigations in 1908 revealed frescos in the chancel and apsis from two periods, c. 1300 and c. 1400. The latter are mostly well preserved with scenes from the Creation including images of Adam and Eve, the Judgment of Christ as well as several dragons.

It was very popular during the swing era of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Lindy was a fusion of many dances that preceded it or were popular during its development but is mainly based on jazz, tap, breakaway, and Charleston. It is frequently described as a jazz dance and is a member of the swing dance family. In its development, the Lindy Hop combined elements of both partnered and solo dancing by using the movements and improvisation of African-American dances along with the formal eight-count structure of European partner dances – most clearly illustrated in the Lindy's basic step, the swingout. In this step's open position, each dancer is generally connected hand-to-hand; in its closed position, leads and follows are connected as though in an embrace on one side and holding hands on the other. There was renewed interest in the dance in the 1980s from American, Swedish, and British dancers and the Lindy Hop is now represented by dancers and loosely affiliated grass-roots organizations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Lindy Hop today is danced as a social dance, as a competitive dance, as a performance dance, and in classes, workshops, and camps. Partners may dance alone or together, with improvisation a central part of social dancing and many performance and competition pieces. Lindy Hop is sometimes referred to as a street dance, referring to its improvisational and social nature. In 1932, twelve-year-old Norma Miller did the Lindy Hop outside the Savoy Ballroom with her friends for tips. In 1935, 15,000 people danced on Bradhurst Avenue for the second of a dance series held by the Parks Department. Between 147th and 148th street, Harlem \\"threw itself into the Lindy hop with abandon\\" as Sugar Hill residents watched from the bluffs along Edgecombe Avenue. History =From jazz to swing (1920s–1940s)= The first dances named as Lindy Hop were born around the time the aviator Charles Lindbergh made his groundbreaking flight across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927.See: Peter BetBasoo, Lindy Hop and Argentine Tango, copyright Peter BetBasoo, published in the Internet, 2009 The most famous Lindy Hop dance, which is not connected to the other Lindy Hop dances, was born in the Harlem dance marathon in 1928 where George Snowden and Mattie Purnell reinvented the breakaway pattern by accident. That started a process in which their invention became bigger than it initially suggested. Obviously, the Harlem dance is the only one of the Lindy Hop dances which survived in the long run.See: Terry Monaghan, 'George Snowden', The Dancing Times, July 2004. Jassdancer,blogspot.fi. Harri Heinilä, An Endeavor by Harlem Dancers to Achieve Equality – The Recognition of the Harlem-Based African-American Jazz Dance Between 1921 and 1943, pages 135-138 The Harlem Lindy Hop developed probably from four possible sources, or some combination thereof: the breakaway, the Charleston, the Texas Tommy, and the hop. A recorded source of the non-Harlem-connected Lindy Hop dances is the famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, nicknamed \\"Lucky Lindy\\", who \\"hopped the Atlantic\\" in 1927.LINDBERGH ARRIVES AFTER RECORD HOPS, The New York Times, Front Page,May 13, 1927HONDURANS HAIL LINDBERGH IN CONGRESS AND PALACE HOPS FOR NICARAGUA TODAY, The New York Times, January 5, 1928LINDBERGH REACHES GOAL AT HAVANA; SPOKESMEN OF PAN AMERICAN NATIONS AND 100,000 CUBANS WELCOME FLIER; WILD ACCLAIM AT LANDING Troops Barely Hold Back Great Crowd as Flier Taxis In.

The dance was reported to be Broadway's tribute to Lindbergh, and it included six basic steps.See: 'LIndy 'Hop' Difficult Dance', Pittsburgh Gazette Times, May 25, 1927. Later, a 'Lindy Hop' dance was described by columnist Gilbert Swan. He wrote, \\"Obviously the first dance named for the Lindbergh flight was the 'Lindy Hop'...Like all trick dances, they will be done in a few theatres and dance halls, where experts appear, and that will be that\\".Reno Gazette, May 31, 1927 Later that year, on September 14, the Woodland Daily Democrat reported Catherine B. Sullivan describing the 'Lindy Hop' as having been placed third in the Dancing Masters of America, New Dances competition, behind the Kikajou and the Dixie Step. ( 'Lindy Hop' also described in reports as the 'Lindbergh Glide'). The journalist reports that Miss Johnson showed a very fast little step, with hops and a kick, whilst holding the arms out, like the Spirit of St Louis. The foot work is described as \\"dum-de-dum, dum-de-dum, dum-de-dum\\". According to Ethel Williams, the Lindy Hop was similar to the dance known as the Texas Tommy in New York in 1913. The basic steps in the Texas Tommy were followed by a breakaway identical to that found in the Lindy. Savoy dancer \\"Shorty\\" George Snowden told Marshall Stearns in 1959 that \\"We used to call the basic step the Hop long before Lindbergh did his hop across the Atlantic. It had been around a long time and some people began to call it the Lindbergh Hop after 1927, although it didn't last. Then, during the marathon at Manhattan Casino, I got tired of the same old steps and cut loose with a breakaway...\\" According to Snowden, Fox Movietone News covered the marathon and took a close-up of Shorty's feet. As told to Marshall and Jean Stearns, he was asked \\"What are you doing with your feet,\\" and replied, \\"The Lindy\\". The date was June 17, 1928. Snowden's account to Stearns probably refers to the fact that he used already existing elements of the dance when he and his partner Mattie Purnell had an accident in the dance marathon where they became separated for a while until Snowden got back to Purnell. According to Snowden, the crowd in the dance marathon answered enthusiastically to the accident. As Marshall Stearns put it, Snowden rediscovered the Breakaway pattern when the accident happened. But the accident where Snowden and Purnell devised the basic principle of the Lindy Hop turned out to be much bigger than it initially suggested. Their invention started a process which led the Lindy Hop to contests, theaters and ballrooms by the end of 1928, and to Broadway plays by 1930. Thus, Snowden and Purnell are the creators of the Harlem Lindy Hop.Harri Heinilä, An Endeavor by Harlem Dancers to Achieve Equality – The Recognition of the Harlem-Based African-American Jazz Dance Between 1921 and 1943, pages 135-138. Terry Monaghan, 'George Snowden', The Dancing Times, July 2004. Jassdancer.blogspot.fi. The first generation of Lindy Hop is popularly associated with dancers such as \\"Shorty\\" George Snowden, his partner Big Bea, and Leroy Stretch Jones and Little Bea. \\"Shorty\\" George and Big Bea regularly won contests at the Savoy Ballroom. Their dancing accentuated the difference in size with Big Bea towering over Shorty. These dancers specialized in so- called floor steps, but they also experimented with early versions of air steps in the Lindy Hop.Monaghan 2004. As white people began going to Harlem to watch black dancers, according to Langston Hughes: Hughes's mocking statement reflects how the Harlem Renaissance Movement acknowledged the Lindy Hop which the movement considered part of \\"low culture\\", and thus not an important cultural achievement.Heinilä 2016, page 330. According to Snowden, \\"When he finally offered to pay us, we went up and had a ball. All we wanted to do was dance anyway.\\" When by 1936 \\"Air steps\\" or \\"aerials\\" such as the Hip to Hip, Side Flip, and Over the Back (the names describe the motion of the follow in the air) began to appear, the old guard of dancers such as Leon James, Leroy Jones, and Shorty Snowden disapproved of the new moves. Younger dancers fresh out of high school (Al Minns, Joe Daniels, Russell Williams, and Pepsi Bethel) worked out the Back Flip, \\"Over the head\\", and \\"the Snatch\\". Frankie Manning was part of a new generation of Lindy Hoppers, and is the most celebrated Lindy Hopper in history. Al Minns and Pepsi Bethel, Leon James, and Norma Miller are also featured prominently in contemporary histories of Lindy Hop. Some sources credit Manning, working with his partner Freida Washington, for inventing the ground-breaking \\"Air Step\\" or \\"aerial\\" in 1935. One source credits Al Minns and Pepsi Bethel as among those who refined the air step. However, early versions of air steps in the Lindy Hop were performed already from the very beginning of the 1930s. An Air Step is a dance move in which at least one of the partners' two feet leave the ground in a dramatic, acrobatic style. Most importantly, it is done in time with the music. Air steps are now widely associated with the characterization of lindy hop, despite being generally reserved for competition or performance dancing, and not generally being executed on any social dance floor. Lindy Hop entered mainstream American culture in the 1930s, gaining popularity through multiple sources. Dance troupes, including the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers (also known as the Harlem Congaroos), Hot Chocolates and Big Apple Dancers exhibited the Lindy Hop. Hollywood films, such as Hellzapoppin' and A Day at the Races began featuring the Lindy Hop in dance sequences. Dance studios such as those of Arthur Murray began teaching Lindy Hop. By the early 1940s the dance was known as \\"New Yorker\\" on the West Coast.\\"Murray in a Hurry Monday\\", Time, October 5, 1942. In 1944, due to continued involvement in World War II, the United States levied a 30 percent federal excise tax against \\"dancing\\" nightclubs. Although the tax was later reduced to 20 percent, \\"No Dancing Allowed\\" signs went up all over the country. =Post-swing era (1950s–1960s)= Arthur Murray's 1954 edition of How to Become a Good Dancer included four pages of instruction for swing, covering the basic Lindy step, the double Lindy Hop, the triple Lindy Hop, the sugar foot walk, and the tuck-in turn.How to Become a Good Dancer; by Arthur Murray. 1954.

Frankie Manning joined the Center in 1985.Frankie Manning , Staff, Sandra Cameron Swing. Al Minns' early students formed the New York Swing Dance Society, established in 1985. In the 1980s, American and European dancers from California, New York, London and Sweden (such as Sylvia Sykes in the United States and Stockholm's Hot Shots) went about \\"reviving\\" Lindy Hop using archival films such as Hellzapoppin' and A Day at the Races and by contacting dancers such as Frankie Manning, Al Minns, and Norma Miller. In the mid-to- late 1990s the popularity of neo swing music of the swing revival stimulated mainstream interest in the dance. The dance was propelled to wide visibility after it was featured in movies such as Swing Kids in 1993 and in the \\"Kakhis Swing\\" television commercials for Gap in 1998.\\"Back in Swing\\". The Washington Post. Richard Harrington. October 26, 1998. Retrieved October 31, 2013. In 1999, Swing! opened up on Broadway, featuring world-class Lindy Hoppers Jenny Thomas and Ryan Francois, Latin swing dancer Maria Torres and her partner Carlos Sierra-Lopez, country swing stars Robert Royston and Laureen Baldovi, and west coast swing couple Beverly Durand and Aldrin Gonzales. Carol Bentley, Scott Fowler, Caitlin Carter, Edger Godineaux, Geralyn Del Corso, and Keith Lamelle Thomas were also featured in various swing-related dance pieces in the Tony-nominated show during its run at the St. James Theatre. The show closed in January 2001, yet continues to be set in regional and international cities around the world. Hollywood-style Lindy Hop Hollywood-style Lindy Hop is sometimes referred to as Dean Collins or Smooth-style, but these terms also sometimes refer to different styles of Lindy Hop. Hollywood is the style reconstructed by Erik Robison and Sylvia Skylar based on movies from 1930s and 1940s featuring dancers like Dean Collins, Jewel McGowan, Jean Veloz and others. They were the first to call it \\"Hollywood Style\\". The swingout (the basic step of Lindy) is danced in a position often described as someone about to sit on a stool, thereby bringing their center point of balance closer to the ground. This piked position is the classic look of Hollywood with the back straight and a slight forward tilt. The Hollywood style is also a slotted dance, meaning the follower travels in a straight line instead of the more elliptical or circular Savoy-style Lindy Hop. A popular variation of Hollywood-Style Lindy Hop called LA-style Lindy Hop has a few technical changes in the footwork and fewer steps. The steps are shortened or \\"cheated\\" to create this look. The style is geared towards performance and is heavily based on short choreographies. Originating in Los Angeles, LA-style is a favorite on the west coast of the United States. It is featured in a bravura number with Martha Raye in the 1941 film of Hellzapoppin. Savoy-style Lindy Hop Savoy-style Lindy Hop was danced at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem in the 1930s and 1940s. This contrasted with Hollywood-style Lindy Hop or 'Smooth- Style Lindy Hop', popularly associated with Dean Collins and his Lindy Hop choreography in Hollywood films. Savoy-style is characterized by a high energy, circular, rotating style, in contrast with the smooth, slotted styling of Hollywood (Smooth). The Savoy Ballroom was the end of the line for an ascending network of clubs, church socials, in New York and beyond. George Snowden, Frankie Manning and George Sullivan were all dismissed by prospective partners for having allegedly inadequate dance skills. With an unusually high preponderance of skilled social dancers there was an infinite variety of interpretations. As Frankie Manning put it, \\"Everyone at the Savoy had their [own] style.\\" And there was no specific \\"Savoy style\\" of Lindy Hopping.See Karen Hubbard and Terry Monaghan, \\"Negotiating Compromise on a Burnished Wood Floor: Social Dancing at the Savoy, \\" in Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader, ed. by Julie Malnig (2009: University of Illinois Press), page 138. , A more modern style of dance called \\"lindy hop\\" also occurs, characterized by slower music, more improvisation, and \\"groove\\" style. This usage evolved in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the late 90s to distinguish it from the \\"Hollywood\\" or \\"LA Style\\" that was becoming popular. The latter styles were typically done to faster music and with less room for improvisation, limited to what could be fit into existing patterns. The coinage was based on the erroneous idea that black dancers on the East Coast danced in a slow, \\"groovy\\" manner with much improvisation not fitting within the typical patterns. This usage seems to be diminishing in usage and the term is often used today to describe faster lindy hop based on moves from Whitey's Lindy Hoppers and other dancers from the Savoy ballroom. However, as most dancers of this style do not possess the years of ingrained African American movement possessed by these early dancers, it is difficult to replicate, and it might be said that most modern dancers more closely resemble Dean Collins and his West Coast contemporaries. =Savoy Ballroom dancers= Savoy style Lindy Hop was most frequently associated with living dancers from the 1930s such as Frankie Manning, and with the Swedish dance troupe The Rhythm Hot Shots (now replaced by the Harlem Hot Shots). The term 'Savoy-style Lindy Hop' applies a generic relationship between all African American Lindy Hoppers (and aficionados of their styles) which ignores the variety and diversity of Lindy Hop in the 1930s and 40s. Lindy Hop historians see clear differences between the Lindy Hop of the early years of its development (the late 1920s) and dancers such as \\"Shorty\\" George Snowden, dancers of the 1930s (such as Manning), and then between individual dancers during these periods. Lennart Westerlund - a key member of The Rhythm Hot Shots and authoritative Lindy Hop historian - described the differences in styles between Manning and Al Minns, the dancer he worked with in the earliest years of the Lindy Hop revival. Al Minns and Leon James are often considered authoritative figures in the academic discussion of Lindy Hop, in part for their work with Marshall Stearns and Jean Stearns (in their book Jazz Dance and documentary films). Lindy Hop historians also draw clear distinctions between the dancing styles of key female dancers such as Norma Miller and Ann Johnson. The most useful point to be made about this variation within a single community of dancers in one historical moment, is that vernacular African American dance, and Lindy Hop in particular, prioritised individual style and creative improvisation and musical interpretation within a particular dance style. =Features= In describing Savoy style Lindy Hop, observers note that the follower is led out of the basic Swingout sideways as a default. This is not the case, however, as leading a follow out backwards or forwards is just as likely. Savoy style is also said to be characterized by a pronounced downwards 'bounce', which is again something of a misnomer, as different dancers employed varying degrees and types of 'bounce', and observers of Frankie Manning have noted changes in his own dancing style in this respect over the years. Despite these comments, it is important to note that the 'bounce' described is characteristic of many African American vernacular dance forms. One of the clearest distinctions between Hollywood and Smooth style Lindy Hop and Savoy style Lindy Hop is the open 'connection' and relative freedom of the follower to improvise within the structure of the Swingout in particular. Again, this technical difference varies between individual dancers, and between teachers today. Historians may also note that Hollywood style, while often characterized by a more intense connection (characterized at its extreme by counter balance), also featured extensive variations and individual improvisation within the swingout in other instances. =African American identity= Perhaps the most useful employment of the term 'Savoy-style Lindy Hop' lies in the association of the Savoy Ballroom (and dancers who were associated with it, particularly those of the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers) and ethnicity. Despite the differences noted above, there are marked tropes in African American and African dances which are present in the Lindy Hop of these dancers in this period. These may include: * clear angles at the ankle - between leg and foot - and often at the wrist and/or elbow * wide-legged stances for both women and men, particularly in the follower's swivel * Frankie Manning's characteristically 'athletic' stance - like a runner spread out in motion, parallel to the ground - echoes African dance * particular 'variations' or jazz steps associated with Savoy-style date back to the African communities from which African American slaves were taken (and are discussed in the History of slavery in the United States article), including the move \\"the itch\\" which then moved on to white communities and across to the west coast of America with dancers like Dean Collins. Current status Lindy Hop dancers at DuPont Circle, Washington, DC, on a Saturday afternoon There are communities throughout the world, and Lindy Hop can today be found in many large westernized cities. The concept of a Lindy exchange, a gathering of Lindy Hop dancers in one city for several days to dance with visitors and locals, enables different communities to share their ideas with others. The first Lindy exchange was called 'The Weekend', and occurred on December 4–6, 1998, in California, between the cities of Chicago, Illinois, and San Francisco, California. The small village of Herräng in Sweden (north of Stockholm) has unofficially become the international mecca of Lindy Hop thanks to the annual Herräng Dance Camp formerly run by the Rhythm Hot Shots then passed on to new owners and operational team, with an attendance from around 40 countries.

In 2018 the company announced Grown by Freight Farms, an on-site farming service for institutions and organizations that would benefit from food grown on-site, but would prefer not to staff their own container farm internally.  Early History  In 2010, while experimenting with rooftop gardening projects in the Boston area, Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara realized that shipping containers, common to Boston's port, would make sturdy and standardized substructures for vertical farms. Furthermore, refrigerated containers feature insulation that would make it possible to maintain internal environmental conditions year- round in any location. International adoption of freight containers for transportation also meant such a vertical farm could shipped anywhere in the world with relative ease. In 2011, the two co-founded Freight Farms and, after a successful crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter, hand-built the first container farm prototype on the Clark University campus in Worcester, MA.  The Leafy Green Machine  In 2013, Freight Farms began to manufacture and sell container farms under the model name Leafy Green Machine or “LGM.” Each Leafy Green Machine was a retrofit 40-ft. refrigerated container, and was divided into two sections: the seedling station, and the main growth area. The seedling station consisted of a multifunction worktable featuring irrigated germination shelves where seedlings sprouted from seeds. The main growth area consisted of 256 vertical crop columns, irrigated with an overhead drip hydroponic system. Each column could detach from the hydroponic circuit and lock into place on the seedling table, meaning all planting, transplanting, and harvesting could be accomplished at waist level without bending down. Both sections were exposed to high-efficiency LED arrays that provide plants with the energy required for photosynthesis, and all excess water was recirculated, filtered, and reclaimed. The average Leafy Green Machine consumed less than five gallons of water and 125 kWh of electricity per day. A skilled farmer could grow up to four tons of food annually in one LGM. Major sales included Google, Ford Foundation, Sodexo, Compass Group, and Square Roots. In February 2019, Freight Farms announced that after five years and eight design iterations, the 2018 Leafy Green Machine would be succeeded by the company's next-generation container farm, the Greenery™. Pre-Owned Leafy Green Machines are traded on iGrow.net.  The Greenery  Freight Farms’ next-generation container farm was conceptualized based on feedback from existing farmers, and organized around three design goals: better yields, improved sustainability, and more IoT-connected automation. Improving on the technology and design of its predecessor, the crop columns and LED array are replaced by plant panels and LED panels respectively, which can slide laterally to accommodate larger crops or in-row farming work. The output of the LED array is also upgraded, meaning plants will grow more quickly, and the seedling table is upgraded to supply the farm with sufficient seedlings.  Farmhand  Farmhand (styled \\"farmhand\\") is a software platform developed in-house by Freight Farms, designed to allow hydroponic growers to control farm components remotely, automate certain tasks, analyze past and current growing data, and manage their business. The software was originally developed for Freight Farms’ customers, but is now compatible with any hydroponic operation that uses a grow controller. Key features include: Automation Programming – Cycle timings for LEDs, nutrient dosing, pH management, and climate control. Sensor Data Management – Realtime readings for air and water temperature, ambient humidity, CO2 levels, and pH. Notifications – Mobile push notifications if any readings fall outside target ranges. Webcam Connectivity – Support for one or more in-farm web cameras. Harvest Tracking – Support for a wireless Harvest Tracking Scale, allowing users to weigh harvests and track performance over time.  Grown by Freight Farms  Grown by Freight Farms (or “Grown”) is an on-site farming service offered by Freight Farms and intended for medium and large institutions like educational campuses, office parks, retail locations, hospitals, and residential buildings. In contrast to an outright container farm purchase, Grown clients subscribe to the service for a period of time. Freight Farms, in turn, installs one or more container farms at the desired location, employs a farmer to manage the day-to-day operation of that farm, and delivers the resulting produce to the subscriber. Delivery comes in two types: “Grown to Share,” a CSA program managed by Freight Farms, or “Grown to Supply,” which is simple produce delivery to a kitchen, prep station, or other destination.

Born at Haywards Heath, Sussex, Higgs was a right-handed batsman. He was known as \\"the Haywards Heath amateur\\" and was a corn merchant by profession (Jenner & Higgs). Career Prior to playing first-class cricket, Higgs served in the British Army during World War I, with a Kenneth Alan Higgs mentioned in the London Gazette on 24 August 1915, as serving with the rank of private in the 16th (County of London) Battalion, with this date coinciding with his promotion to 2nd Lieutenant. Following the war, Higgs resigned his commission in August 1920. It was in that same year that he made his first- class debut for Sussex against Worcestershire in the County Championship at Hove, during which he achieved the feat of making a century on his first-class debut, scoring 101 in Sussex's first-innings, a batting performance which Wisden later described as \\"flawless\\". He made five further first-class appearances in 1920, scoring a total of 345 runs at an average of 38.33, which besides his century also included two fifties. Continuing his good form into the following season, he made nine first-class appearances, scoring 425 runs at an average of 26.56, which included two half centuries, and a second first- class century, scored against Warwickshire at Hove. His century came in a two- hour partnership of 188 for the third wicket with Jack Malden. He made nine first-class appearances for the county in the following season, though met with less success than in his previous two seasons, averaging 17.28 for his 242 runs, with three half centuries and a high score of 62. He played his greatest quantity of first-class matches in 1923, with eleven appearances all made in the County Championship. He equalled the success of his first two seasons in 1923, scoring 474 runs at an average of 27.88, though he failed to record a century, he did however make four half centuries. Higgs played just five first-class matches in 1924, scoring 199 runs with two half centuries. He didn't make any first-class appearances in 1925 or 1926, with his final first- class match coming in 1927, in what was his only appearance in that seasons County Championship against Warwickshire at Cricket Field Road, Horsham. Higgs made a total of 41 first-class appearances for Sussex, scoring 1,693 runs at an average of 25.65, with his score of 111 against Warwickshire being his highest. He also made thirteen half centuries. Although not the oldest man to make a hundred on his first-class debut, he is the oldest (at 33 years and 254 days) to have done so in the English County Championship. Higgs later became the Vice-President of Sussex County Cricket Club. He died at the town of his birth on 21 January 1959.

History The Charleston settlement was established in 1876 when gold was discovered in Seventy-Six Creek, at the southwestern base of Copper Mountain. The camp was originally called Mardis, but was soon named Charleston after a local prospector, Tom Charles. The settlement grew quickly, with the building of a hotel, saloons, schools, stores and an icehouse. By 1884, most mining operations had stopped. A post office was established at Charleston in 1895, and remained in operation until 1951. The camp revived in 1905, when the local mines started producing again. A five-stamp mill was built at the time. Another re-opening of the mines occurred during the period 1932 to 1937. The mines are now abandoned and the two remaining builds from the settlement are on private property.

(2008) Beloit's Club Pop House, Arcadia Publishing, , p. 96 The Beau Gentry spent the next year in Florida developing a following, and in 1966 they were booked for a summer tour of Wisconsin by Ken Adamany (who would later manage Cheap Trick). The tour went so well they decided to stay in the area. After two years of gigging in the midwest, the band evolved into Crowfoot and relocated to San Francisco in December, 1968. With Crowfoot struggling to make ends meet, DaShiell began working as a session guitarist in the S.F. Bay area, playing on A.B. Skhy's 1969 debut album, and going on to play in Harvey Mandel's band with Rick Jaeger. He also played on Norman Greenbaum's Spirit in the Sky album, with Doug Killmer on bass, which included the chart-topping title track. He then toured with Greenbaum and played on his next two albums. His success prompted him to revive Crowfoot, securing a record deal with Paramount Records, although the band's self-titled 1970 album was largely a DaShiell solo effort, as was its 1971 follow-up Find the Sun on ABC Dunhill.\\"Album Reviews: Special Merit Picks\\", Billboard, September 26, 1970, p. 64.

On board were 391 British schoolchildren and 84 adults on a study cruise and 110 crew. The disaster claimed the lives of one pupil, one teacher and two Greek crew members. The ship Jupiter was originally known as Moledet (\\"Fatherland\\") and was a passenger ship registered in the port of Haifa in 1961. The 7,810-tonne vessel was built for Zim (Israel Navigation Company Ltd) and sailed regular voyages around the Mediterranean. In September 1970, Moledet was sold to Epirotiki Line, a Greek shipping company, and renamed Jupiter. Sinking of the Jupiter On 21 October 1988, 391 schoolchildren aged 13–16 and their teachers boarded Jupiter at the Greek port of Piraeus at the start of a week-long educational cruise around the Mediterranean. Just 15 minutes after leaving port, the Jupiter was struck by an Italian freight ship, the Adige, that was entering port. The collision tore a by hole in Jupiters port side. Within 40 minutes (at 6:55p.m.), the ship had sunk vertically and stern first in of water. The lives of two passengers (a pupil and a teacher from the West Midlands) and two Greek crew members were lost. Around 70 people sustained injuries. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the captain of the Italian ship was detained and Greek and Italian authorities each blamed the other party. The subsequent court cases lasted almost eight years. The ship remained where she sank, 1.2 nautical miles from the port entrance at Piraeus. A significant oil leakage occurred in 1999, possibly following disturbance of the seabed by an earthquake, and was removed in a 43-day operation to protect the local marine environment. An Institute of Psychiatry report in 1999 focused on the experiences of the children and formed one of the largest studies of adolescent survivors of disasters when it was published. The impact on the young people was also recorded in a book called Jupiter’s Children, compiled by former schoolteacher and Jupiter survivor Mary Campion and published in 1998. Given the gravity of the incident, it was considered remarkable that all but one schoolchild survived, but in an interview in The Independent, Mary Campion suggested that their behaviour may have been a contributory factor: \\"Schoolchildren are accustomed to obeying orders and those aboard did so without argument. They are used to being in a crowd, being controlled by adults, without questioning at the time, and to moving frequently in a school day in large numbers without pushing, jostling or hurting each other.\\" Writing in the newsletter of the group Disaster Action in 2010, Campion said that although the case had set a number of legal precedents in UK law and had changed safety regulations for passengers on ships, many of the survivors were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder in the aftermath and did not receive the treatment they needed. She added that a Facebook page for Jupiter Survivors established in 2009 had revealed that many people were still adversely affected two decades on.

It was the main programming language supported by Apple for macOS, iOS, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, until the introduction of Swift in 2014. The language was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was later selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which macOS and iOS are derived. Portable Objective-C programs that do not use Apple libraries, or those using parts that may be ported or reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or Clang. Objective-C source code 'implementation' program files usually have filename extensions, while Objective-C 'header/interface' files have extensions, the same as C header files. Objective-C++ files are denoted with a file extension. History Objective-C was created primarily by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company Productivity Products International. Leading up to the creation of their company, both had been introduced to Smalltalk while at ITT Corporation's Programming Technology Center in 1981. The earliest work on Objective-C traces back to around that time. Cox was intrigued by problems of true reusability in software design and programming. He realized that a language like Smalltalk would be invaluable in building development environments for system developers at ITT. However, he and Tom Love also recognized that backward compatibility with C was critically important in ITT's telecom engineering milieu. Cox began writing a pre-processor for C to add some of the abilities of Smalltalk. He soon had a working implementation of an object-oriented extension to the C language, which he called \\"OOPC\\" for Object-Oriented Pre-Compiler. Love was hired by Schlumberger Research in 1982 and had the opportunity to acquire the first commercial copy of Smalltalk-80, which further influenced the development of their brainchild. In order to demonstrate that real progress could be made, Cox showed that making interchangeable software components really needed only a few practical changes to existing tools. Specifically, they needed to support objects in a flexible manner, come supplied with a usable set of libraries, and allow for the code (and any resources needed by the code) to be bundled into one cross-platform format. Love and Cox eventually formed PPI to commercialize their product, which coupled an Objective-C compiler with class libraries. In 1986, Cox published the main description of Objective-C in its original form in the book Object-Oriented Programming, An Evolutionary Approach. Although he was careful to point out that there is more to the problem of reusability than just what Objective-C provides, the language often found itself compared feature for feature with other languages. =Popularization through NeXT= In 1988, NeXT licensed Objective-C from StepStone (the new name of PPI, the owner of the Objective-C trademark) and extended the GCC compiler to support Objective-C. NeXT developed the AppKit and Foundation Kit libraries on which the NeXTSTEP user interface and Interface Builder were based. While the NeXT workstations failed to make a great impact in the marketplace, the tools were widely lauded in the industry. This led NeXT to drop hardware production and focus on software tools, selling NeXTSTEP (and OpenStep) as a platform for custom programming. In order to circumvent the terms of the GPL, NeXT had originally intended to ship the Objective-C frontend separately, allowing the user to link it with GCC to produce the compiler executable. After being initially accepted by Richard M. Stallman, this plan was rejected after Stallman consulted with GNU's lawyers and NeXT agreed to make Objective-C part of GCC. The work to extend GCC was led by Steve Naroff, who joined NeXT from StepStone. The compiler changes were made available as per GPL license terms, but the runtime libraries were not, rendering the open source contribution unusable to the general public. This led to other parties developing such runtime libraries under open source license. Later, Steve Naroff was also principal contributor to work at Apple to build the Objective-C frontend to Clang. The GNU project started work on its free software implementation of Cocoa, named GNUstep, based on the OpenStep standard. Dennis Glatting wrote the first GNU Objective-C runtime in 1992. The GNU Objective-C runtime, which has been in use since 1993, is the one developed by Kresten Krab Thorup when he was a university student in Denmark. Thorup also worked at NeXT from 1993 to 1996. =Apple development and Swift= After acquiring NeXT in 1996, Apple Computer used OpenStep in its then-new operating system, Mac OS X. This included Objective-C, NeXT's Objective-C-based developer tool, Project Builder, and its interface design tool, Interface Builder, both now merged into one application, Xcode. Most of Apple's current Cocoa API is based on OpenStep interface objects and is the most significant Objective-C environment being used for active development. At WWDC 2014, Apple introduced a new language, Swift, which was characterized as \\"Objective-C without the C\\". Syntax Objective-C is a thin layer atop C and is a \\"strict superset\\" of C, meaning that it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler and to freely include C language code within an Objective-C class. Objective-C derives its object syntax from Smalltalk. All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) are identical to those of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging. =Messages= The Objective-C model of object- oriented programming is based on message passing to object instances. In Objective-C one does not call a method; one sends a message. This is unlike the Simula-style programming model used by C++. The difference between these two concepts is in how the code referenced by the method or message name is executed. In a Simula-style language, the method name is in most cases bound to a section of code in the target class by the compiler. In Smalltalk and Objective-C, the target of a message is resolved at runtime, with the receiving object itself interpreting the message. A method is identified by a selector or — a unique identifier for each message name, often just a -terminated string representing its name — and resolved to a C method pointer implementing it: an . A consequence of this is that the message-passing system has no type checking. The object to which the message is directed — the receiver — is not guaranteed to respond to a message, and if it does not, it raises an exception. Sending the message to the object pointed to by the pointer would require the following code in C++: obj->method(argument); In Objective-C, this is written as follows: [obj method:argument]; The \\"method\\" call is translated by the compiler to the family of runtime functions. Different implementations handle modern additions like . In GNU families this function is named , but it has been deprecated in favor of a modern lookup system under . Both styles of programming have their strengths and weaknesses. Object-oriented programming in the Simula (C++) style allows multiple inheritance and faster execution by using compile-time binding whenever possible, but it does not support dynamic binding by default. It also forces all methods to have a corresponding implementation unless they are abstract. The Smalltalk-style programming as used in Objective-C allows messages to go unimplemented, with the method resolved to its implementation at runtime. For example, a message may be sent to a collection of objects, to which only some will be expected to respond, without fear of producing runtime errors. Message passing also does not require that an object be defined at compile time. An implementation is still required for the method to be called in the derived object. (See the dynamic typing section below for more advantages of dynamic (late) binding.) =Interfaces and implementations= Objective-C requires that the interface and implementation of a class be in separately declared code blocks. By convention, developers place the interface in a header file and the implementation in a code file. The header files, normally suffixed .h, are similar to C header files while the implementation (method) files, normally suffixed .m, can be very similar to C code files. Interface This is analogous to class declarations as used in other object-oriented languages, such as C++ or Python. The interface of a class is usually defined in a header file. A common convention is to name the header file after the name of the class, e.g. would contain the interface for the class . An interface declaration takes the form: @interface classname : superclassname { // instance variables } \\\\+ classMethod1; \\\\+ (return_type)classMethod2; \\\\+ (return_type)classMethod3:(param1_type)param1_varName; \\\\- (return_type)instanceMethod1With1Parameter:(param1_type)param1_varName; \\\\- (return_type)instanceMethod2With2Parameters:(param1_type)param1_varName param2_callName:(param2_type)param2_varName; @end In the above, plus signs denote class methods, or methods that can be called on the class itself (not on an instance), and minus signs denote instance methods, which can only be called on a particular instance of the class. Class methods also have no access to instance variables. The code above is roughly equivalent to the following C++ interface: class classname : public superclassname { protected: // instance variables public: // Class (static) functions static void *classMethod1(); static return_type classMethod2(); static return_type classMethod3(param1_type param1_varName); // Instance (member) functions return_type instanceMethod1With1Parameter(param1_type param1_varName); return_type instanceMethod2With2Parameters(param1_type param1_varName, param2_type param2_varName = default); }; Note that demonstrates the interleaving of selector segments with argument expressions, for which there is no direct equivalent in C/C++. Return types can be any standard C type, a pointer to a generic Objective-C object, a pointer to a specific type of object such as NSArray *, NSImage *, or NSString *, or a pointer to the class to which the method belongs (instancetype). The default return type is the generic Objective-C type . Method arguments begin with a name labeling the argument that is part of the method name, followed by a colon followed by the expected argument type in parentheses and the argument name. The label can be omitted. \\\\- (void)setRangeStart:(int)start end:(int)end; \\\\- (void)importDocumentWithName:(NSString *)name withSpecifiedPreferences:(Preferences *)prefs beforePage:(int)insertPage; A derivative of the interface definition is the category, which allows one to add methods to existing classes. Implementation The interface only declares the class interface and not the methods themselves: the actual code is written in the implementation file. Implementation (method) files normally have the file extension \`.m\`, which originally signified \\"messages\\". @implementation classname \\\\+ (return_type)classMethod { // implementation } \\\\- (return_type)instanceMethod { // implementation } @end Methods are written using their interface declarations. Comparing Objective-C and C: \\\\- (int)method:(int)i { return [self square_root:i]; } int function(int i) { return square_root(i); } The syntax allows pseudo-naming of arguments. \\\\- (void)changeColorToRed:(float)red green:(float)green blue:(float)blue { //... Implementation ... } // Called like so: [myColor changeColorToRed:5.0 green:2.0 blue:6.0]; Internal representations of a method vary between different implementations of Objective-C. If myColor is of the class , instance method might be internally labeled . The is to refer to an instance method, with the class and then method names appended and colons changed to underscores. As the order of parameters is part of the method name, it cannot be changed to suit coding style or expression as with true named parameters. However, internal names of the function are rarely used directly. Generally, messages are converted to function calls defined in the Objective-C runtime library. It is not necessarily known at link time which method will be called because the class of the receiver (the object being sent the message) need not be known until runtime. Instantiation Once an Objective-C class is written, it can be instantiated. This is done by first allocating an uninitialized instance of the class (an object) and then by initializing it. An object is not fully functional until both steps have been completed. These steps should be accomplished with one line of code so that there is never an allocated object that hasn't undergone initialization (and because it is unwise to keep the intermediate result since \`-init\` can return a different object than that on which it is called). Instantiation with the default, no- parameter initializer: MyObject *foo = MyObject alloc] init]; Instantiation with a custom initializer: MyObject *foo = MyObject alloc] initWithString:myString]; In the case where no custom initialization is being performed, the \\"new\\" method can often be used in place of the alloc-init messages: MyObject *foo = [MyObject new]; Also, some classes implement class method initializers. Like \`+new\`, they combine \`+alloc\` and \`-init\`, but unlike \`+new\`, they return an autoreleased instance. Some class method initializers take parameters: MyObject *foo = [MyObject object]; MyObject *bar = [MyObject objectWithString:@\\"Wikipedia :)\\"]; The alloc message allocates enough memory to hold all the instance variables for an object, sets all the instance variables to zero values, and turns the memory into an instance of the class; at no point during the initialization is the memory an instance of the superclass. The init message performs the set-up of the instance upon creation. The init method is often written as follows: \\\\- (id)init { self = [super init]; if (self) { // perform initialization of object here } return self; } In the above example, notice the \`id\` return type. This type stands for \\"pointer to any object\\" in Objective-C (See the Dynamic typing section). The initializer pattern is used to assure that the object is properly initialized by its superclass before the init method performs its initialization. It performs the following actions: # self = [super init] #: Sends the superclass instance an init message and assigns the result to self (pointer to the current object). # if (self) #: Checks if the returned object pointer is valid before performing any initialization. # return self #: Returns the value of self to the caller. A non-valid object pointer has the value nil; conditional statements like \\"if\\" treat nil like a null pointer, so the initialization code will not be executed if [super init] returned nil. If there is an error in initialization the init method should perform any necessary cleanup, including sending a \\"release\\" message to self, and return nil to indicate that initialization failed. Any checking for such errors must only be performed after having called the superclass initialization to ensure that destroying the object will be done correctly. If a class has more than one initialization method, only one of them (the \\"designated initializer\\") needs to follow this pattern; others should call the designated initializer instead of the superclass initializer. =Protocols= In other programming languages, these are called \\"interfaces\\". Objective-C was extended at NeXT to introduce the concept of multiple inheritance of specification, but not implementation, through the introduction of protocols. This is a pattern achievable either as an abstract multiple inherited base class in C++, or as an \\"interface\\" (as in Java and C#). Objective-C makes use of ad hoc protocols called informal protocols and compiler-enforced protocols called formal protocols. An informal protocol is a list of methods that a class can opt to implement. It is specified in the documentation, since it has no presence in the language. Informal protocols are implemented as a category (see below) on NSObject and often include optional methods, which, if implemented, can change the behavior of a class. For example, a text field class might have a delegate that implements an informal protocol with an optional method for performing auto-completion of user-typed text. The text field discovers whether the delegate implements that method (via reflection) and, if so, calls the delegate's method to support the auto-complete feature. A formal protocol is similar to an interface in Java, C#, and Ada 2005. It is a list of methods that any class can declare itself to implement. Versions of Objective-C before 2.0 required that a class must implement all methods in a protocol it declares itself as adopting; the compiler will emit an error if the class does not implement every method from its declared protocols. Objective-C 2.0 added support for marking certain methods in a protocol optional, and the compiler will not enforce implementation of optional methods. A class must be declared to implement that protocol to be said to conform to it. This is detectable at runtime. Formal protocols cannot provide any implementations; they simply assure callers that classes that conform to the protocol will provide implementations. In the NeXT/Apple library, protocols are frequently used by the Distributed Objects system to represent the abilities of an object executing on a remote system. The syntax @protocol NSLocking \\\\- (void)lock; \\\\- (void)unlock; @end denotes that there is the abstract idea of locking. By stating in the class definition that the protocol is implemented, @interface NSLock : NSObject // ... @end instances of NSLock claim that they will provide an implementation for the two instance methods. =Dynamic typing= Objective-C, like Smalltalk, can use dynamic typing: an object can be sent a message that is not specified in its interface. This can allow for increased flexibility, as it allows an object to \\"capture\\" a message and send the message to a different object that can respond to the message appropriately, or likewise send the message on to another object. This behavior is known as message forwarding or delegation (see below). Alternatively, an error handler can be used in case the message cannot be forwarded. If an object does not forward a message, respond to it, or handle an error, then the system will generate a runtime exception. If messages are sent to nil (the null object pointer), they will be silently ignored or raise a generic exception, depending on compiler options. Static typing information may also optionally be added to variables. This information is then checked at compile time. In the following four statements, increasingly specific type information is provided. The statements are equivalent at runtime, but the extra information allows the compiler to warn the programmer if the passed argument does not match the type specified. \\\\- (void)setMyValue:(id)foo; In the above statement, foo may be of any class. \\\\- (void)setMyValue:(id)foo; In the above statement, foo may be an instance of any class that conforms to the \`NSCopying\` protocol. \\\\- (void)setMyValue:(NSNumber *)foo; In the above statement, foo must be an instance of the NSNumber class. \\\\- (void)setMyValue:(NSNumber *)foo; In the above statement, foo must be an instance of the NSNumber class, and it must conform to the \`NSCopying\` protocol. In Objective-C, all objects are represented as pointers, and static initialization is not allowed. The simplest object is the type that () points to, which only has an isa pointer describing its class. Other types from C, like values and structs, are unchanged because they are not part of the object system. This decision differs from the C++ object model, where structs and classes are united. =Forwarding= Objective-C permits the sending of a message to an object that may not respond. Rather than responding or simply dropping the message, an object can forward the message to an object that can respond. Forwarding can be used to simplify implementation of certain design patterns, such as the observer pattern or the proxy pattern. The Objective-C runtime specifies a pair of methods in * forwarding methods: \\\\- (retval_t)forward:(SEL)sel args:(arglist_t)args; // with GCC \\\\- (id)forward:(SEL)sel args:(marg_list)args; // with NeXT/Apple systems * action methods: \\\\- (retval_t)performv:(SEL)sel args:(arglist_t)args; // with GCC \\\\- (id)performv:(SEL)sel args:(marg_list)args; // with NeXT/Apple systems An object wishing to implement forwarding needs only to override the forwarding method with a new method to define the forwarding behavior. The action method need not be overridden, as this method merely performs an action based on the selector and arguments. Notice the \`SEL\` type, which is the type of messages in Objective-C. Note: in OpenStep, Cocoa, and GNUstep, the commonly used frameworks of Objective-C, one does not use the class. The method of the class is used to do forwarding. Example Here is an example of a program that demonstrates the basics of forwarding. ; Forwarder.h #import @interface Forwarder : Object { id recipient; // The object we want to forward the message to. } // Accessor methods. \\\\- (id)recipient; \\\\- (id)setRecipient:(id)_recipient; @end ; Forwarder.m #import \\"Forwarder.h\\" @implementation Forwarder \\\\- (retval_t)forward:(SEL)sel args:(arglist_t)args { /* * Check whether the recipient actually responds to the message. * This may or may not be desirable, for example, if a recipient * in turn does not respond to the message, it might do forwarding * itself. */ if ([recipient respondsToSelector:sel]) { return [recipient performv:sel args:args]; } else { return [self error:\\"Recipient does not respond\\"]; } } \\\\- (id)setRecipient:(id)_recipient { [recipient autorelease]; recipient = [_recipient retain]; return self; } \\\\- (id)recipient { return recipient; } @end ; Recipient.h #import // A simple Recipient object. @interface Recipient : Object \\\\- (id)hello; @end ; Recipient.m #import \\"Recipient.h\\" @implementation Recipient \\\\- (id)hello { printf(\\"Recipient says hello! \\"); return self; } @end ; main.m #import \\"Forwarder.h\\" #import \\"Recipient.h\\" int main(void) { Forwarder *forwarder = [Forwarder new]; Recipient *recipient = [Recipient new]; [forwarder setRecipient:recipient]; // Set the recipient. /* * Observe forwarder does not respond to a hello message! It will * be forwarded. All unrecognized methods will be forwarded to * the recipient * (if the recipient responds to them, as written in the Forwarder) */ [forwarder hello]; [recipient release]; [forwarder release]; return 0; } Notes When compiled using gcc, the compiler reports: $ gcc -x objective-c -Wno- import Forwarder.m Recipient.m main.m -lobjc main.m: In function \`main': main.m:12: warning: \`Forwarder' does not respond to \`hello' $ The compiler is reporting the point made earlier, that does not respond to hello messages. In this circumstance, it is safe to ignore the warning since forwarding was implemented. Running the program produces this output: $ ./a.out Recipient says hello! =Categories= During the design of Objective-C, one of the main concerns was the maintainability of large code bases. Experience from the structured programming world had shown that one of the main ways to improve code was to break it down into smaller pieces. Objective-C borrowed and extended the concept of categories from Smalltalk implementations to help with this process. Furthermore, the methods within a category are added to a class at run-time. Thus, categories permit the programmer to add methods to an existing class - an open class - without the need to recompile that class or even have access to its source code. For example, if a system does not contain a spell checker in its String implementation, it could be added without modifying the String source code. Methods within categories become indistinguishable from the methods in a class when the program is run. A category has full access to all of the instance variables within the class, including private variables. If a category declares a method with the same method signature as an existing method in a class, the category's method is adopted. Thus categories can not only add methods to a class, but also replace existing methods. This feature can be used to fix bugs in other classes by rewriting their methods, or to cause a global change to a class's behavior within a program. If two categories have methods with the same name but different method signatures, it is undefined which category's method is adopted. Other languages have attempted to add this feature in a variety of ways. TOM took the Objective-C system a step further and allowed for the addition of variables also. Other languages have used prototype-based solutions instead, the most notable being Self. The C# and Visual Basic.NET languages implement superficially similar functionality in the form of extension methods, but these lack access to the private variables of the class. Ruby and several other dynamic programming languages refer to the technique as \\"monkey patching\\". Logtalk implements a concept of categories (as first-class entities) that subsumes Objective-C categories functionality (Logtalk categories can also be used as fine-grained units of composition when defining e.g. new classes or prototypes; in particular, a Logtalk category can be virtually imported by any number of classes and prototypes). Example use of categories This example builds up an class, by defining first a basic class with only accessor methods implemented, and adding two categories, and , which extend the basic class. While categories can access the base class's private data members, it is often good practice to access these private data members through the accessor methods, which helps keep categories more independent from the base class. Implementing such accessors is one typical use of categories. Another is to use categories to add methods to the base class. However, it is not regarded as good practice to use categories for subclass overriding, also known as monkey patching. Informal protocols are implemented as a category on the base class. By convention, files containing categories that extend base classes will take the name _BaseClass+ExtensionClass.h_. ; Integer.h #import @interface Integer : Object { int integer; } \\\\- (int)integer; \\\\- (id)integer:(int)_integer; @end ; Integer.m #import \\"Integer.h\\" @implementation Integer \\\\- (int) integer { return integer; } \\\\- (id) integer: (int) _integer { integer = _integer; return self; } @end ; Integer+Arithmetic.h #import \\"Integer.h\\" @interface Integer (Arithmetic) \\\\- (id) add: (Integer *) addend; \\\\- (id) sub: (Integer *) subtrahend; @end ; Integer+Arithmetic.m # import \\"Integer+Arithmetic.h\\" @implementation Integer (Arithmetic) \\\\- (id) add: (Integer *) addend { return [self integer: [self integer] + [addend integer ; } \\\\- (id) sub: (Integer *) subtrahend { return [self integer: [self integer] - [subtrahend integer ; } @end ; Integer+Display.h #import \\"Integer.h\\" @interface Integer (Display) \\\\- (id) showstars; \\\\- (id) showint; @end ; Integer+Display.m # import \\"Integer+Display.h\\" @implementation Integer (Display) \\\\- (id) showstars { int i, x = [self integer]; for (i = 0; i < x; i++) { printf(\\"*\\"); } printf(\\" \\"); return self; } \\\\- (id) showint { printf(\\"%d \\", [self integer]); return self; } @end ; main.m #import \\"Integer.h\\" #import \\"Integer+Arithmetic.h\\" #import \\"Integer+Display.h\\" int main(void) { Integer *num1 = [Integer new], *num2 = [Integer new]; int x; printf(\\"Enter an integer: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &x;); [num1 integer:x]; [num1 showstars]; printf(\\"Enter an integer: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &x;); [num2 integer:x]; [num2 showstars]; [num1 add:num2]; [num1 showint]; return 0; } Notes Compilation is performed, for example, by: gcc -x objective-c main.m Integer.m Integer+Arithmetic.m Integer+Display.m -lobjc One can experiment by leaving out the and lines and omitting in compilation. The program will still run. This means that it is possible to mix-and-match added categories if needed; if a category does not need to have some ability, it can simply not be compile in. =Posing= Objective-C permits a class to wholly replace another class within a program. The replacing class is said to \\"pose as\\" the target class. Class posing was declared deprecated with Mac OS X v10.5, and is unavailable in the 64-bit runtime. Similar functionality can be achieved by using method swizzling in categories, that swaps one method's implementation with another's that have the same signature. For the versions still supporting posing, all messages sent to the target class are instead received by the posing class. There are several restrictions: * A class may only pose as one of its direct or indirect superclasses. * The posing class must not define any new instance variables that are absent from the target class (though it may define or override methods). * The target class may not have received any messages prior to the posing. Posing, similarly with categories, allows global augmentation of existing classes. Posing permits two features absent from categories: * A posing class can call overridden methods through super, thus incorporating the implementation of the target class. * A posing class can override methods defined in categories. For example, @interface CustomNSApplication : NSApplication @end @implementation CustomNSApplication \\\\- (void) setMainMenu: (NSMenu*) menu { // do something with menu } @end class_poseAs ([CustomNSApplication class], [NSApplication class]); This intercepts every invocation of setMainMenu to NSApplication. =#import= In the C language, the \`#include\` pre-compile directive always causes a file's contents to be inserted into the source at that point. Objective-C has the \`#import\` directive, equivalent except that each file is included only once per compilation unit, obviating the need for include guards. =Linux gcc Compilation= // FILE: hello.m #import int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) { /* my first program in Objective-C */ NSLog(@\\"Hello, World! \\"); return 0; } # Compile Command Line for gcc and MinGW Compiler: $ gcc \\\\ $(gnustep-config --objc-flags) \\\\ -o hello \\\\ hello.m \\\\ -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries \\\\ -lobjc \\\\ -lgnustep-base $ ./hello Other features Objective-C's features often allow for flexible, and often easy, solutions to programming issues. * Delegating methods to other objects and remote invocation can be easily implemented using categories and message forwarding. * Swizzling of the isa pointer allows for classes to change at runtime. Typically used for debugging where freed objects are swizzled into zombie objects whose only purpose is to report an error when someone calls them. Swizzling was also used in Enterprise Objects Framework to create database faults. Swizzling is used today by Apple's Foundation Framework to implement Key-Value Observing. Language variants =Objective-C++= Objective-C++ is a language variant accepted by the front-end to the GNU Compiler Collection and Clang, which can compile source files that use a combination of C++ and Objective-C syntax. Objective-C++ adds to C++ the extensions that Objective-C adds to C. As nothing is done to unify the semantics behind the various language features, certain restrictions apply: * A C++ class cannot derive from an Objective-C class and vice versa. * C++ namespaces cannot be declared inside an Objective-C declaration. * Objective-C declarations may appear only in global scope, not inside a C++ namespace * Objective-C classes cannot have instance variables of C++ classes that lack a default constructor or that have one or more virtual methods, but pointers to C++ objects can be used as instance variables without restriction (allocate them with new in the -init method). * C++ \\"by value\\" semantics cannot be applied to Objective-C objects, which are only accessible through pointers. * An Objective-C declaration cannot be within a C++ template declaration and vice versa. However, Objective-C types (e.g., ) can be used as C++ template parameters. * Objective-C and C++ exception handling is distinct; the handlers of each cannot handle exceptions of the other type. As a result, object destructors are not run. This is mitigated in recent \\"Objective-C 2.0\\" runtimes as Objective-C exceptions are either replaced by C++ exceptions completely (Apple runtime), or partly when Objective-C++ library is linked (GNUstep libobjc2). * Objective-C blocks and C++11 lambdas are distinct entities. However, a block is transparently generated on macOS when passing a lambda where a block is expected. =Objective-C 2.0= At the 2006 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced the release of \\"Objective-C 2.0,\\" a revision of the Objective-C language to include \\"modern garbage collection, syntax enhancements, runtime performance improvements, and 64-bit support\\". Mac OS X v10.5, released in October 2007, included an Objective-C 2.0 compiler. GCC 4.6 supports many new Objective-C features, such as declared and synthesized properties, dot syntax, fast enumeration, optional protocol methods, method/protocol/class attributes, class extensions, and a new GNU Objective-C runtime API. The naming Objective-C 2.0 represents a break in the versioning system of the language, as the last Objective-C version for NeXT was \\"objc4\\". This project name was kept in the last release of legacy Objective-C runtime source code in Mac OS X Leopard (10.5). Garbage collection Objective-C 2.0 provided an optional conservative, generational garbage collector. When run in backwards-compatible mode, the runtime turned reference counting operations such as \\"retain\\" and \\"release\\" into no-ops. All objects were subject to garbage collection when garbage collection was enabled. Regular C pointers could be qualified with \\"__strong\\" to also trigger the underlying write-barrier compiler intercepts and thus participate in garbage collection.Garbage Collection Programming Guide: Garbage Collection API (Apple developer website - search for \\"__strong\\") A zero-ing weak subsystem was also provided such that pointers marked as \\"__weak\\" are set to zero when the object (or more simply, GC memory) is collected. The garbage collector does not exist on the iOS implementation of Objective-C 2.0. Garbage collection in Objective-C runs on a low-priority background thread, and can halt on user events, with the intention of keeping the user experience responsive. Garbage collection was deprecated in Mac OS X v10.8 in favor of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Objective-C on iOS 7 running on ARM64 uses 19 bits out of a 64-bit word to store the reference count, as a form of tagged pointers. Properties Objective-C 2.0 introduces a new syntax to declare instance variables as properties, with optional attributes to configure the generation of accessor methods. Properties are, in a sense, public instance variables; that is, declaring an instance variable as a property provides external classes with access (possibly limited, e.g. read only) to that property. A property may be declared as \\"readonly\\", and may be provided with storage semantics such as \`assign\`, \`copy\` or \`retain\`. By default, properties are considered \`atomic\`, which results in a lock preventing multiple threads from accessing them at the same time. A property can be declared as \`nonatomic\`, which removes this lock. @interface Person : NSObject { @public NSString *name; @private int age; } @property(copy) NSString *name; @property(readonly) int age; \\\\- (id)initWithAge:(int)age; @end Properties are implemented by way of the \`@synthesize\` keyword, which generates getter (and setter, if not read-only) methods according to the property declaration. Alternatively, the getter and setter methods must be implemented explicitly, or the \`@dynamic\` keyword can be used to indicate that accessor methods will be provided by other means. When compiled using clang 3.1 or higher, all properties which are not explicitly declared with \`@dynamic\`, marked \`readonly\` or have complete user-implemented getter and setter will be automatically implicitly \`@synthesize\`'d. @implementation Person @synthesize name; \\\\- (id)initWithAge:(int)initAge { self = [super init]; if (self) { // NOTE: direct instance variable assignment, not property setter age = initAge; } return self; } \\\\- (int)age { return age; } @end Properties can be accessed using the traditional message passing syntax, dot notation, or, in Key-Value Coding, by name via the \\"valueForKey:\\"/\\"setValue:forKey:\\" methods. Person *aPerson = Person alloc] initWithAge:53]; aPerson.name = @\\"Steve\\"; // NOTE: dot notation, uses synthesized setter, // equivalent to [aPerson setName: @\\"Steve\\"]; NSLog(@\\"Access by message (%@), dot notation(%@), property name(% @) and direct instance variable access(% @) \\", [aPerson name], aPerson.name, [aPerson valueForKey:@\\"name\\"], aPerson -> name); In order to use dot notation to invoke property accessors within an instance method, the \\"self\\" keyword should be used: \\\\- (void)introduceMyselfWithProperties:(BOOL)useGetter { NSLog(@\\"Hi, my name is %@.\\", (useGetter ? self.name : name)); // NOTE: getter vs. ivar access } A class or protocol's properties may be dynamically introspected. int i; int propertyCount = 0; objc_property_t *propertyList = class_copyPropertyList([aPerson class], &propertyCount;); for (i = 0; i < propertyCount; i++) { objc_property_t *thisProperty = propertyList + i; const char *propertyName = property_getName(*thisProperty); NSLog(@\\"Person has a property: '%s'\\", propertyName); } Non-fragile instance variables Objective-C 2.0 provides non-fragile instance variables where supported by the runtime (i.e. when building code for 64-bit macOS, and all iOS). Under the modern runtime, an extra layer of indirection is added to instance variable access, allowing the dynamic linker to adjust instance layout at runtime. This feature allows for two important improvements to Objective-C code: * It eliminates the fragile binary interface problem; superclasses can change sizes without affecting binary compatibility. * It allows instance variables that provide the backing for properties to be synthesized at runtime without them being declared in the class's interface. Fast enumeration Instead of using an NSEnumerator object or indices to iterate through a collection, Objective-C 2.0 offers the fast enumeration syntax. In Objective-C 2.0, the following loops are functionally equivalent, but have different performance traits. // Using NSEnumerator NSEnumerator *enumerator = [thePeople objectEnumerator]; Person *p; while ((p = [enumerator nextObject]) != nil) { NSLog(@\\"%@ is %i years old.\\", [p name], [p age]); } // Using indexes for (int i = 0; i < [thePeople count]; i++) { Person *p = [thePeople objectAtIndex:i]; NSLog(@\\"%@ is %i years old.\\", [p name], [p age]); } // Using fast enumeration for (Person *p in thePeople) { NSLog(@\\"%@ is %i years old.\\", [p name], [p age]); } Fast enumeration generates more efficient code than standard enumeration because method calls to enumerate over objects are replaced by pointer arithmetic using the NSFastEnumeration protocol. Class extensions A class extension has the same syntax as a category declaration with no category name, and the methods and properties declared in it are added directly to the main class. It is mostly used as an alternative to a category to add methods to a class without advertising them in the public headers, with the advantage that for class extensions the compiler checks that all the privately declared methods are actually implemented. Implications for Cocoa development All Objective-C applications developed for macOS that make use of the above improvements for Objective-C 2.0 are incompatible with all operating systems prior to 10.5 (Leopard). Since fast enumeration does not generate exactly the same binaries as standard enumeration, its use will cause an application to crash on Mac OS X version 10.4 or earlier. =Blocks= Blocks is a nonstandard extension for Objective-C (and C and C++) that uses special syntax to create closures. Blocks are only supported in Mac OS X 10.6 \\"Snow Leopard\\" or later, iOS 4 or later, and GNUstep with libobjc2 1.7 and compiling with clang 3.1 or later. #include #include typedef int (^IntBlock)(); IntBlock MakeCounter(int start, int increment) { __block int i = start; return Block_copy( ^ { int ret = i; i += increment; return ret; }); } int main(void) { IntBlock mycounter = MakeCounter(5, 2); printf(\\"First call: %d \\", mycounter()); printf(\\"Second call: %d \\", mycounter()); printf(\\"Third call: %d \\", mycounter()); /* because it was copied, it must also be released */ Block_release(mycounter); return 0; } /* Output: First call: 5 Second call: 7 Third call: 9 */ =Modern Objective-C= Apple has added some additional features to Objective 2.0 over time. The additions only apply to the \\"Apple LLVM compiler\\", i.e. clang frontend of the language. Confusingly, the versioning used by Apple differs from that of the LLVM upstream; refer to for a translation to open-source LLVM version numbers. Automatic Reference Counting Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is a compile-time feature that eliminates the need for programmers to manually manage retain counts using \`retain\` and \`release\`. Unlike garbage collection, which occurs at run time, ARC eliminates the overhead of a separate process managing retain counts. ARC and manual memory management are not mutually exclusive; programmers can continue to use non-ARC code in ARC-enabled projects by disabling ARC for individual code files. Xcode can also attempt to automatically upgrade a project to ARC. ARC was introduced in LLVM 3.0. This translates to XCode 4.2 (2011), or Apple LLVM compiler 3.0. Literals NeXT and Apple Obj-C runtimes have long included a short-form way to create new strings, using the literal syntax \`@\\"a new string\\"\`, or drop to CoreFoundation constants \`kCFBooleanTrue\` and \`kCFBooleanFalse\` for \`NSNumber\` with Boolean values. Using this format saves the programmer from having to use the longer \`initWithString\` or similar methods when doing certain operations. When using Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 (XCode 4.4) or later, arrays, dictionaries, and numbers (\`NSArray\`, \`NSDictionary\`, \`NSNumber\` classes) can also be created using literal syntax instead of methods. (Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 translates to open source LLVM and Clang 3.1.) Example without literals: NSArray *myArray = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:object1,object2,object3,nil]; NSDictionary *myDictionary1 = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:someObject forKey:@\\"key\\"]; NSDictionary *myDictionary2 = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:object1, key1, object2, key2, nil]; NSNumber *myNumber = [NSNumber numberWithInt:myInt]; NSNumber *mySumNumber= [NSNumber numberWithInt:(2 + 3)]; NSNumber *myBoolNumber = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]; Example with literals: NSArray *myArray = @[ object1, object2, object3 ]; NSDictionary *myDictionary1 = @{ @\\"key\\" : someObject }; NSDictionary *myDictionary2 = @{ key1: object1, key2: object2 }; NSNumber *myNumber = @(myInt); NSNumber *mySumNumber = @(2+3); NSNumber *myBoolNumber = @YES; NSNumber *myIntegerNumber = @8; However, different from string literals, which compile to constants in the executable, these literals compile to code equivalent to the above method calls. In particular, under manually reference-counted memory management, these objects are autoreleased, which requires added care when e.g., used with function-static variables or other kinds of globals. Subscripting When using Apple LLVM compiler 4.0 or later, arrays and dictionaries (\`NSArray\` and \`NSDictionary\` classes) can be manipulated using subscripting. Subscripting can be used to retrieve values from indexes (array) or keys (dictionary), and with mutable objects, can also be used to set objects to indexes or keys. In code, subscripting is represented using brackets \`[ ]\`. Example without subscripting: id object1 = [someArray objectAtIndex:0]; id object2 = [someDictionary objectForKey:@\\"key\\"]; [someMutableArray replaceObjectAtIndex:0 withObject:object3]; [someMutableDictionary setObject:object4 forKey:@\\"key\\"]; Example with subscripting: id object1 = someArray[0]; id object2 = someDictionary[@\\"key\\"]; someMutableArray[0] = object3; someMutableDictionary[@\\"key\\"] = object4; =\\"Modern\\" Objective-C syntax (1997)= After the purchase of NeXT by Apple, attempts were made to make the language more acceptable to programmers more familiar with Java than Smalltalk. One of these attempts was introducing what was dubbed \\"Modern Syntax\\" for Objective-C at the time (as opposed to the current, \\"classic\\" syntax). There was no change in behaviour, this was merely an alternative syntax. Instead of writing a method invocation like object = MyClass alloc] init]; [object firstLabel: param1 secondLabel: param2]; It was instead written as object = (MyClass.alloc).init; object.labels ( param1, param2 ); Similarly, declarations went from the form -(void) firstLabel: (int)param1 secondLabel: (int)param2; to -(void) labels ( int param1, int param2 ); This \\"modern\\" syntax is no longer supported in current dialects of the Objective-C language. =mulle-objc= The mulle-objc project is another re- implementation of Objective-C. It supports GCC or Clang/LLVM compilers as backends. It diverges from other runtimes in terms of syntax, semantics and ABI compatibility. It supports Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. =Portable Object Compiler= Besides the GCC/NeXT/Apple implementation, which added several extensions to the original Stepstone implementation, another free, open-source Objective-C implementation called the Portable Object Compiler also exists. The set of extensions implemented by the Portable Object Compiler differs from the GCC/NeXT/Apple implementation; in particular, it includes Smalltalk-like blocks for Objective-C, while it lacks protocols and categories, two features used extensively in OpenStep and its derivatives and relatives. Overall, POC represents an older, pre-NeXT stage in the language's evolution, roughly conformant to Brad Cox's 1991 book. It also includes a runtime library called ObjectPak, which is based on Cox's original ICPak101 library (which in turn derives from the Smalltalk-80 class library), and is quite radically different from the OpenStep FoundationKit. =GEOS Objective-C= The PC GEOS system used a programming language known as GEOS Objective-C or goc; despite the name similarity, the two languages are similar only in overall concept and the use of keywords prefixed with an @ sign. =Clang= The Clang compiler suite, part of the LLVM project, implements Objective-C and other languages. After GCC 4.3 (2008) switched to GPLv3, Apple abandoned it in favor of clang, a compiler it has more legal power to modify. As a result, many of the modern Objective-C language features are supported only by Clang. Apple's versioning scheme for its clang-based \\"LLVM compiler\\" differs from the LLVM's open-source versioning. See for a translation =GNU, GNUstep, and WinObjC= The GNU project has, for a long time, been interested in a platform to port NeXT and Obj-C programs to. The ChangeLog for the directory in GCC suggests that it existed before 1998 (GCC 2.95), and its README further points at a rewrite in 1993 (GCC 2.4). The NeXT frontend source code was released since it was made as part of GCC, released GNU Public License which forces ones making derivative works to do so. Apple continued this tradition in releasing its fork of GCC up to 4.2.1, after which they abandoned the compiler. GCC maintainers took in the changes, but did not invest much in supporting newer features such as the Objective-C 2.0 language. The GNUstep developers, interested in the new language, forked the GCC to a project independent of GCC called in 2009. They also arranged for the runtime to be used with Clang to take advantage of the new language syntax. GCC moved slowly at the same time, but at GCC 4.6.0 (2011) they have moved on to Objective-C 2.0 in their libobjc as well. GNUstep documentation suggest that the GCC implementation still lacks support for blocks, non-fragile variables, and the newer ARC. Microsoft forked into a part of WinObjC, the iOS bridge for Universal Windows Platform, in 2015. Combined with its own implementation of Cocoa Touch and underlying APIs, the project allows the reuse of iOS Application code inside of UWP apps. On Windows, Objective-C Development tools are provided for download on GNUStep's website. The GNUStep Development System consists of the following packages: GNUstep MSYS System, GNUstep Core, GNUstep Devel, GNUstep Cairo, ProjectCenter IDE (Like Xcode, but not as complex), Gorm (Interface Builder Like Xcode NIB builder). These binary installers have not been updated since 2016, so it could be a better idea to just install by building under Cygwin or MSYS2 instead. Library use Objective-C today is often used in tandem with a fixed library of standard objects (often known as a \\"kit\\" or \\"framework\\"), such as Cocoa, GNUstep or ObjFW. These libraries often come with the operating system: the GNUstep libraries often come with Linux-based distributions and Cocoa comes with macOS. The programmer is not forced to inherit functionality from the existing base class (NSObject / OFObject). Objective-C allows for the declaration of new root classes that do not inherit any existing functionality. Originally, Objective-C-based programming environments typically offered an Object class as the base class from which almost all other classes inherited. With the introduction of OpenStep, NeXT created a new base class named NSObject, which offered additional features over Object (an emphasis on using object references and reference counting instead of raw pointers, for example). Almost all classes in Cocoa inherit from NSObject. Not only did the renaming serve to differentiate the new default behavior of classes within the OpenStep API, but it allowed code that used Object—the original base class used on NeXTSTEP (and, more or less, other Objective-C class libraries)—to co-exist in the same runtime with code that used NSObject (with some limitations). The introduction of the two letter prefix also became a simplistic form of namespaces, which Objective-C lacks. Using a prefix to create an informal packaging identifier became an informal coding standard in the Objective-C community, and continues to this day. More recently, package managers have started appearing, such as CocoaPods, which aims to be both a package manager and a repository of packages. A lot of open-source Objective-C code that was written in the last few years can now be installed using CocoaPods. Analysis of the language Objective-C implementations use a thin runtime system written in C, which adds little to the size of the application. In contrast, most object-oriented systems at the time that it was created used large virtual machine runtimes. Programs written in Objective-C tend to be not much larger than the size of their code and that of the libraries (which generally do not need to be included in the software distribution), in contrast to Smalltalk systems where a large amount of memory was used just to open a window. Objective-C applications tend to be larger than similar C or C++ applications because Objective-C dynamic typing does not allow methods to be stripped or inlined. Since the programmer has such freedom to delegate, forward calls, build selectors on the fly, and pass them to the runtime system, the Objective-C compiler cannot assume it is safe to remove unused methods or to inline calls. Likewise, the language can be implemented atop extant C compilers (in GCC, first as a preprocessor, then as a module) rather than as a new compiler. This allows Objective-C to leverage the huge existing collection of C code, libraries, tools, etc. Existing C libraries can be wrapped in Objective-C wrappers to provide an OO-style interface. In this aspect, it is similar to GObject library and Vala language, which are widely used in development of GTK applications. All of these practical changes lowered the barrier to entry, likely the biggest problem for the widespread acceptance of Smalltalk in the 1980s. A common criticism is that Objective-C does not have language support for namespaces. Instead, programmers are forced to add prefixes to their class names, which are traditionally shorter than namespace names and thus more prone to collisions. As of 2007, all macOS classes and functions in the Cocoa programming environment are prefixed with \\"NS\\" (e.g. NSObject, NSButton) to identify them as belonging to the macOS or iOS core; the \\"NS\\" derives from the names of the classes as defined during the development of NeXTSTEP. Since Objective-C is a strict superset of C, it does not treat C primitive types as first-class objects. Unlike C++, Objective-C does not support operator overloading. Also unlike C++, Objective-C allows an object to directly inherit only from one class (forbidding multiple inheritance). However, in most cases, categories and protocols may be used as alternative ways to achieve the same results. Because Objective-C uses dynamic runtime typing and because all method calls are function calls (or, in some cases, syscalls), many common performance optimizations cannot be applied to Objective-C methods (for example: inlining, constant propagation, interprocedural optimizations, and scalar replacement of aggregates). This limits the performance of Objective-C abstractions relative to similar abstractions in languages such as C++ where such optimizations are possible. =Memory management= The first versions of Objective-C did not support garbage collection. At the time this decision was a matter of some debate, and many people considered long \\"dead times\\" (when Smalltalk performed collection) to render the entire system unusable. Some 3rd party implementations have added this feature (most notably GNUstep using Boehm), and Apple has implemented it as of Mac OS X v10.5. However, in more recent versions of macOS and iOS, garbage collection has been deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), introduced in 2011. With ARC, the compiler inserts retain and release calls automatically into Objective-C code based on static code analysis. The automation relieves the programmer of having to write in memory management code. ARC also adds weak references to the Objective-C language. =Philosophical differences between Objective-C and C++= The design and implementation of C++ and Objective-C represent fundamentally different approaches to extending C. In addition to C's style of procedural programming, C++ directly supports certain forms of object-oriented programming, generic programming, and metaprogramming. C++ also comes with a large standard library that includes several container classes. Similarly, Objective-C adds object-oriented programming, dynamic typing, and reflection to C. Objective-C does not provide a standard library per se, but in most places where Objective-C is used, it is used with an OpenStep-like library such as OPENSTEP, Cocoa, or GNUstep, which provides functionality similar to C++'s standard library. One notable difference is that Objective-C provides runtime support for reflective features, whereas C++ adds only a small amount of runtime support to C. In Objective-C, an object can be queried about its own properties, e.g., whether it will respond to a certain message. In C++, this is not possible without the use of external libraries. The use of reflection is part of the wider distinction between dynamic (run-time) features and static (compile-time) features of a language. Although Objective-C and C++ each employ a mix of both features, Objective-C is decidedly geared toward run-time decisions while C++ is geared toward compile- time decisions. The tension between dynamic and static programming involves many of the classic trade-offs in programming: dynamic features add flexibility, static features add speed and type checking. Generic programming and metaprogramming can be implemented in both languages using runtime polymorphism. In C++ this takes the form of virtual functions and runtime type identification, while Objective-C offers dynamic typing and reflection. Both Objective-C and C++ support compile-time polymorphism (generic functions), with Objective-C only adding this feature in 2015.

It was released in April 2013 and aired on various music channels in Pakistan and on YouTube. In June 2013 the song became popular on social media. Lyrics According to Taher Shah, the song is about expressing and conveying feelings of love \\"eye to eye\\". The video of \\"Eye to Eye\\" features Taher Shah, with his long curly hair locks, dressed in a white suit with matching white shoes, in a white background with white furniture, where he sings about \\"sensational eyes, emotional eyes, colourful eyes, exciting eyes, fabulous eyes, spectrum eyes, human eyes, my eyes, your eyes...\\". Music video The music video, which gained notoriety for its absurd and nonsensical English lyrics, shows Taher Shah swaying side to side to the song while singing and blinking coyly at the screen. A duplicate of Shah, dressed in black with sleek hair, is also seen in the video singing and swaying alongside the white-clad Shah. At one point in the video, the two give a short message: \\"Eye to eye, makes a peculiar love, lifetime, once in a life. Substantial love is heaven for the size eyes. Spectacular eyes, our eyes, my eyes and your eyes, eye to eye, eye to eye.\\" Reviews Shah was sarcastically described as a \\"musical genius\\" in a tongue-in-cheek article in the Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune. In popular culture Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan dedicated the song to fellow actor Ranveer Singh on the latter's birthday in July 2015, posting a comment on Twitter: \\"One day I want you to outdo this!\\". Ranveer accepted the challenge and put up a 10-second dubsmash clip, syncing the song in Taher Shah getup. The clip garnered over 1.9 million views in just two days.

Short movies production Graduated in TV and Cinema at the Roma Tre University with maximum grades, Raffaele Monti wrote, produced, directed and played his first short movie, On the life (Sulla vita), as his thesis in 2004. In the same year, On the life was presented at the Arcipelago International Film Festival in the section “Special Events”. Just a 24-year-old, he won the prestigious Premio Internazionale Roberto Rossellini ex-aequo with the Chilean director Liu Marino, readapting William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in his screenplay of short film A bench, a meeting, the love (Una panchina, un incontro, l’amore). The movie also attended the Rome International Film Festival (RIFF) and the Reggio Film Festival. In 2007 he took part in the 48 Hour Film Project with the short Satisfaction (I can get), written, co- produced - with the fantasy name Meafaocort Express - and co-directed together with Gianpaolo Bucci. It won the “Best Actor” award (Daniele Favilli) and was selected among the top five by the organizers. In 2008, Satisfaction (I can get) won the People’s Choice Award at the Corti e Liberi Novara. Afterwards, Satisfaction (I can get) took part in the Arcipelago International Film Festival 2009 and was broadcast in very short clips on Babelgum. Between 2009 and 2010, Raffaele Monti toured Italy as a production manager for the play \\"Mamma Napoli\\" by Emiliano De Martino. In 2012 he wrote, co-produced and directed with his colleague Gianpaolo Bucci the short movie Young Hunger (La fame giovane), premiered out of competition at the MED Film Festival of Rome. TV pilot production Raffaele Monti wrote, self-produced, directed and starred the TV pilot of the sitcom A Ghost Tenant (Un fantasma per coinquilino), winner of the Italian Festival del cinema indipendente as Best TV Pilot with the following motivation: :For the characterization, for added flexibility in the schedule, for the elasticity of production and a strong identification of the target audience. The pilot also received a Special Mention in 2013 at the Festival della Creatività di Roma Capitale with the following motivation: :A zero budget sit-com but with creativity to one hundred. Pleasant, funny, full of visual ideas and strong kinesic intuitions (…) with the lost and disoriented mask played by Raffaele Monti – almost a Jacques Jacques Tati of the twenty-first century – at the lead (...) In 2013, Raffaele Monti and Mobcaster, a US website for crowdfunded television-shows, try crowdfunding as a financial tool in order to produce the entire Season 1 of \\"A Ghost Tenant\\". Experience as a critic Raffaele Monti started his career as a critic in 2002, writing for the magazine Rivista Omnibus. His career as a critic became significant from the following year (and until 2010), when he started a stable collaboration with the website CinemAvvenire, for whom he wrote about cinema, TV, music and literature. During this period, he worked as a correspondent in a lot of prestigious film festivals, like Asiatica Film Mediale, MED Film Festival, Giffoni Film Festival, Venice Film Festival and Torino Film Festival. In 2005 he was a correspondent for UniversyTV, of Roma Tre University, at the Venice Film Festival. In 2006 he participated as a main character at the TV show Voglia!, on national channel Italia 1, and lately he harshly criticized the show on CinemAvvenire website. In 2008 he also was a film critic for MoviePlayer. Passionate about soccer, he wrote about SSC Napoli, his favorite team soccer, on Vavel in 2011.

Holl was briefly a silent film star during the early Weimar Republic, appearing in productions such as F. W. Murnau's Desire (1921).Eisner p.130 Biography Auguste Marie Holl was born on 22 February 1888 in Frankfurt am Main. She had a brother, Georg Holl. Holl was a performer at Schall und Rauch, a cabaret in Berlin that had been founded by Max Reinhardt in 1901. Nicknamed the silver-blonde elegant witch, she sang and acted. She inspired multiple songs by Walter Mehring and Kurt Tucholsky, including The Blonde Lady Sings and Petronella, a parody of the Berlin trend for nudity on stage, and a dig at strip clubs. Tucholsky wrote of Holl, \\"Frankfurt has produced two great men: Goethe and Gussy Holl...She can do anything: hate and love, stroke and beat, sing and speak - there is no tone that is not part of her lyre.\\" and, \\"Unlike any other German artist, this rare and glorious woman is qualified and destined to be the great political singer. I won't even mention her tremendous art of parody and her ability to flit over the most daring things with a gracious leap - we are only interested in the artist who has more to say to a hall full of politically thinking people than ten journalists could.\\" In addition to being the number one cabaret star in the Weimar Republic, she was also a successful impersonator in New York. Portrait of Gussy Holl by Paul Rieth, ca. 1918 Holl made her film debut in the 1913 short America to Europe in an Airship. She did not appear in another film until 1919, when she starred in Richard Oswald's enlightenment film Prostitution alongside her husband, Conrad Veidt, and Reinhold Schünzel. She next appeared in Madness (1919), followed by The Night at Goldenhall (1920), both of which were directed by and starred Veidt. Film-Kurier wrote of Holl's performance in Madness, \\"...Gussy Holl should give up [film] acting. It is pitiful to watch this artist - who is peerless in her own sphere - at a task which she cannot master despite her best efforts.\\" Holl said to Lotte Eisner of the film, \\"The film was not only called Madness, but it was madness as well, and I can't remember anything about the story.\\" Holl's final screen appearance was in Desire (1921). Gussy Holl was married twice; her first marriage was to actor Conrad Veidt. Their large wedding took place on 18 June 1918. The two divorced in 1922, and, one year later, Holl married Emil Jannings, who she remained with until his death in 1950. Neither marriages produced children, although Holl was stepmother to Jannings' daughter Ruth- Maria. Other sources say Ruth-Maria was actually Jannings' stepdaughter, and that Conrad Veidt was her father. Gussy Holl died on 16 July 1966 in Salzburg.

It participated in several of the most significant battles of the war, including the battles of Neuve-Chapelle, the Somme, Passchendaele and St Quentin. It suffered very heavy casualties, repeatedly losing its commanding officers during offensives; by the end of one attack in 1916, it was down to only one surviving officer and sixty men. It participated in the final Allied offensive against Germany in 1918 before returning home in May 1919. Mobilisation and early actions Map of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, New York Times, May 1915 The 1st Battalion Royal Irish Rifles was serving in Aden when the First World War broke out in August 1914.Roe, p. 21 The Ottoman Empire had not yet entered the war so the battalion was sent to England in September, where it prepared for a deployment to France, attached to the 25th Infantry Brigade, 8th Division. It travelled from Southampton to Le Havre at the start of November and took up positions east of Laventie in the Pas de Calais.Roe, p. 22 The battalion's first major action was the Battle of Neuve Chapelle between 10 and 13 March 1915. After an initial artillery bombardment, the battalion advanced to the previously captured German front lines and helped to secure the village of Neuve-Chapelle. It then had to weather heavy German counter-attacks which failed to dislodge the members of the battalion but caused very heavy casualties, amounting to 18 officers and 440 other ranks, including its Colonel.Roe, p. 23 During the Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1915 - The battle of Fromelles took place on 19 and 20 July 1916. The battle mentioned here should be the Battle of Aubers ridge (9–10 May 1915) - the battalion successfully took its objectives at Rouge Bancs near Fromelles, but it again suffered very heavy casualties. At the subsequent Battle of Loos in September–October 1915, the battalion carried out a subsidiary attack at Bois Grenier. Although it gained ground, it had to withdraw. The following month, the battalion was sent to the rear for rest and training after a full year in the trenches.Roe, p. 24 Somme and Passchendaele After a further tour of the trenches at Rouge Bancs, the battalion was posted to Albert in the Somme. A German raid inflicted casualties in April 1916, but worse was to come in the Battle of the Somme in July, when the battalion was ordered to attack the German-held village of Ovillers-la-Boisselle. The attack was unsuccessful and cost the battalion many lives, including that of its colonel, who was mortally wounded early in the offensive. The Battalion's chaplain, Donal O'Sullivan was killed in the Somme. The battalion left the Somme for Loos after the first phase of the battle but returned in October 1916 to fight on the ridges of Le Transloy in appallingly muddy conditions. After a rest, it was posted to Bouchavesnes-Bergen at the end of December and advanced to take a swathe of German-held territory during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917. In June 1917, the battalion was transferred to positions immediately east of Ypres, where it supported the British offensive that opened the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July.Roe, p. 25 Yet again, its colonel was killed on the opening day of the battle and the rest of the battalion suffered massive casualties. By 16 August, when it had advanced well forward of the rest of the attacking force, it only had one surviving officer and 60 other ranks. Final offensives The remainder of the battalion spent a gruelling winter on the ridges above Paschendaele before being transferred in February 1918 to the 36th (Ulster) Division near Saint-Quentin. It played a prominent role in opposing the German attack during Operation Michael (known to the British as the Battle of St Quentin) in March 1918. The following month, the battalion returned to the Somme, where it remained until the Hundred Days Offensive saw the Allies going on the offensive and decisively defeating the Germans, bringing about the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Following the Armistice, the battalion was posted to the formerly German- occupied area of Mouscron in Belgium before returning to England in May 1919.

ROOM was developed in the early 1990s for modeling Real-time systems.Summary of the book \\"Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling\\" The initial focus was on telecommunications, even though ROOM can be applied to any event-driven real- time system. ROOM was supported by ObjecTime Developer (commercial) and is now implemented by the official Eclipse project eTriceeTrice - ROOM Open Source Tool When UML2 was defined (version 2 of UML with real time extensions), many elements of ROOM were taken over.  Concepts and Key Notions of ROOM  ROOM is a modeling language for the definition of software systems. It allows the complete code generation for the whole system from the model. ROOM comes with a textual as well as with a graphical notation. Typically the generated code is accompanied with manually written code, e.g. for graphical user interfaces (GUI). The code is compiled and linked against a runtime library which provides base classes and basic services (e.g. messaging). ROOM describes a software system along three dimensions: structure, behavior and inheritance. The following sections will explain these three aspects in more detail. = Structure = The structural view in ROOM is composed of actors or capsules. Actors can communicate with each other using ports. Those ports are connected by bindings. Actors do exchange messages asynchronously via ports and bindings. To each port a unique protocol is assigned. A protocol in ROOM defines a set of outgoing and a set of incoming messages. Ports can be connected with a binding if they belong to the same protocol and are conjugate to each other. That means that one port is sending the outgoing messages of the protocol and receiving the incoming ones. This port is called the regular port. Its peer port, the conjugated port, receives the outgoing messages and sends the incoming ones of the protocol. In other words, a port is the combination of a required and a provided interface in a role (since one and the same protocol can be used by several ports of an actor). Example of a structure diagram An actor can contain other actors (as a composition). In ROOM these are called actor references or actor refs for short. This allows to create structural hierarchies of arbitrary depth. The actor's ports can be part of its interface (visible from the exterior) or part of its structure (used by itself) or both. Ports that are part of the interface only are called relay ports. They are directly connected to a port of a sub actor (they are delegating to the sub actor). Ports that are part of the structure only are called internal end ports. Ports that belong to both, structure and interface, are called external end ports. = Behavior = Each actor in ROOM has a behavior which is defined by means of a hierarchical finite-state machine, or just state machine for short. A state machine is a directed graph consisting of nodes called states and edges called transitions. State transitions are triggered by incoming messages from an internal or external end port. In this context the messages sometimes are also called events or signals. If a transition specifies a certain trigger then it is said to fire if the state machine is in the source state of the transition and a message of the type specified by the trigger arrives. Afterwards the state is changed to the target state of the transition. ROOM behavior diagramm (state machine as a state chart) During the state change certain pieces of code are executed. The programmer (or modeler) can attach them to the states and transitions. In ROOM this code is written in the so called detail level language, usually the target language of the code generation. A state can have entry code and exit code. During a state change first the exit code of the source state is executed. Then the action code of the firing transition is executed and finally the entry code of the target state. A typical part of those codes is the sending of messages through ports of the actor. State machines in ROOM also have a graphical notation similar to the UML state charts. An example is shown in the diagram in this section. A state machine can also have a hierarchy in the sense that states can have sub state machines. Similar to the structure this can be extended to arbitrary depth. For details of the semantics of hierarchical state machines we refer to the original book.Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson, Paul T. Ward: \\"Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling\\", New York, John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1994, An important concept in the context of state machines is the execution model of run-to-completion. That means that an actor is processing a message completely before it accepts the next message. Since the run-to-completion semantics is guaranteed by the execution environment, the programmer/modeler doesn't have to deal with classical thread synchronization. And this despite the fact that typical ROOM systems are highly concurrent because of the asynchronous communication. And maybe its worth to stress that the asynchronous nature of ROOM systems is not by accident but reflects the inherent asynchronicity of e.g. the machine being controlled by the software. Definitely this requires another mind set than the one that is needed for functional programming of synchronous systems. But after a short while of getting accustomed it will be evident that asynchronously communicating state machines are perfectly suited for control software. = Inheritance = Like other object oriented programming languages ROOM uses the concept of classes. Actors are classes which can be instantiated as objects several times in the system. Of course each instance of an actor class is in its own state and can communicate with other instances of the same (and other) classes. Similar to other modern programming languages ROOM allows inheritance of actor classes. It is a single inheritance as an actor class can be derived from another actor class (its base class). It inherits all features of the base class like ports and actor refs, but also the state machine. The derived actor class can add further states and transitions to the inherited one. = Layering = A last powerful concept of ROOM is layering. This notion refers to the vertical layers of a software system consisting of services and their clients. ROOM introduces the notions of service access point (SAP) for the client side and service provision point (SPP) for the server side. From the point of view of an actor implementation the SAPs and SPPs work like ports. Like ports they are associated with a protocol. But other than ports they don't have to (and even cannot) be bound explicitly. Rather, an actor is bound to a concrete service by a layer connection and this binding of a service is propagated recursively to all sub actors of this actor. This concept is very similar to dependency injection.  Literature  * Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson, Paul T.

Located between the stations of (to the south) and (to the north), it served the small southern Tararua town of Eketahuna and was one of the few attended stations on the northern section of the line. The railhead of the Wairarapa Line was at Eketahuna from when the station opened in 1889 until 1896, and later it continued to be an important station for the surrounding rural area. Closure to all traffic came in 1988 after improvements to local and regional roads contributed to a decline in the patronage of passenger rail services.  History  = Operation =  Early years (1889–1897)  It was with great excitement that the residents of Eketahuna greeted the first train to their town on 8 April 1889. The official party aboard the train included the Minister of Public Works (Edwin Mitchelson), Minister of Lands (George Richardson), Commissioner of Railways (J. C. McKerrow), Speaker of the Legislative Council (William Fitzherbert), a former mayor of Wellington (S. Brown), as well as several department heads and spouses. On its way north, the train had avoided stopping at any of the flag stations between Upper Hutt and Masterton, where it stopped, before continuing its journey with brief stops at Mauriceville and Mangamahoe. Around 400 people received the train after it passed under two arches that had been erected south of the station yard for the occasion. The station enjoyed a period of intense activity as the terminus of the line including the shipment of large quantities of timber, wool, and butter in season. Passengers heading north to destinations including Woodville, Palmerston North, and Napier had to transfer to stagecoaches to continue their journeys, while those stopping over in Eketahuna were catered for by the Railway Hotel, a neighbour of the station, and also the Temperance Hotel and Commercial Hotel.  Heyday (1897–1908)  Over the eight-year period following the opening of the station, the Wellington – Woodville railway slowly advanced northwards, being progressively opened first to freight, and later to passenger services. Eketahuna was the terminus of the line until 1896, after which it was a stop on the government’s only rail line north out of Wellington. With the full line to Woodville open, the Napier Express passenger trains were diverted from the Palmerston North terminus to run from Woodville down the Wairarapa Line to Wellington and were known as the Napier Mail. This became the main passenger service through Eketahuna, supplementing the mixed trains that had served Eketahuna up to this time. Timber was the most significant source of freight traffic during this period, as the surrounding hinterlands were still largely covered in forest, providing much work for the sawmillers. However, the Great Fire of 1908 destroyed much of the remaining verdant growth, significantly curtailing this trade. It was only after the land was cleared following the fire that agriculture rose in importance and replaced timber as the dominant source of business for the railway. The station also catered for other seasonal traffic such as fruit.  Royal visit (1920)  Edward, Prince of Wales, was to have been the guest of honour at a civic reception organised for 5 May 1920 when the people of Eketahuna were advised two days prior that the royal train would be passing through Eketahuna on its way to Wellington. The occasion was the prince’s royal tour of New Zealand to thank its residents for their support during the Great War. Officials advised that because of a tight schedule the train would not be able to stop in Eketahuna, but would slow when passing through the station so the people would have a chance to see the prince on the train. The town’s administration had other ideas and surmised that the train would have to stop in Eketahuna anyway to water the locomotive. Therefore, preparations were hurriedly made, in expectation of a stop at Eketahuna being added to the schedule. When the train arrived at Eketahuna it stopped at the water vat on approach to the station, which was too far from the platform for any meeting to take place. The prince alighted from the train and began to make his way towards the waiting crowd, which had started to make their own way towards the train. He had only time to cross one track before the departure signal was given and had to quickly rejoin the train as it left the station yard at speed. Those waiting to meet the royal visitor only had a moment to see the prince on the rear platform of the last carriage.  Halcyon years (1908–1988)  The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company’s line from Wellington to Longburn was purchased by the government in 1908 which had an effect on services provided in the Wairarapa, particularly the section of the line north of Masterton. Because of the lengthy and costly delays associated with the operation of the Rimutaka Incline, much freight traffic from the northern Wairarapa region was diverted north through Woodville and Palmerston North so it could be taken down the Main Trunk Line to Wellington. Mixed trains, however, continued to operate through Eketahuna. Horses were used for many years for shunting duties in the station yard during stock season. It was noted that at this time of year they were used up to four times a week. In 1922 it was requested that the cattle-stop on the stockyard siding – which crossed a public road at the north end of the yard – be planked between the rails to enable the use of horses to place wagons at the loading bank. Prior to this request, consigners pushed wagons by hand across the road to a point where they could be worked by horses. Shortly after the nationalisation of the WMR line the Napier Express was diverted from the Wairarapa Line to run through the Manawatu Gorge and down the Manawatu line to Wellington. Thereafter, the main passenger service to stop at Eketahuna was its replacement, the Wairarapa Mail. A new passenger-only service was provided from 1936 with the introduction of the RM class Wairarapa-type railcars, which supplemented and later replaced the Wairarapa Mail in 1948. The Wairarapa railcars were in turn replaced after the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel in 1955 by the twinset railcars, which provided the main passenger service for Eketahuna for the next 22 years. The railcar timetable of 1959 shows two northbound and two southbound railcar services stopping at Eketahuna each day of the week with a third service on Fridays. During the period in which railcar services were provided through Eketahuna, locomotive-hauled carriage trains were occasionally provided when demand exceeded the capacity of the railcars, but finally replaced railcar services altogether in 1977. The NZR stopped accepting consignments of general freight at or for Ekehahuna on 13 October 1986. Railcar RM 132 came to an ignominious end on 24 August 1975 when it was gutted by fire between Hukanui and Eketahuna while running a southbound service to Wellington. All the passengers and crew managed to escape unharmed but the railcar was a write-off. It was towed to the Eketahuna yard and cut up for scrap. After the railcar services were withdrawn, patronage of passenger services on the northern section of the Wairarapa Line steadily declined as roads in the region improved. Demand finally dropped to a point where the service was no longer economical, and consequently the Palmerston North – Masterton – Wellington and return service was withdrawn from 1 August 1988. This was the last service to stop at the station and its cancellation resulted in the closure of the station to all traffic. = Facilities = Initial facilities at the station were befitting of a terminus, and included a station building, goods shed, five sidings, platform, loading bank, and water vat. A postal agency and telegraph office also operated from the station building. A staff complement commensurate with this operation was also required, which included a stationmaster, two clerks, three porters, one guard, one telegraph operator, three locomotive engineers, two firemen, and a cleaner. An inspection of railway infrastructure in Wairarapa carried out in February 1960 reported of Eketahuna that the station building was old but in reasonable condition and was last painted in 1951. The goods shed was also said to be old but in a fair condition, and there were also three \\"relatively new\\" houses plus two older ones. After Eketahuna was closed to freight traffic in 1986 the goods shed and loading shelter were disposed of and the trackwork was further rationalised.  Platform  The timber-fronted station platform was built-up and extended from in 1900, and again lengthened in 1906 by . By 1936 the platform had deteriorated to a point where urgent repairs were necessary, which were duly carried out in March. However, only two years later the platform was again in a poor state and a request was made for remedial work to be carried out. In March 1939 the request was approved, and it was decided to rebuild the platform sometime in the following 12 months. The work entailed replacing the front of the platform, reducing its length from to as the excess length was deemed surplus to requirements, and raising the height of the platform from above rail level to which would enable the platform to slope down towards the station building. The tablet exchanger would be located at the top of the south ramp of the platform.  Stockyards  The importance of livestock traffic at Eketahuna required numerous modifications to facilities to improve the transfer of animals to and from rail and augment capacity at the station. The backshunt servicing the cattle yards was extended in 1902 to increase its capacity to 20 wagons and in 1904 the sheep yards were enlarged to increase capacity from 300 head to 1,400 head. A water supply and trough was added to the stockyards in 1914. In 1907 the construction of holding yards was authorised. They were located to the east of the main line, north of the Eketahuna station yard on the other side of Alfredton Road. This space was divided into three parts and was a short distance from the existing stockyards at the north end of the station yard on the south side of the road. The water supply was extended to the holding yards in 1928 using the Department’s own water source, and a pen suitable for holding pigs was added in 1930. With the increasing popularity of trucks for transporting stock to and from the station, a sheep loading race was requested and approved in 1936. The existing livestock facilities at Eketahuna had been designed to cater for stock to be driven to the station, and the practice of unloading stock from trucks directly onto the ground increased the likelihood of stock sustaining injury. A similar request for a cattle loading race was made and recommended in 1956 at which time it was pointed out that around 90% of livestock trafficked through Eketahuna were transported by lorry. The pig yards were reported in 1974 to be in a state of disrepair to the point of being unusable. It was decided that they were surplus to requirements and their removal was approved. It was noted, however, that the sheep and cattle yards were still required and needed to be maintained to a usable standard. Track renewal work in the Eketahuna station yard prompted a request to dispose of the stockyards in 1979 to simplify the new layout. By this time the livestock traffic through Eketahuna was reported to be \\"negligible\\" and the stockyards were no longer being used. The request was approved and the stockyards were sold for removal to the Eketahuna County Council in 1980.  Yard and loading banks  In 1923 the station yard was extended by at the south end to enable the installation of a backshunt and crossover. This work also involved the relocation of the home signal and the extension of the north backshunt by . Later that year, a siding at the north end of the yard used by locomotives to access the water column was extended to enable larger locomotives, such as the A-class, to be watered there. The backshunt was again extended and a new loading bank constructed in 1925, with work being completed in October of that year. The main loading bank at Eketahuna was renewed with a concrete front and extended in length by in 1954.  Coal siding  After falling into disuse, the siding to the coal shed was removed in October 1929 and the engine pit was also filled in at around this time. It was advised that the coal shed was surplus to requirements and could be replaced by a smaller structure for use by the track gangers.  Locomotive watering  Following the introduction of diesel locomotives to the Wairarapa Line in the 1950s, provision of watering services at stations along the line was reviewed in 1956. At Eketahuna, it was decided to retain the vats at the south end of the yard in case of a requirement to use a relief steam locomotive. The vat at the north end was found to be on a stand in poor condition and was removed in June 1959, with the vat being relocated to Waikokopu.  Loading shelter  Construction of a loading shelter was approved in September 1961. It was to provide coverage of and to allow for the operation of a \\"pelican grab\\" loader under its awning. Tenders were called for in March 1962 and the contract was awarded to a Pahiatua company. Work commenced shortly thereafter and was completed several months later in July. Provision of the shelter was requested by commercial operators transferring goods at the station, which at the time handled mainly casein (outwards) and superphosphate (inwards).  Today  The station building was demolished following the cessation of passenger services and all other buildings and sidings from the station's commercial era have also been removed. The only remaining original remnants of the station are the platform, loading bank, and the foundations of a building in the yard. Two station name boards were installed on the platform and a signpost points the way to where the station once was. For a period of 7 years from 27 November 1988, the northern Wairarapa section of the Wairarapa Line was effectively mothballed, with no trains scheduled to pass through Eketahuna. Congestion on the Wellington – Palmerston North section of the NIMT led to the rescheduling of the Wellington – Napier freight services to run via the Wairarapa from 14 August 1995, and though these services passed through Eketahuna they did not stop there. Following the daylighting of tunnels Nos. 3, 4, 5 on the PNGL in Q3 2008, and thus the removal of the impediment to using hi-cube containers through the Manawatu Gorge, the Wellington – Napier freight services were redirected to their original route. Passenger excursion trains operated by local rail heritage organisations occasionally pass through or stop at Eketahuna. Heritage rail organisations Steam Incorporated and the Pahiatua Railcar Society have revamped the station for use in their own excursion activities including the relocation of the former Waikanae Station building to the Eketahuna station platform. It was donated to the groups by Greater Wellington Regional Council when the building became surplus to requirements following the extension of Wellington's electrified suburban rail network to Waikanae. The station was officially re-opened on 10 May 2014 and in 2015 the group’s efforts were recognised by the Rail Heritage Trust with the awarding of a Certificate of Merit.

Paul John is made from Indian malted barley and, for some variants, imported Scottish peat, distilled in traditional copper pot stills and then matured in Charred American Oak Casks. Paul John Single Malt Whisky was first launched in the year 2012 in the United Kingdom and in Goa, India in 2013 followed by the launch in Bangalore in the year 2015. History John Distilleries is based in Bangalore, India and its single malt distillery is located in Goa. The distillery has two sets of Indian-made copper pot stills (wash and spirit) that can produce 6000 litres daily. Maturation takes place in a climate-controlled underground cellar that has around 10,000 barrels. The company had been making blended whisky since its foundation in 1996, but decided to manufacture single malt whisky in 2008 in an attempt to enter the premium end of the market. Master distiller Michael D'souza chose to use Indian ingredients in the making of the single malts, to give the whisky characteristics of its country of origin. The wash he created had an abv of 5%, lower than the standard 8% for most whisky. This creates a sweeter flavour in the final product. The whisky is put in the casks at 55% abv, but the alcoholic strength increases as it ages due to the heat, giving the final product an abv of 57%. Goa features a tropical monsoon climate, and being in the tropical zone and near the Arabian Sea, has a hot and humid climate for most of the year. The month of May is the hottest, with day temperatures of over 35°C (95°F) coupled with high humidity. The monsoon rains arrive by early June and last till late September. Goa has a short winter season between mid- December and February. These months are marked by nights of around 21 °C (68 °F) and days of around 28 °C (84 °F) with moderate amounts of humidity. The hot weather makes whisky mature faster in India than it does in Europe or the United States. The fraction lost to evaporation during aging, known as the angels' share, is also higher in India, at 8-10% per year, than in Scotland, where the annual evaporative loss is about 2%. This leaves a hogshead with only 150 bottles left in it, after three years, compared to around 350 in a Scotland. Michael D'souza describes it this way, \\"Whisky matured at these temperatures simply cannot be aged for the kind of time expected with Scotch, even trying to mature our whisky for just 10 years would leave barely a bottle of liquid in the barrel. Fortunately, the heat actually speeds up the maturation process considerably. As a result, whisky that has been matured for just 4-5 years – as is the case with Paul John Edited and Brilliance – is equivalent to a Scotch that has been aged for around 15 years\\". The first bottling of Paul John whisky, branded \\"Paul John Single Cask 161 Whisky\\", was officially launched on 4 October 2012 by Sanjay Paul, CEO of Alcobev Communications, at the Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, England. It was a non-peated whisky single cask whisky, made from Indian malted barley distilled twice in traditional copper pot stills, aged for an unspecified period in first-fill charred American casks.

They started as informal agreements made by one cotton master and his operatives then each cotton town developed their own list. Spinners merged all of these into two main lists which were used by all, while weavers used one 'unified' list. Background to the industry Early cotton spinning mills in Derbyshire and later in Manchester and Lancashire used cotton-jennies and mules. The proprietors put out the spun cotton to hand loom weavers who wove it into pieces for which they were paid. In the Pennine counties many established woollen weavers switched their looms to cotton and more entrepreneurs invested in cotton spinning mills. When cast iron power looms became reliable, the mill-owners added weaving sheds to their mills then employed relatively unskilled women and children (half-timers). Each minded four looms while a skilled tackler gaited the looms and kept them tuned. Mule-spinners and power loom weavers were also being paid by piece. As the 18th century progressed each town developed a different specialism. Oldham was a spinning town producing fine counts while Wigan did coarse. Burnley became a weaving town, producing plain calicos for printing, while but Blackburn did fancies using Jacquard looms. In the 20th century there was consolidation into larger units of production. To the north-east thousand-loom sheds were built while to the south we saw the quarter of a million spindles Edwardian ring spinning mills. Ring spinners were usually paid by the hour not the piece. What is a list For the calculation of wages piece-rate lists were universally employed as regards the payment of full weavers and mule-spinners; some piecers got a definite share of the total wage thus assigned to a pair of mules, while others are paid a fixed weekly amount. Many ring-spinners were mainly paid an hour-wage. Other operatives are almost universally so paid by list, with the exception of the hands in the blowing-room and on the carding-machines. Individually negotiating with the spinner or weaver how much should be paid for each job clearly was not feasible and a table listing the payment for each task was drawn up by each employer. As operatives then moved to the proprietor who paid the most, 'lists' were put together to agree a standard between mills and sheds in a neighbourhood. The list ensured uniformity of treatment and became an item that demanded vigorous discussion to ensure the differentials were maintained. Spinning and weaving lists were most complicated; discounts are made in them for most incidents beyond the operatives' control. They could not cover all circumstances, and much was left to the manner of their application and private arrangement. The highest wages were earned by mule- spinners (who were all males); their assistants, known as piecers, were more poorly paid. Piecers, hoped ultimately to become \\"minders\\", i.e. mule-spinners in charge of mules. The division of the total wage paid on a pair of mules between the minder and the piecers was largely the result of the policy of the spinners' trade union. Almost without exception in Lancashire one minder took charge of a pair of mules with two or three piecers assisting. The wage of fine spinners about 25 to 35 above that of a coarse weaver. Among the weavers there was no rule as to the number of assistants to full weavers (who are both male and female), or, after the 'More looms system' came in, as to the number of looms managed by a weaver, but the proportion of assistants was less than in spinning branches. =Discounts= Discounts is the principle that no operative should suffer if he was allocated substandard cotton, or put on a machine that output a lower capacity. History The history of lists stretches back to the first quarter of the 19th century as regards spinners, and to about the middle of the century generally as regards weavers, though a weaving list agreed to by eleven masters was drawn up as early as 1834. There are still many different district lists in use, but the favourite spinning lists are those of Oldham and Bolton, and the weaving list most generally employed is that known as the \\"Uniform List\\" (1892), which is a compromise between the lists of Blackburn, Preston and Burnley. A copy of the Bolton list of 1844 was published by the British Association Report in 1887, but this was not the first. It is believed that the Bolton List for spinners dated from 1813 and this embraced discounts. It the 1830s there was much agitation to agree lists, and the Bolton list was often discussed. There was an Oldham List for weavers in 1834, this was in place fifteen years before the Oldham Weavers' Association was formed in 1859. The Burnley weaving list was drawn up 1843 and the Blackburn lists for weaving, looming, winding, beam-warping and tape-sizing were drawn up by joint committees in 1853. In general the pressure to adopt lists came from the operatives themselves. Many lists were drawn up and frequently revised, so by 1887, twenty two lists had been drawn up and most abandoned. The Hyde, Stockport and Ashton lists were superseded by the Blackburn list (1853) for fine cloth- as had the Burnley, Chorley and Preston lists. When the Unified List was adopted in 1892, Ashton opted to stay with the Blackburn list. The lists attempted to achieve fairness, and as such were very complex and the emerging unions employed staff to check the calculations which were known as 'The Sorts'. David Shackleton, the future Independent Labour Party leader and MP for Clitheroe was employed by the Darwen Weavers', Winders' and Warpers' Association as secretary in 1894 . In two years, he recalculated 3,237 sorts and discovered 1290 underpayments. (40%) Some of these were honest mistakes other were due to the practice of 'nibbling'. To put this in context Shackleton himself had attended a dame school and church primary schools for which his father was charged. He started work as a part- timer at the legal age of nine and full-time at 13. Though he attended night school classes he never progressed beyond a primary school level education. Lists continued until the 1920s =Factory Act 1891= Under the \\"Particulars Clause\\", first included in a Factory Act 1891 and given extended application in 1895, the particulars required for the calculation of wages must be rendered by the employer. In spinning there used to be doubts about the quantity of work done, so the \\"indicator\\", which measures the length of yarn spun came into general use. The Oldham Spinning list differs from all others in that its basis is starts from an agreed normal time-wage. The piece-rates are reckoned so that can be achieved. But in effect this was implicit everywhere as when the average wages in a particular mill were lower than elsewhere for reasons not connected with the quality of labour (e.g. because of antiquated machinery or the low quality of the cotton used), the men demanded \\"allowances\\" to raise their wages to the normal level. =Brooklands Agreement= In 1893, the Brooklands Agreement was entered into by masters and men in the cotton spinning industry. Under this agreement advances and reductions could not exceed 5% or succeed one another by a shorter period than twelve months and must be preceded by a consultation or 'conference'. Usually the changes were between 5% or 2.50%. The men agreed that formal conciliation would take place between the interested parties before a strike broke out.

DigiScents Inc was among the more recent pioneers of the technology, developing DigiScent (later iSmell) in 1999 as a device that would plug into a computer's USB port and generate scents dependent on the online content being viewed. The company ceased trading in 2011. In 2013, Amy Radcliffe, a Master's student in the Textile Futures department of Central Saint Martins, London introduced a prototype of a desktop device to record aromas. For the project, she drew on headspace technology pioneered in the 1980s by Roman Kaiser to capture smells in the air around certain objects. Called the Madeleine, after the Marcel Proust episode from Remembrance of Things Past, the device is a working prototype of a new kind of camera to record smell. It consists of a funnel to be placed over the object with the scent you wish to capture. This is attached to a pump that draws air into an odor trap made of a porous polymer resin. According to Radcliffe, it can take from a few minutes to a whole day to capture the odour in liquid form, depending on its intensity. So far, several samples have been sent for analysis in a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry machine at a fragrance laboratory. In the scenario developed for the prototype, the Madeleine would be taken for local lab processing in a similar way to conventional photographic film. The device was exhibited during Milan Fashion Week in April 2013.

She was born in 1715 in Paramaribo to a freed slave, known as Mariana. All of her other siblings had been born as slaves and were emancipated by her half-brother Charlo Jansz. Raised in the home of her half-sister Maria Jansz, Samson was taught to read and write by her brothers-in law who also trained her in business. She began acquiring property at the age of 19, but was banished from the colony in 1736 after being convicted of slander. Her appeal, heard by the Dutch Parliament, was successful and she returned to Suriname in 1739. After acquiring slaves and two small coffee plantations, Samson entered a relationship with Carl Otto Creutz. Creutz was a soldier who was deeded property in 1749 by the governor for his service in making peace with local maroons. Focused on his military career and colonial politics, he turned his plantation, Clevia, over to Samson's management. She brought her own slaves to work on his plantation and within two years, the couple drew up a document confirming their joint ownership of Clevia, as well as of a cattle ranch and two townhomes in the city of Paramaribo. When he died in 1762, his half-ownership and other properties passed jointly to Samson and his brothers but she bought out their interests within two years. Samson continued to acquire properties with various family members, including her sister Nanette, with whom she established a successful export business, which traded using her own ship. In 1767, she married Hermanus Daniel Zobre (17371784), and became the first black woman in Suriname to marry a white man. She was a major coffee plantation owner and coffee export trader until her death in 1771. Her success as a business person, black slave owner, and her marriage to a white partner, challenged both the gender and racial norms of the times. While her personal history provides insight into the ways black and mixed-race women contributed to the economy and challenged social norms, it also expands knowledge of 18th- century social organization in Suriname. Her life and the controversies surrounding her choices have been examined by modern scholarship and in literary studies. Early life Elisabeth Samson was born in 1715 in Paramaribo, Suriname, as the youngest child of a freedwoman, who had taken the name Mariana upon her emancipation from slavery, and an unknown black father. Mariana had originally been known as Nanoe and was brought to Suriname around 1700 from Saint Kitts by her owner Jan van Susteren. Susteren fathered two older siblings with Nanoe, Charlo and Maria Jansz, before his death in 1712. His will instructed that Nanoe and their two children were to be freed, though Nanoe's six other children by black men were to remain in slavery to his wife. These three family members attained their freedom in 1713, with the result that when she was born, Elisabeth was a free \\"negress\\". Samson's half-brother Charlo, purchased the rest of his siblings from Susteren's widow and before his death in 1732 had managed to obtain manumission for each of them. Samson was raised in the household of her half-sister Maria and her husband Pierre Mivela, a Swiss merchant and owner of the Salzhallen Plantation. When Mivela died, Maria remarried a planter, Frederick Coenraad Bossche, who continued to provide a home for Samson. In the homes of both her brothers-in-law, Samson was taught to read and write and also learned to count. She was baptized when she was ten years old and the certificate noted her knowledge of the bible. From an early age, she worked with Bossche in his importing business and by 19 had begun to acquire her own property. In 1736, Samson was convicted of slander for having spread rumors about an alleged dispute between Governor and a local coppersmith, Mr. Peltser (Pelzer) and his wife. Convicted and banished from the colony in 1737, she went to the Netherlands to appeal the verdict. A lawyer, hired by Bossche filed the case with the States General in The Hague, where Samson was residing in exile, and worked on the case for nearly two years from Suriname. In 1739, she was exonerated and allowed to return home. Career Samson began to acquire slaves and purchased the Toevlught and Welgemoed coffee plantations over the next three years. In her mid-twenties, she became involved in a business and personal relationship with Carl Otto Creutz. He was from Emmerich am Rhein in the Duchy of Cleves, had come to Suriname in 1733 as an army cadet, and lived in the home of Samson's sister and brother-in-law. Rising through the ranks to captain and successfully assisting Governor Jan Jacob Mauricius in negotiating peace with the local maroons, Creutz was awarded a 1,000-acre plantation, ', in 1749. To work the plantation, Samson brought her 200 slaves, who had remained her personal property. In 1750, the plantation was registered with local authorities to confirm their cohabitation and in 1751, a legal document was drawn up showing that Samson and Creutz had joint ownership of Clevia; a nearby cattle ranch, La Solitude; and two townhomes in Paramaribo. Creutz became involved in colonial politics, rising to membership in the Court of Policy, leaving Samson in charge of running their estates. 1737 Map of Suriname shows Samson family members owning property in the Hoer Helena Creek section Their lavish home in Paramaribo was next door to the governor's house and was fitted with all the finery money could buy, including crystal chandeliers, china, mahogany furnishings, silver, a wine cellar and luxurious fabrics. The 44 house slaves lived in a separate property adjacent to their stables which were across the street from the main home. Above the stables was an apartment and next door was the other townhome the couple owned. Both were rented out to tenants. During his campaigns with the maroons, Creutz contracted malaria and from 1753 suffered from repeated periods of sickness from the disease. He died in November 1762 and Samson then inherited his half of their joint holdings for use during her lifetime, which would pass to his brothers when she died. Unwilling to have merely a life tenancy she prepared a purchase offer for the Creutz brothers which they accepted. Over the next two years, Samson paid the brothers ƒ155,000 (around £ in ), becoming sole owner of the properties. In 1764, Samson wrote to the Council of Policy and the governor, seeking permission to marry. Her fiancé was Christopher Polycarpus Braband, a white man who was the organist of the local Dutch Reformed Church and a tenant in one of her properties. Her request was denied in accordance with the 1685 law of Suriname which prohibited blacks and whites from marrying. Undaunted, she had her legal representatives in the Netherlands ask permission directly from the board of the Society of Suriname, which prompted the local authorities to write to the Society asking them to deny the request. Their appeal stated that the only argument in favor of the union was that her wealth might pass out of black hands and return to white possession after her death. Unable to reach a decision, the directors of the Society forwarded the request to the parliament. It took the States General three years to review the case, but they concluded that the colonial law differed from Dutch law, which did not exclude interracial marriage and that Dutch law overruled local statutes. Though Samson was now allowed to marry a white man, her fiancé had died in January 1766, during the drawn out legal proceedings. Samson was not idle, while waiting for the decision on her marriage. Her older sister, Catharina Opperman had died in 1764 and left the plantations Vlaardingen and Catharinasburg to her sisters Elisabeth and Nanette Samson. The sisters then jointly purchased Belwaarde Plantation, the neighboring estate to Clevia and formerly owned by Governor Mauricius and began operating a coffee export business. Samson commissioned a shipyard in Amsterdam to build a frigate, the Miss Nanette and Miss Elisabeth, for their trade goods. The ship was completed and arrived in Suriname in 1767, where bags marked with the initials of the sisters and the plantation where the coffee was grown were loaded and shipped to overseas ports of call. When approval for her marriage to a white man was finally received in August of that year, Samson was resolute in wanting to increase her social standing by having a legitimate marriage. On 21 December 1767, she exchanged vows with a much younger man, Hermanus Daniel Zobre, (1737–1784) who had immigrated from The Hague in hopes of becoming a planter and was a neighbor of her sister Nanette. With her nuptials completed, Samson became the first black woman to be legally married to a white man in Suriname. In 1768, Samson drew up a will leaving cash of ƒ23,000 (around £ in ) to her family members and her real property to her husband. The coffee exports of 1768 and 1769 of the Samson sisters were profitably sold in Amsterdam, earning her an estimated annual income of between ƒ30,000–100,000 (around £- in ) at a time when the colonial governor annually earned ƒ10,600 (£ in ). The Miss Nanette and Miss Elisabeth was wrecked off the coast of North Carolina in 1769 and though the crew was rescued, the cargo was lost. In 1770, Samson and her sister Nanette each inherited 1/4 of their sister Maria's Salzhallen Plantation. At her death, Samson owned full interest in the Clevia, De Goede Vreed, Toevlugt and Welgemoed plantations and the La Solitude ranch. She also owned a half interest with her sister Nanette in the Belwaarde, Catharinasburg, Onverwacht, and Vlaardingen plantations, as well as a country estate; a quarter interest in the Salzhalen Plantation; and owned six homes in her own name and a half-interest in six other residences. Death and legacy Location map for Samson's home at 22 Wagenwegstraat, Paramaribo Samson's home, 22 Wagenwegstraat, Paramaribo, 2016 Samson died on 21 April 1771 and was buried without a headstone at the in Paramaribo. Her husband inherited over ƒ1,000,000 (around £ in ) of property, which he promptly mortgaged and lived lavishly on the proceeds. A crop failure in 1772 and a bank crash in Amsterdam in 1773 then led him to take out a mortgage on Belwaarde. Unaware that he had mortgaged the property, Nanette tried to pay back the mortgage, but eventually declared bankruptcy in 1778. When Zobre died in 1784, having never paid the mortgages and with his family refusing the inheritance because of the debt, Jan and Theo Marselis, who owned a mercantile business in Amsterdam took over all of Samson's former estates. As she had no children and her husband squandered her legacy, Samson was obscured in the historic record, often reflected as part of local folklore until writer and historian Cynthia McLeod decided to research her life, in 1988. Expanding her search beyond Suriname, McLeod consulted Dutch archives in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, as well as records in Germany, piecing together and salvaging Samson's life story. Her history gives insight, not only into how black and mixed-race women were able to impact the economy of the Caribbean region and challenge social constructs in the 18th century, but also providing details of the larger society of Suriname in the period. The located at 22 Wagenwegstraat in Paramaribo has been declared part of the historic city center and was added to South America's World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 2002. McLeod has lobbied for years to conserve the property and in 2019 established a foundation, hoping to raise adequate funding for faithful restoration of the home to how appeared in Samson's lifetime. McLeod has repeatedly written about Samson in such historical studies as Bronnen van Afro-Surinaamse Samenlevingen (Sources from Afro-Surinamese Societies, 1993) and Elisabeth Samson: Een vrije zwarte vrouw in het achttiende-eeuwse Suriname (Elisabeth Samson: A Free Black Woman in Eighteenth-century Suriname, 1994) and a novel, De vrije negerin Elisabeth (The Free Negress Elisabeth, 2000), which was published in English in 2004. In 2014, Elisabeth Samson versus de Nederlandse Staat (Elisabeth Samson versus the State of the Netherlands), a play by the theater group Urban Myth, premiered at the Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam. The performance explored Samson's life and whether her ambition to use her wealth and power to gain equal legal treatment was solely for her own benefit. Written by the novelist, Karin Amatmoekrim, the play examined Samson's long quest to marry a white man and find her place in white society, calling into question why she had not worked to free other black people from slavery.

He was killed in action while serving as commander of the 34th Division. Early life and career Ingouville-Williams was born in Purbrook, Hampshire, to General Sir John William Collman Williams, KCB, JP, and Georgiana Isabella, the daughter of a wealthy landowner. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the East Kent Regiment (3rd Regiment of Foot; known as \\"the Buffs\\") on 23 April 1881. He participated in the Nile Expedition (1884–1885) and served as adjutant to the regiment from 1894 to 1898 after promotion to captain. He was seconded to the Egyptian Army in 1898 and 1899, during which time he took part in the Battle of Atbara and the Battle of Khartoum, for which he was mentioned in despatches. From 1899 to 1902, he served under Sir Charles Warren in the Second Boer War. He was present at the Relief of Ladysmith and was twice mentioned in despatches during the war. His brother George, a major in the South Staffordshire Regiment was killed in action during the conflict. By the end of the war, he had been awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal King's South Africa Medal, and the Distinguished Service Order, and had been promoted to local lieutenant colonel. He changed his name to Ingouville-Williams in 1902, apparently in memory of his mother, whose maiden name was Ingouville. In 1903, Ingouville-Williams was transferred to command 2nd Battalion, the Worcestershire Regiment, with whom he spent much of the following five years in India. After completing his tour as a battalion commander, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1910 and went on to serve as Commandant of the School of Mounted Infantry and then to command the 16th Infantry Brigade from 1912 until the outbreak of the First World War. First World War Ingouville-Williams (now a brigadier-general) and his brigade were ordered to France on the outbreak of war, and he remained in command of the 16th until 1915, when he was promoted to major-general and sent to command the newly formed 34th Division. After training, he took the 34th to the Western Front in January 1916 and led the division at the beginning of the Battle of the Somme in summer 1916. He earned another four mentions in despatches during the war. On 22 July, Ingouville-Williams and his aide-de-camp personally inspected the ground on which the division was expected to fight the following week. On his way back, he was caught in an artillery barrage and was killed instantly after being struck by a piece of shrapnel. He was buried at Warloy- Baillon Communal Cemetery extension in France.

Although he had name recognition and was known for his work, he is mainly noted for being the first couture designer to be sacked from their own-name label in 1992. Career Born in Paris, Scherrer trained as a dancer at the Conservatoire de Paris until he injured his back, which put him out of action for three months. He then decided to focus on fashion design, and in 1956, joined Christian Dior as an assistant designer alongside Yves Saint Laurent. Following Dior's death in 1957, Scherrer worked under Saint Laurent, and then for Louis Féraud, before launching his own fashion house in 1962 on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with the backing of Jacques Chabrol, a French millionaire. In the mid-1960s Scherrer had an agreement with the American department store Bergdorf Goodman to grant them exclusive rights to reproduce and resell his designs in the States. His clients included Anne- Aymone Giscard d'Estaing, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Raquel Welch, who wore Scherrer animal-print dresses in the 1977 film L'Animal. By the 1980s, his work was known for its opulence and luxury, with many garments hand- beaded, embroidered and lavishly trimmed. His extremely expensive designs were popular with the wealthy wives of Middle East oil tycoons, but after the Gulf War broke out, they stopped purchasing his clothes. Dismissal In 1990 Scherrer was fired without warning by his then business partners, Hermès and Ilona Gestion, who held a 90% controlling stake in the business. Although the sacking was publicly criticised by high-profile figures in the French fashion industry including Marc Bohan, and Saint Laurent's co-founder Pierre Bergé, there was little that could be done. The fashion historian Colin McDowell described it as \\"a salutary warning of the dangers of putting too many eggs in one basket, of not keeping control of one's business and, according to some, of designer hubris\\". Scherrer himself described the method of his sacking as \\"Comme on aurait renvoyé la bonne\\" (\\"as you would dismiss the maid\\"). Erik Mortensen replaced Scherrer at Jean-Louis Scherrer, and from 1997 to 2007 Stéphane Rolland was designer for the fashion house before it closed permanently in 2008. The brand, which as of 2013, specialises in licensed products, is currently owned by the Dumesnil Group. Death On 20 June 2013, Scherrer died in a palliative care clinic in Paris following a 10 month illness. He was survived by his daughters by his ex-wife Laurence, Laetitia (a former model) and Leonor Scherrer, also a fashion designer specialising in mourning dress.

There were nearly fifty arrests made to allow Canilla to enter his own church in Gibraltar in 1881. Early life Gonzalo Canilla was born in Gibraltar on 24 May 1846. He became a priest and secretary to his fellow Gibraltarian Bishop Scandella who was Vicar Apostolic of Gibraltar. Career When Scandella died in 1880 his secretary Canilla was almost unanimously recommended for his vacant position. Of the eight priests in Gibraltar only Canilla himself and a Greek priest called Stephanapolis dissented. Canilla was appointed new Vicar Apostolic of Gibraltar on 8 Mar 1881 despite objections from rich people in Gibraltar. He was also appointed Titular Bishop of Lystra as nearly all Vicars Apostolic of Gibraltar were also appointed Titular Bishops. Canilla was only the second Gibraltarian to be appointed to this position. He was formally appointed Bishop on 12 Jun 1881 but he still had to enter his cathedral. The objections to Canilla as Bishop from the merchant class was because his predecessor, Scandella, had resisted a new tobacco tax designed to reduce tobacco smuggling into Spain. Scandella had traveled to London to lobby the Members of Parliament. Scandella had also tried to enlist the influential members of the Exchange and Commercial Library. Although nominally in charge of the library, this committee were the emerging civil authority in Gibraltar. When Scandella went to London the Library committee sent its own delegation to Manchester sending notes back complaining about Scandella. When Scandella died these people remembered that Canilla has been Scandella's loyal secretary. Whilst Canilla was being appointed in London by Bishop Manning there were moves in Gibraltar. A \\"Committee of Elders\\" was formed who held public meetings and contacted the press noting that Canilla was too young and inexperienced. When Canilla returned they prevented him from entering his own church although the Governor's office blamed Canilla for being too passive. (The governor Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala was away.) In December Canilla again tried to enter his church but a mob formed and the local police advised Canilla to withdraw. Canilla complained but the governor sided with the mob and about ten of them broke into the church and ejected Alfred Weld, an English Jesuit, who had been sent to investigate the problems in Gibraltar. Weld had gathered over 400 signatures from locals in support of Canilla so that when the Governor advised London that nothing could be done he got a strong reply. London had received a different account from Canilla and the governor was told that his police should be able to keep order especially inside a military fortress. Meanwhile the \\"Elders\\" had raised the stakes and said that they intended to take possession of the church and install Stephenapolis as \\"chief priest\\". Canilla was sent back to his church on 2 March 1881 now that the Governor was under strict instruction to install him in his church. The police could not be relied upon and twenty soldiers were quickly appointed as extra policeman. When the new force came to the church they found it was occupied by 200 men and the police had to make four dozen arrests to establish order. The following trials saw these people given fines and warnings and one person was given six months hard labour. But Canilla now had his church not only in spirit but in law as the governor arranged for the title deeds of the church to be given to the new titular Bishop. When Canilla died in 1898 he was recognised for support he made of workers rights during disputes and for the good work he had done for the Jews and for the poor but particularly in the continuing improvement he encouraged in education. Nearly 2,000 children in Gibraltar were receiving primary education when he died. It was noted that whilst in nearby La Linea 10% of the Catholics there went to church, in Gibraltar the figure was 50%. Canilla's successor was nearly another Gibraltarian, Peter Amigo, however Amigo's father had been one of the leading players at the Exchange and Commercial Library where the dispute had started about Canilla so Amigo went on be a Bishop of Southwark and James Bellord became Canilla's successor.

The community comprises five sub- groupscarpenters, blacksmiths, bronze smiths, goldsmiths and stonemasonswho believe that they are descendants of Vishvakarma, a Hindu deity. They worship various forms of this deity and follow five VedasRigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvaveda, and Pranava Veda.\\"The Panchals are the followers of the five Vedas, the fifth being Pranava Veda.\\"  Origin myths  The community claims descent from the god Vishvakarma, who is considered by Hindus to be the divine architect or engineer of the universe. He had five children — Manu, Maya, Tvastar, Shilpi and Visvajna — and these are believed by the Vishwakarma community to have been the forebears of their five sub-groups, being respectively the gotras (clans) of blacksmiths, carpenters, bell metalworkers (metal casters), stonemasons and goldsmiths. It is not known whether these five subgroups historically practised endogamy, which is a frequently-found feature of the Indian caste system. The origin myths of the Vishwakarma community were first consolidated in the early 18th century, during the British colonial rule. These myths were compiled in the Vishwakarma Puranam, whose original manuscript is undated but was most probably created in the mid-17th or 18th century. According to a popular myth recorded in the Vishwakarma Puranam, the five children of the god Vishwakarma served the gods as artisans, and possessed the ability to create things by simply imagining them. They had conserved their veerya by being celibates, and lived in a fort on the coast of Ilangapuri (Sri Lanka). The fort was made of lodestone, and the enemy weapons thrown at it were stuck to its walls, rendering it invincible. Their chief enemy was Karunakaran, a vassal of the Chola emperor. In order to defeat the Vishwakarmas, Karunakaran planted many beautiful women (Brahmin women according to some versions of the legend) in the fort. These women married the Vishwakarmas, thus destroying their spiritual power, and learned the secret that a certain type of poisonous grass could be used to burn up the fort. Using this secret, the enemy blew up the fort, and the Vishwakarmas were scattered in various areas, where they were forced to work as artisans and craftsmen for mortal humans.  History  While many sources refer to the five sub-groups of the Vishwakarma as artisans, historian Vijaya Ramaswamy believes that the Vishwakarma of the medieval period should be distinguished as craftsmen, arguing that \\"... while every craftsman was an artisan, every artisan was not a craftsman\\". Ramaswamy notes that the socio- economic and geographic stability of a medieval village-based maker of ploughs differed considerably from that of the various people who banded together as Vishwakarma and lived a relatively itinerant lifestyle that was dependent on the \\"temple economy\\" that waxed and waned as dynasties such as the Vijayanagar Empire were formed and disintegrated. The latter group, who did work in proximity to each other while constructing and embellishing temples, had opportunities for socio-economic advancement but also bore the risks of withdrawal of patronage and changes in religious focus.  Position in society  The Vishwakarma have claimed a higher social status for many years, and believe that the trades which they traditionally follow are superior to the work of a manual labourer because they require artistic and scientific skills as well as those of the hand. According to George Varghese, their claim to high status is \\"one of the mainstays of Vishwakarma identity\\" in what is otherwise a fragmented, incoherent community that has often suffered from internal differences of opinion. Their claim has been voiced by Edava Somanathan, a member of the community and its only historian in the written word. Somanathan's works, according to Varghese, \\"... are written from a pro- community perspective. Therefore, there are a lot of exaggerations and anti- brahmin tirades in Kerala\\". Somanathan argues that the artisanal groups were a part of the Indus Valley Civilisation, pre-dating the arrival of Brahmins and their caste-based division of society. He claims implausible achievements are evidenced in both the arts and sciences during that egalitarian pre-Brahmin era, including the construction of aeroplanes. This claim to Brahmin status is not generally accepted outside the community, despite their assumption of some high-caste traits, such as wearing the sacred thread, and the Brahminisation of their rituals. For example, the sociologist M. N. Srinivas, who developed the concept of sanskritisation, juxtaposed the success of the Lingayat caste in achieving advancement within Karnataka society by such means with the failure of the Vishwakarma to achieve the same. Their position as a left-hand caste has not aided their ambition. They have been included in the list of Other Backward Classes in some states of India.Central List of OBCs  Synonyms  = Tamil Nadu = The Tamil Vishwakarmas are locally known as Kammalar, although they prefer to be known as Vishwakarma.

The church is north-east from Grantham, below the southern edge of the Lincoln Cliff, and at the side of High Dyke, part of the old Ermine Street Roman road. St Martin's is in the ecclesiastical parish of Ancaster and Wilsford, in the Deanery of Loveden, and the Diocese of Lincoln. History At the time of Domesday there were two churches in the vicinity of Ancaster, and, to the east of the site of the present church, a hermit’s chapel dedicated to St Mary.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire 1933, pp. 37, 38 St Martin’s register dates from 1722. In 1859 the nave was re-floored, refitted and repaired, under the direction of Kirk and Parry, and in 1912 the tower was restored. In 1898-99 the church organ and font were moved into the body of the church. In May 1909 the churchyard was closed for burials except for those in family vaults. Architecture St Martin's accommodates 220 seated worshipers. It is built in Ancaster stone, and is of Norman, Early English and Decorated styles. It consists of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, a west-facing tower with spire, and a south porch.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John: The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire pp. 436, 437. Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press. The tower, containing five bells, is ashlar-faced and surmounted by battlements. The spire contains three tiers of lucarnes. The roof parapet contains pinnacles and gargoyles, and the tops of the buttresses, grotesque figures. There are 15th-century clerestory windows within the nave.Cox, J. Charles (1916): Lincolnshire pp. 46\\\\. Methuen & Co. Ltd. The four-bay Norman arcade on the north side of the nave is from c.1160-70. It has circular piers, with arch mouldings that become increasingly more elaborate towards the east. The three- bay south arcade is Early English with Decorated walls. The south aisle has highly decorated Perpendicular battlements with pinnacles, and piers with round arches, indented capitals, and octagonal abaci. Parts of the chancel screen are incorporated into the pews. The font is 12th-century, and the south doorway, with a trefoiled head, is Early English. The tower arch is of Decorated style, and the roof, with attached figures, Perpendicular. The four stained glass windows in the chancel, and two at the west end of the church, were presented by F. W. Affix. Other memorial windows were incorporated in 1880 and 1904 by The Rev’d Pemberton Lloyd MA, vicar from 1895 to 1903, to Lucy Anderson Lloyd, Lucy Penelope Lloyd, Marjorie Stote and Stephen Pemberton MA, BM. Set in the south wall is a late 13th-century window with cusped lights and an encircled quatrefoil. The south aisle windows are of Decorated style. North aisle monuments include that to Elizabeth Long (died 1743), as a tablet incorporating a trumpeting angel, and another, by King of Bath, to John Roe (died 1796), as an obelisk fronted by a standing woman with urn. In the chancel are 19th-century wall plaques to the Allix family of Sudbrook Hall. In the south aisle are 18th-century wall plaques, one, dated 1756, of a pediment and flaming urn. The church's chalice is of c.1770 London manufacture, with its cover c.1569. In the porch are two ecclesiastical effigies, one from the early 14th century, and in the cemetery are several stone coffins.

The bridge falls on the Barabanki-Gonda section of the North Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways. The bridge is about 73 km from Lucknow and stands at periodically changing confluence of two rivers i.e. Sharda River and Ghaghara River. The bridge was built on dry land and then the river was trained under it. The bridge was completed in 1896 and opened on 18 December 1896 with the opening of Jarwal Road - Behramghat section of the Bengal and North Western Railway. The bridge is named after Lord Elgin, Governor-General of India (21 March 1862 – 20 November 1863). Before construction of Elgin Bridge and opening of railways between Gonda and Barabanki most of the trade was done by the river route, once the bridge was constructed the river trade decreased greatly. The bridge is an important point of experiment, research and monitoring for irrigation and flood related activities. There is a flood water level recording and forecasting station at the Elgin Bridge which records rise and fall in the Ghaghra River. Tehsil Ram Sanehi Ghat is threatened as soon as water crosses 347 ft mark at the Elgin Bridge.

The rural village of Delaplane was founded in 1852 around the Piedmont Station of the newly chartered Manassas Gap Railroad (originally to link the Alexandria and Orange Railroad with the line running into the Shenandoah valley at Manassas; still operated by the Norfolk Southern Railroad). The railroad built a station, a warehouse and a store, and a town grew, as with the adjacent stops at Marshall and The Plains. As Delaplane prospered, the previously prosperous town of Paris on the Dumfries-Winchester Road (Virginia Route 17), lagged. The town's name was changed in 1874 to honor its postmaster and owner of the general store, Washington E. Delapane. The historic district today looks much like in 1861, when troops embarked en route to the First Battle of Bull Run, although that conflict (and troop movements of Union and Confederate Forces, including Mosby's Rangers) devastated the area.

LeRoy played chess, loved Shakespeare, was a voracious reader, and dealt with his own situation and deteriorating health with amazing strength and fortitude, even while plied with every possible remedy possible, and dosed with morphine and opium.

After winning twice from five starts as a two-year-old, the colt disappointed on his three-year-old debut before recording a 50/1 upset victory in the Guineas. Although the feat was not officially recognised at the time, Gilles de Retz's success made Helen Johnson Houghton the first woman to train the winner of a British classic. The colt failed to reproduce his best form in three subsequent efforts in 1956 and won once from four attempts as a four-year-old. He was retired to stud where he had little success as a sire of winners. Background Gilles de Retz was a dark-coated bay horse with no white markings bred by his owner, Anthony Samuel at his Eveton Stud. His sire, Royal Charger was a successful sprinter and miler who was trained by Jack Jarvis to win the Queen Anne Stakes and the Ayr Gold Cup in 1946. He made a promising start to his stud career in Ireland and went on to greater success after being exported to the United States in 1953. Gilles de Retz was the first foal of Ma Soeur Anne, a French-bred mare who was a half sister to Bagheera, the winner of the Prix de Diane and the Grand Prix de Paris. During his racing career, Gilles de Retz was officially trained by Charles Jerdein and then by Peter Walwyn at the Woodway stable near Blewbury in Berkshire but the truth was rather different. When Gordon Johnson Houghton died in 1952, the running of the Woodway stable was taken over by his widow Helen Johnson Houghton (the twin sister of the National Hunt trainer Fulke Walwyn). The Jockey Club, however, refused to issue training licences to women until 1966, and Helen Johnson Houghton was obliged to use a series of male assistants to hold the licence, while she continued to train the horses. Mrs Johnson Houghton's achievements were belatedly recognised by the Jockey Club when she was one of the first women to be elected as a member in 1977. Racing career =1955: two-year-old season= Gilles de Retz began his racing career in the spring of 1955 when he finished third in a race at Salisbury Racecourse. He recorded his first success in the Watling Street Plate at Birmingham Racecourse and then moved up in class to win the Errol Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. Gilles de Retz returned to Ascot for the Royal meeting in July and finished second in the Chesham Stakes behind the filly Palariva. The colt was then rested until October when he ended his season by finishing fourth to Buisson Ardent in the Middle Park Stakes. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds, Gilles de Retz was given a weight of 122 pounds, seven pounds below the top-rated colt Buisson Ardent, and eleven pounds behind the filly Star of India. =1956: three-year- old season= Gilles de Retz prepared for the 2000 Guineas by finishing unplaced in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. Johnson Houghton felt that the horse had lacked fitness and altered his training programme: instead of traditional training gallops, in which he always performed lazily, the colt was brought to fitness by trotting up and down the hill between Blewbury village and the Woodway stable. Gilles de Retz was given little chance in the Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course and started at odds of 50/1 in a field of nineteen runners which appeared to be dominated by French and Irish challengers. The race attracted a huge crowd, including Queen Elizabeth II to Newmarket Heath for what was believed to be an unusually open contest. Ridden by Frank Barlow, he raced down the centre of the wide track, overtaking Drum Beat two furlongs from the finish and winning the classic by a length from Chantelsey, with Buisson Ardent in third place. In May, Gilles de Retz was moved up in distance for the Lingfield Derby Trial over one and a half miles. He moved very poorly on the way to the start and finished unplaced with Barlow virtually pulling the horse up in the straight as the race was won by Induna. A veterinary examination determined that the colt's lameness was caused by a \\"slipping stifle\\". Despite his physical problems, Gilles de Retz contested the Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse in June. He started a 28/1 outsider and made no impact, finishing unplaced behind the French-trained Lavandin. Later in the month he returned to the one mile distance for the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, but again ran poorly, finishing last of the six runners on his last appearance of the season. =1957: four-year-old season= In 1957 the licence at Blewbury was passed from Charles Jerdein to Helen Johnson Houghton's twenty-three-year-old cousin, Peter Walwyn. Gilles de Retz began his third season at Sandown Park Racecourse where he contested the Coronation Stakes, a race now known as the Brigadier Gerard Stakes. Ridden by Barlow, the colt won easily at odds of 100/6, showing his best form for the first time in almost a year. He then finished fourth behind the French-trained five-year-old Fric in both the Coronation Cup and the Hardwicke Stakes and ended his career with a defeat in the Midsummer Stakes. Assessment and honours As a three- year-old in 1956, Gilles de Retz was given a rating of 132 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him the equal top-rated three-year-old in Europe alongside the Prix du Jockey Club winner Philius. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris were more sceptical, rating Gilles de Retz an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. Stud record Gilles de Retz made little impact as a stallion in Europe and was exported to Japan in 1964. The best of his offspring was probably Chitose O, whose wins included the Satsuki Sho. Gilles de Retz died in Japan in 1969 at the age of seventeen.

In 1903 Easton moved to Western Finnish coastal town of Jakobstad and three years later to neighboring Kokkola introducing football to both towns. The first football match in Kokkola was played between the crew of a British merchant ship and the local voluntary fire brigade. In 1908 Easton won the first Finnish championship title with Unitas Sports Club. He played and coached the rest of his career for Reipas of Vyborg. Easton was also a talented sprinter. His record on 100 metres run was 10.8 (1910) and on 200 metres 23.4 (1910). Easton's record on 200 metres was 0.2 seconds better than the Finnish record of that time. His unofficial record on 100 metres is said to be 10.4. Easton participated the Finnish Championships in Athletics but was not awarded since he did not hold the Finnish citizenship.

He was known particularly for his pursuit of political corruption in state government. Background Gallinghouse was one of four children of John W. Gallinghouse, a dairy farmer, and the former Leona Sutherland. After high school, he worked for a time in the shipbuilding industry in New Orleans. He graduated from Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond and in 1949-1950 the president of the alumni association. In 1978, Southeastern honored Gallinghouse as \\"Outstanding Alumnus of the Year\\". Political and legal career Gallinghouse was affiliated with the New Orleans law firm of Deutch, Kerrigan & Styles from 1948 until 1961. Governor Jimmie Davis named him president of the Orleans Levee Board, a position he held from 1960 to 1964, and in which capacity he was involved in hurricane flood protection, making hundreds of speeches on the need to be prepared of weather disasters. Gallinghouse served as a municipal judge in Orleans Parish for one year. Originally a Democrat, Gallinghouse entered the race for mayor of New Orleans in 1965, but withdrew to support fellow Democrat Jimmy Fitzmorris, a veteran city council member and later the two-term lieutenant governor of Louisiana. Fitzmorris never became mayor; he lost the Democratic nomination to incumbent Victor Schiro. In 1968, Gallinghouse switched parties to work on the campaign of Republican Richard M. Nixon for the U.S. presidency, even though his state voted that year for George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, who ran as the nominee of the American Independent Party. He headed the group known as United Citizens for Nixon. After the presidential race, Gallinghouse became the state Republican finance chairman, having succeeded Allison Kolb, another Democrat-turned Republican figure.\\"Finance Chairman Named for Louisiana Republicans\\", Minden Press- Herald, January 27, 1969, p. 4 In 1969, Gallinghouse was the general chairman of the Louisiana State Republican Convention, at which U.S. Representative Dan Kuykendall of Tennessee's 9th congressional district (since disbanded) was the featured speaker.\\"Tennessee Congressman to Be Speaker at Republican Meet\\", Minden Press-Herald, February 25, 1969, p. 2 In 1970, President Nixon appointed Gallinghouse as the prosecuting attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., re-appointed him in 1974. He remained on-duty for the first year of the Jimmy Carter administration as well. In a 1977 interview, Gallinghouse explained his conception of the U.S. attorney's office as an activist, not a passive, role: \\"A U.S. attorney can't sit back and wait for somebody to bring in a ready-made case.\\" In 1972, Gallinghouse successfully prosecuted state Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion for perjury. Gremillion was convicted of lying to a federal grand jury about the insolvency of the Louisiana Loan and Thrift Corporation, which paid Gremillion $10,000 in legal fees. The company raised $2.6 million from small investors and lent the money to politicians and companies controlled by organized crime boss Carlos Marcello, and the investors faced heavy losses.Life Magazine (Vol. 68, No. 13), p. 53 Gremillion lashed out at Gallinghouse: \\"He's trying to indict everybody for his own personal benefit.\\" Gallinghouse denied that he had political ambition but said merely, \\"I am after crime.\\" He indicated that he would remain U.S. attorney so long as Nixon desired his services. In that same year, Gallinghouse obtained an indictment for bribery against C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, a former state senator from Alexandria and director of the Louisiana Department of Public Works under Governor John McKeithen, for Downs' role in the Shoup Voting Machine Corporation scandal. Downs benefited from a hung jury, which blocked his conviction. Gallinghouse moved against Lewis Johnson, a New Orleans builder, major contributor to Governor Edwin Edwards, and a former highway department commissioner, and won a conviction for income tax evasion. In 1973, Gallinghouse prosecuted Orleans Parish District Attorney Jim Garrison for bribery involving pinball machines, but Garrison was acquitted. In 1977, in an investigation of vote fraud, Gallinghouse forced the freshman Democratic U.S. Representative Richard Alvin Tonry of Louisiana's 1st congressional district to resign. Twenty-one polling commissioners pleaded guilty to having cast fraudulent votes for Tonry in the 1976 general election against the Republican Bob Livingston. Tonry served six months in the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Alabama, not for vote fraud, but for accepting individual campaign contributions in excess of the $1,000 allowable limit that was in place at the time. Livingston won the special election held in August 1977 to succeed Tonry. Gallinghouse also exposed what became known as the Great Grain Scandal in the mid 1970s, which netted seventy one convictions on fraud charges. Dishonest grain inspectors began asking for modest, undetected kickbacks from the shippers to get grain approved for entry, but as business boomed, some were seeking $5,000 in bribes per ship. Four large grain companies pleaded no contest and paid the maximum fines permitted of $10,000. As a result of these cases, Congress established a new system of grain inspections. Gallinghouse's work in this case brought favorable comments from U.S. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, the Democrat who had lost the 1968 election to Gallinghouse's patron, Richard Nixon. Some of his investigations were stymied after Congress created the new United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, based in Baton Rouge, to reduce the caseload of the Eastern District. The change removed nine parishes, including the large one, East Baton Rouge, from Gallinghouse's jurisdiction. Gallinghouse persuaded the federal district judges to permit him to continue his jurisdiction in those nine parishes on the cases already under investigation. Much of the focus centered on East Baton Rouge Parish. In September 1980, President Carter invoked the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to name Gallinghouse as a special prosecutor to investigate reports that Carter's campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, had formerly used cocaine. In the midst of the race against Ronald W. Reagan, Kraft, who was known in Washington, D.C., for his flamboyant lifestyle, stepped down to avoid attention to his own legal troubles. Gallinghouse cleared Kraft of the allegation. A year earlier, another special prosecutor had similarly cleared Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, of the same charge, but in a non-election year, Jordan had not been compelled to resign. Legacy After his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Gallinghouse returned to private law practice in New Orleans. Gallinghouse's pursuit of corruption in government hurt his own career prospects. The American Bar Association rendered him an \\"unsuitable\\" designation, which may have kept President Ford from naming him to a vacant position as a U.S. District Judge. Ben C. Toledano, a New Orleans Republican figure who ran for mayor in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972 and was a journalist for such publications as National Review, attributed the \\"unsuitable\\" rating from the ABA to the system of \\"anonymous comments\\" from attorneys in the big law firms in the New Orleans area who disliked the investigations that Gallinghouse had conducted. In his later years, Gallinghouse resided in The Woodlands in the Houston metropolitan area, where he died in 2007 at the age of eighty-seven. Services were held on December 1, 2007, at Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home in New Orleans. Gallinghouse, who was Anglican, was survived by his wife, the former Clara Van LeMaire (born c. 1932); two sons, Gerald Joseph Gallinghouse, Jr., M.D., of Austin, Texas, and Van LeMaire Gallinghouse of New Orleans, and five grandchildren, Michael Gallinghouse, Joseph Gallinghouse, Brooks Gallinghouse, Grayson Gallinghouse, and Eugenie Gallinghouse. His obituary does not indicate his cause of death, place of interment, nor his year of retirement from his law practice.

This tall, bronze and granite statue is located near Piłsudski's Square and the Hotel Europejski, at Tokarzewski- Karaszewicz Street. It bears the inscriptions \\"Józef Piłsudski\\" and \\"Marshal of Poland\\". Plans to raise the monument can be traced to 1990, when the president of Warsaw Stanisław Wyganowski endorsed the request of a group campaigning for the creation of a monument to Piłsudski. The monument, cast in the Polish Navy Shipyards, was unveiled on 14 August 1995, on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Warsaw, which was commanded by Piłsudski. The unveiling was attended by the President of Poland, Lech Wałęsa, and Piłsudski's daughter, Jadwiga Piłsudska. The original plans called for the monument to be raised at Na Rozdrożu Square, but were later modified to site it near the Łazienki. This decision was protested by the supporters of the monument, who declared the new location too minor, and the monument was moved to the current location. The current location has been and still is seen as controversial; for example the statue's designer, , expressed his opposition to it in a letter shortly before the monument was unveiled, pointing out that it would cause the monument to be isolated from most ceremonies that take place on the square. Others have specifically criticized the fact that the location of the monument causes Polish soldiers to often face away from it during the guard change ceremony at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, and during the observances for Polish Independence Day, which they regard as disrespectful.

Released as a single in America only,http://www.45cat.com/record/nc696128us the song was written and produced by Harley. Background Following the UK Top 50 entry of Love's a Prima Donna's second single, \\"(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna\\", plans were made for \\"(Love) Compared with You\\" to be released as the third single in the UK. However, EMI Records decided to cancel the release at the last minute. Although the UK release was scrapped, EMI chose to release the song as the album's only single in America. Like the Love's a Prima Donna album, the song was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, sometime between June–September 1976.Love's a Prima Donna - sleeve notes - original vinyl album - EMI Records - ST11596 English violinist Wilfred Gibson, who contributed to choir and orchestral arrangements on the album, scored the string section for the track. Speaking to Melody Maker's Harvey Kubernik in February 1977, Harley spoke of the song, revealing: \\"\\"(Love) Compared with You\\" is the first out-and-out love song I've written. I'd been trying for three years.\\"Some of the fans' poetry puts me to shame - Steve Harley interview by Harvey Kubernik - Melody Maker - February 1977 In 2010, Harley supported the Children in Need charity by auctioning a personal mini-concert at the winning bidder's home, as well as a signed guitar and a lavish dinner. A a German fan won the auction with the bid of $15,000. In December that year, it was revealed that Harley was set to travel to the fan's home to play their requested song, which was \\"(Love) Compared with You\\". Release \\"(Love) Compared with You\\" was released by EMI Records on 7\\" vinyl in America only. The B-side, \\"Too Much Tenderness\\", was written and produced by Harley, and also taken from Love's a Prima Donna. For its release as a single, \\"(Love) Compared with You\\" was cut down by almost a minute. A promotional edition of the single was also released, which placed the A-side on both sides of the vinyl; one in stereo and one in mono. Neither release featured a picture sleeve, but used a generic one instead. Following its original release on the Love's a Prima Donna album, and as a single, the song has also appeared on a number of Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel compilations including 1987's Greatest Hits, 1998's More Than Somewhat – The Very Best of Steve Harley, 1999's The Cream of Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, and 2006's The Cockney Rebel – A Steve Harley Anthology. Promotion The song has been performed live during Harley and the band's concerts over the years.Steve Harley - Love Compared To You - December 13th 2012 - HMV Forum London UK - YouTube As a result, live versions of the song have been recorded and released. A version appeared on the band's 1977 live album Face to Face: A Live Recording, while an acoustic version later appeared on Harley's 1999 album Stripped to the Bare Bones. Critical reception Upon release, Paul Phillips of National RockStar magazine reviewed Love's a Prima Donna and highlighted \\"(Love) Compared with You\\" and \\"Carry Me Again\\" as \\"two tracks which work, not because they are simple songs, but because they are simply presented\\". Geoff Barton of Sounds described the song as \\"balladic\\" and highlighted the \\"lovely line \\"Like a waterfall you tingle me with your love\\"\\". He added: \\"This one comes across extremely well, building into an all- encompassing entity and ending with the tear-jerking lines \\"I love you - I'm in love with you\\" echoing away into the distance\\". American magazine Billboard listed the album under the \\"Pop\\" section of their \\"Recommended LPs\\". The review highlighted the song, along with the title track, as the album's best cuts. In a 1976 issue of the EMI Records Weekly News magazine Music Talk, Rex Anderson compared the song with the title track: \\"\\"(Love) Compared with You\\" is the first real highpoint of the album and possibly one of the best things Steve has written to date. It contrasts with all his other work in that it is romantic and dreamy. It is a love hymn with beautifully gentle acoustic guitar, piano, and strings. Later in the review, Anderson also praised Tony Rivers for his vocal arrangements on the song and title track. In a retrospective review, Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic commented that the song was one of \\"Harley's finest songs\\". He described it as \\"a delicately orchestrated love ballad that manages to be touching and heartfelt without lapsing into sappy sentimentality\\". Guarisco spoke of the song again in a review of the 1987 Greatest Hits compilation, noting it was a \\"delicate, subtly orchestrated tune where Harley drops his yen for surrealistic lyrics to communicate in direct and elegantly romantic terms\\". In 1977, Geoff Barton of Sounds reviewed the Face to Face: A Live Recording album, commenting: \\"\\"(Love) Compared with You\\" follows admirably in the footsteps of \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\", together with the irresistible line \\"Like a waterfall you tingle me with your love\\".\\" New third verse Harley included a new version of the song on his 2020 album Uncovered. This version features a newly-written third verse. Harley revealed to BBC Radio 2's Johnnie Walker: \\"I've sung the song [live] many hundreds of times since 1976 [and] every time I'm thinking 'Why are you repeating [the first] verse? Why didn't you write a third verse? Were you lazy? Were you out of words?' 45 years later and I thought the song deserved an update.\\" Track listing ;7\\" single #\\"(Love) Compared with You (Stereo)\\" - 3:33 #\\"Too Much Tenderness\\" - 4:16 ;7\\" single (American promo) #\\"(Love) Compared with You (Stereo)\\" - 3:33 #\\"(Love) Compared with You (Mono)\\" - 3:33 Personnel ;Cockney Rebel * Steve Harley - vocals, guitar, producer * Jim Cregan - guitar, backing vocals * Duncan Mackay - keyboards * George Ford - bass, backing vocals * Stuart Elliott - drums ;Additional personnel * Lindsay Elliott - percussion * Tony Rivers - backing vocals, backing vocal arrangement * John G.

Built in 1918, the theater has operated in different capacities in its history, showing silent films, German-language films, and various forms of stage performance. In 1999, the Davis was planned to be demolished to build residential condos, but the plans were cancelled in part due to a negative response from the community. It is one of the few operating neighborhood movie theaters in Chicago. Its building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History The Pershing Theater was built in 1918 and was named after First World War General of the Armies, John J. Pershing. It is the only remaining theater of five built in Lincoln Square, and one of the few neighborhood theaters still operating in Chicago. The building was designed by architect Walter W. Ahlschlager, who was also responsible for the design of other famous buildings such as the Uptown Broadway Building in Chicago and the Roxy Theater in New York City. The Pershing opened showing silent films, its first being The Forbidden City and later Pals First. In the 1930s, the Pershing was converted to show talkies at a cost of approximately $10,000 and was renamed the Davis Theater. The Pershing had some involvement in The Case of the Ragged Stranger, an infamous Chicago murder case of the early 1920s. Carl Wanderer and Ruth Johnson, husband and wife, left the theater shortly before Johnson was murdered. Although the murder was initially pinned on a stranger dressed in ragged clothing, an investigation revealed new evidence that suggested that Wanderer was, in fact, guilty of the murder. Wanderer was ultimately convicted and executed. Starting in the 1952, the theater attempted to appeal to the cultural influences in the neighborhood by showing German- language films in addition to American films. The theater eventually transformed to a German film house, even acting as host for the Chicago International Film Festival in 1972 where they opened with Signs of Life. The Davis continued to show German films through the end of the decade. The theater then transitioned to showing a variety of entertainment including puppet shows, second run films, and revivals through the 1970s. In 1979, a plan to revitalize the theater by modernizing it and concentrating on movie revivals was supported by film critic and Chicago resident Gene Siskel, but it was unsuccessful within months. In June 1980, the Davis hosted the Chicago International Film Festival's Dance Film Festival, which featured a week-long showcase of dance-themed films such as Divine Madness and Non-Stop Astaire, the latter of which was a collection of film dance routines featuring Fred Astaire with other notable dancers such as Judy Garland and Ginger Rogers. In January 2016, the theater was closed for renovation and brought back to life in its current state as a historical landmark and community center for cinema and the arts. The architecture firm for the renovation was Kennedy Mann. In 2018, they were awarded the Award for Rehabilitation by Landmarks Illinois. Planned demolition Photo of the Davis Theater sign, facing southeast on Lincoln Avenue In October 1999, the Davis was put up for sale at an asking price of $1.6M with the description, \\"This ornate theater is waiting to be developed into a shopping mall\\". The realtor, Edward Vanek, showed the property to several interested developers who considered turning the complex into condominiums, a mall, or even a theater with food and liquor services. The Davis was eventually sold to developer Jim Jaeger later that year, who was rumored to be planning its demolition and replacement with residential housing. Soon after, a \\"Save the Davis\\" campaign was organized to prevent the theater's demolition, and included a community meeting at the Conrad Sulzer Regional Library, where over 500 people voiced opposition to the demolition of the theater. Participants in the meeting argued that demolishing the building would be a historical loss and expressed frustration that useful small businesses had been lost to the community in order to build more residential units. The campaign was supported by alderman Eugene Schulter, who refused to rezone the property to accommodate the redevelopment plans. The property was bid on in December 1999, and acquired by a non-profit, Davis Theater Preservation Corporation, headed by community resident Mary Edsey. The property was sold to Special Real Estate Services in 2000, and thereafter the theater began to show first run films once again. Present operations The Davis Theater is currently operated as a first run theater, containing four screens. It also occasionally shows second runs of older films. It is owned by the Value Theater Corporation, which specializes in maintaining smaller movie theaters in the United States. It was renovated to replace its film projectors with digital film. The Davis participated in the Chicago International Children's Film Festival in 2008.

The storm brought strong winds and high waves especially around the Wellington Region, and further afield chilling cold temperatures and heavy snow to the South Island. The storm was described by the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) as an extreme event. The maximum 10-minute average, sustained wind reading, recorded at Wellington airport was 101 km/hour, with individual gusts up to 130–140 km/hour at this location. Winds were equivalent to the strength of a category 1 or 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Record wave heights of 15 m peak to trough were recorded by a buoy offshore from Baring Head in the Cook Strait. The highest wind gust was 202 km/hr, at Mt Kaukau, Wellington. Meteorological history On 19 June a surface low pressure just to the northwest of the South Island and at the same time there was a southerly coming in with some cold air at the top of the atmosphere. \\"The whole thing developed as a massive low that started to move across the west of the South Island, then [20 June] it moved across Cook Strait to create a new low just east of Kaikoura... that was the real kick in pants that caused a clockwise circle of wind.\\" -Associate Professor James Renwick at the School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences at Victoria University has researched how polar conditions affect our weather. \\"To get an event like this, which is pretty extreme, we need the westerly wind that normally blows across New Zealand and the southern oceans to slow down and to buckle into a series of big meanders, north-south waves around the hemisphere.\\" The air was so cold over the country, temperatures dropped to −6˚C in Tekapo, because the isobars stretched all the way to down to the edge of the Antarctic sea ice\\". This followed bad weather earlier in the month on 4 June which saw winds up to 120 km/h and torrential rain and flooding across the country. Impacts Damage in Ōwhiro Bay, Wellington due to the storm High winds struck Central New Zealand on the night of 20 June and morning of 21 June. Wind gusts uprooted trees, ripped roofs off houses, smashed windows and flung trampolines into powerlines in Wellington, Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa, closing roads and schools across the lower North Island. The Fire Service received 932 emergency calls for help in the lower North Island in the 12 hours to 6 am 21 June. During the Storm residents were advised to stay indoors and not go out by the City Council. Wellington City Council said they had received many reports of flying debris with multiple reports of trees and powerlines down, along with broken windows and structural damage. In the suburb of Kingston a house lost its roof. Radio New Zealand listeners reported that roofing iron was blowing about on roads in Newtown. Emergency services said they were very busy during the storm. The Northern Police Communications Centre said 90% of the calls it received couldn't be answered by its overloaded central branch based in Wellington. The storm damaged houses, roads and seawalls, as well as closing 150 schools and leaving thousands without power across the country. The storm caused significant damage to the capital's electricity network and resulted in 30,000 homes and businesses without power at its peak. Conditions were so dangerous that some council and power companies stopped their workers from carrying out repairs, until the storm had subsided. Ocean waves measuring from trough to peak were recorded from a buoy about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) out to sea, near Wellington by NIWA. The waves washed away parts of some coastal roads and seawalls, and were the largest recorded near the capital since measurements began in 1995. Localised coastal flooding also occurred in the Wellington suburbs of Island Bay, Seaview and the city of Porirua. In Lower Hutt the local council estimated a cost of $100,000 NZD to remove debris washed up on the Petone foreshore when parts of the wall were smashed by the storm surge. Logs and driftwood lay scattered around Marine Parade to Eastbourne. The childhood holiday home of writer Katherine Mansfield was severely damaged by massive waves at Days Bay where several homes were completely destroyed. Racing at Trentham Racecourse was cancelled following the storm and the start of the Wellington LUX light festival was postponed until 22 June. The Hawkes Bay region saw destructive winds, with a peak gust of 80 km/h recorded at Hawkes Bay Airport on 21 June. Police and council workers spent much of the following weekend cleaning up after the storm, most of which involved uprooted trees and blocked roads. Hawke's Bay Civil Defence manager Trevor Mitchell said the region had got off \\"pretty lightly\\" compared to other parts of the country, though some areas suffered localised surface flooding. The Insurance Council of New Zealand says the storm could be the biggest weather event, insurance-wise, in the lower North Island since the 2004 Manawatu River floods. Measurements placed the storm in the same category as five other major storms recorded in 1961, 1965, 1967, 1974, 1977 and 1985.

Both were based on a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The two episodes originally aired on Cartoon Network on May 2, 2011, and guest starred Ron Perlman as the Lich, and Isabella Acres as young Princess Bubblegum. Perlman's character would become the series' chief antagonist, and would reappear in several fourth and fifth season episodes. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In \\"Mortal Folly\\", Finn and Jake must go on a quest to find the Lich (voiced by Perlman), while the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) pesters them for their blessing to marry Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch). After seemingly defeating the Lich, however, the Ice King accidentally drops Bubblegum into the Lich's well of power. In \\"Mortal Recoil\\", Princess Bubblegum possessed by the spirit of the Lich, and Finn and Jake team up with the Ice King to stop him. In the end, Bubblegum is seriously wounded, and since there is not enough candy bio-mass to fully revive her, she reverts to a 13-year-old. \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\" marked the first time the plot of one Adventure Time episode carried into another. \\"Mortal Folly\\" also introduced the Lich, one of the show's primary antagonists, who had first been proposed in the series' pitch bible. Both episodes aired on the same day, and were supposed to air as the second season finale, but due to a studio mix-up, they were instead aired as the penultimate episode, before \\"Heat Signature\\". Despite this, they are still considered by Ward to function as the season two finale. Both episodes were watched by 1.92 million people, and received largely positive critical attention; many critics enjoyed the way the episode began to set up the series' mythology. Plot =\\"Mortal Folly\\"= While meditating with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum has a premonition involving the Lich, an evil undead sorcerer who was long ago trapped in a block of amber by the legendary hero Billy. Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream, and the three of them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum's palace where the block of amber is hidden; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind-control on them. While examining the amber, a snail is placed under the Lich's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are not paying attention. The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom, leaving a wave of destruction in his path. Finn and Jake, after acquiring the legendary gauntlet of Billy as well as a special pink sweater made by Bubblegum, give chase, but they are consistently interrupted by the Ice King, who keeps trying to get Finn and Jake's blessings to marry Bubblegum. Fed up with their dismissive attitude, the Ice King kidnaps Bubblegum and follows Finn and Jake as the two heroes pursue the Lich. The Lich eventually reaches his lair, an abandoned subway station, and creates a pool of green liquid which he plans to use to regain his strength and destroy the world. Finn, Jake, the Ice King, and Bubblegum follow the Lich into his lair. In the entanglement that follows, Billy's gauntlet is destroyed by the Lich and Finn breaks his jewel. The Lich attempts to exert his mind-control on Finn, but Finn finds himself able to resist it. It is then revealed that the sweater Bubblegum gave to Finn has the power to repel the Lich due to it being imbued with \\"liking someone a lot\\". Finn then takes the sweater and pushes it into the Lich's eye sockets and rips his face apart, destroying him. However, the Ice King accidentally drops Bubblegum into the Lich's evil vat, to the horror of Finn and Jake. =\\"Mortal Recoil\\"= After Princess Bubblegum falls into the Lich's well of power, she is rushed to the Candy Kingdom hospital and saved. However, the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn, but Finn angrily scolds him and tells him to leave the kingdom. Finn and Jake then focus their energy on taking care of Princess Bubblegum, whose behavior seems off. At first, she claims that she needs some rest, but soon she begins acting strangely, such as convulsing in her bed. Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests—which includes weapons-grade plutonium, ammonium, and gasoline among other items—and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song. This, however, back-fires and Princess Bubblegum ignites her bedroom with some sort of dark magic. It is apparent that Bubblegum has been possessed by the spirit of the Lich. Finn returns, and the two discover Bubblegum mixing the ingredients that Finn retrieved in her bathtub and then drinking it. She soon deforms and turns into a grotesque monster; she hurls Finn and Jake through a wall and the two discover the Ice King. He finally tells them that he saw with his \\"wizard eyes\\" the spirit of the Lich descend into Bubblegum after she fell into the well of power. The three make an unlikely alliance, teaming up to beat the Lich-possessed Bubblegum. While Finn distracts her, the Ice King uses his ice powers to freeze Bubblegum. Their moment of success, however, is cut short when the still-frozen Bubblegum tips over and shatters everywhere. Her body parts are again rushed to the hospital where she is reassembled. However, there are not enough pieces to complete her, and so she ends up reverting to a 13-year-old girl. Finn, who is also 13, is excited, but the Ice King temporarily gives up his pursuit of Bubblegum due to her age. As the episode ends, it is revealed that the Lich has once again possessed the body of the snail, who angrily waves goodbye to the camera. Production \\"Mortal Folly\\" introduced The Lich—the series' primary antagonist—who is voiced by Ron Perlman Both \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\" were directed by Larry Leichliter, with Pat McHale and Sanchez serving as creative co-directors and Nick Jennings serving as art director. \\"Mortal Folly\\" was storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto, whereas \\"Mortal Recoil\\" was storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez. Both were episodes based on a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\" feature the first substantial appearance of the Lich, the series' primary antagonist, who made an early appearance in the season one episode \\"His Hero\\" being defeated by Billy in a flashback. The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series' pitch bible, which Ward himself had created in 2007. Ward's original drawing was re-designed by former creative director McHale; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried-up look, and was instrumental in crafting the Lich's rotting appearance. In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears, the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman. In the original outline for \\"Mortal Folly\\", the Lich had several lines that played him off as a stereotypical villain. Sugar and Muto decided to make him into a more \\"scary and dangerous\\" character, and purposely played up the darker elements of the episode. The scene featuring Finn stuffing the sweater into the Lich's eye sockets and then ripping his skull apart was inspired by an artistic design idea Sugar had had when she was in high school; she had wanted to draw a comic featuring a small person getting into a fight and being pushed up to the ceiling. In the initial storyboard, the Lich's lair was not specifically designed to be a subway. This was added later by the background designers. The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be \\"specific undead from [Dungeons & Dragons]\\". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble \\"east coast commuters [all] bundled up for winter.\\" He strove to make them look like people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a \\"goofy hat\\", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card. The snail, an easter egg that appears in every episode, appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part. Originally, the snail was inspired by the in-jokes in episodes of The Simpsons, and was Ward's attempt to \\"make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time, where you could freeze-frame and find things in the background\\", such as the snail. However, in \\"Mortal Folly\\", the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich's escape. The snail would also play an important part in other mythology-heavy episodes like \\"In Your Footsteps\\", and \\"The Lich\\". Osborne later noted that the snail's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before. Because a large amount of the action in \\"Mortal Recoil\\" takes place in Bubblegum's bedroom, Moynihan was worried that the scenes would not carry interest and \\"people would get bored\\". As such, Moynihan and Sanchez created the scenes \\"trying to be simultaneously funny and terrifying\\". Ward noted that he liked to be \\"laughing and freaked out\\", and that the scenes work in this manner. Former storyboard artist Adam Muto commented that the possession scenes turned out \\"nice and off-putting\\". Jones-Quartey called the shot of a possessed Princess Bubblegum melting \\"terrifying\\". Although the series tries to avoid \\"cartoon physics\\", Sanchez and Moynihan were forced to work around this during the scene when Bubblegum throws Finn and Jake through a wall without harming them. Moynihan later rationalized that the wall was made of candy, and thus was harmless. The end of \\"Mortal Recoil\\" introduced the plot thread of Bubblegum de-aging to a 13-year-old girl. This would be expanded upon and eventually resolved in the third season episode \\"Too Young\\". The younger version of Bubblegum was voiced by Isabella Acres, who would reprise her role in \\"Too Young\\". According to Moynihan, there were initially \\"rumors\\" to keep Bubblegum young for several episodes, but the character eventually reverted to normal after only two episodes. Reception \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on May 2, 2011. Both episodes were viewed by 1.92 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1.3/2 percent. This means it was seen by 1.3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episodes first saw physical release as part of the 2012 Adventure Time: Jake vs. Me-Mow DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete second season DVD in June 2013. The season was originally supposed to end with \\"Mortal Folly\\"/\\"Mortal Recoil\\", but due to a scheduling conflict, \\"Heat Signature\\" was the last episode of the second season aired. Despite this, Ward still considers the two-parter to be the real season finale, and the two entries are the last episodes featured on the second season DVD release. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk praised both \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\", noting that, despite the fact that the episodes represented only \\"the beginning of the show's journey into direct serialization\\", the story-arc was nonetheless \\"a tantalizing taste of what's to come.\\" Wired magazine noted it as one of the stand-outs from the Jake vs. Me-Mow DVD, calling it a \\"three-part suite\\", which concluded with the third season episode \\"Too Young\\". The review enjoyed the way the episode set the stage for the apparent death, resurrection, and de-aging for Princess Bubblegum, which became a major plot point in the next season. Matt Fowler of IGN praised both \\"Mortal Folly\\" and \\"Mortal Recoil\\", specifically giving applause to the introduction of the Lich, noting that he is \\"a real, grotesque villain inserted into the merely semi-dark world of Adventure Time\\". Fowler ended up being very happy with the two episodes, writing that they end the season \\"strong\\". Use in other media \\"Mortal Folly\\" was later adapted as part of a Level Pack for the 2015 video game Lego Dimensions.

Design and development The design of the CAC-100 originated from the General Aircraft Corporation GAC-100, designed in the late 1960s. The GAC-100 design was enlarged and new technologies incorporated to produce the CAC-100. The proposed production aircraft featured an extended span wing with leading edge slats removed to reduce structural complexity, weight and cost. Other changes under consideration at the time of initial production were direction of undercarriage retraction and retention of the variable incidence tailplane. The CAC-100 was designed as a low wing monoplane with four turboprop engines mounted on the leading edges of the wings. The all-metal fail-safe semi-monocoque tubular fuselage was to have been pressurized and to accommodate a flight crew of two, 50–60 passengers, a single stewardess, a coat compartment, galley and toilet, as well as a pressurized baggage compartment aft of the main cabin. The mainplanes were constructed as two-spar fail-safe structures from 2024-T4 light alloy supporting the engines, ailerons and hydraulically actuated single slotted flaps. Pneumatic de-icing boots on the fin and rudder leading edges ensured ice free operation. The conventional tail unit incorporated a variable incidence tailplane with rudder and elevators all with trim tabs and servo tabs. Hydraulically actuated ailerons operated in conjunction with upper surface spoilers inboard of the ailerons and forward of the outer flap segment. All powered controls were also to be provided with manual cable- operated backups. The tricycle landing gear consisted of hydraulically retracting nose and main gears with twin wheels and brakes on the mainwheels, with the nose gear retracting into the nose of the aircraft and the main legs retracting into extended inboard engine nacelles. Power was to be supplied by four Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65R turboprop engines driving five-bladed Hartzell Propeller constant speed reversible propellers. Production facilities were constructed at Youngstown Municipal Airport in Youngstown, Ohio but the project was shelved in 1983 before its first flight.

Biography Mike Stone was born in Makawao, Maui, Hawaii. Stone's first introduction to the martial arts was in Aikido while as a student Lahainaluna High School. After graduating Stone enlisted in the US Army in 1962. Stone began studying Shorin-ryu Karate earning his black belt in only six months under Herbert Peters while stationed at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas.

In February 1972 Priscilla walked out on Elvis and moved in with Stone with whom she had been having a long affair. Stone had a young child and a pregnant wife. Stone had been working as a bodyguard for record producer Phil Spector. After the show, Elvis invited Stone back to the couple's penthouse suite where Elvis suggested that Priscilla train with Stone. Three weeks later Priscilla made the 45-minute drive to Stone's school in Huntington Beach. Because of the distance Priscilla opted to train with Chuck Norris who had a school in West Los Angeles, which was closer to the Presley home. Stone would make occasional trips to Norris's school to train Priscilla. The relationship soon turned romantic, contributing to Elvis and Priscilla's split in February 1972 and divorce in 1973. Stone and Priscilla would eventually split up because he sold a story to the Globe tabloid entitled \\"How I Stole Elvis Presley's Wife From Him\\". Priscilla said she split with Stone then, \\"because he went to the press\\". Karate career highlights In 1963, Stone won the Southwest Karate Championship in the black belt division.

Today, Assured Life Association is not affiliated with either organization. Aside from offering insurance benefits the organization is a non-profit Life Insurer organized to give back revenues to its member customers through direct benefits such as college scholarships and summer camp grants for youth and through discounts on other products and services. The Society also has a member-directed matching charitable giving program. Four national community service projects are promoted among Society member customers each year.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 pp.264-5  History  The Modern Woodmen had been formed in 1883 by Joseph Root, but by 1890 the group was rent by factional disputes. Out of this conflict emerged two new organizations, the Woodmen of the World based in Omaha, Nebraska and a \\"neighbor\\" organization Pacific Jurisdiction of the Woodmen of the World which originally included California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Montana and Wyoming. Colorado later joined when the majority of the members of the MWA there voted to join the new group. The group was incorporated under Colorado law on January 20, 1891 and its first headquarters was at the McPhee Building in Denver.Barrett, Jr., Arthur J. Woodmen of the World Assured Life Association; a brief and condensed history covering the years 1890-1990 pp.[3-5] The Jurisdiction remained as an affiliate to the Omaha-based Woodmen until 1916. It set its own rates, collected its own assessments. The only connections with the Omaha group were the names and rituals, for the privilege of using which the Jurisdiction paid a 5 cent per member assessment to the Omaha Woodmen after Jan. 1, 1893. At the 12th Regular Meeting of the Head Camp Session in July 1916 the Denver-based group decided to amend its articles of incorporation to drop the \\"Pacific Jurisdiction\\" part of its name and adopted resolutions severing ties to the Omaha group and adopted its own rituals.Barrett pp.5-6 On January 1, 2015, the Society changed its name to Assured Life Association, dropping all use of the name Woodmen of the World. = Mergers and expansion = In the 1960s the Woodmen entered into agreements with or absorbed a number of smaller insurance agencies. This process began in 1960 when they launched a partnership with the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company to offer discounted sickness, hospitalization and accident premiums to its members than if they had purchased the insurance directly. On December 1, 1962 the Woodmen absorbed the Christian Mutual Benevolent Association. This necessitated a change of name from the Denver group, as they were not licensed to sell insurance where the merged group was active and was prohibited from entering the state under its original name, prompting the first usage of the name Assured Life Association for those areas. This began a trend of expansion for the group, as they had previously been limited to the above-mentioned nine Pacific Western states. In 1965 the organization was granted a license to operate in Oklahoma and by 1990 it was active in 24 states - California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana under its original name and Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida as the Assured Life Association.Barrett pp.9-11,15 Today, Assured Life Association is licensed to do business in 37 states. Other groups that have merged into Assured Life Association have included the Pike's Peak Mutual Benefit Association, which joined on December 30, 1965,Barrett p.11 Supreme Camp of American Woodmen in April 1994 and the Danish Brotherhood in America in August 1995.brotherhood in america.pdf Danish Brotherhood in America Sharing their Heritage and their Dream = Supreme Camp of American Woodmen = The Supreme Camp of American Woodmen was founded as another version of the Woodmen order in 1901. By 1910, its leadership was \\"taken over by black men\\" and became the de facto African American version of the Woodmen of the World. The Supreme Camp kept much the same rituals and terminology of the other Woodmen groups. Local units were called \\"Camps\\", with \\"Subordinate Camps\\" and the Supreme Camp at the national level. By the 1950s the organization had 50,000 \\"Neighbors\\", as members of the group were called. In 1970 the Supreme Camp entered into an agreement with the Denver-based Woodmen of the World, with the latter agreeing to provide \\"benefit and certificate administration services\\". This arrangement continued for a while until a change in the Denver Woodmen's computer service made it too expensive for the Supreme Camp to use its services. The Supreme Camp was in difficult financial straits, being asked to vacate its headquarters office space in Denver. Working with the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, it merged with the Woodmen on April 21, 1994.History of AMERICAN WOODMEN - THE SUPREME CAMP OF THE AMERICAN WOODMEN (AWSC)  Organization  Local lodges of the Woodmen were called \\"Camps\\" and the national structure is called the \\"Head Camp\\".

It lies on the east side of Middleton between the town centre and its border with Chadderton in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. Tonge was formerly a township in its own right, until the area was incorporated into the Municipal Borough of Middleton as part of local government reforms in the late 19th century. Its area includes localities such as Moorclose and part of the districts of Mills Hill and Middleton Junction. Tonge Hall was the manor house for the township. The place-name of Tonge, although no longer widely used in the area, stills survives in the district in names of several streets and a long standing sports club, Tonge Social & Bowling club, established in 1923. Mills Hill railway station is located in this district. Middleton Technology School lies within this district. History This township occupied, as its name implies, a tongue of land between the River Irk on the north and its affluent, the Wince Brook, on the south. The area is 392 acres. The surface is mostly above the 300 ft.level—360 ft. is reached at Mills Hill. The township has long been a suburb of Middleton, to which borough it was added for local government purposes in 1861. In 1894 Tonge lost its status as a township or civil parish, and became completely merged with Middleton. Tonge Church (St Michael's) was founded in 1839. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company's line from Manchester to Rochdale passes through the eastern side - (See Caldervale Line). A branch to Middleton opened in 1857, the line closing in the mid 1960s. From this the part of Tonge called Middleton Junction takes its name, though the junction itself is in Chadderton. The former Middleton Railway Station was in Tonge. Landmarks St Michael's, aka Tonge Church British Vita factory, Oldham Road St Michael's Church, Middleton has been a church at Townley Street since 1839. It was built to serve a new population created by the Industrial Revolution. During the 19th century changes occurred, including the coming of the railways and the growth of work in the area. The local community grew in numbers. By the end of the century it became clear that the church building was too small. The church was pulled down and a bigger building erected – its foundation stone was laid in 1901. In 1926, a daughter church was built on Kenyon Lane and called Holy Innocents’ Church. This was to serve the people of Tonge and remained open until 1978, when its congregation joined with those at St Michael’s. There have been a number of changes to the existing building since the beginning of the 20th century – the nave was built in 1912, the tower was added in 1926 and the Holy Innocents’ Chapel and Memorial area were completed in 1981. Sports Tonge AFC were an Association football club formed in 1887 and has it origins at St Michael's School. They originally played on a field behind the Old Cock Inn, Oldham Road but by 1890 the club had moved to a ground near Tonge Hall. The pitch was set in a natural bowl which was partially terraced to accommodate spectators. The club joined the Manchester Football League in 1896 and were an immediate success, winning the League championship in four of their first five league campaigns, finishing in second place to Newton Heath Athletic in their third season. The club also won five League Cups. The team could not sustain this level of success however, and in 1911 resigned from the league after finishing in bottom place. The club continued at a lower level until finally disbanding in 1923. A housing development, Tonge Meadow, now occupies the site of the football ground.Middleton in Retrospect, Morris Garratt, John Cole, References External links *The parish of Prestwich with Oldham: Tonge *Tonge Township Boundaries *St Michael's Church (Middleton) Tonge-cum-Alkrington Category:Areas of Greater Manchester Category:Middleton, Greater Manchester ","title":"Tonge, Middleton"},{"id":"39811653","text":"Barak Feldman Barak Feldman (Hebrew: ברק פלדמן, born July 27, 1972) is an Israeli songwriter, known especially for his collaboration with Yoni Bloch and Efrat Gosh.Barak Feldman's songs in Shironet Biography Barak Feldman grew up in Omer.

Its catchment area is .  Geography  The Abasha river begins at the confluence of the mountain streams Rachkhitskali and Toba, near the village of Baldi, at above sea level, and meets the Tekhuri River as its left tributary. The Abasha forms a narrow canyon near the village of Gachedili (Gochkadili), where the Abasha hydroelectric power station was built in 1928. In July 2010, the Ilia State University expedition discovered footprints of the herbivorous dinosaurs as well as ammonites, brachiopods, and sea urchins dating from the Late Cretaceous (100.5–65.5 Ma). In October 2010, the Gachedili canyon was made a protected area by the government of Georgia.  Etymology and history  The legendary etymology of the hydronym \\"Abasha\\" is found in the 11th- century History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali, part of the Georgian Chronicles, which, relating the story of the Arab invasion of 735, claims that the flooding river afflicted the \\"Abash\\" contingent of the invading army, being subsequently named Abasha after this event. Modern scholars see the hydronym as a compound of the male given name Aba and the adjectival suffix -shi or, alternatively, the Persian-derived word, ab (آب, \\"water\\") plus the diminutive -cha. The Abasha traversed one of the principal districts of historical western Georgia. The important medieval church establishment of Chqondidi was located in the Abasha valley. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a southeastern district of the Principality of Mingrelia was sometimes referred to as Abasha after the river.

Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail opined that the film had been programmed by TIFF solely \\"to remind viewers how bad Canadian movies once were\\", and concluded that \\"you can escape the theatre, but you can't collect on the debt Seductio owes you for wasted time\\". John Harkness of Now wrote that publicist Daphna Kastner deserved an award for having to promote the film, and felt personally compelled to ask festival programmer Kay Armatage why the festival even programmed Chbib's films at all.John Harkness, \\"Cinematic slim pickings dim 1987 festival fervour\\".

It is a right bank tributary of the Pennar river.  Etymology  Pāpāgni is a compound of the words pāpa (meaning sin) and agni (meaning fire). According to legend a king who once killed an innocent tribal chieftain of the Chenchus, who live in this region, was afflicted by leprosy as punishment for his sin. He was supposedly cured of the affliction only after he undertook penance in the Papagni valley and took a dip in the river upon which the river is said to have turned his sins to ashes thus acquiring for itself the name Pāpāgni.  Course  The Papagni originates in the Nandi Hills of Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka. It is a non-perennial river that is rainfed with its basin receiving 60–80 cm of rainfall annually. It traverses through a region of granitic deposits and red soil that is frequently affected by soil erosion. It drains the districts of Kolar in Karnataka and the districts of Chittoor, Anantapur and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh. The basin covers an area of 8,250 km2. and drains 30 mandals of which 21 lie in the Rayalseema region of Andhra Pradesh. It joins the Pennar near Kamalapuram in Andhra Pradesh.  Land use pattern  Although flowing through a largely semi-arid region, wet cultivation including that of paddy and wheat are undertaken along the Papagni's banks. Black, loamy and red soils are found in the river basin area. 60% of the river basin comprises cultivated, fallow and culturable wastelands while another 15% is under forests. The forests here are mostly dry deciduous forests, thorn forests and scrub. The yellow-throated bulbul, starred tortoise, red sand boa and the Kolar leaf-nosed bat are among the major threatened species of fauna found here.  Environmental issues  The river has faced serious damage in recent years due to various human activities. Unregulated and excessive sand mining in the riverbed has led to falling groundwater levels in the river basin, besides damaging civil structures on and near the river and has led to both a deepening of the riverbed and deterioration in the quality of groundwater. Restoration activities under the Foundation for Ecological Security through community participation towards maintenance of check dams, curbing grazing and felling of trees has however led to a revival of the river leading to rising groundwater levels and an increase in tree cover. The success with the Papagni is now being seen as a possible model for the rejuvenation of the Arkavathy river in Karnataka.

With the consecration of the oldest Anglican Church on the east of the Suez Canal in 1680 in the precincts of the Fort, dedicated to St. Mary the Blessed virgin, under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London, came established presence of the non-Roman Catholic Church in Madras. The next 150 years saw the growth of the Christian population in Madras, It became obvious that the St. Mary's Church in the Fort cannot serve the growing and spread-out Christian population. So in 1815 the Church of St. George was built on the arterial road linking St. Thomas Mount and Fort St. George. On 28 October 1835 Daniel Corrie, the Archdeacon of Calcutta, was consecrated Bishop and installed in the Church of St. George, it marked both the coming into being of the Diocese of Madras and the elevation of the parish Church to St. George's Cathedral.

Elections were held after Mayor Sergey Sobyanin had announced his departure on June 4. The elections were the first time in 10 years that citizens of the federal city of Moscow could choose their mayor by a popular vote. Moscow is both a city and separate federal subject, according to the Constitution of Russia.Constitution of the Russian Federation, 65-1 Most of federal subjects are headed by governors or presidents, but the office of the head of Moscow is called Mayor of Moscow, according to the Charter of the city of Moscow.http://constitution.garant.ru/region/ustav_moskv/chapter/1/#block_5 Sergey Sobyanin won with 51.37% of the vote in the first round, with Alexei Navalny receiving 27.24% of the vote, significantly more than previously expected by the polls. Sobyanin was declared the winner after the first round. Voter turnout was 33.23%. The total number of registered voters was 7,176,568.http://www.cikrf.ru/izbiratel/quantity/010713.html Background The position of Mayor of Moscow was elected between 1991 and 2004. In 2004, Vladimir Putin suggested a law to abolish direct elections of governors, the Moscow mayor, and presidents of Russian regions. The law was swiftly adopted by the parliament. The new legislation moved the election system to an indirect one in which parliamentary political parties and the President of Russia nominated a candidate who must then have been approved by the Moscow City Duma. Following the 2011–13 Russian protests which followed the 2011 parliamentary election, President Dmitry Medvedev offered to re-introduce the direct elections of the governors and the mayor of Moscow, and corresponding legislation was approved by the Parliament. On June 5, 2013, the incumbent mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, who was nominated as mayor in 2010, announced his resignation from the post. Russian law allows the mayor to resign and run again for the same office if the president gives his approval. A short time later, Sobyanin confirmed his intention to stand for election. Regulations A candidate to the office must be citizen of the Russian Federation over the age of 30. Self-nomination of candidates for the post of Mayor of Moscow, and the collection of signatures of 1% of Moscow voters (about 73 000 signatureshttp://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2013/07/01/n_3009401.shtmlhttp://ria.ru/politics/20130701/946817829.htmlhttp://lenta.ru/news/2013/07/09/registr) in support of the nomination shall be made within 30 days of the official publication of the decision to call the election. Or alternatively these signatures are not needed for candidates from registered political party. Each of the political parties (electoral blocks were cancelled in the early 2000s) can nominate only one candidate for the post of mayor. In this case, the candidate can not give consent to be nominated from several polling organizations. The candidate nominated by self-nomination cannot give consent to be nominated in the same election by an electoral association. A candidate for mayor of Moscow may have up to 100 \\"trusted representatives\\". The maximum amount of a candidate's election fund shall not exceed 200 million rubles. In the second round of this amount may be increased by 10 percent. =Municipal filter= Ballot of the election All registered candidates are required to pass so called municipal filter introduced be a federal law of 2012: all candidates are required to receive support from at least 6% of elected municipal deputies or heads of municipalities. Those supporting municipal deputies should represent no less than 75% of the federal subject's municipalities. One deputy can only support one candidate. For Moscow 2013 elections it means that every candidate should provide signatures of at least 110 elected municipal deputies representing 75% of all Moscow municipalities. Since most municipalities are controlled by the United Russia party the municipal filter is especially hard to pass for the opposition candidates. =Criteria for election= To be elected a candidate must get more than 50% of votes. If no one achieves 50%, a runoff is to be held in 14 days. Only the two most successful candidates from the first round participate in the second round.

He served as aide to Henri de Tonti, as commandant at Fort Saint-Louis and Chécagou, and as a captain in the colonial regular troops from 1687 to 1729. He was also Commander of the Illinois Country.  Biography  Pierre De Liette was born probably in Gaeta (southern Italy) with the name Piero Carlo Di Lietto, around 1672. He moved to New France around 1685 and lived in Quebec for some time. There he changed his name in a more adapted French version: De Liette or Desliette. Di Lietto served 15 years under Henri de Tonti (who was his cousin), which began with his arrival at Fort Saint-Louis at Le Rocher (Starved Rock) in 1687. Initially the young De Liette lived with the Illinois and Miami tribes hunting, trading and learning their language and customs. After three years, satisfied with the progress of his cousin, Tonti entrusted him with the command of Fort Saint-Louis. Later he appointed him to supervise the resettlement of the Illinois. During the French and Indian Wars, the French used the Fort Saint Louis as a refuge against attacks by Iroquois, who were allied with the British. But in 1692, the fort was evacuated after being attacked by the Iroqouis. The Illinois village and the garrison were moved to a new location at Fort Pimitoui (now Peoria). De Liette then served as interim commandant at Fort Chécagou, where Tonti maintained a warehouse (and also at Fort Pimiteoui until 1702). Indeed the Fort Chécagou (or Fort Chicago) was built in 1685 by Henri de Tonti and later Pierre-Charles de Liette was the main commander of the fort through 1702, probably creating the first civil settlements in the area of what is now Chicago. Fort de Chartres, commanded by De Liette in 1725 From 1702 until 1711 De Liette remained the only representative of the French government among the Indians in the area, mainly because of his knowledge of their language. He was in charge of mediation between the Miami and Illinois tribes and was successful even with countering the English trade ventures in the area. De Liette fought bravely the Fox tribe and in 1725 was named Commandant of the \\"Illinois country\\" while in charge of the Fort de Chartres. Pierre-Charles de Liette died in May 1729,Lives of Fort De Chartres: Pierre-Charles Desliette; p.53 after having spent most of his adult life in the West. He explored the Mississippi valley in detail, while in close contact with the Illinois tribe (of which he described the social patterns in some documentsKaskaskia Social Network: Kinship and Assimilation in the French-Illinois Borderlands, 1695–1735 (by Robert Michael Morrissey)).

It was aired on May 22, 2013. The episode was written by Steven Levitan & Jeffrey Richman and it was directed by Steven Levitan. Plot Phil's (Ty Burrell) mother passes away and the whole family flies to Florida for the funeral. When they get there, Jay (Ed O'Neill) runs into a woman who he is sure he knows from somewhere. While talking to her he remembers that he lost his virginity to her when he was 18 but she has trouble remembering him. Jay tries everything to make her remember but it is not easy since it is revealed that many boys lost their virginity to her back then. An arrest warrant is pending in Florida for Gloria (Sofia Vergara), because after moving and subletting her room in a house there, her roommate turned their apartment into a brothel. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) agrees to represent her in court, and at Gloria's urging, he ends up negotiating the acquittal of numerous other defendants to the increasing ire of the judge. When he finally comes to represent Gloria, the judge settles the case since she can not stand to hear him anymore. After his success at the court, Mitchell regains confidence in his ability as a criminal attorney and wants to return to the court. Cam (Eric Stonestreet) meets a few residents of the retirement community and when he sees that they have some common interests, he spends time with them, talking about books and playing Mahjong. The women are insatiable gossips, just like Cam, and the stories he overhears are proved valuable later. In the meantime, Phil's mother left gifts with attached notes for Phil and her grandkids, Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould). In Phil's letter she writes about the last thing she would want him to do for her. That last thing is to set up his father, Frank (Fred Willard), with another woman so he will not be alone. Phil does not like the idea at all, but Claire (Julie Bowen) says that he has to honor his mother's wish, especially since it is her last one. Haley's letter was accompanied by a necklace, Luke's by a pocket watch and Alex's by a lighter with a note saying \\"this is a lighter.\\" Alex, who was very close to her grandmother, is hurt by the seemingly shallow gift. Alex asks Frank about the note, and he notices it is in fact a letter which, in the humid environment in Florida, has become stuck together. As the family attends the memorial service for Gracie, the contents of the letter are revealed in a voiceover by Alex, telling the story of how she acquired the lighter when her favorite actor, Paul Newman, left it behind at the diner where she was working as a waitress. Frank, witnessing her pocket the lighter, promises to keep her secret, and the letter ultimately encourages Alex to, occasionally, break the rules, saying, \\"You never know what might happen.\\" Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Goodnight Gracie\\" was watched by 10.01 million; slightly down by 0.02 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Goodnight Gracie\\" received generally positive reviews. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave an A- grade to the episode saying that it was one of the best episodes of the entire run. \\"It was hip to rag on Modern Family when this season started, as is natural for anything so lauded and yet so conventional. Nothing’s changed as this season ends, and too frequently the show strains to fulfill its promise. But when it’s good, as this fleet, funny, and sweet finale shows, there are few comedies on television more satisfying.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with a 5/5 saying that it was perfectly balanced. \\"Humorous and heartwarming. Those are the two words I would use to describe the Modern Family season 4 finale. It was a perfect balance that proved once again why Modern Family has won all of those Emmys.\\" Dalene Rovenstine from Paste Magazine rated the episode with 9.4/10 stating that the season was not the best but it went out with one of the strongest episodes. \\"The season definitely wasn’t the best, but it’s going out until next fall on one of its strongest episodes. A death on a sitcom is hard to do, but with “Goodnight Gracie”, Modern Family achieved the perfect balance lighthearted comedy, touching human emotion and heartwarming family drama.\\" Zach Dionne from Vulture rated the episode with 4/5. Michael Adams of 411mania rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that it was an interesting season finale. \\"In my opinion, a season finale should have a cliff hanger moment, or at least something that will make you come back in September, and Mitchell wanting to quit his job is not it to me. But despite the lack of a cliff hanger, I thought this was a really well done episode. It was very funny, and touching at the same time. [...] When a sitcom writer can mix amazing humor and heartwarming moments together, that's the stamp of a great show.\\" Wyner C from Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying that it was kind of bittersweet one. \\" I felt the emotion and the love – I laughed.

Although she had never competed in any edition of the Olympic Games, Dai held her distinction of being one of the world's top class swimmers in the early 1990s. During her sporting career, she captured more than a dozen medals in breaststroke and individual medley, and also helped the Chinese team demolish a global standard in the medley relay from the FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1994. In 1993, Dai made her first international breakthrough at the first ever FINA Short Course World Championships in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, where she captured a total of five medals, four golds and one silver. Dai also established three world records each in the 100 m breaststroke (1:06.58), 200 m breaststroke (2:21.99), and 400 m individual medley (4:29.00), and teamed with He Cihong, Liu Limin, and Le Jingyi to snatch the first medley relay title in a sterling time of 3:57.73, adding it to a medal tally of ten for the Chinese team in short-course swimming. At the 1994 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Italy, Dai won a total of three medals, two golds and one silver. In her first event, 400 m individual medley, Dai edged out the American duo Allison Wagner and Kristine Quance on the freestyle leg to take home the gold in 4:39.14, despite of her accusations over China's doping scandal. Four days later, in the 100 m breaststroke, Dai earned a silver in 1:09.26, finishing behind Australia's Samantha Riley by 1.57 seconds. She also gave her teammate Yuan Yuan a further reason to celebrate as the Chinese handed a medal lock in the pool with a two–three finish. In the 4 × 100 m medley relay, Dai, along with He Cihong, Liu Limin, and Le Jingyi, established a new world record to claim the gold medal in a sterling time of 4:01.67, slashing 0.87 seconds off the standard set by the U.S. Olympic team from the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. When Japan hosted the Asian Games in Hiroshima by the following month, Dai added five more medals to her career hardware: three golds and two silver. In the 400 m individual medley, Dai lost her defense of capturing the title to her teammate and 1992 Olympic champion Lin Li by over five seconds, ending up only with a silver in 4:40.47. Rebounding from two losses, including 200 m breaststroke, at these Games, Dai continued to build her illustrious career with two gold medals each in the 100 m breaststroke (1:09.87), and in the 200 m individual medley (2:15.42). In the absence of Le Jingyi from the Games, Dai helped her teammates He Cihong, Liu Limin, and newcomer Shan Ying defend their medley relay title in 4:07.69, more than six seconds outside the world record. Dai also sought a second bid to defend three of her titles for the 1995 FINA Short Course World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but she withdrew from the Chinese championships in Chengdu that effectively ended her swimming career. Some reports claimed that she had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and anabolic steroids.

Most of Narayan's novels deal with the lives of the tribal communities of Kerala. He belongs to the Malayarayar tribe and is considered Kerala's first tribal novelist. Early life Narayan who was born in 1940 in Kadayathur, Idukki district, belongs to the tribe called Malayarayar. After completing his schooling from a local government school, he got a job in the postal service. Literary career Narayan started his literary career by writing a few short stories, which were published in periodicals. The writing did not attract the attention of readers but it did attract attention of the negative sort: of his immediate superior. With the publication of his debut novel Kocharethi in 1998, Narayan became Kerala's first tribal novelist. The novel, through the lives of its protagonist Kunjipennu and her childhood love and later husband, Kochuraman, depicts the history, traditions and travails of the Malayarayar tribal community in Kerala in the twentieth century. While Narayan completed the manuscript of the novel in 1988, it was published only ten years later by the DC Books. The novel was critically acclaimed and went on to win the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award. Its English translation as Kocharethi: The Araya Woman by Catherine Thankamma was published by the Oxford University Press in 2011 and won the Economist Crossword Book Award in the Indian language translation category for 2011. Awards and recognitions Kocharethi was given the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in the Novel category for the year 1999. The novel's English translation by Catherine Thankamma won the Economist Crossword Book Award in 2011. Narayan is also a recipient of many other awards including Thoppil Ravi Award and Abu Dhabi Sakthi Award. Kocharethi has run into six editions in Malayalam and has been translated into Hindi as Pahadin and into all the south Indian languages. A French translation of the novel is also in progress.

It won the Crossword Prize for Non-Fiction and was chosen among the Books of the Year by The Economist and The New Yorker. Plot The book is a depiction of the author's rather personal tale of his life in the militant 1990's of Kashmir. Despite his family’s pleas, the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front insurgents attack an Indian convoy close to their village. The army’s reprisals are expected to be swift and the family quickly grab their possessions and leave. In the end they return home to find only a few bullets stuck in the walls, which Peer’s grandfather pulls out with pliers. A few years later Peer’s father survives a militant attack on him, justified by the fact that he is a civil servant in a government seen to be run by Delhi. He was, according to rumour, betrayed by a jealous rival at work. After becoming a journalist for an Indian newspaper, Peer reports on other wars far away from home but is inevitably drawn back to Kashmir. The second half of his book records his interviews with the victims of the army occupation. Another sinister development is the increasing prominence in the conflict of Pakistani-funded militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which carry out suicide attacks in Kashmir, India and even in Pakistan itself against Sufi and Shia mosques. These groups also often have links with the Taliban. The book ends in April 2005, with the hopeful resumption of a bus route between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, the capitals of the Indian- and Pakistani-administered regions of Kashmir. But five years on, despite occasional gestures from both the governments, freedom is still a distant prospect for the people of Kashmir. Reviews The book was well received. The New York Times described it as \\"an instructive primer on the conflict mixed with literary reportage on its human toll\\". and praised in the Guardian by Kamila Shamsie for the way it brought the conflict \\"into the lives of Kashmiris\\". The noted historian William Dalrymple, writing in The Guardian said an extraordinary book, a minor masterpiece of autobiography and reportage and called it a \\"classic account\\" of the conflict.

It took place on 14 June 1648 between Imperial and Hessian troops. Several sources cite the Julian date of 4 June.  Background  The Hessians under General Johann von Geyso were stationed in Neuss as an occupying power. To the south, on the territory of the Electorate of Cologne, were Imperial Troops under Field Marshal Guillaume de Lamboy. The Duchy of Jülich-Berg was neutral. As Hessian troops marched towards Grevenbroich, which belonged to Jülich, Duke Wolfgang William feared that an occupation of Grevenbroich by the Hessians would be seen by the Imperial side as an opportunity to declare the neutrality of Jülich-Berg as null and void. He therefore asked von Geyso for an undertaking that Grevenbroich would be spared. As a result, the Hessians did not occupy Grevenbroich and encamped near Wevelinghoven, in order to fall back to Neuss.  The battle  Lamboy advanced with 7,000 men and positioned himself on 13 June in front of the Hessian encampment. However, the Hessians did not engage in battle, but pulled back to a pre-prepared site between Grevenbroich and Wevelinghoven, in order to cross the River Erft there and make for Neuss. The Imperialists pursued them in order to cut off their withdrawal and isolate them from their supply lines. This plan was anticipated by von Geyso, however, and he waited for the Imperial troops in battle formation. Around 5 am on 14 June, the two armies clashed. In spite of outnumbering the Hessians almost 2 to 1, the Imperial Army had to retreat after five hours of fighting. 1,500 of their men were captured and 1,000 lost their lives. Hessian losses were given as 163. Six cannon were also captured.  Aftermath  The defeat of the Imperial Army led Ferdinand III to make further concessions in the peace negotiations that had been running for some time in Münster and Osnabrück. These were finally incorporated into the Peace of Westphalia.

Publications David G. Benner has authored or edited more than thirty books. Early titles focused on the role of spirituality in clinical practice and were primarily written for psychologists and other mental health professionals. His middle-phase books were written from an explicitly Christian perspective and focused on living the spiritual journey in a deeply human way and the human journey in a deeply spiritual way. Later books have been written for a more general audience and have continued to focus on the role of spirituality in human spiritual development while still drawing on science, philosophy and the perennial wisdom tradition for insights that are helpful in understanding spiritual awakening and transformation. These big themes of awakening, becoming fully human, and the possibilities of deep personal transformation have been at the core of all his books.

It was built between 1803 and 1805 for Joséphine de Beauharnais, owner of the neighboring Château de Malmaison. It was a reception pavilion adjacent to a large greenhouse, since destroyed. History The large greenhouse of Malmaison was begun in 1804 for the Empress Josephine by the landscape architect Jean-Marie Morel (1728 - 1810) and completed by the end of 1805 according to plans by Jean-Thomas Thibault (1757-1826) and his partner Barthélemy Vignon (1762-1846). It was the first time in France that glass was used for such a large surface. The greenhouse of Malmaison can be considered the forerunner of the great glass and metal architecture of the 19th century. It was about and was divided into two distinct sections: *The greenhouse itself, heated by twelve large stoves, in which trees high could grow. Josephine cultivated plants like jasmine, rose, hydrangea and Parma violet. *Behind and adjacent to it, a building housed a series of salons. A central salon with a rotunda was decorated by Louis-Martin Berthault in 1807, from where it was possible to view rare plants while resting after visiting the greenhouse. The roof was luxuriously decorated and furnished by the best craftsmen of the time such as the marble mason Gilet and the cabinetmaker Jacob Desmalter. The park was designed in the English style, also by Louis-Martin Berthault, named as landscape designer to the Empress Josephine. Due to the expense of maintenance, the greenhouse was demolished in 1827. The rooms were partly redecorated in 1828 by the new owner, the Swedish banker Jonas-Philip Hagerman. After the sale of the estate in lots in 1878, in 1887 the Petite Malmaison became the property of Pascal of the Two Sicilies (1852-1904), Count of Bari, youngest son of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, who lived in his Parisian hotel at 8 avenue Matignon, but died in the Petite Malmaison in 1904 . Description The subdivision of the park separated the Petite Malmaison from the Château de Malmaison. The park, planted with chestnut, cedar, bald cypress, yew and boxwood, is treated as an English park, but the rear has traces of the French style. There is a pond. Protection status First listed in the supplementary inventory of historic monuments on 9 February 1968, the Château de la Petite Malmaison been classified as a historical monument since 26 April 1995. Protection also includes the park.

With iteratees, it is possible to lazily transform how a resource will emit data, for example, by converting each chunk of the input to uppercase as they are retrieved or by limiting the data to only the five first chunks without loading the whole input data into memory. Iteratees are also responsible for opening and closing resources, providing predictable resource management. On each step, an iteratee is presented with one of three possible types of values: the next chunk of data, a value to indicate no data is available, or a value to indicate the iteration process has finished. It may return one of three possible types of values, to indicate to the caller what should be done next: one that means \\"stop\\" (and contains the final return value), one that means \\"continue\\" (and specifies how to continue), and one that means \\"signal an error\\". The latter types of values in effect represent the possible \\"states\\" of an iteratee. An iteratee would typically start in the \\"continue\\" state. Iteratees are used in Haskell and Scala (in the Play Framework and in Scalaz), and are also available for F#. Various slightly different implementations of iteratees exist. For example, in the Play framework, they involve Futures so that asynchronous processing can be performed. Because iteratees are called by other code which feeds them with data, they are an example of inversion of control. However, unlike many other examples of inversion of control such as SAX XML parsing, the iteratee retains a limited amount of control over the process. It cannot reverse back and look at previous data (unless it stores that data internally), but it can stop the process cleanly without throwing an exception (using exceptions as a means of control flow, rather than to signal an exceptional event, is often frowned upon by programmers). Commonly associated abstractions The following abstractions are not strictly speaking necessary to work with iteratees, but they do make it more convenient. =Enumerators= An Enumerator is a convenient abstraction for feeding data into an iteratee from an arbitrary data source. Typically the enumerator will take care of any necessary resource cleanup associated with the data source. Because the enumerator knows exactly when the iteratee has finished reading data, it will do the resource cleanup (such as closing a file) at exactly the right time – neither too early nor too late. However, it can do this without needing to know about, or being co- located to, the implementation of the iteratee – so enumerators and iteratees form an example of separation of concerns. =Enumeratees= An Enumeratee is a convenient abstraction for transforming the output of either an enumerator or iteratee, and feeding that output to an iteratee. For example, a \\"map\\" enumeratee would map a function over each input chunk. Motivations Iteratees were created due to problems with existing purely functional solutions to the problem of making input/output composable yet correct. Lazy I/O in Haskell allowed pure functions to operate on data on disk as if it were in memory, without explicitly doing I/O at all after opening the file - a kind of memory-mapped file feature - but because it was impossible in general (due to the Halting problem) for the runtime to know whether the file or other resource was still needed, excessive numbers of files could be left open unnecessarily, resulting in file descriptor exhaustion at the operating system level. Traditional C-style I/O, on the other hand, was too low-level and required the developer to be concerned with low-level details such as the current position in the file, which hindered composability. Iteratees and enumerators combine the high-level functional programming benefits of lazy I/O, with the ability to control resources and low-level details where necessary afforded by C-style I/O. Examples Uses Iteratees are used in the Play framework to push data out to long-running Comet and WebSocket connections to web browsers. Iteratees may also be used to perform incremental parsing (that is, parsing that does not read all the data into memory at once), for example of JSON. It is important to note, however, that iteratees are a very general abstraction and can be used for arbitrary kinds of sequential information processing (or mixed sequential/random-access processing) - and need not involve any I/O at all. This makes it easy to repurpose an iteratee to work on an in-memory dataset instead of data flowing in from the network. History In a sense, a distant predecessor of the notion of an enumerator pushing data into a chain of one or more iteratees, was the pipeline concept in operating systems. However, unlike a typical pipeline, iteratees are not separate processes (and hence do not have the overhead of IPC) - or even separate threads, although they can perform work in a similar manner to a chain of worker threads sending messages to each other. This means that iteratees are more lightweight than processes or threads - unlike the situations with separate processes or threads, no extra stacks are needed. Iteratees and enumerators were invented by Oleg Kiselyov for use in Haskell. Later, they were introduced into Scalaz (in version 5.0; enumeratees were absent and were introduced in Scalaz 7) and into Play Framework 2.0. Formal semantics Iteratees have been formally modelled as free monads, allowing equational laws to be validated, and employed to optimise programs using iteratees. Alternatives * Iterators may be used instead of iteratees in Scala, but they are imperative, so are not a purely functional solution. * In Haskell, two alternative abstractions known as Conduits and Pipes have been developed. (These Pipes are not operating system level pipes, so like iteratees they do not require the use of system calls). Conduits in particular are associated with substantially richer libraries of primitives and combinators than iteratees; conduit adapters for incremental functionalities such as parsing HTML, XML, generalised parsing, making HTTP requests and processing the responses, exist, making conduits more suitable than iteratees for industrial software development in Haskell, out of the box. * There is also a high-level abstraction named machines. In Scala there is a package called FS2: Functional Streams for Scala, whose ancestry can be traced back to machines via several ports, renames and refactors. * In Haskell, the package safe-lazy-io exists. It provides a simpler solution to some of the same problems, which essentially involves being \\"strict enough\\" to pull all data that is required, or might be required, through a pipeline which takes care of cleaning up the resources on completion.

After the Battle of Hadhramaut and the Siege of Sana'a in 570, the Aksumites were expelled from the Arabian peninsula. They had re-established their power there by 575 or 578, when another Persian army invaded Yemen and re-established the deposed king on his throne as their client. It marked the end of Ethiopian rule in Arabia.  Context  Around 520, Kaleb of Axum had sent an expedition to Yemen against the Jewish Himyarite king Dhu Nuwas, who was persecuting the Christian community there. Dhu Nuwas was deposed and killed and Kaleb appointed a Christian Himyarite, Esimiphaios (\\"Sumuafa Ashawa\\"), as his viceroy. However, around 525 this viceroy was deposed by the Aksumite general Abraha after which the Axumite general declared himself King of the newly formed, independent Himyarite/Axumite Kingdom (not to be mistaken with the Axumite Empire). After Abraha's death, however, his son Masruq ibn Abraha continued the Axumite vice- royalty in Yemen, resuming payment of tribute to Axum and with this ended the Himyarite-Axumite Kingdom and united the Kingdom with the Axumite Empire again. However, his half-brother Ma'd-Karib revolted. After being denied by Justinian, Ma'd-Karib sought help from Khosrow I, the Sasanian Persian Emperor.  Conflict  Khosrau sent his general Vahrez and his son Nawzadh to Yemen at the head of a small expeditionary force of eight hundred cavalrymen of Dailamite origin, in one version men of good birth who had been consigned to prison but were now given a chance to redeem themselves by achieving victory.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abna-term The Persian army, onboard eight ships, sailed around the coasts of the Arabian peninsula; and, although two of the ships were wrecked, the rest landed in Hadramaut. The strength of the Persian expeditionary force is variously given as 3,600, 7,500 (Ibn Qutaiba), or 800 (al-Tabari). A modern estimate is 16,000. The army sailed from the port of Obolla, seized the Bahrain Islands, and headed to Sohar, the capital of Oman (al-Tabari was apparently ignorant of the conquest of Oman). He then captured Dhofar and Hadhramut, before landing at Aden During the invasion, Nawzadh was killed, which made Vahriz furious at Masruq, the Ethiopian ruler of Yemen. Vahriz then met Masruq in battle and killed the latter with an arrow at Battle of Hadhramaut, which made the Ethiopians flee. Fresco of king Khosrau's I war against Masruq Abraha in Yemen He then approached Sana'a, where he is known to have said: \\"My banner shall never enter [a town] lowered! Break down the gateway!\\" After having captured Sana'a, Vahrez restored Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan to his throne as a vassal of the Sasanian Empire. Al-Tabari reports that the main reason behind victory of Vahrez over the Axumites was the use of the panjigan (probably a ballista equipped with heavy darts), a piece of military technology with which the local peoples were utterly unfamiliar. After having conquered Yemen, Vahrez then returned to Persia with a great amount of booty. However, in 575 or 578, the vassal king was killed by the Ethiopians, which forced Vahrez to return to Yemen with a force of 4000 men, and expel the Ethiopians once again. He then made Maʿdī Karib, the son of Sayf, the new king of Yemen. Vahriz was then appointed as governor of Yemen by Khosrau I, which would remain in Sasanian hands until the arrival of Islam. Vahriz was succeeded by his son Marzbān as governor of Yemen.  Aftermath Vahrez made Maʿdī Karib, the son of Sayf, the new king of Yemen.

The horse died following an injury sustained in the 2014 Japan Cup. Background Trading Leather was a dark-coated bay colt with a white star bred by his trainer, Jim Bolger. He was from the second crop of foals sired by the undefeated Teofilo, the European Champion Two-Year-Old of 2006. Like his sire, Trading Leather was trained by Bolger in County Carlow and was ridden in all of his races by Bolger's stable jockey, Kevin Manning. In his first two seasons, he raced in the colours of Jim Bolger's wife, Jackie Bolger. Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Trading Leather ran in the Listed Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Trial Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse on 8 September. He started a 14/1 outsider and finished second to the odds on favourite Battle of Marengo. Two weeks later at Gowran Park, the colt was dropped in class to contest a maiden race and recorded his first victory with a seven-lengthwin from fifteen opponents. Trading Leather was then sent to England for the Group Three Autumn Stakes over the Rowley Mile course on 13 October. He started the 5/2 joint-favourite and won by three- quarters of a length from the Richard Hannon Sr.-trained Montiridge, with the other beaten horses including Eye of the Storm, Glory Awaits, and Galileo Rock. On his final start of the season, the colt started second favourite for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse but after leading for five furlongs, he faded to finish fifth behind Kingsbarns. =2013: three- year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Trading Leather ran his third consecutive race in Britain when he contested the Dante Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in May. He finished second of the eight runners, one and a quarter lengths behind 33/1 outsider Libertarian. Eleven days later, he was dropped back in distance to contest the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh. he led from the start but was overtaken a furlong from the finish and finished third to the Aidan O'Brien-trained Magician. Trading Leather missed the Epsom Derby and was dropped to Listed class for the Silver Stake over ten furlongs at the Curragh. He took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and won by three and a half lengths from UAE Derby winner Lines of Battle. On 29 June, Trading Leather was one of nine colts to contest the 148th running of the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh. He started at odds of 6/1 in a field which included Ruler of the World, Libertarian, and Galileo Rock, the first three finishers in the Epsom Derby. Manning settled the colt behind the leaders before moving up to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish. In the closing stage, he stayed on well under pressure to win by one and three quarter lengths from Galileo Rock. Trading Leather's victory, which came in a fast time of 2:27.17, was a second for Jim Bolger and a first for Manning, who said that the colt \\"gallops and keeps galloping, I was getting there all the way up the straight. This win means everything to me.\\" On 27 July, Trading Leather was sent to the United Kingdom to contest the country's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. Manning tracked the leaders before moving up to contest the lead in the straight. Trading Leather was quickly overtaken by the German colt Novellist but held on to take second place by three quarters of a length from the British colt Hillstar. Trading Leather and Hillstart met again at York Racecourse in August for the International Stakes, which also attracted Al Kazeem, Toronado, and Declaration of War. Manning sent the colt into the lead from the start before accelerating early in the straight. He was overtaken approaching the final furlong but stayed on to finish second, one and a quarter lengths behind Declaration of War. On 7 September, Trading Leather faced Al Kazeem again in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown. Racing on softer ground than he had previously encountered, he led the field until the last quarter mile before finishing third, beaten one and a quarter lengths and two lengths by The Fugue and Al Kazeem. =2014: four-year-old season= Trading Leather on the day of his death, shortly before running in the Japan Cup. Before the start of the 2014 season, Trading Leather was sold to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin Racing but remained in training with Jim Bolger. On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Trading Leather started the 4/6 favourite for the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 3 May. Restrained by Manning in the early stages, he made progress in the last quarter mile without ever looking likely to win and finished third behind Gospel Choir and Pether's Moon. After a break of more than two months, the colt returned in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. Trading Leather raced in third place for most of the race before staying on in the straight to finish second, two lengths behind the winner Mukhadram. Further back in the field were Kingston Hill, The Fugue, War Command, Night of Thunder and Verrazano. On 26 July, he started at odds of 8/1 for Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and finished fifth of the eight runners, eleven lengths behind the winner Taghrooda. Trading Leather was brought back in distance for the Irish Champion Stakes on 13 September. Starting at odds of 20/1, he kept on well in the straight without ever looking likely to win, finishing third behind the three-year-olds The Grey Gatsby and Australia, with Mukhadram and Al Kazeem in fourth and fifth. Trading Leather's final run of the season was in the Japan Cup on 30 November. He went lame half a mile from home and was immediately dismounted by jockey Manning.

The Imperial Army of the Emperor should not be confused with the Army of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsarmee), which could only be deployed with the consent of the Imperial Diet. The Imperialists effectively became a standing army of troops under the Habsburg emperor from the House of Austria, which is why they were also increasingly described in the 18th century as \\"Austrians\\", although its troops were recruited not just from the Archduchy of Austria but from all over the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.  The Empire and the Habsburg monarchy  The Habsburg monarchy supplied almost all the Holy Roman Emperors during the Early Modern Period. Their title of Emperor was one that was bound not so much to a territory, but to a person. In the tradition of the Roman Empire, the Emperor had a status that was recognised in all of Latin Europe. Accordingly, the Imperial Army was a force established by the Emperor, with privileges in the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor was not permitted to raise troops in the electoral states, but had inter alia the right to recruit soldiers in the imperial cities and in all other territories. Independent of the Emperor's ability to raise his own army, the Imperial Diet could establish the Army of the Holy Roman Empire, the \\"troops of the empire\\".  Bavarian period and \\"Austrianisation\\"  An imperial Bavarian flag in 1745. The imperial eagle on a gold field was stitched onto the flag of the Electorate of Bavaria. Musée de l'Armée, Paris, taken in 2010 During the imperial interregnum of 1740-1742, Habsburg troops no longer formed the army for the Emperor, but that of the Queen of Hungary. During the Austrian War of Succession, Queen Maria Theresa and the Austrian House of Habsburg, fought for their survival within the European system of power. She initially lost her battle for the imperial crown for her husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine. With the acquisition of the crown by Charles VII of the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach, units from the Electorate of Bavaria formed the Imperial Army for a short time, from 1742 to 1745. A year after the loss of the imperial crown, the Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary directed her troops to wear green instead of gold for officers' sashes and for the regimental flags. Gold has always been considered an imperial attribute. The Royal Hungarian flag of the Habsburg troops. The imperial eagle was not allowed to be used from 1743. Project Kronoskaf After the imperial election of Maria Theresa's husband, Francis I, the Habsburg troops were given back their imperial status. Although Maria Theresa took the title of empress, she put no value on her coronation as empress. This was reflected in the title of her army, which was now called \\"Roman Imperial-Royal\\" (römisch kaiserlich-königlich). The colloquial, shorter term, \\"Austrian\\", established itself during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) and subsequent conflicts in the War of Bavarian Succession (1778/1779), the Russo-Austrian war against the Turks (1787-1792) and the Napoleonic Wars.c.f.

Prussian and Protestant journalists increasingly lost interest in a universal Reich concept, which, for a long time, had earned the imperial troops their special position. Even Maria Theresa's son, Emperor Joseph II, with his centralizing reforms that promoted an Austrian territorial state, encouraged imperial politics less and less. In 1804, the Austrian imperial crown was introduced. Only two years later, the Austrian emperor laid down his Roman-German Emperor's crown. Until 1871, there was only an Austrian imperial crown in the German nation.  Operations of the Habsburg Imperial Army  During the Early Modern Period, the Imperial Army fought in all the wars affecting the Empire, usually allied with the Army of the Holy Roman Empire and other territorial forces. * Long War (1593–1606) * Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) * Second Northern War (1655-1660) * Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664) * Scanian War (1674–1679) * Nine Years' War (1688–1697) * Great Turkish War (1683–1699) * War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) * Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718 (1714–1718) * War of the Polish Succession (1732–1738) * Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1736–1739)  Growth of the Habsburg Imperial Army  The Thirty Years' War led to an unusually strong arming of the Emperor. In 1635, the Imperial Army reached a peak of 65 regiments of foot, with a nominal strength of 3,000 men each. During the course of the war, 532 regiments were formed and disbanded. In 1648 only 9 regiments of foot, 9 regiments of horse and a regiment of dragoons remained. Gradually, a standing imperial army evolved as a result of the many wars. Of the 49 regiments raised for the Second Northern War, 23 remained in 1660. The 1760s saw 28 new regiments being formed, and the following decade saw a further 27.

The Aksumite army was defeated by the Sassanids and Masruq was killed. The Abyssinian occupation of Yemen continued until about 570, when a Yemeni national reaction was provoked against Masruq ibn Abraha. The leader of this patriotic movement was a scion of the Himyarite royal line, Sayf ibn Dhi- Yazan. He first tried vainly to get help from the Byzantines and Lakhmids, but then began direct negotiations with the Sassanid king Khosrau I. The king was reluctant to intervene in a region so distant from Persia, but in the end agreed to send a force of eight hundred cavalrymen of Dailamite origin, in one version men of good birth who had been consigned to prison but were now given a chance to redeem themselves by achieving victory. The force sailed around the coasts of the Arabian peninsula; and, although two of the eight ships were wrecked, the rest landed in Hadramaut.

It was abolished, together with other reforms of the Constitution, after the Polish defeat in the summer of Polish–Russian War of 1792. Executive power in the reformed Commonwealth government, according to Article V and Article VIIrested in the hands of \\"the king in his council\\", the council being a cabinet of ministers known as the Guardians of the Laws. The ministries could not create or interpret the laws, and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional, subject to parliament (Sejm)'s approval. This council was presided over by the king and comprised the Roman Catholic Primate of Poland (who was also president of the Education Commission) and five ministers appointed by the king: a minister of police, minister of the seal (i.e. of internal affairs – the seal was a traditional attribute of the earlier Chancellor), minister of the seal of foreign affairs, minister belli (of war), and minister of treasury. In addition to the ministers, council members included – without a vote – the Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council was a descendant of similar councils that had functioned over the previous two centuries since King Henry's Articles (1573) and the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the king required the countersignature of the respective minister. The ministers, however, were responsible to Sejm, which could dismiss them by a two-thirds vote of no confidence by the members of both houses. The stipulation that the king, \\"doing nothing of himself, ... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation\\", parallels the British constitutional principle that \\"The King can do no wrong.\\" (In both countries, the respective minister was responsible for the king's acts.) Ministers could be also held accountable by the Sejm court, and Sejm could demand an impeachement trial of a minister with a simple majority vote. The decisions of the royal council were carried out by commissions, including the previously created Commission of National Education, and the new Commissions for Police, the Military and the Treasury, whose members were elected by Sejm.

Rule and his wife started schools building to 400 pupils in Gibraltar. He tried to establish missions in Spain. Life Rule was born in Penryn in Cornwall to John Rule, who was an army surgeon, and Louise, his wife (born Harris). Rule did not get on with his family and left to work as an artist at the age of seventeen. Rule was converted to Methodism at the age of twenty and moved from the career of artist to schoolmaster. He decided he wanted to become a missionary, and he started studying Latin and Greek. In 1825 he was summoned to London to await a missionary position, and early in 1826 he married Mary Ann Dunmill. In March they were sent to Malta to train for a mission in Palestine. However, war broke out and they were redirected to Gibraltar. Rule arrived in Gibraltar in 1832 although he had briefly visited before, where he had made a favourable impression on the church there. Rule was of the belief that he was in charge and that lay volunteers were welcome to assist, but it was Rules's role to make decisions. This led to some friction and resignations, but Rule appears to have been unrepentant. The start of free schools can be assigned to Mary Ann Rule. They had both learnt Spanish, and Mary was asked informally to teach a neighbour's child to read. Her first student was joined by her brother and then other Catholics and then Jewish children. Rule was obliged to get himself involved. Rule noted that he (sic) became unawares the \\"founder of the first charity school in the garrison\\". The Jews eventually withdrew on religious grounds, and Rule was involved when Lieutenant Governor William Houston set up the first official free school on Flat Bastion Road in 1832 and he sent his own children there. The new school was secular although it was led by a committee which included the major religious leaders, but not Rule. The following year Rule announced that he would reform his school and it would not only include religious instruction for girls and boys but students would be required to attend the Methodist church on a Sunday. The school thrived, and he took on assistants, and in 1835 he appointed William Lyon to be master of the school. This allowed him and Lyon to start up another Sunday School targeted at Spanish children. Rule was also interested in the families, and he would survey the population so that he could distribute Bibles translated into Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. He had few refusals. The Catholic population realised that they needed to establish their own school, and in 1835 two Irish Brothers arrived to found the Christian Brothers School. However, progress was slow as the children did not speak English and the new teachers did not speak Spanish. The brothers were overworked and nearly left when they realised that they were not expected to take a holiday. In 1835 Rule journeyed around Spain speaking to like-minded people about distributing the Bible. Amongst others he twice met Félix Torres Amat, who was the Bishop of Astorga who had translated the Bible into Spanish in 1824, but had had difficulty finding money for publication. Rule reported that he found Amat's liberal views interesting, but when he read his works he found that he was expressing much more conservative views. Rule decided that he wanted to create his own translation of the gospels into Spanish. He completed this in 1841, and these were printed together with hymn books, school books and other religious works. Rule's new schools were very popular, particularly with the better off, who wanted to avoid the poor-quality education supplied by public subscription. The whole matter came to a head on the centenary of the Wesleyan Foundation in 1839 when Gibraltarians were surprised to see 400 of Rule's local school children marching down Main Street carrying banners that showed that they were committing to the Methodist approach. It was apparent that Rule was training converts and missionaries. This was the start of the end of his Methodist academies. Photograph from Rule's autobiography Rule came into a disagreement with the governor when a soldier was disciplined for his Methodism, which Rule felt was against standing orders. He appealed directly to London and won a small victory, but the garrison prevented the support he had received from volunteers, and he no longer enjoyed the support he once had. Rule's obsession was Spain, and he concentrated on teaching in Spanish whilst trying to establish missions in Cadiz, Madrid and eventually Algeciras. The latter was done against the specific advice from the Missionary society who funded his work that he should conduct any work over the border. Advocating Protestantism and supplying Bibles was against Spanish law, but Rule seemed to ignore this. Matters came to a head after Rule had been requested to economise and it emerged that he had committed to purchase a property in the south of Gibraltar without prior approval. Moreover, Rule had purchased the property in his own name and had not revealed the full details of the contract. Rule offered his resignation, and it was accepted, with the Missionary Society noting later that he was fortunate to escape so lightly. Rule worked as a Methodist minister at the first Wesleyan chapel in Aldershot and in Plymouth before retiring in 1872. He still visited Gibraltar, but he never travelled outside the UK again in an official capacity. There is a carte de visite from Rule in the collection of Manuel Matamoros and he has been called the founder of Protestantism in Spain. His wife died in February 1872, and it was she who actually started the first charity school. Rule married again in 1873, and he extended his earlier translation of the gospels to include the whole of the New Testament, and this was published by the Missionary Society in 1880. Rule died on 25 September 1890 in Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey.

The church formerly rose on the preexisting church of San Biagio de Mercato, dating at least to the 11th- century. The remains of St Blaise putatively were discovered during the dismantling of Santa Rita.  History  The church was built in 1643 by architect Carlo Fontana in place of a former church, built by the family Bucabella in the 11th century, and rose at the base of the staircase of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, on its left side. It was dedicated to Saint Blaise. Pope Alexander VII entrusted the church to the brotherhood of the Holy Thorn of the Cross of Jesus. It became property of a confraternity of individuals from Cascia, who advocated for the veneration of the then blessed Rita. The codedication to Saint Rita of Cascia, in addition of Saint Blaise, was added only in 1900, the year of her canonization. In 1928, as a consequence of the demolitions in the area to make space to the Via del Mare (now Via del Teatro di Marcello), the church was dismantled piece by piece and deposited with the aim of rebuilding it in the same place. Nonetheless, in 1940 the church was rebuilt in its present location, as remembered by a commemorative stone on the left side of the building. '''' '''' The church is now deconsecrated and used for meetings, conferences and concerts.  Description  The façade is decorated with lesenes and stuccoes. The interior is on the Greek cross plan with a convex rhomboidal map, like the one of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. The apse, deeper than the side chapels, still houses the baroque altar made of polychrome marbles and a stained glass window depicting Saint Rita of Cascia. The dome is in the middle.

Bumbu is the Indonesian word for a blend of spices and it commonly appears in the names of spice mixtures, sauces and seasoning pastes. The official Indonesian language dictionary describes bumbu as \\"various types of herbs and plants that have a pleasant aroma and flavour — such as ginger, turmeric, galangal, nutmeg and pepper — used to enhance the flavour of the food.\\" It is a characteristic of Indonesian cuisine and its regional variants such as Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Padang, Batak and Manado cuisines. It is used with various meats, seafood and vegetables in stews, soups, barbecue, sotos, gulai, and also as an addition to Indonesian-style instant noodles. Indonesians have developed original gastronomic themes with lemongrass and galangal, cardamom and chilies, tamarind and turmeric. Unlike Indian cooking tradition that favours dried spice powder mix, Indonesian cuisine is more akin to Thai, which favours the use of fresh ingredients. Traditionally, this mixture of spices and other aromatic ingredients is freshly ground into a moist paste using a mortar and pestle. The spice mixture is commonly made by slicing, chopping, grinding, beating, bruising, or sometimes dryroasting the spices, using traditional cooking tools such as stone mortar and pestle, or a modern blender or food processor. The bumbu mixture is usually stir-fried in hot cooking oil first to release its aroma, prior to adding the main ingredient (usually meats, poultry, or fish).

The rising took place when the protecting Persian garrison withdrew from Yemen. The Sassanids, this time with a force of 4,000 men, managed to reconquer Yemen and install Sayf’s son, Maʿdī Kareb as ruler. A pre-Islamic Arabian poet, Umayya bin Abi al-Salt, has praised the victory of the Persians in one of his poems. His poem is recorded in Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani's Kitab al-Aghani. A Persian military force now remained in Yemen for over fifty years, with a Persian governor at Maʿdī Kareb’s side. The names of the successive Persian governors are as follows, according to Tabari (there is some variation in the sources over the names): *Wahriz *Marzbān (son of Wahriz) *Bīnagār (son of Marzbān) *Kharra Khusraw (son of Bīnagār) *Bādhān or Bādhām, who was unconnected with Wahriz's line and replaced Kharra Khusraw due to the assimilation of the latter into the local culture. The Persian garrison of soldiers and officials settled down in Sana'a and its vicinity and intermarried with the local Arab population, and it was the sons of these Persian fathers and Arab mothers, with their descendants, who became known as the abnāʾ.
