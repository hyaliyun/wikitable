The existence of this linguistic border led to differentiate the Celtic-speaking Lower Brittany (West) from the Romance- speaking Upper Brittany (East). The farthest eastern extension of the Breton language was in the ninth century, when the linguistic border was located near Nantes and Rennes. Breton declined inexorably in favor of the Gallo gradually moving westward along a Binic-Gu√©rande line. The border can now be traced along a line from Plouha to Rhuys. The linguistic unification of France, completed after World War II, made somewhat obsolete the linguistic aspect of the distinction between Upper and Lower Brittany, although many people still consider it valid in terms of toponymy, culture and identity.Fa√±ch Broudic, √Ä la recherche de la fronti√®re. La limite linguistique entre Haute et Basse- Bretagne aux xixe et xxe si√®cles, Brest, Ar Skol Vrezoneg, 1997 History  Decline of the Breton language from the 10th to the 20th century. Place-names are one form of evidence for the linguistic boundary during the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near Nantes and Rennes. For example, Pleugueneuc, in Ille-et-Vilaine, combines the Breton element plou (parish) with the name 'Guehenoc'.Kenneth Jackson, Linguistic Geography and the History of the Breton Language (1961), online at reference-global.com The distinction of two Brittanys was made at least as early as the 15th century, when the names used were Britannia gallicana (Gallic Brittany) and Britannia britonizans (Brittonic Brittany).John T. Koch (ed.), Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia, Volumes 1-5 (2006), p. 244 At that time, it appears that Lower Brittany had a separate fiscal status. Since then, the boundary between them has changed slowly as a result of the long retreat of the Breton language.Herv√© Abalain, Histoire de la langue bretonne (1995), p. 30 Under the ancien r√©gime, the boundary between the two was generally in line with the province's division into nine bishoprics, with those of Rennes, Dol, Nantes, St Malo and St Brieuc considered to form Upper Brittany, while Tr√©guier, Vannes, Quimper and Saint-Pol-de-L√©on formed Lower Brittany.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Volume 4 (1894), p. 320 In 1588, the historian Bertrand d'Argentr√© defined the boundary as running from the outskirts of Binic southwards to Gu√©rande, leaving the towns of Loud√©ac, Josselin, and Malestroit in Upper Brittany. In 1886, Paul S√©billot noted that the boundary was deeper into what had been Breton territory, the line then running from Plouha on the north coast to Batz-sur-Mer in the south, on the Bay of Biscay. The boundary between 'Upper' and 'Lower' Brittany is now a purely imaginary line and has no administrative or other status. However, having been based on linguistic areas, the boundary does correspond very roughly to administrative borders. The town of Plo√´rmel is one point where the two meet. In area, Upper Brittany now takes in something over half of the 35,000 square kilometres of the whole of Brittany, but it has some 2.5 million people, compared with Lower Brittany's 1.6 million. In the early 20th century, about 60% of the population had lived in the Breton-speaking areas.Helen Kelly-Holmes, Minority language broadcasting: Breton and Irish (2001), p.32 File:R√©partition_du_nombre_de_brittophones_par_pays.jpg See also *Linguistic boundary of Moselle References Category:Brittany Category:Borders Category:Languages of France Category:Isoglosses ","title":"Linguistic boundary of Brittany"},{"id":"45531177","text":"Tanush Dukagjin ( 1423‚Äì33), known as Little Tanush, was an Albanian nobleman, a member of the Dukagjini family, the son of Pal Dukagjini (died 1393).

It was disbanded on 9 February 1939. History The First Mixed Brigade was established from the Fifth Regiment on 10 October 1936 in Alcal√° de Henares as a result of the reorganization of the Spanish Republican Armed forces.Fernando de Bordej√© y Morencos (2007); Galer√≠a de personajes espa√±oles, p. 368 It was put under the command of Communist commander Enrique Lister.Miguel Moreno (2008); La medida del Abismo, p. 185Santiago √Ålvarez (1994); Negr√≠n personalidad Hist√≥rica, Volume 1, p. 78 The first combat action of the First Mixed Brigade was the Battle of Sese√±a. It would suffer many losses in the Battle of Brunete, including its Cuban brigade commander Alberto S√°nchez, as well as a great number of officers and Chief of Staff Major Emilio Conejo. Later the First Mixed Brigade would see action in the Aragon Offensive, the Battle of the Ebro and the Catalonia Offensive. =Central Front= Map of the Republican attack at Brunete. 6 - 11 Julio 1937.V√≠ctor Hurtado, Las Brigadas Internacionales, Edicions DAU. 2013, p.44 , During the Siege of Madrid it was posted in Vallecas,Julio Ar√≥stegui, Jes√∫s A. Mart√≠nez (1984); Junta de defensa de Madrid, p. 395 where, with great losses, it helped repulse the attacks of the Army of Africa against the capital. Following this combat it was transferred to the left bank of the Manzanares River. At that time its size grew to eight battalions, being then split when the 1.¬™ Brigada Bis was established. The 1.¬™ Brigada Bis would later be renamed as the 9th Mixed Brigade. On 19 February the First Mixed Brigade was sent to attack the Cerro de los √Ångeles where the rebels had established its positions and were firing upon the surrounding area, but although it managed to gain some terrain the attack failed. On 3 February it attacked the rebel positions in Villaverde Bajo, but it went back to the capital in order to take part in the Battle of Jarama. On 8 February it was near Vaciamadrid where on 19 February it began an assault at El Pingarr√≥n hill; there it occupied the enemy trenches on four occasions, being finally repulsed in all attacks. During the Jarama combats many officers ‚Äîincluding all battalion commanders‚Äî as well as a great number of soldiers were killed and the unit had to be reconstituted in the rearguard. In March 1937 the brigade took part with success in the Battle of Guadalajara and in April it was sent again to attack the Cerro de los √Ångeles, ending again in failure. In May it took part in a small offensive operation south of Toledo. On 5 July the First Mixed Brigade infiltrated the rebel lines near Brunete. Two days later it occupied Villanueva de la Ca√±ada and continued the advance. But towards the end of the month it had to retreat, along with the remainders of the 11th Division. = Aragon Front = After a short period of rest the brigade was transferred to Arag√≥n together with the remainder of the V Army Corps. On 24 August it took part in the Zaragoza Offensive attacking the Fuentes de Ebro sector in successive assaults without being able to make significant progress.Alfonso Alvarez Bolado, Para ganar la guerra, para ganar la paz, Universidad Pontificia Comillas de Madrid (November 2001), p. 190 The \\"Jos√© D√≠az Battalion\\" commander and his commissar died during these combats. In December the First Mixed Brigade was sent to the Battle of Teruel where it repeated the same maneuver as in Brunete, infiltrating enemy lines following the 9th and 100th mixed brigades with the mission to take Concud and cut the Francoist rearguard. But the brigade lost its way and instead of circling the village, it ended up attacking it frontally, being immediately repulsed and suffering heavy casualties. Even so, by the afternoon it was able to occupy the place. After conquering Teruel, the First Mixed Brigade was sent to a rearguard position together with the remainder of the 11th Division in order to recover following the heavy losses that had been inflicted on these units. In the spring of 1938 the First Mixed Brigade took part in the Arag√≥n Campaign, but with limited success. Even though it tried to stop the enemy advance in the sector between Calanda and the Valdealgorfa road junction, the collapse of the whole front forced it to retreat. = Last actions in Catalonia = By April, although the 1st Mixed Brigade was stuck in Catalonia together with other republican forces, it had managed not to become cut off from its division after the hasty retreat. In May it was sent as strategic reserve for the failed Balaguer Offensive, seeing no combat action. By then the command of the brigade had been reorganized and the unit had been re- equipped. On 25 July the unit crossed the Ebro, taking part in the battle that would last the following four months. After conquering M√≥ra d'Ebre, it arrived to the P√†ndols Range defensive line and later it reached the Barranco de Santa Magdalena. But by 15 August it lost that outpost retreating again to the P√†ndols Range, where it held its position until the end of the battle. At the beginning of November it was still in the southern bank of the Ebro, having suffered great losses in manpower and equipment. The commandment of the unit was changed again, being entrusted to major Jos√© Montalvo. When the Francoist offensive against Catalonia began on 23 December 1938, the 1st Mixed Brigade was in the Garrigues area waiting to be reorganized, but it was sent to the Battle of the Segre front in order to plug a breach in the republican lines. For a while it managed to stop the offensive of the Fascist Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie near Les Borges Blanques, but by the beginning of January 1939 it had to retreat towards the north. By 3 February it reached Girona, and on 5 February it still held fast against the Francoist pressure by the banks of the Ter River. Nevertheless, on 9 February in the evening it crossed the French border at Portbou and became disbanded.Translation  Commanders  *Commanders in Chief ** Enrique L√≠ster ** Manuel L√≥pez Iglesias ** Alberto S√°nchez ** Francisco del Cacho Villarroig ** Domingo Hortelano Hortelano ** Eduardo Zamora Conde ** Jos√© Ar√©valo ** Jos√© Montalvo *Commissars.

It is regarded as the national epic of Finland and Karelia and is one of the most significant works of Finnic literature. The Kalevala has inspired artworks of many famous artists, including ‚Äì for instance ‚Äì music of the Finnish classical composer Jean Sibelius and the illustrations of the Finnish painter Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The title The Kalevala can be interpreted as The Land of Kaleva or Kalevia. The first version of The Kalevala, called The Old Kalevala, was published in 1835. The later second version is the most commonly known version today. It was first published in 1849. It consists of 22,795 verses, divided into fifty poems/songs (Finnish: Runot). The author of The Kalevala, Elias L√∂nnrot (April 9, 1802 ‚Äì March 19, 1884), was a Finnish physician, philologist and collector of traditional Finnic oral folklore. The material for the compiling of The Kalevala was gathered by him from Finnic oral tradition carried from the distant past, including short ballads, lyric poems and mythology, during his several expeditions in Finland, Russian Karelia, the Kola Peninsula and the Baltic countries. The earliest remaining written reference to Kaleva (a.k.a. Kalev, Kalevi, etc. in Estonia) is by many experts considered to be one found in Widsith, also known as The Traveller's Song, which also provides the earliest known written usage of the name Viking, with the spelling wicing. Widsith is a 6th or 7th century Anglo-Saxon poem ‚Äì or song ‚Äì of 143 lines, which became copied into the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century. Widsith is for the most part a survey of the people, kings and heroes of Europe in the Germanic Heroic Age. The Germanic Heroic Age corresponds to the Germanic Wars in terms of historiography, and to the Germanic Iron Age in terms of archaeology, spanning over the early centuries of the 1st millennium, in particular the 4th and 5th centuries, the period of the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the establishment of stable \\"barbarian kingdoms\\" larger than at the tribal level (the kingdoms of the Visigoths, the Franks and the Burgundians, and the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain). The Germanic peoples at the time lived mostly in tribal societies. The following is stated in Widsith: > \\"Caesar ruled the Greeks, Caelic the Finns ... I was with the Greeks and > Finns and also with Caesar ...\\". Many historians and folklorists believe Widsith's \\"Caelic\\" to be a reference to the ancient Finnic ruler Kaleva/Kalevi, discussed in both the Finnish epic Kalevala and the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg. \\"Widsith: Anglosaksinen muinaisruno\\". Authors: Osmo Pekonen and Clive Tolley. Published in Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland, by Minerva in 2004, Kalevipoeg ‚Äì the Estonian national epic Following the publishing of The Kalevala, a similar Estonian national epic Kalevipoeg was completed in 1853. Due to censorship, it could not be published that year, but it became published in parts as a new and extended version during the years 1857‚Äì1861, and as a book in 1862. Kalevipoeg is based on ancient oral tradition within Ancient Estonia of legends explaining the origin of the world. Within old Estonian folklore, a malevolent giant by the name of Kalevi ‚Äì a.k.a. Kalev, Kalevine, Kalevipoiss, Kalevine posikine, Kalevin Poika ‚Äì appears, battling with other giants or enemies of the nation. In addition to Widsith's Caelic, early written references to Kalevi are found in a list of deities published by the Finnish author Mikael Agricola in 1551 with the spelling Calenanpoiat and in Leyen Spiegel published by Heinrich Stahl in 1641 with the spelling Kalliweh. Lauri Honko, Religion, Myth, and Folklore in the World's Epics: The Kalevala and Its Predecessors, published by Walter de Gruyter, 1990, Kalevi ‚Äì in slightly varying spellings ‚Äì in the Estonian epic Kalevipoeg is widely viewed to be the same hero as Kaleva in the Finnish and Karelian epic The Kalevala.

See letter from Grier to Susan B. Anthony dated 3-7-1901 showing Grier's use of Eliza Anna Grier. (1864‚Äì1902) was an American physician and the first African-American woman licensed to practice medicine in the U.S. state of Georgia. Biography Dr. Eliza Anna Grier was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina in 1864 to Emily and George Washington Grier. Although she was born after the Emancipation Proclamation, she was effectively a slave in that part of North Carolina not occupied by the Union Army. She was emancipated in practice at the end of the war (while still an infant) and later moved to Nashville, Tennessee to study teaching at Fisk University. In order to be able to afford her tuition fees, she alternated every year of studying with working; after enrolling in 1884, she graduated in 1891. Grier wrote to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1890 to explain that she had very little money and inquired whether assistance \\"might be provided for an emancipated slave to receive any help into so lofty a profession\\". She was accepted into the college in 1893 and once again worked in between periods of studying to support herself. Eliza worked for a year picking cotton to pay for the next year's medical school, taking her seven years to graduate. After graduating in 1897, she moved to Atlanta, Georgia and applied for a license to practice medicine in Fulton County, making her the first African-American woman to receive a medical license in the state of Georgia. Grier set up a private practice in Atlanta, specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. She was quoted as saying \\"When I saw colored women doing all the work in cases of accouchement [childbirth], and all the fee going to some white doctor who merely looked on, I asked myself why should I not get the fee myself. For this purpose I have qualified. I went to Philadelphia, studied medicine hard, procured my degree, and have come back to Atlanta, where I have lived all my life, to practice my profession. Some of the best white doctors in the city have welcomed me, and say that they will give me an even chance in the profession. That is all I ask.\\" During this time, she also supplemented her income with teaching jobs. She fell ill in 1901, just three years after opening her practice, and was unable to work. She wrote to suffragist Susan B. Anthony to request help with her financial troubles. Anthony was not in a position to help her financially but did contact Woman's Medical College on her behalf.

He graduated as a medical surgeon in 1964.  Biography  He trained in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Aguirre Hospital and obtained his certification after 3 years from the same university. He specialized for two years in colposcopy and cytopathology, and dedicated a large part of those first years to the early detection of cervical cancer while working at the Military Hospital in Santiago, Chile (1974-1978), where he became Head of the Cervical Pathology Department for the early diagnosis of cancer. During those years he focused his attention on the frequent correlation he had noticed between cervical inflammation and premenstrual syndrome, conditions to which he has since dedicated his life and passion. The so-called Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) form the large part of his experience, which has permitted him to develop an innovative approach to the treatment of this disease and from which he is a well known personality. His new ideas about the mechanism involved in the biology of the menstrual cycle and many ailments related to cervical dysfunction, have made him a controversial character. He coined the term \\"cyclical hysterotoxemia\\" to replace the descriptive terms mentioned above (from the Greek ‚Äúhysterus‚Äù, meaning uterus, and ‚Äútoxemia‚Äù, for the presence of toxins in the blood. Ciclical refers to the menstrual cycle) For his work he has been a frequent guest on TV, interviews and specialized magazines. His innovative approach refers to techniques he has perfected over the years to deal with the chronic inflammation of the uterus, mostly affecting the cervix, with which he has obtained impressive results in controlling and eradicating the symptoms of this condition, thus preventing the need for major surgery. Lolas is a founding member of the Chilean Society of Colposcopy and Pathology of the Lower Genital Tract, he is also a member of the Scientific Society of Chile and runs a gynecological research institute in Santiago, Chile. He has been nominated for the \\"National Prize of Applied Sciences\\" from his patients in 1998 and by the Scientific Society of Chile in 2000, 2002 and 2004, in recognition of his innovative contributions to women's health. He published his book ‚ÄúS√≠ndrome premenstrual desde una nueva perspectiva‚Äù (Premenstrual Syndrome: A New Perspective) in 1995.

Sudden heavy rainfall, saturation of the ground from rainwater and the flow of tributaries caused the Grand River to rise dramatically, with the river cresting at in Grand Rapids on April 21, 2013. The flooding caused thousands of residents in the area to evacuate their homes. Meteorology Grand River flood water settling near the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum with kayakers floating near light poles of a riverwalk. In April 2013, heavy rain throughout the Midwest caused severe flooding in the region. In a period between April 8 and 15, Grand Rapids received of rain, while the upriver community of Comstock Park received about of rainfall. Within that period on April 13, the National Weather Service stated that floodwaters in Comstock Park rose from minor to moderate, with the flood stage beginning at and that day's level at . On April 17, Grand Rapids received about of rain. Rainfall broke a 104-year-old record on April 18 with of rain falling by 9:30 a.m. EDT.

Rain totals for the month of April were about . Impact Grand Rapids fish ladder during the 2013 flood. Grand Rapids residents filling sand bags. On April 21, Mayor of Grand Rapids, George Heartwell, declared a state of emergency. Evacuations of homes were reported along with some reports about boat rescues from houses in the area. In Kent County, about 700 people were evacuated while 1,000 people alone were evacuated from the Plaza Towers in downtown Grand Rapids. Some buildings in Grand Rapids near the riverfront had the Grand River's waterline go over their windows with some individuals able to see fish and ducks swim by through the windows. Flood walls and bridges in Grand Rapids caused some increased flooding in cities up and downstream from the Grand River since they impeded the flow of the river, causing water to stand and rise. Wastewater treatment plants in Grand Rapids, Grandville and Wyoming had partially treated wastewater overflow from their facilities. The Grand Rapids wastewater plant had about of the partially treated water spill into the Grand River. =Response= The American Red Cross of West Michigan deployed to heavily affected neighborhoods in the area. During the floods, thousands of residents in the Grand Rapids area volunteered to fill over 100,000 sand bags that were to be used throughout the territory. Near the Grand Rapids wastewater facility, a wall of sandbags were placed. CSX Transportation also placed train cars full of salt on a 110-year-old trestle bridge that crossed the river near Wealthy Street in order to weigh down the bridge from the rising floodwaters below it. Aftermath The state of emergency declared by Mayor Heartwell lasted until May 24 in order to give more time for officials to gather information about the impact of the flooding. Following the flooding, thousands of sandbags had to be removed with some possibly being stored for future use for other floods. Discussions were also held on whether to turn the wall of sandbags near the Grand Rapids wastewater facility into a permanent berm for future protection. In the spring of 2014, Grand Rapids and Walker started a $703,000 contract to install flap gates and to perform repairs to existing flood walls. In August 2014, Grand Rapids also released plans to remove obstructions in the Grand River and to raise the berm near their wastewater plant. After initial claims by Grand Rapids officials that the flood walls in the city were adequate, in November 2014, city officials decided to look at ways to heighten flood walls due to factors involving Federal Emergency Management Agency, climate change and a proposed river restoration project.

Career Born in Bermondsey, London, Goldswain began his professional boxing career in the mid-1890s. He fought for several English titles in the era before they were standardized and controlled by the National Sporting Club at weights between 130 and 148lbs. In January 1906 he beat Fred Buckland to take the English & Imperial ten stone title, and in April 1906 he successfully defended his title against Jabez White. Fights in this period included wins over Curly Watson, as well as two defeats at the hands of Young Joseph, one of which was recorded in one of the early boxing films. In October 1909, he beat French middleweight champion Marcel Moreau on points. In March 1910 Joseph made the first defence of the British welterweight title against Goldswain; Goldswain was disqualified in the eleventh round for holding and \\"not trying\\", the NSC refusing to pay him for the fight as a result. He took the National Sporting Club to court in an appeal against the result, but was unsuccessful. In June he was knocked out in the third round by Packey McFarland.\\"Goldswain Knocked Out; Packey McFarland Strikes Winning Blow in Third Round\\", The New York Times, 19 June 1910 In October 1910 he fought Joseph again, this time the two drawing over ten rounds. In June 1911 he fought Georges Carpentier in Paris, losing via a fourth-round knockout. In December 1911, in a fight with Stoker Green, Goldswain broke his left arm in the fourth round but continued punching with his right and knocked Green out to win the fight. In December 1912 he met Gus Platts in what was Platts' third professional fight; Goldswain retired at the end of the fourth round due to a leg injury. Goldswain met Young Joseph again in May 1913 and while Goldswain stopped Joseph, the result was declared void due to Goldswain continuing to punch after the bell at the end of the fifth round as he didn't hear the bell; The fight would have continued but Joseph was unable to start the sixth round. Five months later he was beaten by the Dixie Kid in four rounds. Goldswain served in the Territorial Army during World War I in the 1st Surrey Rifles and later in the cycle section of the Middlesex Hussars, reaching the rank of Sergeant. Goldswain continued to fight until 1919, his career including over 130 fights.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The church was restored in 1873 by Benjamin Ferrey. The parish is part of the benefice of Aisholt, Enmore, Goathurst, Nether Stowey, Over Stowey and Spaxton with Charlynch which falls within the archdeadery of Taunton. Architecture The church has a three bay north aisle, two bay chancel and a two bay nave accessed via the south doorway which was built around 1185. The heavy doorway dating from around 1185 is an ornately carved archway. The three-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses and topped with a turret above the stairs. It contains six bells the oldest of which was cast in 1647 by William Purdue. Interior Inside the church are a 13th-century octagonal font, and jacobean pulpit. There are also various chests ranging in date from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. There are two helms from the family of William Malet who were the lords of the manor and Sheriffs of Somerset. These are believed to date from around 1620 so they would date from the time of John Malet. They were discovered when parts of Enmore Castle were demolished in 1833 and moved to the church. Churchyard In the churchyard is a 15th-century cross. The shaft is high, however the head of the cross is missing. The wall around the churchyard which separates it from Enmore Castle was probably built in the 18th century. The monuments include the Studdier, and Waterman family monuments. There are also some unidentified chest tombs. One dating from the early 18th century, and one from the 17th.

It is situated just north of Town Street on the north bank of the River Aire. History In 1992 Yorkshire Water proposed that the site of a former sewage works be used as a nature reserve. Discussion with local wildlife groups followed and the idea was approved. After several years of planning and fund-raising, the reserve was created in 1999 and opened by Michael Meacher, Minister of State for the Environment, the following year. Between 2004 and 2006, five ponds were established to provide habitat for dragonflies, each one planted with different native species of plant. A further developmental stage from 2007 to 2009 added four more ponds, a long ditch, a marsh and several areas of open water. Habitat Hide on the reserve for watching birds The reserve is on a migratory route used by waders and waterfowl. The site floods in the winter and provides good habitat for these birds, augmenting that provided by the River Aire and by the nearby Leeds and Liverpool Canal, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Apart from the water features, woodland, grassland and scrub are present in the reserve. Fauna Frogs, toads and newts breed in the reserve, and fifteen species of dragonfly have been recorded, many of which breed there. Birds that can be seen at any time of year include little grebe, tufted duck, gadwall, shoveler, kingfisher, dipper, oystercatcher, lapwing and common tern. Winter visitors include snipe, water rail, pochard, wigeon, teal and common merganser. Smaller species seen in the summer or all year round include linnet, reed bunting, greenfinch, bullfinch, chiffchaff, willow warbler, garden warbler, grey wagtail, blackcap, common whitethroat and song thrush. Facilities There is a carpark by the gate and a visitor centre in the centre, with disabled parking and toilets adjacent.

United Nations United Nations General Assembly (resolution 46/119 of 1991), \\"Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care\\" is a non-binding resolution advocating certain broadly-drawn procedures for the carrying out of involuntary commitment. These principles have been used in many countries where local laws have been revised or new ones implemented. The UN runs programs in some countries to assist in this process. Australia In Australia, court hearings are not required for involuntary commitment. Mental health law is constitutionally under the state powers. Each state thus has different laws, many of which have been updated in recent years. =Referral for service= The usual requirement is that a police officer or a physician determine that a person requires a psychiatric examination, usually through a psychiatric hospital. If the person is detained in the hospital, they usually must be seen by an authorized psychiatrist within a set period of time. In some states, after a further set period or at the request of the person or their representative, a tribunal hearing is held to determine whether the person should continue to be detained. In states where tribunals are not instituted, there is another form of appeal. Some Australian states require that the person is a danger to the society or themselves; other states only require that the person be suffering from a mental illness that requires treatment. The Victorian Mental Health Act (1986) specifies in part that: :\\"(1) A person may be admitted to and detained in an approved mental health service as an involuntary patient in accordance with the procedures specified in this Act only if‚Äî ::(a) the person appears to be mentally ill; and ::(b) the person's mental illness requires immediate treatment and that treatment can be obtained by admission to and detention in an approved mental health service; and ::(c) because of the person's mental illness, the person should be admitted and detained for treatment as an involuntary patient for his or her health or safety (whether to prevent a deterioration in the person's physical or mental condition or otherwise) or for the protection of members of the public; and ::(d) the person has refused or is unable to consent to the necessary treatment for the mental illness; and ::(e) the person cannot receive adequate treatment for the mental illness in a manner less restrictive of that person's freedom of decision and action. There are additional qualifications and restrictions but the effect of these provisions is that people who are assessed by doctors as being in need of treatment may be admitted involuntarily without the need of demonstrating a risk of danger. This overcomes the pressure described above to exaggerate issues of violence, or to verbal statements, to obtain an admission.Verbal statements =Treatment= In general, once the person is under involuntary commitment, treatment may be instituted without further requirements. Some treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), often require further procedures to comply with the law before they may be administered involuntarily. Community treatment orders can be used in the first instance or after a period of admission to hospital as a voluntary/involuntary patient. With the trend towards deinstitutionalization, this situation is becoming increasingly frequent, and hospital admission is restricted to people with severe mental illnesses. Finland Involuntary commitment requires three criteria: 1) severe mental illness with impaired insight; 2) that a lack of treatment would worsen the condition or endanger the safety or security of the patient or others; 3) and other treatments or services are insufficient or inapplicable. If found insane, criminal offenders may not be sentenced. Instead, they must be referred to THL (National Institute for Health and Welfare) for involuntary treatment. Niuvanniemi hospital specializes in involuntary commitment of criminal patients. France About 2.4% in of patients in French psychiatric wards are committed involuntarily. A person may be committed if they are an imminent danger or at the request of either (1) a third party, usually a family member, or (2) a representative of the state. * Classic admission: To involuntarily commit a person, two items are needed: (1) a handwritten request from a third party with a relationship to the person (e.g. a member of the patient's family or a care giver), excluding care givers working in the institution caring for the sick person, and (2) two supporting medical certificates, at least one of which is drawn up by a doctor outside of the institution giving care to the person. * Admission in case of imminent danger: In the case of imminent danger, a single medical certificate drawn up by a doctor who is not part of any establishment caring for the person, suffices to involuntarily commit a person. * Admission in case of emergency: A handwritten request from a third party and a medical certificate suffice to involuntarily commit a person. From an admission at the request of a representative the state to occur, the mentally ill person must a danger to themselves or others, or cause a serious breach of public order, in which case the mayor (temporarily and only when there is a danger to the safety of persons) or the prefect, may issue a decree in support of a medical certificate issued by a doctor outside the receiving institution to admit that person. Germany In Germany, there is a growing tendency to use the law on legal guardianship instead of mental health law for justification of involuntary commitment or treatment. The ward's legal guardian decides that he/she must go into mental hospital for treatment, and the police then acts on this decision. This is simpler for the government and family members than the formal process for commitment under mental health laws. In German criminal law, a person who was convicted of certain crimes can also be sentenced to be kept in preventive detention; see article on preventive detention. Israel The Mental Health Care Act of 1991 regulates the rights of the mentally ill in Israel and defines the conditions under which the patient's freedom of choice can be restricted. The law replaced the Mental Health Law of 1955. Italy In Italy the physician Giorgio Antonucci, in his work at the hospitals of Gorizia, Cividale del Friuli and Imola since the late 1960s, has avoided involuntary hospitalisation and any kind of coercion, rejecting the diagnosis as psychiatric prejudice. During the years 1973-1996 he worked on the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals Osservanza and Luigi Lolli in Imola. He currently collaborates with the Italian branch of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights. Japan In Japan, the Law on mental health and welfare for the mentally disabled (Japanese: Á≤æÁ•û‰øùÂÅ•Âèä„Å≥Á≤æÁ•ûÈöúÂÆ≥ËÄÖÁ¶èÁ•â„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊ≥ïÂæã) establishes the legal framework for involuntary commitment. Netherlands In Dutch criminal law, a convict can be sentenced to involuntary psychiatric treatment in a special institute called a . TBS is an abbreviation for ter beschikkingstelling, literally meaning \\"being placed at disposal\\" (of the state). Legally, such a sentence is not regarded as punishment like a prison sentence, but as a special measure. Often, when a convict is sentenced to TBS, they first serve a prison sentence. The convict will then be placed in a clinic after serving time in prison (usually two-thirds of the original prison sentence, although this practice is under discussion). According to Dutch law, meeting three conditions is required for a convict to be sentenced to TBS. These conditions are: * the crime committed must have been directly related to a psychiatric disorder, * recidivism must be likely, and * the convict can not, or only partially, be held accountable for the crime. To determine if these conditions are met, the suspect is observed in a forensic psychiatric detention center, the Pieter Baan Centre. Neither the prosecution or the defense can effectively challenge the Pieter Baan Centre's report, since it is the only institution that can conduct such investigations. Fatal mistakes have occurred, for instance, when a child molester regarded by the Pieter Baan Center as \\"not dangerous\\" killed a child after the molester was released. The conclusions in the centre's report are not binding; the judge can decide to ignore, or only partially accept them. Every convict detained in a TBS clinic may get temporary leave after serving a certain time or after some progress in treatment. This is regarded as an essential part of treatment, as the convict will be gradually re-entering society this way. At first the convict will be escorted by a therapist, and will be allowed outside the clinic for only a few hours. After evaluation, time and freedom of movement will be expanded until the convict can move freely outside the clinic without escort (usually for one day at a time). At that time, the convict will find work or follow an education. Generally, the convict is released after being in this situation for one or two years without incident. The time to be served in TBS can be indefinite, and it may be used as a form of preventive detention. Evaluation by the court will occur every one or two years. During these evaluations the court determines if any progress is made in treatment of the convict, and if it will be safe to release the convict into society. In general, the court will follow conclusions made by the TBS clinic. Average time served in a TBS clinic by a convict is slightly over eight years. ;Dutch TBS clinics In the Netherlands there are currently 12 institutions regarded as TBS clinics: * Inforsa/Arkin, Amsterdam * Dr. Henri van der Hoevenstichting, Utrecht * Dr. S. van Mesdagkliniek, Groningen * Hoeve Boschoord, Boschoord * FPC Veldzicht, Balkbrug * Pompestichting, Nijmegen * Oostvaarderskliniek, Almere * De Kijvelanden/FPC Tweelanden, Poortugaal * FPC Oldenkotte, Rekken (Closed on 4 september 2014) * FPC De Rooyse Wissel, Venray * GGz Drenthe, Assen * GGz Eindhoven/De Woenselse Poort, Eindhoven These institutions combined currently are holding about 1840 convicts. By the end of the 20th century, it was concluded that some convicts could not be treated and therefore could not be safely released into society. For these convicts, TBS clinics formed special wards, called \\"long-stay wards\\". Transfer to such a ward means that the convict will no longer be actively treated, but merely detained. This is regarded as more cost-effective. In general, the convicts in these wards will be incarcerated for the rest of their lives, although their detention is eligible for regular review by the court. =Controversy= Since the latter half of the 1990s, considerable controversy has grown in Dutch society, about the TBS system. This controversy has two main areas. The first level of controversy resulted from the media increasingly reporting cases of convicts committing crimes while still in, or after, treatment in a TBS clinic. Some examples of these cases are: * During 1992, a truck driver was convicted of raping and murdering three young children. Eight years earlier he was released from a TBS clinic after being treated for child molestation. * A convict, about to be released from a TBS clinic, murdered the owner of a garage in 1996 while under the influence of drugs. * An ex-convict, treated in a TBS clinic, murdered two women in 1994 and 1997. * A convict, still being treated by a TBS-clinic, randomly killed a man in the city of Groningen in 1999. * Between 2000 and 2004, an ex-convict tortured several animals and killed a homeless man. He had been treated in a TBS clinic. * In 2002 an ex-convict was sentenced for triple murder. He also had been released earlier by TBS. * In 2005 a convict escaped his escort during leave. He was arrested several days later after killing a man. Political and social attention increased, and debate started about the effectiveness of the TBS system and whether convicts should be granted leave from TBS clinics. Especially right-wing politicians suggested the TBS system be discarded altogether. Numerous articles in newspapers, magazines, television and radio programs and a revealing book written by an ex-convict (which for the first time openly questioned the effectiveness of the TBS-system) boosted discussion. Prior to that, any problems had been mostly denied by officials of the TBS-clinics themselves. The center of attention became a highly renowned TBS clinic, Dr. S. Van Mesdagkliniek in the city of Groningen. Events that took place there, by the end of the 1990s and the first years of the 21st century, provoked the second reason for controversy. Concern rose about claims of unprofessional behavior by staff working in TBS clinics, and the Dr. S. Van Mesdagkliniek developed a poor reputation over these problems. This TBS clinic has been plagued with unprofessional and even criminal acts by its staff since 1999. During that year, the clinic came under investigation by Dutch police after rumors about female staffmembers committing sexual offenses against convicts emerged.Nieuwe Revu Magazine, 1999 Five such cases were discovered during the investigation, and also numerous cases of drug-abuse, smuggling and trading of contraband such as alcohol, mobile phones, pornographic material, and hard drugs. It became apparent that staff members did not have the required education, had not been informed about rules and regulations, disregarded legal procedures, gave false testimonies, tampered with evidence, uttered false accusations against convicts, and intimidated colleagues. At least one psychiatrist, employed as such by the clinic, proved to be not qualified,Trouw, August 8, 2000 and treatment of convicts was in many cases simply non-existent.Algemeen Dagblad, October 27, 1999 These problems had been known for long by the management but were kept hidden. After public outcry about this situation, management was replacedAlgemeen Dagblad, December 22, 1999 and all of the nine (at the time) TBS clinics in the Netherlands were subjected to investigation. Six of them proved to be below the required legal standards.NRC Handelsblad, March 3, 2001 However, problems did not end there. In spite of many measures taken by the government, convicts still were released without proper treatment. As a consequence, numerous crimes were committed by convicts that were regarded as treated by TBS clinics. Also, sexual offenses against convicts by staff members and smuggling of contraband did not cease in several TBS clinics.Metro, February 8, 2006 In 2006, the Dutch government formed a committee to investigate the TBS system. Some problems, however not the worst, were recognized and countermeasures were implemented. One of the known actual results is that fewer convicts escape during temporary release. Controversy regarding the, often praised, Dutch TBS system continued. In 2005, a staff member working in the Dr. S. Van Mesdagkliniek was caught smuggling liquor to convicts suffering from alcohol-related problems.Algemeen Dagblad, September 22, 2005 In 2007, a female staff member committed sexual offenses against a convict, and had smuggled contraband.RTV Noord, February 9, 2009 She was sentenced to three months in prison in 2009. That same year, investigation proved convicts still had ample access to illicit drugsRTV Noord, September 3, 2009 and four inmates from the Dr. S. Van Mesdagkliniek were arrested for possession of child pornography.RTV Noord, January 29, 2009 Many crimes committed by released convicts treated in TBS clinics escape statistics because the crimes were committed in other countries, or because they differ from the crime the convict was originally convicted for (many convicts released from TBS clinics find their way in illegal drug trade and related crimes). Because there seems to be no acceptable alternative available, political support for the much troubled TBS system remains, in spite of the controversy. New Zealand The Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992, replaced the previous Act, enacted in 1969. Although there were several reasons to replace the previous act, one key aspect was the lack of review, as once the Reception Order had been made by a District Court judge and two doctors, that the proposed patient be taken to hospital: \\"Subject to the provisions of this Act, every reception order, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, shall continue in force until the patient is discharged.\\" (MHA 1969 s28(2)) Despite the deinstitutionalization that began in New Zealand during the 1960s, as in many other Western countries, many patients stayed at the psychiatric hospital for years, as the original reception order remained in force. Another reason to review the former act was that patients appeared at the District Court (formerly the Magistrates Court until 1980) - which hears all but the most serious criminal cases. The present Act emphasises that Mental Health Hearings be heard at the Family Court instead, to remove any implication that the patient is being detained in hospital due to a criminal act. It does, however, provide that Mental Health Hearings may take place at the District Court, if there is no other suitable alternative. Often the Family Court will sit at the Mental Health Inpatient Unit. There are multiple checks and balances built into the present committal procedures. As in the United Kingdom, the process is generally known as \\"sectioning\\". Section 8A provides that any person, aged 18 or over, who has seen the proposed patient within the last 72 hours, may apply to the Director of Area Mental Health Services (DAMHS), to have that person seen by a psychiatrist, against their wishes. The person must be a danger to themselves or others, or be unable to care for themselves. Section 8B requires that the person be seen by a doctor, preferably their own General Practitioner, to give their opinion as to whether the applicant is correct in their statements about the proposed patient's behaviour. If the doctor is satisfied, this paperwork is signed, and the process continues to Section 9 where Duly Authorised Officers (DAOs) - operating as agents of the DAMHS, have the power to detain the person for six hours, and during that time, they have the power to transport the proposed patient to the psychiatrist. This is usually at a hospital, but the patient may be seen at a police station, depending on the circumstances. If the proposed patient refuses to accompany them, the Police will assist under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health and the New Zealand Police. Under s10 they are formally interviewed by the psychiatrist, and if they are to be admitted, a s11 is issued that detains the patient for assessment and treatment at an inpatient mental health unit, for up to five days. Following this, a s12 review is held, and if necessary the patient can be held under s13 for fourteen days. At the end of this time, the psychiatrist must apply for a Court Hearing as to whether the patient can be treated compulsorily for any longer. Section 14(4) gives up to fourteen days for the hearing to occur. The detention sections (11, 13, & 14(4)) can be done in the outpatient setting, but in practice, most compulsory patients are detained at a hospital. Two compulsory treatment orders are available. Section 29 is a Community Treatment Order, and the Act states that this should be applied for. The patient can only be recalled to hospital twice for two fourteen-day periods in the six months that it lasts. If a community order is not suitable (for example, due to the risk posed by the patient to themselves or others), a s30 Inpatient Treatment Order can be applied for, where the patient is either in hospital, or on leave from hospital. In either case, two health professionals must apply to the Family Court - the psychiatrist, backed by a second health professional, usually a registered nurse, sometimes a social worker. People who have committed a crime while mentally unwell are subject to the Criminal Procedure (Mentally Impaired Persons) Act 2003, although the Mental Health Act also refers to their care. If taken into custody, it is a matter for the Court as to whether they will go to prison and have their mental health issues treated whilst imprisoned, or whether they are \\"insane\\" in the legal sense, in which case they are detained at a Forensic Mental Health Unit. These are located at Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. The Acts described provide also for the transfer of patients between prisons and Forensic Mental Health Units, and the reasons for doing this. New Zealand has found that closing its large country psychiatric hospitals and replacing them with small inpatient units, and a community care model, does not always mean better care. While many people were released who were able to adapt to, and become part of, their communities, some patients were unable to adapt. The current system is not set up for people who require long term closely supervised mental health care.  Singapore  The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act was passed in 2008 to regulate the involuntary detention of a person in a psychiatric institution for the treatment of a mental disorder, or in the interest of the health and safety of the person or the persons around him. Switzerland Switzerland has a high proportion of involuntary commitments (German: Zwangzulassung, French: placement forc√©) compared to other European countries. Almost 25% of psychiatric patients were admitted involuntarily according to a 2009 study. report by www.humanrights.ch of 2014-02-17 https://www.humanrights.ch/de/menschenrechte- schweiz/inneres/strafen/freiheitsentzug/zwangseinweisungen-psychiatrie- grundrechtlicher-sicht The conditions and procedure of involuntary commitments are regulated by Articles 426 to 439 of the Swiss Civil Code. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the process known in the United States as involuntary commitment is informally known as \\"detaining\\" or \\"sectioning,\\" using various sections of the Mental Health Act 1983 (covering England and Wales), the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 that provide its legal basis. In England and Wales, approved mental health professionals have a lead role in coordinating Mental Health Act assessments, which they conduct in cooperation with usually two medical practitioners. Under the Mental Health Act, detention is determined by utility and purpose. Mentally ill individuals may be detained under Section 2 for a period of assessment lasting up to 28 days or Section 3 for a period of treatment lasting up to 6 months (though this period can be renewed). Patients already on a ward may be detained under section 5(2) for up to 72 hours for the purposes of allowing an assessment to take place for Section 2 or 3. Separate sections deal with mentally ill criminal offenders. In all cases detention needs to be justified on the basis that the person has a mental disorder and poses a risk of harm to his/her own health, safety, or the safety of others (as determined by the 'Approved' Mental Health Professional(s)).Mental Health Act, 1983 (amended 2007) A Section 3 detention can be applied for by the person's nearest relative or, if the nearest relative agrees, by an approved mental health professional (AMHP). More specifically, according to Article 11 of the Mental Health Act the AMHP can make an application that a person be detained for treatment under section 3 only if the AMHP has consulted the person who appears to be the patient's nearest relative (unless it is not reasonably practicable or would cause unreasonable delay) and if the nearest relative has not told the AMHP or the LSSA that they object. Under the amended Mental Health Act 2007, which came into force in November 2008 to be detained under Section 3 for treatment, appropriate treatment must be available in the place of detention. Supervised Community Treatment orders signifies that people can be discharged to the community on a conditional basis, remaining liable to recall to hospital if they break the conditions of the community treatment order. In 2020, as part of the response to COVID-19, Parliament passed the Coronavirus Act 2020 which amends the Mental Health Act to allow for sectioning with the approval of only one medical practitioner. United States State law governs involuntary commitment, and procedures vary from state to state. In some jurisdictions, laws regarding the commitment of juveniles may vary, with what is the de facto involuntary commitment of a juvenile perhaps de jure defined as \\"voluntary\\" if his parents agree, though he may still have a right to protest and attempt to get released. However, there is a body of case law governing the civil commitment of individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment through Supreme Court rulings beginning in 1975 with the ruling that involuntary hospitalization and/or treatment violates an individual's civil rights in O'Connor v. Donaldson. This ruling forced individual states to change their statutes. For example, the individual must exhibit behavior that poses a danger to himself or others in order to be held, the hold must be for evaluation only, and a court order must be received for more than very short term treatment or hospitalization (typically no longer than 72 hours). This ruling has severely limited involuntary treatment and hospitalization in the U.S. In the U.S. the specifics of the relevant statutes vary from state to state. In 1979, Addington v. Texas set the bar for involuntary commitment for treatment by raising the burden of proof required to commit persons from the usual civil burden of proof of \\"preponderance of the evidence\\" to the higher standard of \\"clear and convincing evidence\\". An example of involuntary commitment procedures is the Baker Act used in Florida. Under this law, a person may be committed only if they present a danger to themselves or others. A police officer, doctor, nurse or licensed mental health professional may initiate an involuntary examination that lasts for up to 72 hours. Within this time, two psychiatrists may ask a judge to extend the commitment and order involuntary treatment. The Baker Act also requires that all commitment orders be reviewed every six months in addition to ensuring certain rights to the committed including the right to contact outsiders. Also, a person under an involuntary commitment order has a right to counsel and a right to have the state provide a public defender if they cannot afford a lawyer. While the Florida law allows police to initiate the examination, it is the recommendations of two psychiatrists that guide the decisions of the court. In the 1990s, involuntary commitment laws were extended under various state laws commonly recognized under the umbrella term, SVP laws, to hold some convicted sex offenders in psychiatric facilities after their prison terms were completed. (This is generally referred to as \\"civil commitment,\\" not \\"involuntary commitment,\\" since involuntary commitment can be criminal or civil). This matter has been the subject of a number of cases before the Supreme Court, most notably Kansas v. Hendricks and United States v. Comstock in regard to the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which does not require a conviction on sex offenses, but only that the person be in federal custody and be deemed a \\"sexually dangerous person\\". =Specific requirements by state= In Arizona, the government can mandate inpatient treatment for anyone determined to be \\"persistently or acutely disabled.\\" Virtually anyone who suspects that someone has mental problems and needs help could file an application to a state- licensed healthcare agency for a court-ordered evaluation. In Connecticut, someone can be committed only if he or she has \\"psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled\\". \\"Gravely disabled\\" has usually been interpreted to mean that the person is unable on their own to obtain adequate food, shelter and clothing. In Iowa, any \\"interested person\\" may begin commitment proceedings by submitting a written statement to the court. If the court finds that the respondent is \\"seriously mentally impaired,\\" he or she will be placed in a psychiatric hospital for further evaluation and possibly treatment. Further hearings are required at specific intervals for as long as the person is being involuntarily held. The Michigan Mental Health Code provides that a person \\"whose judgment is so impaired that he or she is unable to understand his or her need for treatment and whose continued behavior as the result of this mental illness can reasonably be expected, on the basis of competent clinical opinion, to result in significant physical harm to himself or herself or others\\" may be subjected to involuntary commitment, a provision paralleled in the laws of many other jurisdictions. The Michigan Mental Health Code allows for one to petition a court to order assisted outpatient treatment for patients with such impaired judgment, which compels them to comply with treatment to avoid relapses. One can petition for assisted outpatient treatment along with, or instead of, hospitalization. In Nevada, prior to confining someone, the state must demonstrate that the person \\"is mentally ill and, because of that illness, is likely to harm himself or others if allowed his liberty.\\" In Oregon, the standard that the allegedly mentally ill person \\"Peter [h]as been committed and hospitalized twice in the last three years, is showing symptoms or behavior similar to those that preceded and led to a prior hospitalization and, unless treated, will continue, to a reasonable medical probability, to deteriorate to become a danger to self or others or unable to provide for basic needs\\" may be substituted for the danger to self or others standard. In Texas, the standard is that, in the judgment of the person seeking involuntary commitment, 1) the person is mentally ill, and 2) because of that mental illness \\"there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or to others unless the person is immediately restrained\\".Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573. The Section lists criteria if the person seeking commitment is a peace officer, guardian of the person of a ward under age 18, or another adult (who must list his/her relationship to the person). The Utah standard is that the proposed patient has a mental illness that poses a substantial danger.Utah Code Annotated ¬ß 62A-15-631(3) (2003) \\"Substantial danger\\" means the person, by his or her behavior, due to mental illness: (a) is at serious risk to: (i) commit suicide, (ii) inflict serious bodily injury on himself or herself; or (iii) because of his or her actions or inaction, suffer serious bodily injury because he or she is incapable of providing the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, and shelter; (b) is at serious risk to cause or attempt to cause serious bodily injury; or (c) has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily injury on another.Utah Code Annotated ¬ß 62A-15-602(13) (2003) In Wisconsin, the District II Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that patients with Alzheimer's disease cannot be involuntary committed under Chapter 51 and can only be involuntarily committed for residential care and custody under Chapter 55. The court left open whether this applies also to persons with a dual diagnosis. =Controversy about liberty= The impact of involuntary commitment on the right of self- determination has been a cause of concern. Critics of involuntary commitment have advocated that \\"the due process protections... provided to criminal defendants\\" be extended to them. The Libertarian Party opposes the practice in its platform. Thomas Szasz and the anti-psychiatry movement have also been prominent in challenging involuntary commitment. The American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH) was an organization founded in 1970 by Thomas Szasz, George Alexander, and Erving Goffman for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly involuntary commitment, against individuals. The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the American Journal of Public Health and American Journal of Psychiatry. The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, The Abolitionist. The organization was dissolved in 1980. A small number of individuals in the U.S. have opposed involuntary commitment in those cases in which the diagnosis forming the justification for the involuntary commitment rests, or the individuals say it rests, on the speech or writings of the person committed, saying that to deprive the person of liberty based in whole or part on such speech and writings violates the First Amendment. Other individuals have opposed involuntary commitment on the basis that they claim (despite the amendment generally being held to apply only to criminal cases) it violates the Fifth Amendment in a number of ways, particularly its privilege against self-incrimination, as the psychiatrically examined individual may not be free to remain silent, and such silence may actually be used as \\"proof\\" of his \\"mental illness\\". Although patients involuntarily committed theoretically have a legal right to refuse treatment, refusal to take medications or participate in other treatments is noted by hospital staff. Court reviews usually are heavily weighted toward the hospital staff, with the patient input during such hearings minimal. In Kansas v. Hendricks, the U.S. Supreme Court found that civil commitment is constitutional regardless of whether any treatment is provided. =Alternatives= Accompanying deinstitutionalization was the development of laws expanding the power of courts to order people to take psychiatric medication on an outpatient basis. Though the practice had occasionally occurred earlier, outpatient commitment was used for many people who would otherwise have been involuntarily committed. The court orders often specified that a person who violated the court order and refused to take the medication would be subject to involuntary commitment. Involuntary commitment is distinguished from conservatorship and guardianship. The intent of conservatorship or guardianship is to protect those not mentally able to handle their affairs from the effects of their bad decisions, particularly with respect to financial dealings. For example, a conservatorship might be used to take control of the finances of a person with dementia, so that the person's assets and income are used to meet their basic needs, e.g., by paying rent and utility bills. Advance psychiatric directives may have a bearing on involuntary commitment. =Individual state policies and procedures= US military The service member can be held under the so-called Boxer law (DoD Directive 6490.04). California District of Columbia In the District of Columbia, any police officer, physician, or mental health professional can request to have an individual evaluated at St. Elizabeths Hospital, where they may be detained for up to 48 hours at the direction of the physician on duty. A family member or concerned citizen can also petition the Department of Mental Health, but the claim will be evaluated prior to the police acting upon it. To be held further requires that a request be filed with the Department of Mental Health. However, this only can keep the patient involuntary admitted for up to seven days. For further commitment, the patient is evaluated by a mental health court, part of family court, for which the public defender assists the patient. This can result in the patient being held up to one year at which point the patient returns to mental health court. This is different for someone first admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital due to criminal charges. If found to not ever become competent for trial, they will be evaluated via a Jackson hearing for possible continued commitment to protect the public. If they have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, their dangerousness is evaluated at a Bolton Hearing.Kenber, Billy (4 June 2015) A plea for sanity The Times, (Example of Raymond Gregory pleading insanity to a minor criminal offence in Washington DC) Retrieved 4 June 2015 Florida Maryland In Maryland, any person may request, via an Emergency Evaluation form, that another individual be evaluated against their will by an emergency room physician for involuntary admission. If the judge concurs, he will direct the police to escort the individual to the hospital. A licensed physician, psychologist, social worker, or nurse practitioner who has examined the patient or a police officer may bring a potential patient to the emergency room for forced evaluation without approval from a judge. The patient may be kept in the hospital for up to thirty hours. If by then two physicians, or one physician and one psychologist then decide that the patient meets the Maryland criteria for an involuntary psychiatric admission, then he or she may be kept inpatient involuntarily for up to ten days. During this time, an administrative law judge determines if the following criteria for longer civil commitment are met: *a person has a mental illness; *a person needs inpatient care or treatment; *a person presents a danger to themselves or to others; *a person is unable or unwilling to be admitted voluntarily; *there is no available, less restrictive form of care or treatment to meet the person's needs. Texas In Texas a person may be subject to involuntary commitment by: *A peace officer, without a warrant, if A) the officer believes that 1) the person is mentally ill, 2) because of that mental illness \\"there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or to others unless the person is immediately restrained\\", and B) the officer also believes that there is insufficient time to obtain a warrant.Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573.001(a). *A guardian of the person of a ward under the age of 18, if the guardian believes that 1) the ward is mentally ill, 2) because of that mental illness \\"there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the ward or to others unless the ward is immediately restrained\\".Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573.003(a). *An adult may file an application for emergency detention of another person; the application must meet seven outlined items which indicate that, in the applicant's belief, that the person to be detained is mentally ill and poses a threat to the person or to others, why the person considers this to be the case, and the relationship of the applicant to the person.Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573.011. A person cannot be held for more than 48 hours, and must be released by 4 PM on the day the 48-hour period ends, unless: *a written order for protective custody is obtained, *the 48-hour period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, or before 4 PM on the first succeeding business day (in which case the person may only be held until 4 PM on the first succeeding business day), or *if extremely hazardous weather events exist or a disaster occurs (in which case, the period may be extended in 24-hour increments by written order specifically stating the weather event or disaster).Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573.021 Upon release, unless the person was arrested or objects, the person (at the expense of the county where s/he was apprehended) must be transported to either 1) the place where s/he was apprehended, 2) the person's residence in the state, or 3) another suitable location.Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 573.024. Virginia As of 2008, Virginia was one of only five states requiring imminent danger to involuntarily commit someone. But after the Virginia Tech Massacre, there was significant political consensus to strengthen the protections for society and allow more leniency in determining that an individual needed to be committed against their will. * the person has a mental illness and there is a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the person will, in the near future, (1) cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatening harm and other relevant information, if any * the person has a mental illness and there is a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the person will, in the near future, (2) suffer serious harm due to his lack of capacity to protect himself from harm or to provide for his basic human needs \\"Imminent danger\\" was found to have too much variability throughout Virginia due to vagueness. The new standard is more specific in that substantial likelihood is more clear. However, to not limit potential detainee's freedoms too much it is characterized by the time limit of near future. \\"Recent acts\\" is legally established to require more than a mere recitation of past events.

They lie within the High Tauern National Park on the border between the Austrian states of East Tyrol and Salzburg. They were given their name at a meeting of the Austrian Alpine Club on 15 March 1865 at the request of cartographer, Franz Keil who wanted to honour the geographer and Alpine researcher, Friedrich Simony. The peaks were first climbed on 28 July 1871 by Stuttgarter alpinist, Theodor Harpprecht and mountain guide, Josef Schnell.Eduard Richter: Die Erschliessung der Ostalpen, Vol. III, Berlin, 1894, p. 149 f.  Location and elevation  According to official surveys by the Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying, the Western Simonyspitze (Westliche Simonyspitze, ) is the higher of the two tops at . The Eastern Simonyspitze (√ñstliche Simonyspitze, ) to the northeast, reaches 3,442 m. According to other sources both peaks are 3,488 m. To the north, on the Salzburg side, the mountains drop into the glacier of Krimmler Kees above the valley of Krimmler Achental. To the south (East Tyrol) the Simonykees flows into the Maurertal valley. To the west, an ar√™te runs across to the 3,426 m high Umbalk√∂pfl and the 3,499-metre-high Dreiherrenspitze.Immediately to the southwest of the Western Simonyspitze is the 3,440-metre-high Simonyschneide (). It is often wrongly called the Western Simonyspitze. Likewise the 3,415-metre-high ar√™te between the two Simonyspitzen is often described in many sources as the \\"Simonyschneid\\" or \\"Simonyschneide\\". To the northeast the chain continues to the 3,225 m high Vorderer Maurerkeeskopf.  Alpinism  The firn-covered Eastern Simonyspitze is important from a mountaineering perspective, but is not often climbed. The normal route along the southeastern ar√™te is rated as UIAA grade II. The start point for the roughly 4 hour ascent is the Essener-Rostocker Hut (2,208 m) in the Maurertal valley. Other routes run up the south flank (II), east flank (III-), northeastern ar√™te (III) and Western Hanging Glacier (Westlichen H√§ngegletscher, III+). The North Face (IV) is the most difficult climb and may also be reached via the Western Hanging Glacier from the Warnsdorfer Hut (2,336 m) in the Krimmler Achental. The summit is also ascended in winter up the Simonykees as a ski tour. The Western Simonyspitze is rarely visited; most alpinists only climb up to the Simonyschneide in front of it. The normal way runs from the southwest to the summit at grade II. Of climbing interest are the northwestern ar√™t, an ice tour from the Krimmler Kees, the North Face (combined terrain V-, 50¬∞) and the ice climb up the North Face, at 65¬∞, one of the steepest ice tours in the Venediger Group. Other genuine glacier climbs like the South Flank or the Northwestern Hanging Glacier (Nordwestliche H√§ngegletscher) are considered dangerous and frequently impassible. In winter the Simonyschneide to the southwest is a popular ski touring destination. The crossing between the Western and Eastern Simonyspitze along a frequently corniced ar√™te and the Harpprechtturm tower is assessed as grade III.  Name and climbing history  The name of the mountain was proposed in 1865 by the cartographer and topographer (Geoplastiker), Franz Keil, who named it after the geographer and alpine researcher, Friedrich Simony. Hitherto the Eastern Simonyspitze had frequently been wrongly called the Gro√üer Geiger. Today, in addition to the feminine form of the name (Simonyspitze), the masculine versions also occur (i.e. Westlicher and √ñstlicher Simonyspitz) in German. The first ascent of both summits was achieved on 28 July 1871 by Theodor Harpprecht and Josef Schnell. They climbed up the present-day normal route to the Eastern Simonyspitze, crossed the linking ar√™te and came down from the Western Simonyspitze over the South Flank. On 2 August that year they also made the first ascent of the Simonyschneide. Ludwig Purtscheller and Johann Grill, who first ascended the south flank (1881) and northeastern ar√™te (1882) of the Eastern Simonyspitze, two more well-known alpinists were added to the climbing history of the Simonyspitzen.Mittheilungen des Alpenvereins, Munich, 1882, p. 188  References  Alpine Club map No. 36, Venedigergruppe, 2007 Bundesamt f√ºr Eich- und Vermessungswesen: Austrian 1:50,000 map series, AMAP Online, retrieved 2 July 2012  Literature  *  External links  * Simonyspitze at Summitpost.org Category:Alpine three-thousanders Category:Mountains of the Alps Category:Mountains of Salzburg (state) Category:Mountains of Tyrol (state) Category:Venediger Group ","title":"Simonyspitzen"},{"id":"45531635","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1960 in Laos.

Biography  Gaber has been making satirical videos that criticise religions for years. By July 2019, his YouTube channel had over 253,000 subscribers, making him one of the best-known critics of religion in Egypt. With titles such as \\"Does God exist?\\", \\"Evolution and religion are incompatible\\" and \\"Criticising religion is a human right\\", his videos brought him into legal troubles. The Egyptian law against blasphemy, Article 98(f) of the Penal Code, was eventually used to justify his arrest. = Argument with teacher = Gaber enrolled as a student at Suez Canal University in Ismailia. He claimed to be 'one of the best students in class', but that changed when he got into a verbal argument with his chemistry teacher, who called homosexuality a 'sin' and said gay people 'should be crucified in the middle of the street'. A few months after this incident, fellow students forwarded some of his Facebook postings to the rector, who reported it to the police. = Arrest and court case = At 3:00 a.m. on October 27, 2013, three armored state security cars and an army vehicle arrived at Gaber's house. A number of state security agents entered his apartment, conducted a search, and confiscated all of his property, including but not limited to his school papers and documents, books, his PC, mobile phone, and his money. After that they threw him in the car and took him to jail. Gaber claimed the prison guards mistreated him and punished 'every part' of him. On December 3, 2013, the court agreed to release Gaber after paying 7500 LE (2500 for the \\"Contempt of Religion\\" charge and 5000 for \\"spreading immoral values and abnormal thoughts that provoke and disturb the public peace and the national security of Egypt.\\") He was released the next day, but his case was ongoing. He was allowed to resume his studies, but suspected the teachers deliberately made him repeatedly fail his tests. On February 16, 2015 Gaber (aged 22) was found guilty and sentenced to one year in jail. He was allowed to appeal if he paid 1,000 LE, but instead Gaber went into hiding. By that time, the rector had quit the university, and claimed he did not recall the 'incident'. = Hiding and re-arrest = Gaber's whereabouts were unknown, but Gaber was still releasing pro-science and pro- human rights videos on YouTube. On March 31, 2018 Gaber published a tweet about an imminent arrest, call for calm among his supporters and claimed he would \\"keep making videos when i get out.. i'll write the scripts in prison.\\" On Saturday May 5, 2018, Gaber was arrested once again and imprisoned. Several media associated his arrest with a large number of arrests around the time of the March 2018 reelection of president El-Sisi, including a fellow satirical video maker named Shady Abuzaid (or Shadi Abuzeid) a week after Gaber. = Escape attempts = Mina Ahadi called for solidarity with Gaber on 26 July 2019 (German). On October 1, 2018, Gaber tweeted saying that his passport was confiscated at an Egyptian airport, and that he was banned from leaving the country. He also said that there were two \\"different ongoing blasphemy charges\\" against him, and that he couldn't share more details. As of October 12, 2018, the total number of felony charges against him, each one of them punishable up to 15 years in Egyptian prison, amounted to five \\"ranging from blasphemy, insulting Islam, contempt of religion, supporting homosexuality, shaking the peace of the society and 'religious extremism'\\". In late January 2019, Gaber made an online appeal to aid him financially in order to escape from Egypt with a new nationality, such as that of Dominica, after being stopped at the airport when travelling to Malaysia in 2018. He obtained a few thousand dollars shortly after launching the crowdfunding campaign. However, the action was not progressing according to plan, and on 11 July Gaber made an emotional appeal on Twitter, saying that he had almost lost all hope and was \\"on the verge of committing suicide\\" if no help came soon. Mina Ahadi of the Central Council of Ex-Muslims called for solidarity with Gaber, and pleaded with the German government to commence negotiations to get him to Germany or elsewhere in Europe.  YouTube Videos  = Is ISIS Islamic = In September 2016, Gaber uploaded on YouTube a video raising the question is ISIS Islamic. The video gained more than 700 thousand views. In the video, Gaber expresses annoyance with the phrase \\"Daesh [ISIS] does not represent Islam\\" commonly heard in Egypt, and expressed also by Al-Azhar , the leading center of Sunni Islam in Egypt and the middle east. He claimed that the history of Islam is filled with violence and in any Islamic country, there will always be organized groups like ISIS, or people committing crimes in the style of ISIS. Adding that most people are ignorant about the real history of Islam, that directly after the death of the Islamic prophet Mohamed, began the Muslim conquest of India. The conquest, he cites, is recorded as the bloodiest conquest in history. The total number of people that died because of the crusaders, he said, is 1.7 million, while he cites the total number of people who died because of the Muslim conquest of India alone is estimated around 60 to 80 million people, out of originally a population of 400 million people. Gaber blames the Muslims intent to spread Islam in a country, with only Buddhists and Hindus, was the reason that they committed mass murder, destruction of their holy places, mass rape and enslavement of the women and children. This history, Gaber continues shall never be taught in the schools [his intention is schools in Egypt and other middle eastern Muslim countries]. Gaber argues that Daesh [ISIS] are not extremist, they are well read and well educated about the Islamic religion, its history, and they are trying to repeat this history today. Gaber also challenges the Muslim viewer asking if they are upset about Daesh's beheadings of Christians, why they are not also upset about the Islamic prophet Mohammed's beheadings of 700 Jewish people, including women and children because they refused to convert to Islam. The story about the Jewish village which Gaber talks about is from a 1992 book called ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ®ŸàŸäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ∂Ÿàÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿßÿØÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿµŸÑŸäÿ© in Arabic, which has been translated under the title A Biography of the Prophet of Islam. It is a widely used source in many Muslim websites. In the book, it talks about how the prophet and his companions attacked and corned a Jewish village into surrender. The Jewish village after surrender asked what would the prophet judge them. A Muslim ally of this village told them death, and then the book claims he asked god for forgiveness, probably because he felt guilt about the decision. The prophet Mohammed ordered that they be murdered, their money to be taken as bounty, except the children who have not yet hit puberty, they are to be taken as slaves. They gathered all the men and women and pubescent children and slit their throats and threw them in a big pit. The books claims only 400 where killed, but cites in footnotes that it is not sure exactly the number, it could be up to 900. The book claims the only survivors of this genocide where 3 because they claimed they are Muslims, two more because the companions of the prophet protected them from murder, maybe more survived, but not more than one family. The prophet is quoted in the book as saying \\"I have done as God commanded\\". The prepubescent children, the book continues, who were spared death, were sold as slaves in order for the prophet and his companions to buy more weapons and horses.

Also known as Plains Villagers, this pre-Columbian culture cultivated maize and other crops, hunted bison and other game, and gathered wild plants for food. The people generally lived in hamlets of a few dwellings adjacent to flood plains of rivers such as the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in Oklahoma and Texas. Thousands of hamlets have been identified.Drass, Richard. R. (1998), \\"The Southern Plains Villagers\\" in Archaeology on the Great Plains, W. Raymond Wood, ed., Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, pp. 415-447. Downloaded from JSTOR. The Southern Plains villagers were likely the ancestors, at least in part, of the historic Wichita and other Caddoan peoples. Some of the Southern Plains Villagers survived into the historic era in the 16th century when Spanish explorers first ventured onto the Great Plains. The Wichita's first contact with Europeans was in 1541 when they were visited by Francisco Coronado in Kansas.Schlessier, Karl H., Plains Indians, A.D. 500‚Äì1500 (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994), 355‚Äì359 The semi-agrarian economy of the Southern Plains villagers was always vulnerable due to frequent droughts and climatic variations, although the livelihood of the villagers was enhanced by the periodic abundance of bison.Drass, Richard R. (February 2008), \\"Corn, Beans, and Bison: Cultivated Plants and Changing Economies of the Late Prehistoric Villagers on the Plains of Oklahoma and Northwest Texas\\", Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 53, No. 205, pp 9-10. Downloaded from JSTOR. The Southern Plains villagers, especially on their western fringe, were influenced by the agricultural Ancestral Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande River Valley of New Mexico. They traded bison meat, robes, and stones for tools to the Ancestral Pueblos on their west and to the Caddoans on their east for maize, pottery, and Osage orange wood for making bows.Vehik, Susan C. \\"Trade and Political Development on the Southern Plains\\" (January 2002), American Antiquity, Vol. 67, No. 1, pp. 37-41. Downloaded from JSTOR; Texas Beyond History http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/research/antelope.html, accessed 15 Feb 2015 Archaeologists have divided the Southern Plains villagers into many different archaeological variants based on differences in what has been found of their material possessions. The Redbud Plains variant includes the Paoli, Washita River, Custer, and Turkey Creek phases of western Oklahoma; the Henrietta and Wylie Creek focuses are located in north-central Texas; the Upper Canark variant in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles includes the Antelope Creek Phase, and the Buried City and Zimms complexes; the Apishapa phase in southeastern Colorado; and the Bluff Creek, Wilmore, and Pratt complexes are in south central Kansas. The proto-historic Wichita villages in central Kansas are called the Great Bend aspect.Drass (1998), pp 415-416 Origins In the opinion of archaeologists, the Southern Plains villagers were likely, in whole or part, speakers of Caddoan languages, the ancestors of the historical Wichita, Kichai, and possibly the Pawnee. Some of the easternmost sites of the Southern Plains villagers show an almost unbroken record of occupation for thousands of years and thus it appears, again in whole or part, that the villager's culture developed from people who had long lived in the area rather than being introduced by migrants. The apparent Caddoan origin of the villagers, however, does not preclude the possibility of non-Caddoan speakers and linguistic and ethnic diversity in the region.\\"Putting the Pieces Together:the Harrell Site Reconsidered\\", Texas Before History, http://www.texasbeyondhistorynet/harrell/reconsidered.html, accessed 1 Feb 2015; \\"The Roulston-Rogers site\\" Oklahoma's Past\\" http://www.ou.edu/cas/archsur/counties/seminole.htm , accessed 1 Feb 2015 Three technological developments in the early centuries of the Common Era led to the replacement of nomadic hunter-gatherer cultures by semi-sedentary cultures on the Southern Great Plains: the replacement of spears and the atlatl by the bow and arrow, a more efficient tool for hunting; the introduction of pottery for storage and cookery; and the adoption of maize agriculture as a major source of food. None of these new technologies was likely invented in the Southern Plains region but rather the knowledge seeped into the area from outside. With these new technologies, the population probably expanded and it became possible or necessary for the former hunter- gatherers of the Southern Plains to become semi-sedentary agriculturalists.\\"Putting the Pieces Together: the Harrell Site Reconsidered\\", Texas Before History, http://www.texasbeyondhistorynet/harrell/reconsidered.html, accessed 1 Feb 2015 Characteristics Some of the earliest remains of the Southern Plains Villagers may be in what is called the Paoli phase, located around the Oklahoma town of Paoli and the Washita River Valley and the nearby South Canadian River Valley. Radiocarbon dates for Paoli sites are from AD 900 until about 1250 when the Paoli phase evolved into the Washita River phase, dating from 1250 to 1450. Paoli village sites developed in place from earlier hunter- gatherer settlements. The Paoli and Washita River people lived in hamlets of up to ten thatched-roof houses typically built on terraces overlooking rivers. Hamlets often stood only a few hundred meters from each other indicating a fairly dense population. The Washita phase is distinguished from Paoli by differences in arrowheads, pottery, and architecture.Drass, Richard R. (1999), \\"Redefining Plains Village Complexes in Oklahoma: The Paoli Phase and the Redbud Plains Variant\\", Plains Anthropologist, Vol 44, No. 168, pp. 123-133. Downloaded from JSTOR. These people cultivated maize and indigenous marsh elder, hunted and caught deer, rabbits, fish, and mussels, and gathered edible wild plants such as Chenopodium (goosefoot or lambs-quarters), amaranth, sunflower, little barley, maygrass, dropseed, and erect knotweed. They added beans and squash to their crops around 1200. As cultivation of maize, beans, and squash, the \\"Three Sisters\\" of Native American agriculture, expanded, use of earlier indigenous crops declined. Bison remains are scarce in earlier sites, but bison became more important as a source of food around 1300, indicating that their herds may have become more abundant in the region of the Paoli and Washita settlements.Drass (1999), pp. 123‚Äì133 The Custer (800‚Äì1250) and Turkey Creek phases (1250‚Äì1450) were located further west than the Paoli and Washita phases but on the same Washita and South Canadian Rivers. Custer and Turkey Creek people knapped projectile points stones from the Alibates quarries of the Texas Panhandle. There is no evidence that they grew squash and beans in addition to maize. They possibly had a greater reliance on gathering wild foods rather than cultivating crops. This finding is consistent with the drier climate of western Oklahoma compared to the more easterly Paoli and Washita phases. During the later Turkey Creek phase reliance on bison as a major food source increased.Drass (1999), pp. 133‚Äì137 The Henrietta focus or Henrietta complex extends from the Red River valley of Oklahoma and Texas southward to the Clear Fork of the Brazos River near Graham, Texas. The Henrietta focus dates from approximately AD 1100 to 1500. The best-known site of the focus is Harrell, near Graham, which is also the southernmost major site at which Southern Plains villagers lived. South of Harrell the pre- Columbian Indians in Texas were hunter-gatherers, who apparently did not practice agriculture. The Harrell site features a large cemetery demonstrating that the site was inhabited for thousands of year.\\"The Harrell Site\\", Texas Beyond History, http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/harrell/index.html, accessed 3 Feb 2015 The Wylie focus is located north of Dallas and reflects a blend of the Woodland agricultural society of the Caddo in East Texas and the Great Plains societies to its west. It dates from AD 1000 or earlier.Lynott, Mark J. (August 1977), \\"Radiocarbon Dating the Wylie Focus North Central Texas\\", Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 22, No. 77, pp. 233-327. Downloaded from JSTOR Arrowheads made from Alibates flint found in the Texas panhandle were widely traded by the Southern Plains Villagers. The Upper Canark variant includes the Antelope Creek Phase, Panhandle phase, Optima focus, and the Buried City and Zimms complexes. All these manifestations of Canark were located in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, the Zimms complex extending into western Oklahoma.Gibbon, Guy E. Ed. Archaeology of Pre-Historic Native America: An Encyclopedia. NY: multi-familyRoutledge, 1998, p. 20 The Canark variant dates from about 1100 to 1500. It is distinguished by the stone-slab foundations of its dwellings, which in multifamily and single-family structures. The people of the Canark variant may have borrowed the technology of their construction from the Pueblo peoples in the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and were possibly related linguistically to the Pueblo speakers. The majority opinion; however, is that they spoke a Caddoan language and were related to the Southern Plains villagers living to their east.Drass (1998), pp. 415-418 The people of the Canark variant grew maize, beans, squash, and probably sunflowers in addition to hunting (mainly bison) and gathering wild food plants. The drought-prone area they occupied is marginal for agriculture without irrigation and the bulk of its 16 to 24 inches annual rainfall arrived in a few thunderstorms that cause flooding. Thus, the Antelope Creek people probably used water harvesting or \\"Ak-Chin\\" dryland farming techniques similar to those practiced by the Ancestral Pueblo peoples.Texas Beyond History. http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/buried city/life.html, accessed Nov 17, 2010; Drass (1998), pp. 415-418 The Apishapa Phase in southeastern Colorado dates from 900 to 1400 and is characterized by stone slab architecture, often in defensible positions on mesas. The Apishaspa culture probably evolved in place from the earlier Graneros phase. They appear to have been primarily hunter-gatherers, but archaeologists have found some evidence of maize cultivation. Agriculture, however, was probably relatively unimportant due to the semiarid climate and the rocky canyons and dry mesas where many Apishapa dwellings have been found. It is uncertain whether the abundant petroglyphs of the area were the work of the Apishapa people.Drass (1998), pp. 422-425 The Bluff Creek, Pratt, and Wilmore complexes are located in south-central Kansas near and along the tributaries of the Arkansas River. Bluff Creek is the earliest, dating from about 1000 until 1500. Pratt and Wilmore perhaps derive from Bluff Creek, dating from about 1400 until 1500. The Kansas sites are similar to the sites of the Southern Plains Villagers further south in Oklahoma. Along the Arkansas River in northernmost Oklahoma is the Uncas site, which is quite different than the others in the character of its dwellings and pottery and possibly represents an intrusion of unrelated people.Drass (1998), pp. 439-441 Protohistoric period Around 1400, during the Wheeler phase, some Southern Plains Villages moved from small, scattered villages to larger agrarian settlements, particular Little River focus and Lower Walnut focus peoples in south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma. These urban, Southern Plains farmers are sometimes called Coalesced Villagers. Meanwhile, others shifted their subsistence patterns, to rely less on agriculture and more upon bison-hunting, Several theories have been advanced to explain why many Southern Plains Villagers opted to relay more heavily on bison-hunting. First, Southern Athabascans, the Apaches, moved into the Southern Plains and displaced the villagers. Second, bison populations on the Southern Great Plains fluctuated. They may have increased in numbers around AD 1400, and villagers may have begun to rely less on agriculture and more on hunting which required them to be more mobile and less sedentary. Third, a long-lasting drought or climatic change to drier conditions may have reduced the feasibility of an agricultural economy on the southern plains. These theories are not mutually exclusive.Drass (1998), pp. 446-447 When Coronado traversed the Great Plains of Texas and Oklahoma in 1541, he found only bison- hunting nomads rather than farming villages. The Querechos he found near present day Amarillo, Texas were almost certainly Apaches. The Teyas he found east of present day Lubbock, Texas might also have been Apaches, or perhaps the Caddoan descendants of the Southern Plains villagers. Coronado also found maize-growing Wichita Indians in the land he called Quivira in present-day Rice County, Kansas. In 1601 Juan de O√±ate found the agricultural Rayados, his term for the Wichitas, living in the city of Etzanoa in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas. Both the Quivirans and Rayados were living more than 200 miles east and in much more favorable climates for agriculture than where maize and other crops had been grown by the Southern Plains villagers hundreds of years earlier.Flint, Richard (2008), No Settlement, No Conquest, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, p. 157; Drass, Richard R. and Baugh, Tomothy, G.

Bonzel was beatified in 2013 by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Regina Christine Wilhelmine Bonzel was born on 17 September 1830, the elder of two daughters of Friedrich Edmund and Angela Maria Liese Bonzel. She was familiarly called \\"Aline\\". Her mother sent her to study at the Ursulines in Cologne and it was there that her vocation matured. Her parents were opposed to her desire to enter religious life but she nonetheless entered the Third Order of Saint Francis in 1850. Alongside eight other women she joined and took the name of \\"Maria Theresia\\". In 1859, Maria and two other women founded a monastic community to care for orphans and neglected children. Their work expanded to include the welfare of the poor and health care. On 20 July 1863 the Bishop of Paderborn granted formal approval to the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration .Jones, Kevin J., \\"Colorado miracle spurs German nun's beatification\\", Catholic News Agency, April 3, 2013 During the war years of 1870-71, eight hundred wounded soldiers were cared for by the Sisters from Olpe. During the Kulturkampf, an anticlerical reaction against the growing strength of the Catholic Church, the Sisters were forbidden to receive new candidates. Bonzel decided to begin a new foundation in North America.\\"The Life of Blessed Maria Theresia Bonzel\\", Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration, Mishawaka, Indiana The first missionaries arrived in Lafayette, Indiana, in December 1875 and began their work of caring for the sick. The congregation grew and the Sisters were able to open many new hospitals and schools. Bonzel made three separate voyages across the ocean to visit her Sisters in the United States. By 1882 legal restrictions in Germany had eased, and new members were again admitted. Bonzel died on February 6, 1905 at Olpe. The order at the time of her death had 73 branches in Germany and 49 in North America. Beatification The cause of beatification commenced under Pope John XXIII on 18 September 1961 which bestowed on her the title of Servant of God. The Positio ‚Äì which documented her life of heroic virtue ‚Äì was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints which led to Pope Benedict XVI's declaration of Bonzel to be Venerable on 27 March 2010. An investigation into a presumed miracle took place in 2001 and Pope Francis approved the miracle on 27 March 2013. Cardinal Angelo Amato ‚Äì on behalf of Pope Francis ‚Äì presided over the beatification on 10 November 2013. The miracle involved the cure of a 4-year-old boy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

When I shall have departed hence I shall certainly reach Him: one who has this faith and has no doubt will certainly attain to that Godhead. Thus said Sandilya, yea, thus he said. \\" In these four passages ≈öƒÅ·πá·∏çilya gives us the cosmological proof of the Absolute, the Universal ƒÄtmƒÅn or TajjalƒÅn (Sanskrit:‡§§‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§≤‡§æ‡§®). It is that from which things are born, in which they live and repair. According to one's own karma in this life is shaped the life in the next world. The ƒÄtmƒÅn is a positive entity, both great and small, infinite and infinitesimal, surely reachable after death. That Universal ƒÄtmƒÅn resides in the heart of all as the individual self. My soul is Brahman. He describes in a positive way the process of creation from the ƒÄtmƒÅn, TajjalƒÅn is the universe identified with the changeless Brahman, who is not bound by space and time, having three attributes ‚Äì creator, preserver and destroyer of the universe, and that the individual self is Brahman in its essential nature. All this is Brahman. The ≈öƒÅ·πá·∏çilya Vidya is part of the Agnirahasyama of the Shatapatha Upanishad, briefly described in the following two passages (SB X.vi.iii.1-2):\\\\- :1. \\"Let him meditate upon the 'true Brahman.' Now, man here, indeed, is possessed of understanding, and according to how great his understanding is when he departs this world, so does he, on passing away, enter yonder world.\\" :2. \\"Let him meditate on the Self, which is made up of intelligence, and endowed with a body of spirit, with a form of light, and with an ethereal nature, which changes its shape at will, is swift as thought, of true resolve, and true purpose, which consists of all sweet odours and tastes, which holds sway over all the regions and pervades this whole universe, which is speechless and indifferent; even as a grain of rice, or a grain of barley, or a grain of millet, or the smallest granule of millet, so is this golden Purusha in the heart; even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky, greater than the ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing things;--that self of the spirit (breath) is my self: on passing away from hence I shall obtain that self. Verily, whosoever has this trust, for him there is no uncertainty. Thus spake Sandilya, and so it is.\\" Here, it is most comprehensively explained that the ƒÄtmƒÅn within the body and the mind etc., is the same as the all-pervading Purusha who is the source, support, power and light of entire creation. The first formulation of Hindu idea of God found in the Shatapatha Brahmana is repeated in Sandilya Vidya. The sage addresses Ishvara (God) as Atman or Purusha or Brahman as the 'creator' and 'overlord' of all things that have been and are to be. The Sandilya Doctrine of Bhakti (faith), called Sandilya Vidya by Vedantasara, lays stress on devotional meditations directed towards Saguna Brahman i.e. Brahman viewed as possessed of qualities. Yajnavalkya extends the doctrine of the same immortal soul in each being by explaining that the soul, which is Brahman consisting of consciousness, mind, etc., based on desire passes from one body to another; the one who is without desire is not reborn and becomes Brahman.

The brigade was formed as a duplicate of the Black Watch Brigade in January 1915. As the name would suggest, it was organized with four battalions of the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), It was dissolved in November 1915 as its constituent battalions were posted to other formations. History In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. As a consequence, the 2/1st Black Watch Brigade was formed in January 1915 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the Black Watch Brigade. It was assembled at Hawick with four 2nd Line battalions of the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) that had been raised in September 1914: * 2/4th (City of Dundee) Battalion raised at Dundee * 2/5th (Angus and Dundee) Battalion raised at Forfar * 2/6th (Perthshire) Battalion raised at Perth * 2/7th (Fife) Battalion raised at St Andrews The brigade was assigned to Coastal Defence duties in Scottish Command. The battalions variously served at Broughty Ferry on Tay Defences (2/4th), Clyde Defences (2/5th), North Queensferry on Forth Defences (2/6th) and Kinghorn also on Forth Defences (2/7th). By June 1915, the battalions was concentrated at Bridge of Earn, Perthshire. The brigade did not remain in existence for very much longer as the battalions were posted away. In October, the 2/4th and 2/5th Black Watch were posted to the 191st (2nd Seaforth and Cameron Highlanders) Brigade, 64th (2nd Highland) Division at Auchterarder and the 2/7th Black Watch joined the 192nd (2nd Gordon Highlanders) Brigade, 64th (2nd Highland) Division at Grangemouth. Finally, in November 1915, the 2/6th also joined the 192nd (2nd Gordon Highlanders) Brigade at Blairgowrie. With that, the brigade passed out of existence.

It begins at U.S. Route 24 (US-24) north of Manhattan and runs north to K-16 southwest of Fostoria. K-13 serves as the only northeasterly route out of Manhattan. The majority of the highway is exclusively in Pottawatomie County, with less than a mile of it existing in Riley County. The first traverse Tuttle Creek State Park, and crosses the Tuttle Creek Lake dam. K-13 was first designated as a state highway in 1927, and at that time ran from US-77 in De Graff northward to Manhattan. By 1932, K-13 was realigned to intersect US-77 further south in El Dorado. By 1933, K-13 was extended north from Manhattan to K-9 north of Barrett. In 1958, K-13 was rerouted to cross the Tuttle Creek Dam and continue northward to K-16 southwest of Fostoria. Then in 1964, K-13's southern terminus was truncated to Manhattan, and the old section along with K-213 was redesignated as K-177. In 1991, K-13 was truncated to its current southern terminus. Route description K-13 crosses the dam at Tuttle Creek Lake K-13 begins at US-24 north of Manhattan and begins travelling northward. It then curves to the northeast and begins to cross the Tuttle Creek Dam. About halfway across the dam the route enters into Pottawatomie County. After crossing the dam, the highway begins to pass through small rolling hills with areas of scattered trees. The highway soon crosses Cedar Creek, then turns north and begins to parallel the creek. It continues north for then turns northeast at a junction with Carnahan Road (RS-1208), which goes north to Olsburg. At this point, the trees disappear and the highway begins to travel through rolling hills covered with grasslands. K-13 continues along the creek for another then turns north again, as it crosses Mud Creek. Just past the curve the landscape transitions to flat rural farmlands and continues northward for about where it intersects Bigelow Road. Just north of here the highway transitions back to small rolling hills and continues north for then intersects Westmoreland Road (RS-539), which goes east to Westmoreland. K-13 continues north for past here, and reaches its northern terminus at K-16 southwest of Fostoria and east of Olsburg. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 1320 vehicles per day near the northern terminus to 2550 vehicles per day near the southern terminus. K-13 is not included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-13 does connect to the National Highway System at its southern terminus at US-24. History K-13 was first designated as a state highway in 1927, by KDOT. At that time it began at US-77 in De Graff, and ran northeastward to Matfield Green, where it turned north. It then reached Cottonwood Falls where it began an overlap with K-57. The two routes continued north to Council Grove, where they began to overlap K-4 for a short distance. Then further north in Dwight, the overlap with K-57 ended and one with K-10 began. K-13 continued north to Alta Vista, where the overlap with K-4 ended. It then continued north and ended in Manhattan. Between 1931 and 1932, K-13 was realigned to go from Matfield Green southwest to US-77 in El Dorado, which bypassed De Graff. By 1933, K-13 was extended north from Manhattan along the west side of the Big Blue River. It then turned northeast, crossed the river, and entered Garrison. From here it went northeast before ending at K-9 north of Barrett. By 1936, K-113 was established from K-13 west of Bigelow north to Blue Rapids. Then on January 14, 1957, K-213 was established from where K-13 crossed the Big Blue River north to Randolph.

In February 2015, Calderwood was announced as the new Chief Medical Officer of Scotland, succeeding Burns.  Resignation  In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, Calderwood apologised for visiting her second home in Earlsferry, Fife, about from her home in Edinburgh, on consecutive weekends with her family, contravening the advice issued by herself in her high-profile role as Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, her own office, and the Scottish Government to stay at home and help limit the spread of the virus. On 5 April 2020 she was visited at home by officers from Police Scotland and warned about her conduct. In a government press conference later that day, she admitted she had visited her holiday home more than once during lockdown and apologised. The most recent visit had been on 4 April 2020. Scottish Labour's shadow health secretary, Monica Lennon, called for Calderwood's resignation, saying \\"The CMO has undermined Scotland‚Äôs pandemic response and if she doesn't offer her resignation the First Minister should sack her.\\" On the afternoon of the 5 April 2020 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that Calderwood would be \\"withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future\\" and explained that the government would be revising its public information campaign. Several hours later, on the evening of 5 April 2020, Calderwood resigned. She issued this statement: \\"People across Scotland know what they need to do to reduce the spread of this virus and that means they must have complete trust in those who give them advice\\". The following morning, Sturgeon told BBC Breakfast that she and Calderwood had had a \\"long conversation\\" on the evening of the 5 April. Sturgeon reported that as a result of this conversation she and Calderwood mutually agreed that Calderwood should stand down from being Chief Medical Officer for Scotland.

Early life Bo Gunnar Almqvist was born on 5 May 1931 in Edsgatan, a small community in Alster, a farming district in the province of Varmland, Sweden, an area noted for its old customs and traditions. He was the youngest child, born eleven years after his siblings, in the family of two sons and three daughters of Oskar Almqvist, a 'landfiskal', effectively the police superintendent of the rural area, and Hulda Almqvist (n√©e Rydberg). Oskar Almqvist died when Bo was fourteen and mother and son moved to the town of Karlstad, where he attended Karlstad L√§roverk, the local secondary school. Hulda Almqvist worked for a time in her family's hat making business. She had a remarkable repertoire of traditional proverbs to be used on any occasion, and her knowledge of folklife crafts and calendar customs deepened her son's interest in the folkways and oral culture of his native region. Career In 1950 Bo entered Uppsala University to study Nordic languages and literature, along with English. He was also intrigued by Irish scholarship and took lessons in the Irish language from Caoimh√≠n √ì Danachair (qv), a visiting professor in Irish studies (1952‚Äì3). Dag Str√∂mb√§ck, professor of folklore at Uppsala, became a lifelong friend and greatly influenced Almqvist's choice of career. Almqvist developed a great interest in, and knowledge of, comparative philology and historical linguistics. After graduating from Uppsala in 1954, he spent a year on a scholarship in Reykjavik studying Icelandic language and literature. On his return to Sweden, a year of compulsory military service, though mostly spent as an attendant in military archives, was far from enjoyable, and Almqvist was glad to return to Iceland in 1956 as a lecturer in Swedish. In 1959 he was awarded one of the first B. Phil. degrees of the University of Iceland (Baccalaureatus Philologi√¶ Islandic√¶). Almqvist returned to work in 1960 to the folklore department in Uppsala University, as docent (1965‚Äì7) and acting professor (1967‚Äì9). He successfully defended his doctoral thesis in Uppsala, and Norr√∂n niddiktning: traditionshistoriska studier i versmagi was eventually published in two volumes, in 1965 and 1972. His findings, on the magical power of satire and attitudes to manliness in Old Icelandic poetry, were regarded as a major contribution to the study of Old Norse literature and to ethnography. From 1953, when he attended a summer school in UCD, Almqvist spent months at a time doing fieldwork in Ireland, especially in Dunquin and Dingle, Co. Kerry. He made friends with interviewees, including Mich√©al √ì Gaoith√≠n (qv), son of Peig Sayers (qv), and traditional storytellers such as M√≠che√°l √ì Gaoith√≠n and C√°it ‚ÄòBab‚Äô Feirit√©ar Citation needed, collecting many traditional stories and hundreds of proverbs. Dunquin locals nicknamed him 'An Lochlannach' ('The Viking'). In 1972 he moved to Ireland permanently to take up positions as professor of folklore in UCD and director of the Irish Folklore Archive (later the National Folklore Collection) (Coimisi√∫n B√©aloideasa √âireann in Irish). Fluent in Irish and the Nordic languages, and also in English, French and German, Almqvist was able to compare and contrast folklore and literature across several traditions, drawing on linguistic clues and on fieldwork undertaken in Scotland and Nordic countries as well as Ireland. His wide knowledge was evident in over ninety published articles and several books. His scholarly reputation and European perspective underpinned the development of the study of folklore as an academic discipline in Ireland through the introduction of new courses and inspiring fieldwork, and his influence hastened the disappearance of the rather parochial attitude to Irish tradition evident in some earlier studies. From 1968 he was a member of the editorial board of Tidskrift for Nordisk folkeminneforskning (later Scandinavian yearbook of folklore). Later life In his long involvement with B√©aloideas, the journal of the Folklore of Ireland Society, he monitored and encouraged study of all aspects of Irish and comparative folklife studies. He was editor of B√©aloideas in 1971‚Äì3 and 1977‚Äì9, advisory editor from 1981, and from 1972 general editor of the publications of Comhairle Bh√©aloideas √âireann. He also wrote a history of the Irish Folklore Commission (1979). Almqvist trained most of the folklore scholars of the next generation. His influence on them and popularity with international colleagues was evident in two festschriften, Viking ale (1991) a collection of his own major articles published to honour his sixtieth birthday, and Northern lights (2001) for his seventieth. Collaborative publications included material recorded from Peig Sayers (I will speak to you all (2009)). Almqvist was a member of the Royal Irish Academy (elected 1981) and of the Swedish Kungliga Gustav Adolfs Akademien, as well as other learned societies. Almqvist also had a notable interest in philology and comparative literature; his enthusiasm for tracing the not always obvious connections between medieval literature and contemporary folklore led to the introduction of a new course in UCD. One of his students on that course was √âil√≠s N√≠ Dhuibhne, a writer and folklorist. She and Almqvist married years later in 1982 after his first marriage ended, and they had two sons, Ragnar and Olaf. Almqvist's first marriage, in Iceland, had been to Jane Houston (d. 2018), an American textile artist and photographer, who became an expert on traditional Irish white embroidery; they had one daughter, Marja. After a short illness, Bo Almqvist died on 9 November 2013 in Loughlinstown Hospital, Dublin. His funeral was from the Church of our Lady Seat of Wisdom, Belfield, to Mount Jerome crematorium.

Micha≈Ç Tomaszek and Zbigniew Adam Strza≈Çkowski, and Alessandro Dordi were murdered on 9 August and 25 August 1991 respectively. Both Polish Franciscans dedicated their work to the faithful of Peru in charitable and merciful acts that appealed to their Franciscan charism, taking as their models for their work both Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Maximilian Kolbe. In response to a drought in 1989, the two friars brought with them food from Caritas to cater to the immediate needs of the people. Yet the two also catechized the faithful and preached on various saints, in the process, revitalizing the faith of the Peruvian people. Dordi served in Peru since 1980 and tended to the social needs of the Peruvian people while assisting with rural development programs and for his esteemed preaching abilities. Pope Francis gave approval on 3 February 2015 to their beatification after affirming their martyrdom, and the celebration of beatification was celebrated in Peru by Cardinal Angelo Amato on 5 December 2015. A miracle attributed to the three will be required for their eventual canonization. Biographies =Micha≈Ç Tomaszek= Tomaszek was born on 23 September 1960 and was a professed member of the Conventual Franciscans; he received the Franciscan habit on 4 October 1980 on the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi. Tomaszek was baptized a month after his birth in Saint Michael's parish in his home town and was an altar boy at the time he received his First Communion in 1969 at the same time his father died. He graduated from high school in 1975 and continued his studies in a Franciscan seminary, professing his temporary vows in 1981. He commenced his novitiate after five years of study and studied theology from 1981 to 1987. He studied both philosophy and theology and defended his thesis on moral theology He was ordained to the priesthood on 23 May 1987. On 24 July 1989, he was dispatched to Peru and despite threats against him, he continued his missionary activities alongside fellow Franciscan Zbigniew Adam Strza≈Çkowski. In 1991, he was abducted and murdered by the Shining Path Communist guerilla faction. =Zbigniew Adam Strza≈Çkowski= Strza≈Çkowski was born on 3 July 1958 and was a professed member of the Conventual Franciscans. He was baptized a week following his birth and made his First Communion in 1967. He graduated from secondary schooling in 1978 and he joined the Franciscan order the following year. He studied both philosophy and theology while in the seminary and after this was ordained as a priest on 7 June 1986 by Henryk Gulbinowicz. He served as the assistant rector at the minor seminary in Legnica for two years. He professed his solemn vows on 8 December 1984 prior to his ordination. He commenced missionary work in Peru from November 1988. He tended to the ill who often referred to him as \\"our little doctor\\" since he helped the ill to get better through words of comfort or providing them with the Eucharist. It was during the course of his work in Peru that he met Micha≈Ç Tomaszek. Both were abducted in 1991 and were murdered by a Communist guerilla group. =Alessandro Dordi= Tomb of Alessandro Dordi. Dordi was born on 23 January 1931 and he served as a priest in his birthplace of Bergamo. Dordi had administered to Italian immigrants in Switzerland and he served in watch factories there as a worker-priest. It was there that he became aware of the concerns of the working class and decided to place great focus on social matters. He was also a member of the missions of Fidei Donum and travelled to Peru where he did work in the missions there. He served in the Santa parish and was committed to the farming sector while helping them implement rural development programs. At the time he learned of the fates of the two Polish friars' fate, Tomaszek and Strza≈Çkowski with whom he was friends with, he kept telling his close collaborators that he would be the next victim of the Shining Path group; indeed, they deemed Dordi a great threat. He was returning from a chapel to baptize children and celebrate Mass when he was ambushed and shot, thus murdered in 1991. Beatification The cause for the beatification of the three priests commenced under Pope John Paul II with the declaration of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) on 5 June 1995 which opened the cause in Peru to investigate their deaths and both their lives and their work in Chimbote; the process spanned from 9 August 1996 until 25 August 2002. The documentation was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 2011 after the diocesan process closed. Pope Francis approved the beatification in 2015 which occurred on 5 December 2015; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the mass. The pope venerated the relics of the two Poles at a Franciscan convent on the occasion of his visit to Poland for World Youth Day 2016. The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments approved the request of the Franciscans - on 26 February 2016 - that the liturgical feast for the two Poles be moved from 9 August to 7 June.

History  George Washington, first President of the United States From a simple one-day parade of Ford Model Ts to an event that attracts thousands of visitors every year, the Eustis GeorgeFest has increased in both size and scope. While it continues to grow, the primary theme of the festivities has never changed. GeorgeFest is a patriotic event held in honor of America's founding father, George Washington. In 1876, the Ocklawaha House was built as a hotel to serve the many tradesman traveling through the area. GeorgeFest's modest beginnings can be traced back to this building which still stands today as the oldest remaining hotel in the area. In 1902 construction began to enlarge the hotel. On February 22, 1902, while the hotel was under construction, the residents of Eustis held a holiday in honor of Washington and in celebration of Florida's early heritage. The event would continue to be held once a year on February 22 in honor of George Washington's birthday. However, the festivities were later spread out over several weeks and were eventually assigned to the last weekend of February where they remain today.

After winning a handicap race on his first appearance as a three-year-old he was campaigned un France where he won the Prix La Force before recording his biggest success when he won the Prix du Jockey Club by six lengths. He was beaten in his three remaining races that year but returned as a four-year-old to win the Grand Prix de Deauville. In the autumn of 2000 he was exported to Saudi Arabia where he had no success racing on dirt and had no impact at stud. Holding Court was suited by front- running tactics and showed a marked preference for soft ground. Background Holding Court was a bay horse with a white blaze bred in the United Kingdom by Pauline & John Good. He was from the first crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Hernando, who went on to sire other major winners including Sulamani and Look Here. His dam Indian Love Song was a poor racehorse, who failed to win in 33 races, but came from a good family, being a granddaughter of The Oaks runner-up Maina. Apart from Holding Court, Indian Love Song produced Tomba (also by Hernando) who won thirteen races including the Prix de la For√™t. The Goods sent their colt into training with Brian Meehan at Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Holding Court finished sixth in a maiden race over seven furlongs on firm ground at Haydock Park Racecourse on 4 September. In his three remaining races of 1999 the colt was ridden by Frankie Dettori. On 30 September Holding Court started at odds of 12/1 for the Westley Maiden Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and finished second of the fourteen runners, beaten a head by the favourite Qamous. Two weeks later, he started for a minor stakes race over heavy ground at Haydock and recorded his first win, leading from the start and beating Cover Up (later to win the Ascot Stakes, Queen Alexandra Stakes and Jockey Club Cup) by six lengths. On his final race of the season, Holding Court was moved up sharply in class for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 23 October. He started at odds of 13/2 but was never in serious contention and finished eighth of the nine runners behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Aristotle. =2000: three-year-old season= For the 2000 season, Holding court was transferred to the Newmarket stable of Michael Jarvis. Philip Robinson took over the ride and partnered the colt in all but one of his subsequent European races. On his first appearance of the season, the colt carried top weight of 133 pounds in a ten and a half furlong handicap race on heavy ground at Haydock in April. He led from the start and won by three and a half lengths. In the following month he was sent to France for the first time to contest the Group Three Prix La Force (a trial race for the Prix du Jockey Club) over 2400 metres and started 2.9/1 second favourite behind the previously unbeaten Bonnet Rouge. Ridden by the locally based Olivier Peslier he went to the front from the start and went clear in the straight to win by three lengths from the favourite, with a gap of two and a half lengths back to the other three runners. On 4 June, Holding Court started at odds of 6.1/1 in a field of fourteen colts for 163rd running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres on very soft ground at Chantilly Racecourse. The Hamdan Al Maktoum entry headed by the Prix Noailles winner Kutub started 2.1/1 favourite, whilst the other contenders included Ciro (Grand Crit√©rium, Prix Lupin), Cosmographe (Prix l'Avre), Roscius (Predominate Stakes), Lord Flasheart (Prix de Cond√©, Prix Hocquart) and Millenary (Chester Vase). Robinson sent Holding Court into the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged. He drew away from the field in the straight and won by six lengths from Lord Flasheart, with Circus Dance taking third just ahead of Kutub, Broche and Ciro. He was the fourth British-trained colt to win the race in eleven years following Old Vic (1989), Sanglamore (1990) and Celtic Swing (1995). After the race Robinson said \\"He didn't just quicken once-he quickened twice. I knew it would take a good horse to get to me and I can't believe how far he's won\\" whilst Jarvis commented \\"He's such a galloper that he burns them off. He loves to bowl along, and when the rains came I thought the race looked ideal. When he won the Prix la Force his final fractions were those of a six-furlong horse. He's not just a stayer.\\" Four weeks later, Holding Court was matched against The Derby winner Sinndar in the Irish Derby after his owners paid a supplementary entry fee of IR¬£85,000. Before the race Robinson said that he would be \\"supremely confident\\" of beating the Derby winner on soft ground but only \\"hopeful\\" on good going. In the event, the race was run on a surface described as \\"yielding\\" - between good and soft. He started 9/4 second favourite behind his principal opponent, with the 2000 Guineas winner King's Best being the only other horse in the eleven runner field to start at odds of less than 16/1. He tracked the leaders and reached third place in the straight but made no further progress and eventually finished sixth, more than twelve lengths behind Sinndar. Two months later Holding Court was sent to Germany and matched against older horses for the first time in the Grosser Preis von Baden. He took the lead after 400 metres but faded in the straight and finished fifth behind the Deutsches Derby winner Samum. On his final start of the season, Holding Court was dropped in class for the Group Two Prix du Conseil de Paris at Longchamp in October. He began to struggle before half way and finished tailed-off last of the five runners behind Crimson Quest. Jarvis was reportedly \\"mystified\\" by the performance and requested a dope test. =2001: four-year-old season= Holding Court began his third season in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket on 4 May. He briefly took the lead three furlongs out before finishing third behind Millenary and Sandmason. In the Princess of Wales's Stakes two months later he led from the start but was overtaken a quarter of a mile from the finish and finished third behind Mutamam and Little Rock. On 26 August, Holding Court returned to France for the Group Two Grand Prix de Deauville over 2500 metres. He started the 5.3/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Epitre (Prix Hubert de Chaudenay), Maximum Security and Marienbard. Robinson send the horse into the lead as usual and took a five- length lead, which widened to an eight length advantage entering the straight. Marienbard steadily reduced the leaders advantage but could never get on terms and Holding Court won by two and a half lengths, with gaps of two, six and three lengths back to the next three finishers. In October, Holding Court contested France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. He started a 23/1 outsider he was close to the leaders until the last 600 metres, but then faded to finish fifteenth of the seventeen runners behind Sakhee. After his last race in Europe, Holding Court was sold and sent to race in Saudi Arabia where he finished fifth in the HRH Prince Abdullah bin Al Aziz Cup on dirt at Malaz Racecourse (Riyadh) in November and fourth in the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Cup in the following January. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Holding Court stood as a breeding stallion in Saudi Arabia. Pedigree *Holding Court was inbred 3 x 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generation of his pedigree.

Initial ionization occurs as the pressure drops within the inlet tube. Inlet ionization is similar to electrospray ionization in that a reverse phase solvent system is used and the ions produced are highly charged, however a voltage or a laser is not always needed. It is a highly sensitive process for small and large molecules like peptides, proteins and lipids that can be coupled to a liquid chromatograph. Inlet ionization techniques can be used with an Orbitrap mass analyzer, Orbitrap fourier transform mass spectrometer, linear trap quadrupole and MALDI-TOF. Types of inlet ionization =Matrix-assisted inlet ionization= Schematic of matrix-assisted inlet ionization (MAII) In Matrix- assisted inlet ionization (MAII), a matrix which can be a solvent is used at ambient temperature with the analyte of interest as a mixture. The matrix/analyte mixture is inserted into the heated inlet tube through tapping the mixture at the opening end of the tube. For the highly charged ions of the analyte to be produced from ionization, desolvation of the matrix molecules needs to occur. Matrices that can be used include: 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, 2-aminobenzyl alcohol, anthranilic acid, and 2-hydroxyacetophenone. = Laserspray inlet ionization = Schematic of LSII Laserspray inlet ionization (LSII) is a subset of MAII and uses a matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) method. It was originally called atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization however was renamed as LSII to avoid confusion with MALDI and as it was found to be a type of inlet ionization. As all inlet ionization techniques, highly multiply charged ions are produced. A nitrogen laser is used to ablate the solid matrix/analyte into the heated inlet tube, the observed ions are generated at the surface of the matrix/analyte and so the laser is not directly involved in the ionization as was originally thought. LSII can determine protein molecular weights and has been found to detect masses of proteins up to 20,000 Da. The sensitivity of LSII, for protein detection, is higher by an order of magnitude compared to ESI. =Solvent assisted inlet ionization = Schematic of SAII Solvent assisted inlet ionization (SAII) is similar to matrix-assisted inlet ionization however the matrix is a solvent such as water, acetonitrile and methanol. This ionization technique is highly sensitive to small molecules, peptides and proteins. The analyte is dissolved in the solvent and can either be introduced to the heated inlet tube by a capillary column or directly injected into the inlet tube with a syringe or by pipetting. The capillary column is made of fused silica particles with one end submerged in the sample solvent and the other in the end of the heated inlet tube. The solvent flows through the capillary column without the use of a pump due to the pressure difference between ambient pressure and the vacuum. The temperature can vary in the inlet tube from 50 ¬∞C to 450 ¬∞C, with the lower temperature being used if the results obtained from a higher temperature are of good resolution. Solvent assisted inlet ionization can be coupled not only to liquid chromatography (LC) but also to nano LC.  Advantages of inlet ionization  Ionization at atmospheric pressure often leads to a loss of ions during the transfer of the ions from the ambient pressure region to the vacuum of the mass analyzer.Sheehan EW, Willoughby RC. June 13, 2006. U.S. Patent 7,060,976. Ions are lost due to dispersion of analyte spray and 'rim loss' causing fewer ions to reach the vacuum for m/z separation to occur. Initial ionization occurs in the sub-atmospheric pressure region of the heated inlet tube which is directly attached to the vacuum of the mass analyzer and so ion loss is reduced as transfer of the ions does not occur. In LSII the use of the laser increases the image quality of the results by producing better spatial resolution. This is where more pixels are created and so a clearer image is obtained. Multiply charged ions are produced further extending mass range. Multiple methods can be used to fragment molecules producing fragmentation for structural information: electron transfer dissociation (ETD), collision- induced dissociation (CID), and electron capture dissociation (ECD). When using a laser, only small volumes are needed.

It amplifies basal progenitors, controls neural progenitor proliferation and can cause neocortex folding. It is capable of causing neocortex folding in mice. This likely reflects a role for ARHGAP11B in development and evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex, a conclusion consistent with the finding that the gene duplication that created ARHGAP11B occurred on the human lineage after the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage but before the divergence from Neanderthals.Marta Flori et al Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion, Science 27 Mar 2015: Vol. 347, Issue 6229, pp. 1465-1470 DOI: 10.1126/science.aaa1975 Structure ARHGAP11B encodes 267 amino-acids and is a truncated version of ARHGAP11A. ARHGAP11B arose on the human evolutionary lineage after the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage by partial duplication of ARHGAP11A, which is found throughout the animal kingdom and encodes a Rho GTPase-activating-protein (RhoGAP domain). ARHGAP11B exists not only in present-day humans but also in Neandertals and Denisovans. ARHGAP11B comprises most of the GAP-domain (until lysine-220) followed by a novel C-terminal sequence but lacking the C-terminal 756 amino acids of ARHGAP11A. Activity In contrast to full-length ARHGAP11A and ARHGAP11A 1-250, ARHGAP11B, like ARHGAP11A1-220, did not exhibit RhoGAP activity in a RhoA/Rho- kinase‚Äìbased cell transfection assay. This indicates that the C-terminal 47 amino-acids of ARHGAP11B (after lysine-220) constitute not only a unique sequence, resulting from a frameshifting deletion, but also are functionally distinct from their counterpart in ARHGAP11A. In this assay, co-expression of ARHGAP11B along with ARHGAP11A did not inhibit the latter's RhoGAP activity. Function Since several genes involved in mental retardation encode proteins with RhoGAP domains or other proteins in the Rho signalling pathway it does not come as a complete surprise that ARHGAP11B is involved in neocortex folding; however, its precise function is still unknown. It has been reported https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)31036-0 that it is located in mitochondria where it binds to the adenine nucleotide translocator; it does not affect the adenine nucleotide exchange activity of the translocator, but it does lead to delayed opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thus allowing for greater sequestration of calcium. Furthermore, the presence of ARHGAP11B in the mitochondria boosts glutaminolysis, which is most likely due to the ability of mitochondria to sequester more calcium which activates mitochondrial matrix dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle, particularly the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex.

McCarthy has worked for reform across the public, private and community sectors, in education, family planning, human rights, public health, and overseas aid and development, as well as in conservation, heritage, and media.  Biography  Aged sixteen, McCarthy was awarded a teacher scholarship to attend the University of New England and began her professional life as a secondary school teacher, teaching in Sydney, London and Pittsburgh. Her first experience as a political lobbyist came about in 1968 when, newly pregnant, she and her husband joined the Childbirth Education Association, campaigning for, amongst other issues, the rights of fathers to be present at the births of their children. In 1972 she established the NSW branch of the Women‚Äôs Electoral Lobby, before taking on the role of Education, Information and Media Officer with Family Planning Association of NSW in 1975, and eventually that of CEO of the Australian Federation of Family Planning Associations. Her leadership in these issues was quickly recognised with her appointment to the National Women's Advisory Council in 1978, a new office that was to advise the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser on policy issues effecting women. McCarthy has represented Australia at conferences on women‚Äôs health and leadership, education, broadcasting, conservation and heritage and for four years was Chair of the Advisory Committee of WHO Kobe Centre, Japan. McCarthy‚Äôs career as an advocate for women was advanced during a period of significant reform and change when she served as the Deputy Chair of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1983-1991), while also working as General Manager Communications with the Australian Bicentennial Authority (1985-1989). In the education sector, McCarthy was the first woman appointed to the NSW Higher Education Board and also served on the NSW Education Commission. She was a founding member of Chief Executive Women, an organisation established to mentor and support female executives, and served as its president during 1995-96. In 1995 she was appointed to the Economic Planning Advisory Commission‚Äôs four member Task Force report to Prime Minister on Australia's child care needs to 2010.

A digital card, unlike a plastic card, doesn't require any physical representation in the first place as it is fully virtual and hosted online. A digital card can emulate (imitate) any kind of plastic cardhttps://www.theverge.com/2014/8/22/6053967/coin-beta-is-ready-to-swipe but is mostly used with a credit card, loyalty card, health insurance card, driver's license, Social Security number, etc.  History  Front side of the first Magnetic Stripe plastic credit card. Note that the narrow magnetic stripe is on the front of the card. It was later switched to the back side. In 1960 IBM used the magnetic tape to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards, the most common identification and payment method to date. As technological progress emerged in the form of highly capable and always carried smartphones, handhelds and smartwatches, the term \\"digital card\\" was introduced. On May 26, 2011 Google released its own version of a cloud hosted Google Wallet which contains digital cards - cards that can be created online without having to have a plastic card in first place, although all of its merchants currently issue both plastic and digital cards.https://www.google.com/wallet/business/  Additional data  Digital cards are usually stored on a smartphone or a smartwatch. Therefore, informational data from the card's issuer can be transmitted (via Internet) and displayed, such as discounts, news updates, store locations, coupons, etc.  Usage  Identification with a digital card is usually done in several ways: # Displaying a QR code on the customer's smartphone to the identifying host (a cashier i.e.). The unique QR code ensures privacy for every customer. # Engaging an NFC protocol connection by placing the smartphone near the NFC Reader (using host card emulation method). # Using IoB (Identification over Bluetooth, an obsolete method which is rarely used) or PoB (Payment over Bluetooth).

The tetrasulfide group is a polysulfide, which means that it consists of a chain of sulfur atoms. S-S bonds are susceptible to reduction (to thiols), attachment to metals (e.g., for protection against corrosion), and vulcanization. The triethoxysilyl groups are susceptible to hydrolysis, resulting in cross-linking via sol-gel condensation. In the usual application of this chemical, the hydrolyzed siloxy groups attach to silica particles and the polysulfide groups link to the organic polymer.

The river forms in White Plains and flows south until it joins the Mamaroneck River. Approximately of the Sheldrake River flow through Scarsdale, through New Rochelle and through the Town of Mamaroneck. The Sheldrake River is the largest tributary of the Mamaroneck River, which flows into Long Island Sound. The Sheldrake River watershed drains approximately and comprises the upper Sheldrake River (north of Sheldrake Lake) and lower Sheldrake River (south of Sheldrake Lake), the east branch, the main tributary to the east branch, and various smaller tributary streams. The Sheldrake River drainage system encompasses part of Mamaroneck Town, New Rochelle, Scarsdale, and a minor portion of White Plains. Geography From its origin, the river flows south through a medium-density upscale residential neighborhood. The river then enters a culvert running partly under Fenway Golf Course, where it re-surfaces and drains into Fenway Pond. From the pond, the river flows south/southwest past the Heathcote Five Corners intersection from Scarsdale to New Rochelle, eventually ending up in Carpenter Pond.Carpenter's Pond The river flows over the dam at Carpenter Pond, where it widens to an average width of 15 feet and then flows south under the Hutchinson River Parkway and along Pine Brook Boulevard for approximately where it enters Sheldrake Lake. The river is fed from the reservoir over a spillway into the adjacent Goodliffe Pond. A dam and spillway at the south end of Goodliffe Pond drains into a channel that flows east through the Bonnie-Briar Golf Course. From Goodliffe Pond, the Sheldrake River flows through Mamaroneck Town nearly parallel to Weaver Street and south to Valley Stream Road. At this point, the Sheldrake River is joined by the east branch. The Sheldrake River flows through a series of small waterfalls to Gardens Lake (also known as the Duck Pond); Gardens Lake is circular in shape and approximately wide. Downstream from Gardens Lake, the river turns northeast through an industrial section of Mamaroneck Village and carried in culverts underneath the Interstate 95, joining the Mamaroneck River just south of the interstate at Columbus Park in Mamaroneck Village business district. The East Branch of the Sheldrake River originates in Scarsdale and flows south through the Bonnie-Briar Country Club to meet the east tributary at Fenimore Road. Below Fenimore Road, the east branch flows through Rockland Avenue to meet the Sheldrake River below Valley Stream Road. The Sheldrake River and east branch have been classified by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as Class C. According to this state water quality classification, Class C watercourses should be suitable for fishing and fish propagation and discharges to these watercourses must meet standards that enable those uses. Class C watercourses also are suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation even though other factors may limit the use for that purpose. Water quality standards for Class C watercourses include limitations on fecal coliform, pH, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen. Tributaries Two principal tributaries enter the Mamaroneck River, one from the east and one from the west. The East Branch of the Mamaroneck River is the furthest upstream tributary along the Mamaroneck River and originates in north Harrison near the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Anderson Hill Road. The West Branch originates just south of the Hutchinson River Parkway near Mamaroneck Avenue. =East Branch= The East Branch of the Mamaroneck River is 3.3 miles long. The main stem is 1.9 miles long north of its junction with the east branch. The east branch originates from a small pond in north Harrison at about 400 feet above sea level and then flows southeast 0.7 miles into Forest Lake. South of Forest Lake, it flows westerly to its confluence with the main stem. Spring Lake, also known as Croker Pond, is approximately 900 feet above the confluence of the east branch and main stem. =West Branch= The West Branch of the Mamaroneck River is the smallest of the river's two primary tributaries, draining an area of 2.3 square miles just south and southeast of downtown White Plains. The west branch originates from a wetland and pond and flows about 2.75 miles south / southwest through several storm water management basins to its confluence with the main stem near the intersection of Mamaroneck Avenue and Hutchinson River Parkway.

The documentary made by the Irish broadcaster called Suffer Little Children aired hours before Mother Teresa died on 5 September 1997.  Television award  She won a Sony RT√â Irish national television short film award for Elaine in Wonderland on 22 December 1990 aged 15. The short film first aired on national television on 17 November 1990.  Media  The global business awards judge appeared on radio and television from the age of 13. She has interviewed Academy Award recipients Paul Newman, Cate Blanchett, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Quentin Tarantino and Ren√©e Zellweger. She reported on a news story for CNN aged 20. She made a third world documentary in Africa in 2006 in the Kenyan cities of Nairobi and Mombasa. She was accepted into Forbes Councils in January 2020.  Psychology formula  The social media influencer developed a psychology formula with Dr. Naois√© O'Reilly in 2013 named the Periodic Table of the Development of Results also known as Purple Success. They specialised in understanding the psychology behind success using a process called Purple Psychology. O'Riordan is an INFJ personality type and has ambidexterity. She was interviewed on national radio in Ireland about having a photographic memory and a sensory processing disorder. Other issues discussed were with regards to the autism spectrum and the LGBTQ community.

Volunteering  The first time she left Ireland was to fly to France to volunteer in a hospital during the summer aged 16. That hospital is where a child in her family was cared for before dying of leukaemia at the age of 4. This was the start of O'Riordan's volunteering abroad which led to philanthropy and documentary making in Third World countries. Speaking on RT√â 2fm Irish national radio she told presenter Evelyn O'Rourke on the Drive By with Colm Hayes show on 28 March 2012 that the seeds for philanthropy were set aged 6. That is when she started a bucket list after the deaths of two children in the family aged 4 and 2.

Rwanda operates a universal health care system, and is considered to have one of the highest-quality health systems in Africa. alt=Photograph depicting a hospital building, with Rwandan flag, viewed from the entrance pathway History In the pre-genocide era before 1994, Rwanda's healthcare was supported by the Bamako Initiative which was sponsored by UNICEF and WHO and adopted by African ministers of health in 1987.\\"Bamako initiative\\" Archived from the original on 2006-11-28. Retrieved 2006- 12-28Caroline Kayonga towards universal health coverage in Rwanda. Summary notes from briefing Brookig Institution Washington D.C 2007 Progress was started towards decentralising the health management system, first to the Province level and then to the district level. Unfortunately this was disrupted by the 1994 genocide, which crippled the healthcare system alongside the economy. In the post genocide period, Rwanda has had an uphill climb in the recovery of its health system as well as its economy. However, it has since built one of the best healthcare systems in the region. In 2008, the government spent 9.7% of national expenditure on healthcare, compared with 3.2% in 1996. Health insurance system Health insurance became mandatory for all individuals in 2008; in 2010 over 90% of the population was covered. In 2012, only about 4% were uninsured. President Kagame made healthcare one of the priorities for the Vision 2020 development programme, boosting spending on health care to 6.5% of the country's gross domestic product in 2013, compared with 1.9% in 1996. The government has devolved the financing and management of healthcare to local communities, through a system of health insurance providers called mutuelles de sant√©. The mutuelles were piloted in 1999, and were made available nationwide by the mid-2000s, with the assistance of international development partners. The mutuelles are owned and managed at the level of Rwanda's thirty districts. There are separate national health insurance schemes for public servants and soldiers. Premiums under the scheme were initially US$2 per annum; since 2011 the rate has varied on a sliding scale according to wealth, with the poorest citizens entitled to free health insurance and wealthiest paying premiums of US$8 per adult. , more than 90% of the population was covered by the scheme. The government has also set up training institutes including the Kigali Health Institute (KHI), which was established in 1997 and is now part of the University of Rwanda. In 2005, President Kagame also launched a program known as The Presidents' Malaria Initiative. This initiative aimed to help get the most necessary materials for prevention of malaria to the most rural areas of Rwanda, such as mosquito nets and medication. Rwanda follows a universal health care model, which provides health insurance through a system called Mutuelles de Sant√©. The system is a community-based health insurance scheme, in which residents of a particular area pay premiums into a local health fund, and can draw from it when in need of medical care. Premiums are paid according to a sliding scale, with the poorest members of society entitled to use the service for free, while the wealthiest pay the highest premiums and are charged copays for treatment. In 2012, about 45% of the system was funded by premium payments, with the rest coming from government funding and international donors. Quality Rwanda's healthcare system operates 499 health centers, 680 health posts which are mainly involved with the outpatient programmes such as immunizations and family planning services, a number of dispensaries, and 42 district hospitals.http://hrhconsortium.moh.gov.rw/rwanda - at - a - glance The country's villages are served by a network of thousands of community health workers. There are four national referral hospitals, which are Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Butare, King Faisal Hospital Kigali and the Rwanda Military Hospital. The most advanced of them is King Faisal Hospital, which is operated on a for-profit model by the government but participates in the national health insurance system, and therefore accepts patients referred to it by other hospitals and clinics. It is the most advanced hospital in Rwanda, equipped with a CT and MRI machine, two dialysis machines, and a wide range of surgical capabilities. Rwanda's clinics are equipped with basic medical equipment and a cupboard of essential medications. The district hospitals offer basic surgical services, and all have a minimum of 15 doctors. Those in need of more advanced and specialized care are referred to one of the four national referral hospitals. There is one cancer treatment center in the country, the Rwanda Cancer Centre, located at Butaro Hospital, which offers an almost full spectrum of cancer treatment, providing services such as screening, diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, palliative care, and a pathology laboratory, with those in need of radiology services referred to Mulago Hospital in Uganda. A new university teaching hospital which will be equipped with the country's second cancer treatment center is scheduled to be completed by 2018, with a second campus ultimately planned. It will be run by Partners in Health. Staffing There is a network of 58,286 Community Health Workers who provide primary care in the 14,837 villages and make referrals. Rwanda has a shortage of medical professionals, with only 0.84 physicians, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 residents in 2013. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is monitoring the country's health progress towards Millennium Development Goals 4‚Äì6, which relate to healthcare. A mid-2015 UNDP report noted that the country was not on target to meet goal 4 on infant mortality, despite it having \\"fallen dramatically\\"; the country is \\"making good progress\\" towards goal 5, which is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio, while goal 6 is not yet met as HIV prevalence has not started falling. Rwanda is participating in a seven-year program begun in 2013 that sees hundreds of medical educators and clinicians from 25 American medical institutions, including Harvard Medical School, Yale Medical School, and Duke Medical School, training Rwandan medical personnel and establish training and residency programs, which, after seven years, will be run by the Rwandan government with its own budget, teachers, and clinicians.

The system used is similar to its predecessors with several balance tweaks and fixes, as well as an improved spell card system. Plot A series of false rumours spread around the Human Village, rumours of odd creatures and strange events. Unlike the Youkai, however, the nature of these rumours is foreign and unsettling, scaring the human children (although most of adults regard it is as simple child's play). But when Reimu, the Shrine Maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, started to notice the rumors, she concluded that it must be the work of a higher power. With that, she and the others decided to investigate this new incident and find the culprit behind the rumors. Characters Up to 14 characters are playable in the game, each with their own scenario. The complete cast of Hopeless Masquerade re-appear in this game, plus four new characters; two from previous games, one originally from a manga, and one d√©but.

It is locally distinctive for its architecture, having been designed by the firm of Andrews, Jaques & Rantoul, which was responsible for designing a number of Bar Harbor's large summer estates. The school was built in 1909 and was used until the 1940s, after which it was converted to a community center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Hulls Cove High School is set on the west side of Bar Harbor Road, a short way north of Hulls Cove and just south of the Church of Our Father. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, wood shingle siding, and a rubblestone foundation. The roof has flared eaves, a typical feature of Shingle style buildings designed by Andrews, Jacques & Rantoul. The main facade faces south, with a projecting central vestibule, whose doorway is flanked by fluted pilasters and topped by a fanlight window. Banks of sash windows line the main wall on either side, a feature repeated on the north side, where there is a brick chimney opposite the entrance. The building is topped by a square belfry with segmented-arch louvered openings, and a flared- eave pyramidal roof. Hulls Cove was one of thirteen districts established by the town of Eden (later renamed Bar Harbor). The first school in the Hulls Cove district was built in 1863, funded by a native son. The present school building was built in 1909 to relieve crowding. It is not known how Andrews, Jacques & Rantoul came to be selected for its design. The school remained in use until the school system was consolidated in the 1940s, and now serves as a community center.

She succeeds in her attempt but loses her sense of sight as a consequence. ;God of Wishes (ÊÑøÊúõ‰πãÁ•û) When Qi Bai is accused of committing rape and murder, Wisely refuses to believe the accusations and secretly helps his friend escape from police custody. However, he makes a shocking discovery later that there are actually two Qi Bais. The other Qi Bai is a clone of the real Qi Bai and has been responsible for committing the evil deeds. He follows the real Qi Bai to a secret room inside an old mansion which supposedly contains a treasure that can lead one to the God of Wishes. They see that the room is filled with mirrors and has nothing inside except for an empty chest. Qi Bai and his clone are eventually cornered by the police in a hostage situation. Qi Bai commits suicide because that is the only way to destroy his clone. However, the entire saga is not over yet because a clone of Wisely was created when Wisely entered the secret room. Wisely is caught off guard by his clone, knocked out and held captive. His clone then impersonates him, harms his loved ones and close friends, and terrorises the city by setting off poison gas bombs. Wisely manages to break out of captivity, proves his identity to his friends, and puts an end to his evil clone's rampage. Before the series ends, he visits the God of Wishes in an ancient Egyptian temple and makes three wishes.

Lahren has been described as an \\"anti-feminist who admires strong women.\\" Lahren has said that while she does not consider herself a feminist, she believes in women's empowerment and looks up to various women from both the political left and the political right. In March 2017, Lahren said she was pro-abortion rights, sparking criticism from a number of anti-abortion writers. TheBlaze owner Glenn Beck, among others, noted that Lahren had previously publicly said she was anti-abortion, in addition to numerous other inconsistencies on other issues. Soon thereafter, Lahren told Playboy that she had always supported abortion rights as a matter of national law but was personally against abortion. While in college, Lahren wrote a feature for the Las Vegas Review-Journal about a classmate who had turned to stripping to support herself. Lahren is in favor of same-sex marriage. In June 2020 she supported Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch's vote and majority opinion in the combined cases of Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ruling that businesses cannot fire LGBTQ people for their sexuality or gender identity. Lahren stated, \\"You can be Christian, conservative, and a proud Trump supporter and believe people should not be fired for who they love. Conservative doesn't come in one flavor, one race, one religion, one gender or one sexuality ... and I won't sit by quietly and allow certain self-righteous and self-appointed and anointed conservative thought policemen make that decree.\\" Lahren's commentaries have been described by critics as racist or race-baiting, which she disputes. In July 2016, Lahren posted a tweet comparing the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan. Tens of thousands of people signed a Change.org petition in response asking for her to be fired from TheBlaze. The petition was unsuccessful. In August 2016, she released a video criticizing NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had been protesting police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before football games. In August 2018, at a political rally for Kelli Ward, Lahren warned against voters electing 'RINOs' (Republicans in name only) into Congress; the term was applied to Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake. Lahren was criticized as cruel and disrespectful as McCain was in very poor health; that day he discontinued medical treatment for brain cancer, and he died the next day. Many people have criticized Lahren for her behavior including former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren. In November 2018, Lahren said that the \\"highlight\\" of her Thanksgiving had been watching United States Border Patrol fire teargas at migrants trying to illegally cross over the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. In December 2018, she ran a Fox Nation segment focusing on how members of a Central American migrant caravan that had been stopped in Mexico that year were carrying diseases; she listed several unconfirmed cases of HIV/AIDS and Chickenpox to support the claim. That same month, she urged President Trump to shut down the government to force Congress to fund the construction of a wall on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.  Personal life  In April 2020, Lahren moved from Los Angeles to Nashville.

The building of the fort was proposed in a defence committee recommendation in 1873, and construction started on 24 January 1875 and was finished in December 1878. The fort has an elongated hexagonal shape, surrounded by a ditch and glacis. It contained underground magazines and casemated garrison quarters. It was armed with three RML 11 inch 25 ton guns and one 64-pounder gun, which were mounted en barbette. Fort Pembroke ditch By the mid-1890s, the fort's armament became obsolete, and instead of upgrading the armaments, the nearby Pembroke Battery was built. The fort became an ammunition depot and storage area for small arms ammunition. Its gate was widened and a fixed metal bridge replaced the original rolling bridge. In World War II, the fort was used as a prisoner-of- war camp, housing German prisoners. The British military establishments in Pembroke were closed in 1978 and the fort remained unused for nine years until 1987. Present day Verdala International School moved into the fort in 1987. Since then, the school has grown from 110 to 400 students. Due to this increase, the school has expanded to include some barrack blocks close to the fort. The campus is leased by the government to the school until the year 2072. The fort was scheduled by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) as a Grade 1 national monument in 1996. The protection status was revised to include the surviving glacis of the fort in 2009.

It was regarded as one of the most exclusive of its kind in 19th-century Stockholm. The school was named after its principals, and therefore changed name several times: from the 1830s until 1881, it was therefore named as Bjurstr√∂mska pensionen (Bjurstr√∂m Pension), Kockska pensionen (Kock Pension), Posseska pensionen (Posse Pension) and, finally, as Hammarstedtska pensionen (Hammarstedt Pension). History =Bjurstr√∂mska pensionen= The school was founded by niece and heir of Sophie Hagman, mamsell Augusta Bjurstr√∂m, and called Bjurstr√∂mska pensionen (Bjurstr√∂m Pension) after her. It attracted clients from the upper classes and was regarded as the most prominent educational institution for females in Stockholm in the 1830s. As such it was a successor of the Johanna Lohm's school. It was the foremost competitor to Wallinska skolan, which was founded in 1831. The school was a typical example of the contemporary conventional girl' school and was in actuality a finishing school focused on accomplishments. When Olof Fryxell was engaged as a teacher at the school, he left the school after a conflict with the students' parents, who were opposed to him introducing the subject of human anatomy and the art of ice skating. Among its students were Sophie Adlersparre, who was a pupil there in 1836‚Äì1838, and Ebba Ramsay. = Kockska pensionen= In the 1840s, the Bjurstr√∂mska pensionen was taken over by Sophie Antoinette Kock from Germany, and called Kockska pensionen (Kock Pension) after her. During the tenure of Kock, the school was renowned for its high quality in language education. At the time, languages was the foremost criteria for an educated woman, and Kock offered education in German, French and English, all offered by teachers from the respective countries in question. Kock employed university educated (male) teachers in most of the subjects. The school was somewhat progressive for its time. No education was offered in needlework, which was otherwise a compulsory subject in schools for girls, and the education was considered of high quality for a girls' school. However, the method was still merely education by listening, and no homework was given. =Posseska pensionen= In 1852, the Kockska pensionen was taken over by the unmarried noblewoman Sophia Posse, and called Posseska pensionen (Posse Pension) after her. Sophia Posse was a student of Cecilia Fryxell, had been active as a teacher at the school of Fryxell and educated on a government scholarship in Germany, where she studied the educational methods in Christiansfeld and the work of Amalia Sieweking in Hamburg. Posse was recommended for her passion for education and religion. Her school offered elementary subjects with focus on Christianity and language, and her methods were listening and practical use. She also employed university educated (male) teachers in most of the subjects. =Hammarstedtska skolan= In 1855, the Posseska pensionen was taken over by Frederique Hammarstedt, also a student of Cecilia Fryxell, and called Hammarstedtska pensionen (Hammarstedt Pension) after her. During Hammarstedt's tenure the school was referred to as one of the most fashionable of its kind in 1860s Stockholm. It received about 100 students, many of them boarding students, from both Sweden and Finland. Still foremost a finishing school, it kept its good reputation in the subject of language, and continued to employ a majority of university educated (male) teachers. During the late 1850s, it offered three two years-classes with the subjects of religion, Swedish, German, French, English, geography, Swedish history, history, natural science, arithmetic, drawing, singing and gymnastics, many of them with highly respected teachers. The school was regarded as progressive for its kind: while girls' schools offered a foreign language, they generally only offered French while Hammarstedt offered also German and English, its German language classes being particularly renowned under its teacher Johannes Rohtlieb. Furthermore, Hammarstedt introduced hygiene, that is to say gymnastics, as soon as the 1850s, which was, at the time, radical. Nevertheless, the school was still characterized as a conventional girls' school, with the goal of fostering girls as ideal ladies, wives and mothers rather than to achieve academic goals. Frederique Hammarstedt was commended for her ability to create a homelike atmosphere at the school, and for her strict adherence to the state church during a time when the Free churchs spread rapidly, which concerned many conservatives. In the 1870s, however, the school adjusted itself in accordance with the recommendations of the Girls' School Committee of 1866 and became an 8th class girl school like the Royal Normal School for Girls of the Royal Seminary, and was thus transformed from a finishing school to a serious academic secondary girls' school. Frederique Hammarstedt closed the school in 1881, and as it was not taken over by anyone else, the school was finally closed after about a half a century as the most fashionable school in Stockholm. Among its famous students were the philanthropist Agda Montelius, the writer Gurli Linder and the artist Anna Billing. References * Idun.

In some criticism these writers have also been described as the 'Post Cultural Revolution Generation', or 'Post Maoism Generation' as they grew up after Mao's death. Background This concept firstly appeared in Shanghai's literary magazine 'Fiction World'(Â∞èËØ¥Áïå) in 1996, as a column for young writers born after 1970 (whom were still in early 20s at that time),http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_522597670102v6i5.html and then it was widely used in literary criticismhttp://220.182.20.143:8021/cd1/a0250/0223.htm from 1990s to early 21st century in China,http://news.sohu.com/03/39/news147303903.shtml until the 'Post 80s Generation' emerged soon after. The well known Post 70s writers include Mian Mian, Wei Hui, Zhou Jieru, Yilin Zhong, Shen Haobo (poet), Ding Tian, Wang Ai, Wei Wei, Dai Lai, Li Shijiang (poet), Jin Renshun, Zhu Wenying, Wu Ang (poet), Yin Lichuan (poet), Sheng Keyi, Ma Yi, Zhao bo, Jia Zhangke (film maker), Xiaolu Guo (film maker), and Xie Youshun (literary critic), etc. The iconic groups of Post 70s Generation include: 1, Beauty writers (refers to women writers only),http://article.hongxiu.com/a/2005-10-29/930796.shtml 2, Lower body poets (refers to a poem style),https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8A%E8%BA%AB%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C and 3, The 6th Generation (refers to film makers).http://baike.baidu.com/view/1082623.htm Beauty writers There was a famous event in 2000 while the 'Beauty writers' had become a popular concept in Chinese media. When Wei Hui published her novel 'Shanghai Baby' in 1999, one of her very good friends, Shanghai born writer Mian Mian released an essay with title 'Wei Hui has not plagiarized my work',http://edu.sina.com.cn/enjoy/2000-04-14/1807.shtml saying that she was shocked that Wei Hui's fiction plagiarized her work and she even called her to ask about this, then Wei Hui answered her: 'I didn't copy your words one by one.(ÊàëÊ≤°ÊúâÊãøÁùÄ‰Ω†ÁöÑÂ∞èËØ¥‰∏Ä‰∏™Â≠ó‰∏Ä‰∏™Â≠óÂú∞ÊäÑ„ÄÇ)' This caused a massive argument between Wei Hui and Mian Mian,http://leiden.dachs- archive.org/archive/leiden/poetry/20040712/white- collar.net/wx_wxf/wxf04/161.htm and then later other post 70 generation writers Zhou Jieru, Yilin Zhong, and Wei wei, etc., were involved into this incident too (regarding whether Wei plagiarized Mian or not).http://220.182.20.143:8021/cd1/a0250/0223.htm Afterword, this controversy was totally overwhelmed by all newspapers' reportshttp://www.dw.de/a-1365782 based on each side's different views and arguments,http://edu.sina.com.cn/critique/2000-04-14/1806.shtml ‚Äòbeauty writers' debate' led millions of comments online by mass people, and in public it was like a mass media's carnival.http://women.sohu.com/06/22/article215572206.shtml Rapidly this scandal became one of the most famous debates in 2000 and consequently pushed Wei Hui's book 'Shanghai Baby' to be a bestseller in China (later internationally bestsellerhttp://edu.sina.com.cn/critique/2000-05-16/2891.shtml).

Location  The building stands on the eastern side of Gda≈Ñska Street, between S≈Çowackiego street and Adam Mickiewicz Alley. It is close to Alfred Schleusener Tenement at N¬∞62, another historical building in the same street. History =19th century= In the middle of the 19th century, Karl Hildebrandt a judicial executor opened in the back yard a summer garden and a bowling. In 1882, in the garden at the back of the property was built a wooden summer theater, originally called Victoria, on the design of architects J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki and Anton Hoffmann. Theater and concerts performances were held here. The new house was standing on a previous building where Eduard Schulz was living since 1893. He had there his restaurant, Elysium. =Eduard Schulz's period= The tenement has been built in 1904-1905 for the restaurateur Eduard Schulz by the architect Rudolf Kern. The building is stretched along N¬∞66 and N¬∞68 of Gda≈Ñska Street: both houses formed a complex network for house and business purposes. Its address was, in Bromberg's time, Danzigerstrasse 134. Eduard Schulz opened there a new restaurant, Zum Reichskanzler (To the Reich Chancellor). =1920s till today= In 1922, the Company Deutsches Haus became the new owner of the lot: it ran in the premises a restaurant, a German theater Deutsche B√ºhne and a hotel until 1945. After World War II, a new restaurant, Slowianka, has been set up there. In the period 1947-1949 at the very place of the old wood theater was built the actual Polish Theatre by architect Alfons Licznerski. In the upper levels a disco club opened in November 1975. Today, N¬∞68 houses the District Chamber of Legal Advisers of Bydgoszcz. Architecture Eduard Schulz tenement has got an Art Nouveau decorated facade decoration, significantly impoverished as a result of renovation and rehabilitation. Initial decoration of N¬∞66 frontage have been revived by a refurbishment during summer 2016. Likewise, on the facade of N¬∞68, one can still notice gargoyles and stylized floral motifs. Inside are still preserved a staircase with its original door, railings and stuccoes.

She earned a PhD Doctorate in physical oceanography from the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom in 2007. The British Library catalogued her PhD dissertation entitled Combining Altimetry and Hydrography with Inverse Methods. Outlined as one of the conclusions, O'Reilly developed an oceanography satellite altimetry and argo float big data scientific research system to analyse the state of the north Atlantic Ocean in three dimensional surface elevations. She graduated from the National University of Ireland, Galway in 2000 with a first class honours degree in marine science. She studied quantitative Earth observations at the University of Oxford and geophysical and environmental fluid dynamics at the University of Cambridge in 2002.  Dyslexia  O'Reilly has severe dyslexia and as a teenager an educational psychologist said she was not suited to attend college. She says literacy is not a gauge of intelligence and that \\"personality is an inconvenience in school.\\" In an education and teaching book about getting high school grades she spoke of introducing reward systems in the home for dyslexic children saying \\"the goal should be achievable and have the right level of challenge.\\" Interviewed by a journalist in 1999 during her time in university in Ireland O'Reilly said \\"school is the worst place for a dyslexic.\\" Her methods examine personality theory and four learning styles of auditory, visual, practical and kinesthetic with children and adults in Ireland and around the World. She was Anti-Discrimination Officer for the Students' Union and Student Activist for people with disabilities at the National University of Ireland, Galway in addition to National Disability Rights Officer for the Union of Students of Ireland. The observational scientist and physical oceanographer taught at the European Space Agency Earth Observation Summer School in Frascati, Italy in 2004 on a course run for postdoctoral researchers interpreting and using satellite images in Earth science research. She assisted the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute in developing a UNESCO postgraduate level workshop called the Application of Satellite Altimetry to Oceanography. This was a training course for the western Indian Ocean region run in Africa for postdoctoral students in 2004. She addressed the European Geosciences Union general assembly in Nice, France in 2004 and her works were presented at an Argo Science workshop in Venice, Italy in 2006.  Education methods  A series of educational methods for students with learning difficulties called the Purple Learning Project were developed by O'Reilly in an education centre she founded in 2009 called the Homework Club located in Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland. Classes are not created based on age or academic level but student personality type and ability. Classroom sizes are capped with a maximum of ten students per class taught by honours university graduates trained in O'Reilly's teaching methods. The government of Finland engaged with research from the Irish educationalist. Interviewed for a college in the United States about dealing with difficult children the personality theory researcher and educationalist placed importance on investigating the environment and surroundings when problems frequently emerge to help discover what triggers can spark behaviour. O'Reilly has said \\"I read backwards and see the world in reverse. In fact my own PhD research was an inverse method.\\" Other educational methods developed by O'Reilly include the Experience Effect and the Gap Effect.  Learning difficulties  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is an area she has been described as an expert in and supporting people with Asperger syndrome, dyslexia, developmental co- ordination disorder, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, hearing impairments, expression disorders and depression.  Personality theory  The educational innovator made a breakthrough in psychology research in 2013 by developing the Periodic Table of the Development of Results. The formula is also called Purple Success. O'Reilly has an INFJ personality type.  Awards  O'Reilly's the Homework Club was awarded O2 Ability Company status by international disability rights group Kanchi in 2010 along with Citi, EMC, Microsoft Ireland and Trinity College Dublin. Former President of Ireland and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson was on stage and the awards were broadcast live on Newstalk national radio. Dublin 15 Chamber presented her with two awards for Best New Business 2009 and Small Business of the Year 2010 for the Homework Club. The education centre was nominated for an AIB Innovation in Business Excellence award at the Fingal Business Excellence Awards 2011.  Media  She called for homework to be banned in schools during an Irish national radio interview in studio with Derek Mooney on the Mooney show on RT√â Radio One on 11 November 2011. Interviewed by Shane Coleman in studio on Irish national radio show The Right Hook broadcast on Newstalk on 29 October 2015 about plans to ban homework in Oslo, Norway she said Irish people should refuse to do homework and referenced homework boycotts in France.

They are so widely used in the mentioned structures, that nowadays, they form part of the standard electrical installation of most buildings.Door phones reference manual The simplest version is a simple intercom that establishes a communication between the street door and the house. In buildings where there are more than one door phone plate (located at the outside of the building's door entrance) has a certain number of buttons, depending on the number of flats existing in each building, in addition to the loudspeaker. Operation  Modern outdoor phone plate with a push buttons matrix A door phone in its most basic version is a two-way intercom allowing communication from the street to the house, with the possibility of driving an electric strike to unlock and open the door, allowing access to the interior of the building. In places where there is more than one dwelling, the caller street, also called Push Plate or simply Plate Street , is composed of a number of buttons is (usually one per housing) with the label next to the house or apartment number or name of the tenant. The door phone plate is located at the outside of the entrance of each building, is composed by a matrix of buttons each of them driving a Buzzer located in a unit inside each home, which has a button to activate the electric strike.

Plot The show opens with a short parody of the Disney short Feast entitled \\"Fat.\\" Santa's Little Helper is fed scraps from the Simpsons' dinner table until he gets too fat and dies. He goes to Heaven and God offers him a choice between Fit Dog Heaven and Fat Dog Hell. Fat Dog Hell flashes a \\"Free Pizza\\" sign and Santa's Little Helper runs inside. Homer sees a commercial for a self-lifting chair and becomes interested in buying one, but the $1,100 price dismays him. After Lenny and Carl suggest that he try to raise the money through crowdfunding, Homer posts a video that persuades the residents of Springfield to donate. He soon has enough to buy the chair and posts a follow-up video of himself enjoying it, but the townspeople become so enraged upon seeing his frivolous use of their money that they storm the Simpson house and destroy the chair. Meanwhile, at Springfield Elementary, Lisa tries to attract potential members for the school magic club. A girl named Harper Jambowski (voiced by Kristen Bell) becomes interested in signing up, and the two begin to spend time together. Lisa tries to calm Homer's anger about losing the chair by asking him to take her and Harper to an Australian boy band concert, for which Harper's father Mike has already bought tickets. Homer agrees, but is surprised to discover that the group's seats are in an expensive VIP skybox. Mike, a wealthy entrepreneur and owner of several businesses and sports teams, joins them in the box, and he and Homer strike up a friendship of their own. On the way home, Lisa complains to Homer that Harper never let her talk during the show, but Homer persuades her to stay friends with Harper so she can enjoy all the luxuries of the Jambowskis' lifestyle. Harper invites Homer and Lisa to see a performance by David Copperfield, but again she stops Lisa from participating as the fathers enjoy themselves. As Lisa becomes disenchanted with Harper, Mike invites the Simpsons to spend a week on his private island. They decline at first due to the children needing to attend school, but Mike bribes Principal Skinner to close Springfield Elementary for a week so they can go. Harper gives Lisa a fancy new bicycle, but Lisa sees it as an insult to the one she owns and feels that Harper is trying to control everything around her. Although their argument escalates, Lisa decides to remain friends with Harper so that the family can enjoy the island's comforts. When the girls begin fighting again during the trip, Homer reluctantly takes the family home early for Lisa's sake, commenting that no one who would treat her so badly deserves to be her friend. During the credits, Homer ruefully says goodbye to the island's amenities as the family flies back to Springfield. Looking out the window, he and Lisa see that Bart is still on the island and has spelled out the message \\"So long suckers\\" on the shore. Reception \\"Friend With Benefit\\" scored a 1.5 rating and was watched by 3.48 million viewers, making the episode Fox's highest rated show of the night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ stating, \\"This season has seen the show rediscover how fruitful it can be to bring Lisa back down closer to her own age. Sure, she‚Äôs almost always the smartest person in the room, but here, as in the truly, restoratively excellent 'Halloween Of Horror,' that intelligence, when coupled with an eight-year-old‚Äôs emotional intellect, has freed up the show to make Lisa more vital than she‚Äôs been in a while. A lot of that has to do with Yeardley Smith‚Äôs performances, naturally.

When Bart tells Marge about the incident, she goes to a City Council meeting and says it's time to make bullies feel scared instead of their victims, and a bill giving the police wide powers to crack down on bullying is passed unanimously. Prior to the bill being passed, Hans Moleman initially voted \\"No\\" until Mayor Quimby angrily threatens and shoves him, causing him to change his vote to \\"Yes\\". Chief Wiggum starts out by legitimately arresting bullies like Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph after they try to steal Bart and Milhouse's sleds. However due to how vaguely the law defines a bully, the police can arrest almost anyone, which Chief Wiggum soon begins to do even if they are wrongly accused. Homer, who has abused the new law on anyone who even mildly inconveniences him, gets a taste of his own medicine when Rod & Todd Flanders (who are fed up with how Homer treats Ned) have him arrested and he's been sentenced to 90 days of treatment. While in the center, Homer has an epiphany that he is cruel to Ned because his neighbor is better than Homer in every way, and Homer is then held up as a paragon of reform and celebrated. However, Ned doesn't accept this ridiculous logic and bluntly tells Homer that Ned won‚Äôt forgive him for his actions. A distraught Homer begs for forgiveness which Ned refuses several times. But after Homer penitently kneels on Ned's lawn for a long stretch, Ned tells him he is forgiven. The Simpsons and the Flanders then join together and have brunch. Reception The episode received a 1.2 rating and was watched by a total of 2.77 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, saying \\"since the Homer-Flanders dynamic can only stretch so far‚ÄîFlanders has to stay Flanders, Homer Homer‚Äîan episode that sets out to seek an emotionally satisfying rapprochement between the two has to earn its eventual big moment, and \\"Bull-E\\" comes up just short.\\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5/5.

The film stars Emma Roberts, Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Boynton, Lauren Holly, and James Remar. Over their winter break, two Catholic schoolgirls get left behind at their boarding school at which the nuns are rumored to be satanists. The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival before it was released through video-on-demand on February 16, 2017, by DirecTV Cinema, and was released theatrically in the United States on March 31, 2017, by A24. The film received positive reviews, with particular praise for the cast's performance. Plot The plot is split into three \\"timelines\\". The first two, \\"Rose\\" and \\"Joan\\", intercut between each other throughout the bulk of the film, before a third timeline, \\"Kat\\", is introduced and comprises the film's climax. Rose In February, students at the prestigious Catholic Bramford Academy in upstate New York are preparing to be picked up by their parents for a week-long break. Kat (Kiernan Shipka), a freshman, and Rose (Lucy Boynton), an older student, are left behind when neither of their parents arrive. Rose suspects she may be pregnant so she deliberately lied to her parents about the vacation dates to bide time. Kat, meanwhile, has a premonitory dream of her parents dying in a car crash, and is unable to get ahold of them for an explanation of their tardiness. The two girls are left alone together in the academy overnight, and the nuns task Rose with looking after Kat. Rose, however, departs with her boyfriend to inform him of the possible pregnancy. During this time, while Kat is left entirely alone in the building, the phone rings and she responds. Hours later, Rose returns and finds Kat in the boiler room, repeatedly prostrating herself before the boiler. Rose brings Kat back to her dorm and presses for an explanation of her strange behavior, but Kat speaks cryptically and claims her parents are dead, offering no further explanation and disturbing Rose. After Rose leaves, Kat's body starts convulsing and contorting in her bed. The next morning, Rose and an increasingly sickly-looking Kat join the nuns for breakfast, where Kat behaves erratically, vomits, and curses at the nuns. After receiving an alarming phone call, the nuns order Rose to shovel the driveway for the abrupt return of the headmaster Gordon. After shoveling, Rose finds the door to the nuns' cabin locked, with no response from within, and returns to the dorm building. Later, Gordon arrives with a policeman; as they enter the nun's cabin, a bloodstain is seen on the wall, and the men react with shock to something offscreen. Joan A young woman going by Joan (Emma Roberts) arrives at a bus stop after escaping a mental institution. A friendly older man named Bill (James Remar) offers Joan a ride with him and his wife Linda (Lauren Holly) to Bramford, which is near the town where she claims to be headed. As they stop at a motel, Joan showers, revealing a scar on her shoulder, and a flashback shows her being shot by a policeman. Bill tells Joan over dinner at a nearby restaurant that he picked her up because she reminded him of his deceased daughter, revealed in a photograph to be Rose - the next day will be the ninth anniversary of Rose's death, on which her parents visit Bramford every year. Joan recognizes Rose and retreats to the restaurant bathroom, where she suppresses a fit of laughter. Another flashback reveals Joan is a fake name; the real Joan was a woman whom she killed to steal her I.D. Bill, Linda and Joan depart for Bramford. Kat During the days leading up to winter break, Kat is shown to be in contact with an entity depicted alternately as a looming, horned shadow and a deep, gravelly voice on the phone outside her dormitory. This entity informs her of her parents' impending death, and instructs her to kill everyone. After breakfast, the nuns receive a phone call informing them that Kat's parents have died. After Rose is dismissed to shovel the driveway, Kat murders both nuns. She pursues the oblivious Rose into the academy; shortly after Rose has her period, confirming she is not pregnant, Kat stabs her to death and beheads her. Gordon and the policeman search the building and find Kat prostrating herself in front of the boiler again, with the decapitated heads of her three victims lined up next to her. Brandishing the knife, Kat exclaims \\"Hail Satan!\\" before the policeman shoots her in the shoulder, revealing that \\"Joan\\" is Kat. Kat is detained in a mental hospital, where a priest arrives and performs an exorcism to banish her demon. The exorcism is seemingly successful, but Kat begs the horned figure not to leave her before it vanishes. \\"Joan\\", the Kat of nine years later, murders Bill and Linda when they pull over in Bramford. She beheads their corpses, coats her face with their blood like makeup, and brings the heads to the boiler room of the academy, seemingly in an effort to summon the demon she lost years ago. However, she finds the boiler cold and unused. Now completely alone, Kat leaves the academy and breaks down crying in the middle of the road. Cast Production Although the film only received a wide release after I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House was shown, The Blackcoat's Daughter was actually filmed first, making it Perkins' debut film. Perkins noted that he intended to \\"tell a sad story\\" about loss and used the horror genre, specifically the possession subgenre, as a \\"Trojan Horse\\". Perkins also noted that he could have still made the film without this angle, but felt its omission would have resulted in the audience's engagement with the story being very different. Financing the film was particularly difficult, and Perkins attributed this to the \\"slumping\\" success of the horror genre at the time, since the film's script was completed in 2012, but filming did not begin until 2015. In addition, even though those to whom Perkins initially showed the script were enthusiastic about it, many of them believed that it would be impossible to make. However after the casting of Kiernan Shipka and Emma Roberts was announced in April 2014, and the casting of Lucy Boynton, Lauren Holly, and James Remar was announced in February 2015, the film then became a reality. Principal photography for the film began in February 2015 in Kemptville, Ontario, Canada, and the film's soundtrack was scored by Perkins' brother, Elvis Perkins, who is a singer-songwriter. Unfortunately for him, Elvis had never written a film score before, and he found the medium confining, with Perkins noting that the restrictions \\"almost killed him\\". Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2015. Shortly after, A24 Films and DirecTV Cinema acquired US distribution rights to the film. The Canadian distribution rights were then acquired by ABMO Films. The film had its US premiere at the Fantastic Fest on September 24, 2015. In November 2015, it was announced that the film had sold to various international territories at the AFM, including the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Poland, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Middle East. The film was retitled from February to The Blackcoat's Daughter. The film was scheduled to be released DirecTV Cinema on July 14, 2016. But was pushed back to August 25, 2016, before opening in a limited release on September 30. The film was then pulled from the schedule and pushed back to an undisclosed 2017 date. It was released on February 16, 2017, through DirecTV Cinema, before being released on March 31, 2017, in a limited release and through video on demand by A24. On Netflix UK, it was released under the title February. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 72%, based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 6.44/10, and the site's consensus of the film reads: \\"Slow-building and atmospheric, The Blackcoat's Daughter resists girls-in-peril clich√©s in a supernatural thriller that serves as a strong calling card for debuting writer-director Oz Perkins.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"As with so many of the best mystery-horror films, the optimum way to enjoy a first viewing of this is try to remain as ignorant as possible about what happens. That said, it also brims with tiny, blink-and-you'll-miss- them details that will repay repeat viewings.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety magazine wrote: \\"In addition to everything else he does right in February, Perkins plays fair: When you replay the movie in your mind after the final fadeout, you realize that every twist was dutifully presaged, and the final reveal was hidden in plain sight all along.\\" References External links * Category:2015 horror thriller films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:2015 psychological thriller films Category:2010s supernatural films Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American supernatural thriller films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian horror thriller films Category:Canadian psychological films Category:Canadian supernatural horror films Category:Demons in film Category:Films about exorcism Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films set in schools Category:Films shot in Ottawa Category:Religious horror films Category:Films directed by Oz Perkins Category:2015 directorial debut films ","title":"The Blackcoat's Daughter"},{"id":"45534369","text":"Allenby \\"Allen\\" Driver (29 September 1918 ‚Äì 31 March 1997) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward in the Football League for Sheffield Wednesday, Luton Town, Norwich City, Ipswich Town and Walsall.Pride of Anglia - Allenby Driver He began his career professional career at Sheffield Wednesday but the outbreak of war interrupted his progress, he later played for Frickley Colliery.Frickley Athletic Museum - Allenby Driver References Category:1918 births Category:People from Blackwell, Derbyshire Category:1997 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Clipstone F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Ipswich Town F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Corby Town F.C. players Category:Scarborough F.C. players Category:Frickley Athletic F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Brentford F.C. wartime guest players ","title":"Allenby Driver"},{"id":"45534387","text":"Gunton v Richmond upon Thames LBC [1980] ICR 755 is a UK labour law case, concerning wrongful dismissal.

The station is owned and operated by Local Television Limited and forms part of a group of eight local TV stations. Its offices are based near the Gas Street Basin in Birmingham city centre.  History  =Big Centre TV= Kaleidoscope TV Limited was granted a licence to establish a local television station in November 2014, following the collapse of City8, a proposed station centred on the Birmingham area, which went into administration after failing to secure sufficient funding. Kaleidoscope was given 10 minutes' notice that its bid had been successful before an official announcement was made by the regulatory body Ofcom. The new licence, initially known as Kaleidoscope TV, was given an Ofcom deadline of Saturday 28 February 2015 to launch Kaleidoscope TV to bring local television to Birmingham, the Black Country and Solihull from 2015, Initially, Big Centre TV was jointly launched by Chris Perry and former ATV announcer and television executive Mike Prince, the station's director of programming. Prince also served as the station's chairman. Big Centre TV's studios and offices were based at the Goldmine Centre in Walsall, located alongside the town's studio school, where students were able to gain work experience with the channel as part of their studies. The station launched at 6pm on Saturday 28 February 2015, preceded by a testcard and music, ending with the Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\". Opening night programming included an hour-long introduction to the channel, a special edition of the local news programme The Midland, a 1981 episode of Crossroads, and coverage of an ice hockey league match. These were aired alongside two of the station's feature programmes, Life Stories and Project M. The first news bulletin attracted criticism from Birmingham Mail TV critic Roz Laws, who noted that many of the reports concerned stories from several days before the channel's launch. The news bulletin was also beset by technical problems, with poor sound quality and an out-of-focus studio camera. The Black Country-based Express & Star observed that the launch programme had been \\"more corporate video than glitz and glamour\\" consisting of the channel's executives \\"sitting in front of their computers and discussing a business plan before the station was blessed by a clergyman\\". Responding to the criticism, then-channel director Chris Perry argued that Big Centre TV's teething problems were similar to those experienced by the larger channels, and urged viewers to stay with the station. In April 2015, the station announced that Canadian media company Trek 2000 had invested in Big Centre TV. The station later opened a satellite studio at Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham for sports coverage. =Made in Birmingham= On 3 October 2016, Made Television, which was unsuccessful in bidding to run the franchise in 2012, announced it had bought Big Centre for an undisclosed sum, subject to approval from Ofcom.Big Centre TV acquired by rival network 18 months after launch, Birmingham Mail, 4 October 2016 Big Centre TV ceased broadcasting at midnight on Friday 4 November 2016 and reopened and relaunched as Made in Birmingham at 6pm on Tuesday 8 November 2016.Made TV network acquires eighth TV station, Made Television, 3 October 2016 The channel began broadcasting on Sky and digital satellite platforms in January 2017.

The station also produced a number of nostalgia-based entertainment shows including The David Hamilton Show, The Ads Show, Crossroads Check-In, Tiswas Pies Again and The Long Lost Shows Show. As the channel went on air, plans to repeat Crossroads were at the centre of a disagreement over the amount of royalties to be paid to its former actors ‚Äì Paul Henry (who played Benny Hawkins) reportedly threatened to take legal action over the issue. The station discontinued Crossroads repeats in September 2015 and latterly phased out its Kaleidoscope- related archive output and nostalgia programming. Big Centre TV continued to air archive programming from other sources until it ceased broadcasting in November 2016. As with the other Made TV channels, it now broadcasts a selection of acquired output.

The staff handbook, s.8.3, made no difference to the fact that an employee had to be notified of termination. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale had not given clear notice to Geys about the payment. It was only on 6 January, when Geys received Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale's letter of 4 January, that the contractual right to terminate under the pay in lieu of notice method was validly exercised. Only then did Gey's employment with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale come to an end.[54]-[61] Lord Hope said the following. Lord Wilson focused criticism on the 'automatic theory' of termination. Lord Sumption dissented.[2012] UKSC 63, [108]-[140] He said there should be a general rule that an innocent party to a repudiated contract could not treat it as subsisting if his performance would require the other party's cooperation. Cooperation, and specific performance could not be compelled. So, in his minority view, Gunton was wrong, and Geys was receiving a windfall given that the majority was preferring the \\"elective\\" theory over the \\"automatic\\" theory of termination.

The site was used as a quay in Roman times and later as an unloading place for Anglo-Saxon boats. A wharf was constructed there at some point in the medieval period and appears to have acquired its name from its customary usage as a landing place for fresh fish. In the 16th century, Fresh Wharf was made a \\"Legal Quay\\" authorised for the import of certain goods during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. It expanded as London's river-borne trade grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, with large warehouses being established immediately behind the wharf. In the 20th century, the wharf's owners took over the adjoining wharves immediately upstream and downstream, built a new ten-storey warehouse and renamed the site New Fresh Wharf. By the end of the 1960s, however, London's docks had fallen into disuse with the advent of containerization, for which they were not suited, and the wharf was closed down in 1970. An office block was built on the site of the warehouse in 1977 and the former quayside is now part of a public footpath along the Thames. Early history Fresh Wharf, near London Bridge, c. 1762, by William Marlow A quay existed on the site as long ago as the Roman period, but there is no evidence that it was used after 260 AD. Its construction illustrated the effects of climate change in the Roman era. Due to a period of colder temperatures that led to more water being locked up in the polar icecaps, the sea level and thus the level of the Thames fell considerably in the centuries after Roman Londinium was founded. A revetment had been constructed at Fresh Wharf in the second century AD but by the third century the high water mark had dropped so much that the river wharves had to project much further out into the river to maintain the same depth of water. In the case of the timber quay at Fresh Wharf, it was constructed in front of the earlier revetment. The date of establishment of Fresh Wharf is not known. In late Anglo-Saxon times (10th‚Äì11th century), the site of Fresh Wharf appears to have been merely a beach on which ships were grounded for off-loading. A wharf was built there at some subsequent point during the medieval period; its name was first recorded as Fresshffysshewharfe in 1363, which was probably related to its appointment as one of the places authorised for the unloading of fish.Henry A Harben, 'Foxton Inn - Fresh Wharf Gateway', in A Dictionary of London (London, 1918), https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/dictionary-of-london/foxton-inn- fresh-wharf-gateway (accessed 2 March 2015). On the landward side, the wharf was accessed via Lower Thames Street a short distance down from the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr. Excavations of 1974-5 on the site revealed much about the medieval buildings. J Schofield, L Blackmore and J Pearce, London's Waterfront 1100-1666 (2018) passim. It became one of the twenty \\"Legal Quays\\" of the City of London in 1559 with state authorisation to serve as one of the official landing and loading points for traders. The wharf was listed as being \\"for fyshe and eele shippers\\". During the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which started a short distance to the north in Pudding Lane, Fresh Wharf and all of the other Legal Quays were destroyed. They were quickly rebuilt and were all back in operation by the mid-1670s.Rule (2012), pp. 13, 129 Another fire on 18 April 1760 resulted in the wharf and some of the surrounding area burning down. The ownership of the wharf changed hands several times during the century, with its most notable owner being the famous actor David Garrick, who invested in a ¬£1,500 mortgage (equivalent to ¬£ today) on the wharf in 1776. However, the investment turned out to be a financial disaster for Garrick when the debtor absconded to the Far East. Nineteenth century Plan of Fresh Wharf in 1857 The 1824 Accounts Relating to the Port of London listed Fresh Wharf as having a river frontage of , making it the second largest of the Legal Quays after Custom House Quay. All of the Legal Quays, including Fresh Wharf, were compulsorily purchased by the government in 1805McCusker & Morgan (2000), p. 67 but in 1827 the wharfinger John Knill was assigned the lease at a yearly rent of ¬£1,555 after purchasing the fee simple from the Crown. By the 1840s, the wharf was being used by schooners transporting fruit from the Canary Islands, Azores and Mediterranean regions. As many as a dozen ships at a time would unload simultaneously, bringing six million oranges a year to London. The wharf's trade was \\"exclusively Foreign, consisting chiefly of Fruit, with the addition of Silk and Wines\\"; it did not accept hazardous goods. It was run in conjunction with London Bridge Wharf, which was used by coasters and steamships. Fresh Wharf was described around this time as \\"covering an immense space of ground, and consisting of a great number of lofty warehouses, containing, in the whole, property valued at considerably over a million [pounds] sterling\\" (equivalent to ¬£ today). All but one of the warehouses were of recent vintage and constructed of brick, other than the \\"very old\\" timber Crane House that adjoined Cox & Hammond's Quay. It was severely damaged by fire again on 21 June 1858, causing the destruction of an estimated ¬£100,000 of property stored in the wharf's warehouses. The Knills continued to run Fresh Wharf for the rest of the century and became a family of considerable note. They acquired a baronetcy that continues to this day; the second of the Knill baronets, Sir John Stuart Knill, became the first Roman Catholic Lord Mayor of London in 1892. Twentieth century Map of New Fresh Wharf, 1950s At the turn of the century, Fresh Wharf was a busy and profitable enterprise, dealing with 300,000 tons of cargo and over quarter of a million passengers a year. The Fresh Wharf Company expanded its operations in the 1930s by leasing the whole of the river frontage from London Bridge Wharf, in front of the 1925 Adelaide House, to its neighbour immediately to the south, Cox and Hammond's Quay, which had originally been two separate quays of equally ancient vintage to Fresh Wharf and had likewise been named as Legal Quays in 1559. The combined wharves, now known as New Fresh Wharf, had two berths. The larger of the two measured and could accommodate vessels of up to 7,000 tons. The position of Fresh Wharf made it the closest steamer wharf and associated warehouses to the centre of the City of London. By 1937, New Fresh Wharf had 28 cranes and had diversified to handle a variety of general cargoes, green fruit and canned goods. A new quay was constructed in front of the wharf in the 1930s and the existing jetty at London Bridge Wharf was extended. New Fresh Wharf in the early 1960s with the cargo ship Alfonso moored at the quayside As well as handling goods, New Fresh Wharf was also used by passenger steamships. These were operated by the Queen Line of the New Medway Steam Packet Company, which ran daily services to Southend-on-Sea, Herne Bay, Margate and Ramsgate on one route, and to Southend, Clacton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze and Felixstowe on its other route. The Company moved its operations to Tower Pier from around 1935 onwards. Passenger services also ran twice weekly to Amsterdam under the auspices of the Holland Steamship Company. The wharf narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when its southern neighbour, Nicholson's Wharf, was flattened by a V-1 flying bomb. A regular passenger and cargo service between the wharf and the Canary Islands was maintained for a number of years after the war by the 10,123-ton MV Monte Ulia and its 7,723-ton sister ship MV Monte Urquiola, operated by Naviera Aznar SA. Such vessels were among the largest merchant ships ever to visit the Pool of London. Writing in 1963, James Harold Bird observed how \\"during his lunch-hour the pale-faced London office worker can lean on the downstream parapet of London Bridge and watch Canary Island produce being unloaded to New Fresh Wharf below from vessels up to 500 feet long and delivered to a ten- storey warehouse.\\" The warehouse was constructed in 1953 and provided four million cubic feet of storage space. By this time the wharf had five travelling cranes and two conveyors, capable of transporting loads of up to five tons. Its river frontage measured . Closure and redevelopment St Magnus House (right), on the site of New Fresh Wharf in 2008 Only a few years after Bird's description of the fruit ships unloading alongside London Bridge, the inner London docks fell into disuse as a result of trade moving to the container port downriver at Tilbury Docks. New Fresh Wharf closed for good in 1970 and in 1973 the warehouse was demolished. Archaeological excavations on the site between 1974 and 1978 uncovered the remains of the Roman quay and revetment. The demolished warehouse was eventually replaced by St Magnus House, an office building designed by Richard Seifert that was constructed in 1978.

Judge Delany was on the board of Directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Harlem YMCA and became an active leader in the Harlem Renaissance. He also served as a Vice President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He was a graduate of City College of New York in 1923. He received his law degree from New York University School of Law in 1926 and was a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, the first Greek-letter organization to be founded by African American men. Delany had a long career serving as both a justice in the New York City Domestic Relations Court as well as an attorney and adviser to civil rights activists Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., US Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and poet Langston Hughes. He also advised entertainment and sports luminaries including famed opera singer Marian Anderson, singer and actor Paul Robeson, cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, bandleader Cab Calloway, and Major League Baseball color line breaker Jackie Robinson. Early life and education Delany was the eighth of ten children born to the Rev. Henry Beard Delany (1858‚Äì1928), the first Black person elected Suffragan Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, and Nannette James Logan Delany (1861‚Äì1956), an educator. His father, Henry Beard Delany was born into slavery in St. Mary's, Georgia. Delany was born and raised on the campus of St. Augustine's School (now University) in Raleigh, North Carolina, where his father was the Vice-Principal and his mother, a teacher and administrator. Delany was a 1919 graduate of the school. His sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany were civil rights pioneers in their own right who co-authored the bestselling oral history Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years along with Amy Hill Hearth. Throughout his early years, Delany believed he would follow in his fathers footsteps and become a clergyman within the Episcopal Church. Having grown up on the campus of historically black Saint Augustine's College where his parents taught, Delany had been protected from the rigid system of racial segregation that gripped North Carolina in the early twentieth century. After finishing high school, Delany soon followed his older siblings to New York City and attended the City College of New York. He worked his way through undergraduate college holding a job as a Red Cap railway Pullman porter at New York Penn Station. During his three years as a law student at NYU Law, Delany was also a teacher in Harlem elementary schools within the New York City Public School system. Mid-life and professional career =First marriage= After receiving his law degree from New York University School of Law in 1926, Delany married the Harlem Renaissance figure Clarissa Scott Delany. Scott, a poet, essayist and educator was also a social worker with the National Urban League working to gather statistics for a \\"Study of Delinquent and Neglected Negro Children.\\" The two were married only one year before Scott died from kidney disease in 1927. =Legal and political career= From 1926 until 1933, Delany served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York appointed by Charles H. Tuttle, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. By 1934, he was the highest paid African American federal appointee in the nation, and had won 493 of the 500 cases he had argued in U.S. District Court. Mayor LaGuardia named him tax commissioner and later a judge in the Court of Domestic Relations. In 1929, Delany ran for Congress representing New York's \\"old\\" twenty-first district (today's (2015) New York's 13th congressional district, incorporating neighborhoods of Harlem, Inwood, Marble Hill, Spanish Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights) in the House of Representatives. After winning the Republican primary but losing the general election to Democrat Joseph A. Gavagan, he gained the respect and friendship of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Delany won 26,666 (37.9%) of the 70,000 votes cast. During the Harlem riot of 1935, Delany and Mayor LaGuardia walked through the streets together to try and quiet things down. After the riot, Mayor LaGuardia appointed Delany and others, including E. Franklin Frazier, Countee Cullen, and A. Philip Randolph, to the investigatory commission that found that the riot was caused not by communist agitators but by economic deprivation, racial discrimination, and an unresponsive city government. Delany joined the law firm Mintzer, Todarelli and Kleid in 1933 but left in 1937 to run his own law practice. Among his many clients was the classical contralto Marian Anderson. In 1939, after the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to allow Anderson to perform in Constitution Hall in Washington D.C., Delany introduced the resolution to the executive board of the NAACP that led to her performing instead on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial As a result of the ensuing furor around the Daughters of the American Revolution denying Anderson, thousands of DAR members, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, resigned from the organization. On January 1, 1942, Delany was appointed Justice of the Family Court by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia and served until 1955. During his tenure, Judge Delany established himself as a compassionate and humane Justice as well as a strong and passionate advocate for civil rights. His advice on juvenile issues was \\"eagerly sought by many individuals and organizations.\\" His many admirers and colleagues cited the understanding, fairness and delicacy with which he approached his cases; detractors labeled him too \\"liberal.\\" BlackPast.org His briefs were often interpreted by his critics as \\"left-wing views\\" and were used as the \\"rationale\\" for not reappointing him in 1955, despite being backed by several bar associations. The New York Times claimed that Mayor Robert F. Wagner declined to reappoint Delany because he held communist views; Delany believed he was not reappointed because of his vocal and public stand on civil rights and against second-class citizenship for Black Americans. The NAACP and the National Urban League stood up in support of Judge Delany and protested the Mayor's decision. =Second marriage= Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia performed the marriage ceremony for Delany and his second wife, Willetta S. Mickey. She, a native of Yonkers, New York, attended Howard University and served as Delany's secretary at the Tax Commission. Mrs. Delany was Founder and President of Adopt-A-Child, an interracial interface program of 14 public and private agencies which came together to find homes for Black, Hispanic and minority children needing adoption who in her own words \\"were forced to spend their formative years in hospitals, shelters, institutions and boarding homes\\". She played a vital role in organizing forums and interstate conferences to discuss the inequities and unique issues related to their adoption. First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt made a visit to Harlem N.Y. to support the efforts of the growing Spence-Chapin Adoption Service in 1954. A reception was given in her honor at the Delany home on 145th street and Riverside Drive (Manhattan) where Judge Delany and his wife Willetta became the first African American family to host an incumbent First Lady. Mrs. Willetta Delany was one of the earliest African American women on the Board of Spence-Chapin Adoption Service along with Mrs. Rachel Robinson, Mrs. Ralph Bunche and Marian Anderson. In support of the agency's outreach efforts, Eleanor Roosevelt was the featured speaker for a Spence-Chapin conference. Mrs. Roosevelt was quoted in The New York Times as saying, \\"No matter what the color of their skin, all our children must be looked at as the future rich heritage of the country.\\" =Second class treatment= In 1955, during a stay in Hartford, Connecticut to speak on juvenile delinquency, Judge Delany filed a complaint of second-class treatment with Hartford's Commission on Civil Rights. The Statler Hotel denied him a room even with a reservation, because he was Black. The hotel staff then offered him the use of a cot in a meeting room. =Trial attorney= In 1956, after retiring from the Domestic Relations Court, Delany continued to practice along with attorneys Emile Zola Berman Esq, A. Harold Frost Esq. and George J. Mintzer Esq. The firm litigated within all of the Courts of the State of New York, Federal District and Circuit Courts, and the Supreme Court of the United States. =Consultant to State of Israel = In the Spring of 1956, the Government of Israel invited Delany to Tel Aviv as consultant to the Minister of Justice to study juvenile delinquency and assist in the reorganization of the Domestic Relations Courts of the State of Israel. In late 1956, an article discussing his consultancy and findings was published as \\"Hubert Delany Reports on Israel\\" in the official NAACP publication The Crisis. =Martin Luther King trial of 1960= In late 1959, Martin Luther King Jr. was leaving Montgomery, Alabama to return to his father's church, Ebenezer Baptist in Atlanta, Georgia. Just prior to his departure, Alabama authorities charged King with failure to pay income tax. Leading King's legal team, Delany won a historic \\"not guilty\\" verdict from an all-white jury in segregated Alabama. After the trial, King wrote that the verdict was a \\"turning point\\" in his life and gave praise to Delany and his other principal lawyer, William Robert Ming: \\"They brought to the courtroom wisdom, courage, and a highly developed art of advocacy; but most important, they brought the lawyers' indomitable determination to win. After a trial of three days, by the sheer strength of their legal arsenal, they overcame the most vicious Southern taboos festering in a virulent and inflamed atmosphere and they persuaded an all-white jury to accept the word of a Negro over that of white men.\\" In his autobiography, Dr. King described the trial like this: \\"This case was tried before an all-white Southern jury. All of the State's witnesses were white. The judge and the prosecutor were white. The courtroom was segregated. Passions were inflamed. Feelings ran high. The press and other communications media were hostile. Defeat seemed certain, and we in the freedom struggle braced ourselves for the inevitable. There were two men among us who persevered with the conviction that it was possible, in this context, to marshal facts and law and thus win vindication. These men were our lawyers-Negro lawyers from the North: William Ming of Chicago and Hubert Delany from New York.\\" Dr. King also noted: \\"I am frank to confess that on this occasion I learned that truth and conviction in the hands of a skillful advocate could make what started out as a bigoted, prejudiced jury, choose the path of justice. I cannot help but wish in my heart that the same kind of skill and devotion which Bill Ming and Hubert Delany accorded to me could be available to thousands of civil rights workers, to thousands of ordinary Negroes, who are every day facing prejudiced courtrooms.\\" King's wife, Coretta Scott King, discussed the trial in her autobiography: \\"A southern jury of twelve white men had acquitted Martin. It was a triumph of justice, a miracle that restored your faith in human good.\\" =Low-income housing= In May 1963, Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller appointed Delany as Chairman of a powerful Temporary State Commission on Low-income Housing. The commission held all the authority of a full legislative public inquiry with the ability to call witnesses and subpoena records. The commission proposed using state funds to help low-income families live in middle-income housing projects and privately owned apartments as a means of promoting integration. By proposing to subsidize low-income families, placing them in middle-income units built with state assistance, the Delany commission ultimately went far beyond the original Rockefeller plan. This early commission became the forerunner to creation of the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) in 1968. The UDC was designed and given broad powers and resources to \\"improve the physical environment for low-and moderate-income families.\\" Under Governor Rockefeller, and by 1973, the UDC (known today as the Empire State Development Corporation) had successfully created over 88,000 units of housing for limited income families and the aging.State of New York, Public Papers of Nelson A. Rockefeller, Fifty-third Governor of the State of New York, vol. 15, 1973 (Albany, NY: State of New York, 1973), p. 1382. Death On December 28, 1990, Delany died at the age of 89 in Manhattan where he lived the majority of his life. He was survived by a wife, Willetta Delany, a daughter, Dr. Madelon Delany Stent; professor of Education at City College of New York and a son, Dr. Harry Mickey Delany; Chairman of the Department of Surgery Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx Hospital, as well as six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Honors and legacy * 1945: Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) awarded Delany an Honorary Legum Doctor (LL.D.) * 1956: University of Tel Aviv (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ï÷º◊†÷¥◊ô◊ë÷∂◊®÷∞◊°÷¥◊ô◊ò÷∑◊™ ◊™÷µ÷º◊ú-◊ê÷∏◊ë÷¥◊ô◊ë Universitat Tel Aviv) in Israel awarded Delany an Honorary Fellowship. He was one of only two Americans to receive the honor, the other being Episcopal Bishop James Albert Pike. Many of Delany's papers, photographs and other materials can be found at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, New York. Family origins More often than not, descendants of enslaved Africans are faced with many challenges when attempting to find ancestry prior to the American Civil War. The ancestry of Judge Delany's African American family has been accurately traced back to the mid 18th century with ties to St. Marys, Georgia, Fernandina Beach, Florida and the Danville, Virginia area. This historic account of an African American family is documented by Delany's two older sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany, in the autobiographical bestseller Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years =Children of Bishop Henry Beard Delany= Hubert T. Delany was the eighth of ten children born to the Rev. Henry Beard Delany (1858‚Äì1928), the first Black person elected Bishop Suffragan of the Episcopal Church in the United States. His siblings were: * Sadie (1889‚Äì1999) and Bessie (1891-1995) Delany, both lived to become centenarian authors of the autobiographical bestseller Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Yearshttp://satucket.com/lectionary/delany&demby.htm;http://archive.wfn.org/1999/02/msg00227.html which documents an historically accurate, nonfiction account of the trials and tribulations the Delany sisters and their family faced during their century of life. The book offers positive images and details of African-American life in the 1890s. Having Our Say illustrates why the Jim Crow laws of racial segregation prompted the Delany sisters and their siblings to make the move from the segregated south to Harlem NYC where many in the family were active in the burgeoning Harlem Renaissance and Civil Rights Movement. * Lemuel Thackara Delany (1887‚Äì1956) was a graduate of St. Augustine's College in 1907.

He is the author of numerous science fiction books including Dhalgren, Babel-17, and Return to Nev√®r√øon, as well as the best- selling nonfiction study Times Square Red, Times Square Blue. His science fiction novels Babel-17 and The Einstein Intersection were winners of the Nebula Award for 1966 and 1967, respectively. =Connection to St. Augustine's University= Founded in 1867 as Saint Augustine's Normal School, the institution first changed its name to Saint Augustine's School in 1893 and then to Saint Augustine's Junior College in 1919 when it began offering college-level coursework. Beginning in the mid-1880s, the children of the Rev. and Mrs. Henry Beard Delany were all born, raised and educated on this campus. The Delanys witnessed a growing St. Augustine's become the first school of nursing in the state of North Carolina for African-Americans. Even today, the Delany family is described as \\"The First Family of St. Augustine's\\". The Delany family began its lengthy relationship with the now historically black college in 1881 when Henry Beard Delany, a former slave from Florida, arrived to study theology. The university further describes the family: \\"As the children of educators, the younger family members understood the importance of education to the future. Many became teachers committed to working with black students while others received advanced degrees after leaving St. Augustine's. Lemuel Delany, like his parents, remained at the school and served the black community as a surgeon at St. Agnes Hospital. Bessie Delany became a dentist and one of only two black women practicing in New York at the time. Three of the siblings, including Sarah Delany, the first black person in New York to teach high school domestic science, were lifelong educators. The careers of the other Delany children included a judge, an attorney, and two undertakers.\\" References External links *Hubert T.

She is best known for her poetry and short stories depicting African-American and lesbian relationships, often focusing on topics such as interracial relationships, emotional recovery from a breakup, single parenthood and adoption. Her poetry was featured in the acclaimed 1983 anthology of African-American feminist writing Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology, edited by Barbara Smith and published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. She has won a Lambda Literary award for her poetry. She has been awarded grants from the Pew Fellowships in the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts to further her literary works. In recent years she has written three children's historical fiction picture books about the African-American experience.  Early life  Rebecca Lucille Birtha was born on October 11, 1948, in Hampton, Virginia, to Jessie Dixon Moore Birtha and Herbert Marshall Birtha. She is the younger sister of Rachel Roxanne Birtha Eitches, a former international radio broadcaster for the Voice of America. She self-identifies as an African American with Cherokee, Catawba, African, and Irish heritage, all of which inform her writing. Birtha grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after the family moved to the Germantown section of the city in 1952. (Back cover). In 1963 the family relocated to the West Mount Airy neighborhood and Birtha attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls. She attended the State University of New York at Buffalo for a Bachelor of Science degree in Child Studies in 1973 and later obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree in Writing from the Vermont College of Fine Arts in 1984. In addition to her writing, she has worked as a teacher, a legal librarian, and as a representative for an adoption agency.  Career and writings  Birtha's first published book of short stories was For Nights Like This One: Stories of Loving Women (1983), an anthology of short stories about lesbian relationships. Her second book, Lovers' Choice, continues Birtha's focus upon the experience of marginalized African-American women in such stories as \\"Route 23: 10th and Bigler to Bethlehem Pike\\", in which a desperate mother takes her children on an all- night public bus ride through the city of Philadelphia in order to keep them warm. She wrote the foreword for Breaking Silence (1983) by Anne B. Keating in November 1983. Foreword, 2. Birtha and Keating were members of a local feminist writers' workshop in Philadelphia under the aegis of a local chapter of the Feminist Writers Guild. Foreword, 1. In 1991, Birtha published The Forbidden Poems, an anthology of poetry focusing on lesbian relationships. According to Birtha, \\"Several [of the] poems were written as part of the process of recovering from the breakup of a 10-year lesbian relationship, of trying to find a way to deal with the feelings that the breakup produced in [her]\\". The Publishers Weekly review of The Forbidden Poems states that in her writings Birtha exhibits a \\"considerable ability to endow ordinary perceptions and occurrences with a profound significance\\" in her depictions of a lesbian community that is \\"stable, loving and creative--and whose members can all make a great cup of tea: 'even a hardcore stomping deisel dyke / can't ruin a pot of boiling water.'\\" Her works have been published in Azalea: A Magazine by Third World Lesbians, Conditions, Sinister Wisdom and Women: a Journal of Liberation. She writes book reviews for The New Women's Times Feminist Review. Ed Hermance, owner and manager of the Philadelphia gay and lesbian bookstore Giovanni's Room, has stated that Birtha's stories \\"have a vivid sense of place as well as an emotional depth rare among storytellers\\". Speaking at the 13th Annual Trenton Writers Conference in 1994, Birtha discussed her career as a writer, stating: \\"Have being black, a woman and lesbian been the biggest barriers I have had to overcome to become a successful writer? ... No, in fact,... I celebrate it. I am also an adoptive parent, a single mother and a Quaker, and that has not stopped me from writing, either.\\" In later years, Birtha transitioned to writing primarily for children. Her first children's book Grandmama‚Äôs Pride (2005) has earned the Golden Kite book award and placement in the master reading lists of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Georgia. Her second picture book Lucky Beans (2010) was named as one of the New York Public Library's 100 Titles for Reading and Sharing 2010 as well as one of Smithsonian Magazine‚Ä≤s 2010 Notable Books for Children. Birtha is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators.  Personal life  Birtha lives with her partner Nancy and daughter Tasha in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. She practiced Balkan folkdancing for over seventeen years and later studied other forms of modern and folk dance. Birtha is a member of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society. Her current hobbies are folk dance and playing the hammered dulcimer. She is a member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). In February, 1991, she gave a keynote address to the Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns conference in which she described writing as a meditative and healing process that connects her to her Quaker faith.  Awards  In 1985, Becky Birtha received an Individual Fellowship in Literature from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. She later received a Creative Writing Fellowship Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She won a Pushcart Prize in 1989 for her story \\"Johnnieruth\\". In 1992, she won one of the 4th Lambda Literary Awards for her anthology of lesbian poetry, The Forbidden Poems (1991). She was awarded one of the Pew Fellowships in the Arts grants for $50,000 for the year 1993. Her children's book Grandmama's Pride (2005) won the 2005 Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators Golden Kite Honor Book for Picture Book Text.

He is best known as an African American Impressionist-style painter during the time of the Harlem Renaissance and as the first African American to be appointed art supervisor of the Philadelphia School District. Personal life Born in Philadelphia on September 2, 1895, to Douglas Freelon and Laura E. (Goodwin) Freelon, a \\"middle-class family of notable academic achievement\\", Freelon was the oldest of three children. On September 4, 1918, he married Marie J. Cuyjet, and they had one child, Allan Randall Freelon Jr. At some point Freelon and Cuyjet divorced; Freelon was married to Mary Kouzmanoff at the time of his death, August 6, 1960. He died while at his art studio in Telford, Pennsylvania. Architect Philip Freelon is his grandson. Education Freelon attended the South Philadelphia High School for Boys, followed by a four-year scholarship (1912‚Äì1916) to the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), from which he graduated in 1916 with a diploma in normal art instruction (what would be called art education today). From there he attended the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy, an upper division of Central High School created to prepare men for teaching careers. Following a stint in the Army from 1917 to 1919, where he served as a second lieutenant, he attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in February 1924 with a BS in education. Further studies ensued at the Barnes Foundation (1927 through 1929), followed by private studies with Emile Gruppe, modernist Earl Horter (1881-1940), neo-Impressionist Hugh Breckenridge (1870-1937), and printmaker Dox Thrash (1892-1965), and the earning of an MFA in 1943 from Tyler School of Art of Temple University. Artistic career The New Negro, a pen and ink sketch One of Freelon's earliest documented exhibitions also happened to be the first exhibition of African-American art in Harlem, at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library, now part of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. He later exhibited from 1928 to 1932 and in 1934 with the William E. Harmon Foundation, whose exhibitions traveled widely in the United States. Other exhibition venues included the Albright-Knox Gallery (Buffalo, NY), the National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), Howard University Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), New Jersey State Museum (Trenton, NJ), Arthur U. Newton Gallery (New York, NY), Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, NY), Lincoln University, and Lehigh Art Alliance (Lehigh, PA). Freelon was one of seven African-American artists who participated in the exhibition Art Commentary on Lynching, organized by the NAACP in response to deaths such as that of Claude Neal. The exhibition was held February 15 to March 2, 1935, in New York. Freelon's work, Barbecue - American Style, portrays a naked man, tortured and in flames, encircled by the feet of spectators. He wrote: Freelon was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Philadelphia Art Teachers Association, Philadelphia Art Week Association, Artists' Equity, Tra Club, Pyramid Club, Society of New Jersey Artists, North Shore Art Association of Gloucester, MA, American Federation of Arts, and was the first person of color elected to the Print Club of Philadelphia. He served as an editor of and contributor to the literary and art magazine, Black Opals. Formed in 1937, the Pyramid Club provided prominent African Americans, who were excluded from most clubs, with opportunities to meet and network. From March 2‚Äì16, 1941, the Pyramid Club sponsored the first of its annual invitational art exhibits, 20th Century Negro Contemporary Artists and Memorial Paintings of Henry O. Tanner. Freelon was asked to speak at the inaugural event, and discussed the role of the Black artist and his influence in current events. Coming of artistic age during the time of the \\"New Negro\\", Freelon found himself in aesthetic disagreement with fellow Philadelphian Alain LeRoy Locke, who urged African American artists to take up African themes as the source for their art in The New Negro (NY: Boni, 1925). Freelon \\"vigorously defended the artist's right to freedom of expression\\", writing in a 1944 review of James A. Porter's book, Modern Negro Art: Teaching career Following his 1919 graduation from the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy, Freelon became an art teacher in the Philadelphia public school system. In 1921 he was appointed as assistant director of art education, the first African American to be appointed to the district's Department of Superintendence. In July 1939 he was named \\"special assistant to Theodore M. Dilliway [sic: Dillaway], director of art in the Philadelphia public schools, and will supervise art work in vocational and junior high schools. He has been supervising art projects in the elementary schools for a number of years, and his promotion follows competitive examination for the new post, held recently by Board of Education.\\" He placed first in that examination and held that position until his death. Deeply interested in printmaking, Freelon taught etching and lithography at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1940 to 1946. In addition to his public school teaching career, Freelon taught classes at the Telford, Pennsylvania, studio he called Windy Crest. Political life Freelon ran for the Pennsylvania state legislature in 1949 on the Progressive Party (United States, 1948) ticket. He lost.

Victoria's early reign was characterised by rapid industrial development and social and political change, which made the United Kingdom one of the most powerful and advanced nations in the world. Painting in the early years of her reign was dominated by the Royal Academy of Arts and by the theories of its first president, Joshua Reynolds. Reynolds and the academy were strongly influenced by the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael, and believed that it was the role of an artist to make the subject of their work appear as noble and idealised as possible. This had proved a successful approach for artists in the pre-industrial period, where the main subjects of artistic commissions were portraits of the nobility and military and historical scenes. By the time of Victoria's accession to the throne this approach was coming to be seen as stale and outdated. The rise of the wealthy middle class had changed the art market, and a generation who had grown up in an industrial age believed in the importance of accuracy and attention to detail, and that the role of art was to reflect the world, not to idealise it. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, a group of young art students formed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as a reaction against the teaching of the Royal Academy. Their works were based on painting as accurately as possible from nature when able, and when painting imaginary scenes to ensure they showed as closely as possible the scene as it would have appeared, rather than distorting the subject of the painting to make it appear noble. They also felt that it was the role of the artist to tell moral lessons, and chose subjects which would have been understood as morality tales by the audiences of the time. They were particularly fascinated by recent scientific advances which appeared to disprove the biblical chronology, as they related to the scientists' attention to detail and willingness to challenge their own existing beliefs. Although the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was relatively short-lived, their ideas were highly influential. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 led to a number of influential French Impressionist artists moving to London, bringing with them new styles of painting. At the same time, a severe economic depression and the increasing spread of mechanisation made British cities an increasingly unpleasant place to live, and artists turned against the emphasis on reflecting reality. A new generation of painters and writers known as the aesthetic movement felt that the domination of art buying by the poorly-educated middle class, and the Pre-Raphaelite emphasis on reflecting the reality of an ugly world, was leading to a decline in the quality of painting. The aesthetic movement concentrated on creating works depicting beauty and noble deeds, as a distraction from the unpleasantness of reality. As the quality of life in Britain continued to deteriorate, many artists turned to painting scenes from the pre-industrial past, while many artists within the aesthetic movement, regardless of their own religious beliefs, painted religious art as it gave them a reason to paint idealised scenes and portraits and to ignore the ugliness and uncertainty of reality. The Victorian age ended in 1901, by which time many of the most prominent Victorian artists had already died. In the early 20th century the Victorian attitudes and arts became extremely unpopular. The modernist movement, which came to dominate British art, was drawn from European traditions and had little connection with 19th-century British works. Because Victorian painters had generally been extremely hostile towards these European traditions, they were mocked or ignored by modernist painters and critics in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1960s some Pre-Raphaelite works came back into fashion amongst elements of the 1960s counterculture, who saw them as a predecessor of 1960s trends. A series of exhibitions in the 1960s and 1970s further restored their reputation, and a major exhibit of Pre-Raphaelite work in 1984 was one of the most commercially successful exhibitions in the Tate Gallery's history. While Pre-Raphaelite art enjoyed a return to popularity, non-Pre-Raphaelite Victorian painting remains generally unfashionable, and the lack of any significant collections in the United States has restricted wider knowledge of it. Background The First of May, 1851 by Franz Xaver Winterhalter was intended to symbolise the age. Winterhalter painted in the manner promoted by Joshua Reynolds and based on the style of Raphael, in which the artist consciously idealises the subject of the work. The painting shows the 82nd birthday of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (born 1 May 1769), whose military victories were felt to have secured the stability and prosperity of the United Kingdom, and who as Prime Minister had attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, at this time considered one of the key turning points of the Industrial Revolution. Wellington presents a casket to his godson Prince Arthur, seventh child of Victoria and Albert (born 1 May 1850), on his first birthday, and receives a nosegay from Arthur in return. Albert is distracted from the scene by the sun rising over the Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition, organised by Albert, which opened on 1 May 1851 and symbolised the strength of British technology and innovation and the belief that technology would lead to a great future. When the 18-year-old Alexandrina Victoria inherited the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as Queen Victoria in 1837, the country had enjoyed unbroken peace since the final victory over Napoleon in 1815. In 1832 the Representation of the People Act (commonly known as the Reform Act) and its equivalents in Scotland and Ireland had abolished many of the corrupt practices of the British political system, giving the country a stable and relatively representative government. The Industrial Revolution was underway, and in 1838 the London and Birmingham Railway opened, linking the industrial north of England to the cities and ports of the south; by 1850 over of railways were in place and Britain's transformation into an industrial superpower was complete. The perceived triumph of technology, progress and peaceful trade was celebrated in the 1851 Great Exhibition, organised by Victoria's husband Albert, which attracted over 40,000 visitors per day to view the over 100,000 exhibits of manufacturing, farming and engineering on display. While Britain's economy had traditionally been dominated by the landowning aristocracy of the countryside, the Industrial Revolution and political reforms had greatly reduced their influence, and created a booming middle class of merchants, manufacturers and engineers in London and the industrial cities of the north. The newly rich were generally keen to show off their affluence through the display of art, and rich enough to pay high prices for art works, but generally had little interest in the old masters, preferring modern works by local artists. In 1844 Parliament ruled art unions legal, which commissioned artworks by famous artists, paying for them by means of a lottery in which the finished artwork was the prize; this not only offered an entrance to the art world for people who may not have been able to afford to buy a significant painting, but stimulated a growing market for prints. =Reynolds and the Royal Academy= British painting had been strongly influenced by Joshua Reynolds (1723‚Äì1792), the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts, who believed that the purpose of art was \\"to conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere matter of fact\\", and that artists should aspire to emulate the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael in making their subjects appear as close to perfection as possible. Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise (1839). Dickens's focus on reflecting the reality of modern life was highly influential on British artists. By the time of Victoria's accession the Royal Academy dominated British art, with the annual Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the most important event in the arts world. The Royal Academy also controlled the prestigious Royal Academy art schools, which taught with a very narrow focus on approved techniques. Painting in Raphael's style had proved commercially successful for artists serving a nobility primarily interested in family portraiture, military scenes and scenes from history, religion and classical mythology, but by the time of Victoria's accession was coming to be seen as a dead end. The destruction of the Houses of Parliament in late 1834, and the subsequent competitions to select artists to decorate its replacement, threw into sharp focus the lack of competent British artists able to paint historic and literary topics, which at the time were considered the most important form of painting. From 1841 the new, and highly influential, satirical magazine Punch increasingly ridiculed the Royal Academy and contemporary British artists. John Ruskin's seminal Modern Painters, the first volume of which was published in 1843, argued that it was the purpose of art to represent the world and allow the viewer to form their own opinions of the subject, not to idealise it. Ruskin believed that only by representing nature as accurately as possible could the artist reflect the divine qualities within the natural world. An upcoming generation of young artists, the first to have grown up in an industrial age in which the accurate representation of technical detail was considered a virtue and a necessity, came to agree with this view. In 1837 Charles Dickens began to publish novels attempting to reflect the reality of the problems of the present day, rather than the past or an idealised present; his writings were greatly admired by many of the rising generation of artists. In 1837 painter Richard Dadd and a group of friends formed The Clique, a group of artists rejecting the Academy's tradition of historical subjects and portraiture in favour of populist genre painting. While the majority of The Clique returned to the Royal Academy in the 1840s, after the incarceration of Dadd following his 1843 murder of his father, they were the first group of significant artists to challenge the positions of the Royal Academy. J. M. W. Turner At the time of Victoria's accession, the most significant living British artist was J. M. W. Turner. Turner had made his name in the late 18th century with a series of well- regarded landscape watercolours, and exhibited his first oil painting in 1796. A staunch ally of the Royal Academy throughout his life, he was elected a full Royal Academician in 1802 at the age of 27. In 1837 he resigned from his post as professor of perspective at the Royal Academy, and in 1840 first met John Ruskin. The first volume of Ruskin's Modern Painters was a defence of Turner, arguing that Turner's greatness had developed despite, not because of, the influence of Reynolds and a consequent desire to idealise the subjects of his paintings. By the 1840s, Turner was drifting out of fashion. Despite Ruskin's defence of his work as being ultimately \\"an entire transcript of the whole system of nature\\", Turner (who by 1845 had become the eldest Academician and deputy president of the Royal Academy) had come to be seen by younger artists to embody bombast and wilfulness, and to be a product of an earlier, Romantic period out of touch with the modern age. Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Ophelia (1851‚Äì2) illustrates the PRB attention to detail. All flowers mentioned in the relevant scene from Hamlet are accurately illustrated. In 1848 three young students at the Royal Academy art schools, William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, formed the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB). The PRB rejected the ideas of Joshua Reynolds, and had a philosophy based on working from nature as accurately as possible wherever possible, and when it was necessary to paint from imagination to strive to show the event as it most likely would have happened, not in the way that would appear most attractive or noble. The PRB took their inspiration from scientific exhibitions, and felt this scientific approach was in itself an instrument of moral good. The intensely laboured detail and attention to accuracy showed that hard work and dedication had gone into their paintings, and thus illustrated the virtue of work, as contrasted to the \\"loose, irresponsible handling\\" of the Old Masters' techniques or the \\"defiant indolence\\" of Impressionism. As well as this, they felt it was the duty of the artist to choose subjects which illustrated moral lessons of some kind. Early PRB works were noted for their inclusion of flowers, which suited their purpose well. Flowers could be used in almost any scene, they could be used to convey messages in the then-popular language of flowers, and accurately illustrating them showed the artist's dedication to scientific accuracy. Pegwell Bay, Kent ‚Äì a Recollection of October 5th 1858 shows Comet Donati as seen from Pegwell Bay, traditionally considered the site of the introduction of Christianity to England and of the arrival of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain. Its extreme attention to detail, and use of symbolism drawn with scientific accuracy, are characteristic of Pre-Raphaelite painting. The Victorian age was characterised by rapid scientific advance, and by rapidly changing attitudes to religion as advances in geology, astronomy and chemistry disproved the biblical chronology. The PRB found these advances fascinating, based as they were in attention to detail and a willingness to challenge existing beliefs on the basis of observed fact. PRB founder William Holman Hunt led a revolution in English religious art, visiting the Holy Land and studying archaeological evidence and the clothing and appearance of local people to paint biblical scenes as accurately as possible. By 1854 the PRB had collapsed as an organisation, but their style continued to dominate British painting. An exhibit of Pre-Raphaelite works at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle was well received. The 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, which exhibited the works of contemporary artists alongside 2000 works by European masters saw 1,300,000 visitors, further increasing awareness of modern painting styles. In 1856 art collector John Sheepshanks presented his collection of modern paintings to the nation, which together with the exhibits from the Great Exhibition formed the South Kensington Museum in June 1857 (later divided into the Victoria and Albert Museum of visual arts and the Science Museum of engineering and manufacturing technology). Painting remained a field dominated by male artists at this time. In 1859 a petition by 38 female artists was circulated to all Royal Academicians requesting the opening of the Academy to women. Later that year Laura Herford submitted a qualifying drawing to the Academy signed simply \\"A. L. Herford\\"; when the Academy accepted it, the Academy accepted her as its first female student in 1860. The Slade School of Fine Art, founded in 1871, actively recruited female students. =Love, lust and beauty= Venus Verticordia led to the collapse of relations between Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Ruskin. In the 1860s, the Pre- Raphaelite movement splintered, with some of its adherents abandoning strict realism in favour of poetry and attractiveness. Particularly in the case of Rossetti, this tended to be embodied in paintings of women. As with many other artists and writers of the time, as his religious faith waned Rossetti increasingly saw love as the most important subject. This move towards depicting the effects of love became explicit in Venus Verticordia (\\"Venus the turner of hearts\\"), painted by Rossetti in the mid-1860s. The title and subject come from John Lempri√®re's Bibliotheca Classica, and refers to a prayer to Venus to turn the hearts of Roman women away from debauchery and lust and back towards modesty and virtue. Surrounding Venus, roses represent love, honeysuckle represents lust, and the bird represents the shortness of human life. She holds the Golden Apple of Discord and Cupid's arrow, thought to be a reference to the Trojan War and the destructiveness of love. John Ruskin disliked the painting intensely. While it is now thought that his dislike of the painting was due to a dislike of the representation of the naked female form, he claimed his issues with the painting were with the depiction of the flowers, writing to Rossetti to advise him that \\"They were wonderful to me, in their realism; awful‚ÄîI can use no other word‚Äîin their coarseness: showing enormous power, showing certain conditions of non- sentiment which underlie all you are doing now\\". Ruskin's hostility towards the painting led to a quarrel between Ruskin and Rossetti, and Rossetti drifted away from Pre-Raphaelite thinkings and towards the new doctrine of art for art's sake expounded by Algernon Charles Swinburne. Animal painting The Monarch of the Glen (1851) epitomised 19th-century animal painting. Since the time of George Stubbs (1724‚Äì1806), Britain has had a strong tradition of animal painting, a field which had gained respect owing to James Ward's highly proficient animal paintings of the early 19th century. Selective breeding of livestock, particularly dogs, had become highly popular, leading to a lucrative market in drawings and paintings of prize-winning animals. In the early 19th century the Scottish Highlands experienced a dramatic upsurge in popularity among the wealthy of Britain, particularly for the opportunities they offered for hunting. One painter in particular, Edwin Landseer (1802‚Äì1873), took the opportunity offered by the boom in Scottish travel, travelling to Scotland for the first time in 1824 and returning each year to hunt, shoot, fish and sketch. Francis Barraud's His Master's Voice (1898‚Äì1900) was rejected by the Royal Academy, but was sold to the Gramophone Company. It remains the logo of Gramophone's successor HMV Retail Ltd. Landseer became well known for his paintings of the landscapes, people and particularly wildlife of Scotland, to the extent that his paintings, along with the novels of Sir Walter Scott, became the primary means through which people in the rest of the United Kingdom came to picture Scotland. His works were in such high demand that the engraving rights (the right to make printed duplicates of a work) would generally sell for at least three or four times the sale cost of each work, and it was rare for a work of his to sell for less than ¬£1000. In 1840 Landseer suffered a bout of mental illness and suffered alcoholism and mental illness throughout the rest of his life, although he continued to work successfully. In later years he became best known as the designer of the bronze lions at the base of Nelson's Column, unveiled in 1867. Landseer and other animal painters such as Briton Rivi√®re also became well known for sentimental paintings of dogs. Landseer's The Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner, showing a sheepdog sitting beside a coffin, was particularly well-regarded by John Ruskin, who described it as \\"a touching poem upon canvas, which, it cannot be doubted, has caused many a stout heart to 'play the woman' by moving it to tears\\". Many of the artists of the period were keen huntsmen, and accepted as a given that nature was inherently cruel and that learning to embrace this cruelty was a mark of manliness. In this context, dogs exhibiting emotions were a highly popular topic in a time of rapidly declining religious faith, suggesting the possibility of a nobility within nature that transcended cruelty and the will to live as a driving force. Aesthetic movement Aurora Triumphans (1886) by Evelyn De Morgan represents the triumph of light over darkness. In common with many at the time, De Morgan had lost her Christian faith but retained a deep sense of spirituality. This painting was falsely attributed to Edward Burne-Jones for many years, and bears his forged signature. In the 1870s the Long Depression wrecked the economy and confidence of Britain, and the spirit of progress symbolised by the Great Exhibition began to fade, to the extent that in 1904 G. K. Chesterton described the Crystal Palace as \\"the temple of a forgotten creed\\". Some rising artists such as George Frederic Watts complained that the increasing mechanism of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 caused large numbers of French artists such as Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro to relocate to London, bringing with them new styles of painting. Art critic Walter Pater's The Renaissance, published in 1873, led a backlash against Pre-Raphaelitism, arguing that the only worthy way to conduct one's life was through the pursuit of pleasure and the love of art and beauty for their own sakes. Nocturne in Black and Gold ‚Äì The Falling Rocket and other aesthetic paintings were a controversial departure from previous English traditions. Against this background, a new generation of painters such as Frederic Leighton and James Abbott McNeill Whistler departed from the traditions of storytelling and moralising, painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Whistler disparaged the Pre-Raphaelite obsession with accuracy and realism, complaining that their audience had developed \\"the habit of looking not at a picture, but through it\\". The Pre-Raphaelites and their remaining champions protested vigorously against this new style of art, as did the Royal Academy, leading Sir Coutts Lindsay to set up the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 to show the work of artists overlooked by the Royal Academy. Matters reached a head in 1877, when John Ruskin visited an exhibition of Whistler's Nocturne paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery. He wrote of the painting Nocturne in Black and Gold ‚Äì The Falling Rocket, that Whistler was \\"asking two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\\". Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878. The judge in the case caused laughter in the court when, referring to Nocturne: Blue and Gold ‚Äì Old Battersea Bridge, he asked Whistler \\"Which part of the picture is the bridge?\\"; the case ended with Whistler awarded token damages of one farthing, the costs of the trial driving him into bankruptcy. The aesthetic movement, as Pater and his successors came to be known, became increasingly influential; it was championed by Whistler and Oscar Wilde and until his death in 1883 by former Pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and was popularised with the public by the successful Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera Patience. The movement considered the rise of middle- class of art buyers in Birmingham and Manchester, wealthy enough to buy art but insufficiently educated to show good taste, as having led to the decline of quality in British art. Coupled with this, they felt that since industrialisation and capitalism were making the world increasingly unattractive, the emphasis of Pre-Raphaelite painters and those influenced by them upon reflecting reality as closely as possible was itself leading to the loss of beauty from art. Consequently, the artists of the aesthetic movement saw the task of the artist as providing a distraction from the ugliness of reality for their viewers, readers and listeners, and of trying to highlight and emphasise the beauty of the world and the nobility of good deeds, even if the artist no longer themselves believed in such things. The 1878 election of Frederick Leighton as the Royal Academy's president went some way to healing the breach within the British art world, as Leighton endeavoured to ensure the Summer Exhibition was open to young artists and artists working in new styles. Edward Burne-Jones defended the blank expressions of the mourners in The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon (1881‚Äì98) by saying that \\"a little more expression and they would be neither queens nor mysteries nor symbols\\". The painters of the aesthetic movement prided themselves on their detachment from reality, working from studios and rarely mingling with the public. Likewise, the subjects of their paintings were rarely engaged in activity of any kind; human figures typically stand, sit or lie still, generally with blank facial expressions. Classical revival As the century progressed and the combination of mechanisation, economic decline, political chaos and religious faith made Britain an increasingly unpleasant place in which to live, the population increasingly came to look back to pre-industrial times as a golden age. As part of this trend, artists became drawn to pre-industrial subjects and techniques, and art buyers were particularly drawn to artists who could make connections between the present day and these idealised times such as to the Middle Ages, which were seen as the period in which the key institutions of modern Britain had begun and which had been popularised in the public imagination by the novels of Sir Walter Scott. The Roses of Heliogabalus (1888) by Lawrence Alma-Tadema shows the Emperor Heliogabalus (reigned 218‚Äì222) suffocating guests beneath rose petals, and was part of a major trend towards painting historical scenes. Against this background there arose a great fashion for paintings on mediaeval themes, particularly Arthurian legend and religious themes. Many of the most noteworthy artists of the period, particularly from the aesthetic movement, chose to work on such themes despite their lack of religious faith, as it gave a legitimate excuse to paint idealised figures and scenes and to avoid reflecting the reality of industrial Britain. (Edward Burne-Jones, who despite his lack of Christian belief was the most significant painter of religious imagery in the period, told Oscar Wilde that \\"The more materialistic science becomes, the more angels I shall paint\\".) Other painters took to painting different periods of the idealised past; Lawrence Alma-Tadema painted scenes of Ancient Rome, former Pre-Raphaelite John Everett Millais took to painting in the style of painters from the period immediately preceding the Industrial Revolution such as Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough, and Frederic Leighton specialised in highly idealised scenes from Ancient Greece. While there had been fashions for historical paintings before in British history, that of the late 19th century was unique. In previous revivals, dating from the Renaissance to the late 18th century, the ancient world symbolised greatness, dynamism and virility. In contrast, the aesthetic movement and their followers sought to emulate the most passive (and generally female) works of the classical world, such as the Venus de Milo. Painters of this period emphasised passivity and internal drama, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. They also, again unlike previous classical revivals, worked primarily in bright colours, rather than trying to suggest the bright but bleak appearance of classical stonework. Not all members of the aesthetic movement subscribed to the backlash against the present in favour of an idealised past. Whistler, in particular, was scathing of this view, dismissing the sentiment as \\"this lifting of the brow in deprecation of the present‚Äîthis pathos in reference to the past\\". =French influence and the rise of art colonies= A Hopeless Dawn by Frank Bramley was painted in the Newlyn School, an art colony in Newlyn, Cornwall. A fisherman's wife and mother weep together over a Bible, on realising that he is lost at sea. Even among artists who did not paint pictures of the past, the influence of the backlash against modernity often had an effect. In landscape painting in particular, artists generally abandoned the effort to paint realistic depictions of views, and instead focused on effects of lighting, and on the capturing of elements of the pre- industrial countryside that they felt were likely to be destroyed. Country scenes, and images of country people (particularly farmers and fishermen and their families), became a highly popular topic both in Britain and throughout industrialising Europe. Art colonies began to open in locations thought particularly picturesque, allowing artists and students to work in the countryside and meet genuine country people, while still in the company of like-minded people. The most influential of these colonies was the Newlyn School in western Cornwall, which was heavily influenced by the style of Jules Bastien-Lepage in which individual brushstrokes remain visible, suggesting the coarse simplicity of the idealised country life. The techniques introduced by the Newlyn School and other similar French impressionist styles such as those of Edgar Degas were in turn taken up by painters elsewhere in the country such as Walter Sickert, while John William Waterhouse fused backgrounds painted in Bastien-Lepage's style with Pre-Raphaelite images of historical and classical legends. This spread of French techniques was viewed with deep scepticism by the preceding generation of painters. British painters had historically prided themselves on each having a distinct and easily recognisable style, and viewed French and French-influenced painters as being unduly similar to each other in style, and as John Everett Millais said \\"content to lose their identity in their imitation of their French masters\\". George Frederic Watts saw the rise of the French style as reflecting a growing culture of laziness within Britain as a whole, while William Holman Hunt was troubled by the lack of significance of the paintings' subjects. Despite Leighton's reforms of the Royal Academy the Summer Exhibition remained mainly closed to these painters, leading to the foundation in 1886 of the New English Art Club as an exhibition space in London for French-influenced painters. The New English Art Club in turn suffered a schism in 1889 between those painters who painted rural life and nature, and a faction led by Walter Sickert who felt themselves more influenced by impressionism and experimental techniques. Legacy abstraction which would shortly sweep away Victorian art. The opening of the Tate Gallery in 1897, opened to display sugar merchant Sir Henry Tate's collection of Victorian art, proved the last triumph of Victorian painting. Leighton and Millais had died the preceding year; Burne-Jones died in 1898, followed by Ruskin in 1900 and Victoria herself in 1901. In the 1910s, Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Many people blamed the outbreak of the First World War, which devastated Britain and Europe, on the legacy of the Victorian age, and arts and literature associated with the period became deeply unpopular. Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians (1918) and Max Beerbohm's Rossetti and His Circle (1922), both extremely successful and influential, brought parody of the Victorian age and Victorian artists into the literary mainstream, while the increasingly influential modernism movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul C√©zanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting. Throughout the 20th century the work of the 19th-century French impressionists and post-impressionists rose in value and importance. Because the Pre-Raphaelites and the members of the aesthetic movement, who between them had dominated Victorian painting, had united in the late 19th century in condemnation of French influence and the perceived laziness and insignificance of impressionism and post-impressionism, they were mocked or dismissed by many modernist painters and critics in the first half of the 20th century. In the 1940s William Gaunt's The Pre-Raphaelite Tragedy, coupled with a general desire during wartime to celebrate the achievements of British culture, led to a revival of interest in Victorian art. A number of major British museums held events and exhibits in 1948 to mark the centenary of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but fashionable art critics such as Wyndham Lewis mocked the PRB as a pretentious irrelevance. In 1963 Flaming June was valued at just ¬£50. A major exhibition in 1951‚Äì52 at the Royal Academy of Arts, The First Hundred Years of the Royal Academy 1769‚Äì1868 brought a number of British works from the 19th century to a wider audience, but the general opinion of Victorian art remained low. In the 1960s some aspects of Victorian art became popular in the 1960s counterculture, as Pre-Raphaelitism in particular began to be seen as a precursor of Pop art and other contemporary trends. A series of exhibitions on individual Pre-Raphaelite and PRB- influenced artists in the 1960s and 1970s further boosted their reputation, and a major exhibition in 1984 at what was then the Tate Gallery (now Tate Britain) showcasing the entire Pre-Raphaelite movement was one of the most commercially successful exhibitions in the gallery's history. Non-Pre- Raphaelite Victorian art mainly remained unfashionable. In 1963 Flaming June, one of the most significant among Sir Frederic Leighton's classicist pieces, went on the market in London at just ¬£50 (about ¬£ in today's terms), and as late as 1967 art historian Quentin Bell felt able to write that Victorian art was \\"aesthetically and therefore historically negligible\\". Although non-Pre- Raphaelite Victorian art has experienced a slight revival in subsequent years, it remains unfashionable, and the lack of any significant collections in the United States has held back global interest in the topic.

David Fishelov (), born June 1, 1954, is an Israeli professor of comparative literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Education Fishelov earned his bachelor's degree in comparative literature and philosophy (1979), his master's degree in comparative literature from Tel Aviv University (1982), and a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of California, Berkeley (1986). He wrote his doctoral thesis on the role of metaphors in theories of literary genres. Career Fishelov has taught in the Department of Comparative Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem since 1986. He has worked as a visiting professor at Berkeley, the University of Chicago, Columbia University, and the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, and also taught at the Rothberg International School of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is a member of the editorial board of Connotations: A Journal for Critical Debate. In 2011, Fishelov served as chairman of the committee appointed by the Israeli Ministry of Culture and the city of Jerusalem to award the Yehuda Amichai Prize in poetry. As a literary critic, Fishelov has published review articles and essays in the literary supplements of the daily newspapers Davar, Haaretz, and Yediot Ahronot. He has also written afterwords to Hebrew translations of 18th- century literary works, such as Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, Jonathan Swift's Selected Writing, and Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy. Research Fishelov's topics of research include genre theory, poetic simile, biblical characters in modern literature, the role of literary and artistic dialogues in canon formation, 18th-century English literature, and modern Hebrew poetry. His book Metaphors of Genre made a significant impact on the field of genre studies. In it, Fishelov described the role played by conceptual metaphors in modern theories of literary genre: Literary genres have been compared to biological species, to families, to social institutions, and to speech acts. Unlike post- structuralist and deconstructionist criticism, the book argues that generic categories still play an important role in the process of the production, reception, and interpretation of literary texts. When the book first came out, some reviewers criticized it for advocating a conservative approach to genres, but since then, the book's usefulness in genre studies has been acknowledged by many scholars in the field. In Like a Rainfall, Fishelov offered a model for describing poetic similes (e.g., T. S. Eliot's \\"the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table\\") as a cluster of functional deviations from the norms of trite, nonpoetic similes (e.g., \\"it is as good as gold\\"). Alongside the general model, the book offered close readings of poetic similes drawn from poets of different periods and languages (e.g., Virgil, John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, and Yehuda Amichai). In his book Samson's Locks (in Hebrew), which won the first Bahat Prize for nonfiction, Fishelov traced adaptations of the biblical story of Samson throughout history and demonstrated the role of the Bible as a source of inspiration for authors and artists. Fishelov wrote about the transformations of mythical and classical stories in Dialogues with/and Great Books, in which he argued, through a blend of empirical methods and close readings, that literary and artistic adaptations foster and maintain a book's canonical status. In a 2017 article, Fishelov argued that the attempt to link Darwinism to literary studies has failed \\"to produce compelling evidence to support some of its basic assumptions (notably that literature is an adaptation)\\" and called on literary scholars to be more conceptually rigorous when \\"pursuing empirical research into different aspects of literary evolution.\\"David Fishelov, \\"Evolution and Literary Studies: Time to Evolve,\\" Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 2 (October 2017): 286.

In sentimental comedies, middle-class protagonists triumphantly overcome a series of moral trials. These plays aimed to produce tears rather than laughter and reflected contemporary philosophical conceptions of humans as inherently good but capable of being led astray by bad example. By appealing to his noble sentiments, a man could be reformed and set back on the path of virtue. While the plays contained characters whose natures seemed overly virtuous and whose problems were too easily resolved, they were accepted by audiences as truthful representations of the human predicament. Elements of the genre The characters in sentimental comedy are either strictly good or bad. Heroes have no faults or bad habits, villains are thoroughly evil or morally degraded. The authors' purpose was to show the audience the innate goodness of people and that through morality people who have been led astray can find the path of righteousness. The plot usually centered on the domestic trials of middle-class couples and included romantic love scenes. Their private woes are exhibited with much emotional stress intended to arouse the spectator‚Äôs pity and suspense in advance of the approaching happy ending. Lovers are often shown separated from each other by socioeconomic factors at the beginning, but brought together in the end by a discovery about the identity of the lower class lover. Plots also contained an element of mystery to be solved. Verse was not used in order to create a closer illusion of reality. It was thought that rhyme would obscure the true meaning of the words and make the truth disappear. The playwrights of this genre aimed to bring the audience to tears, not laughter, as the name sentimental comedy might suggest. They believed that noisy laughter inhibited the silent sympathy and thought of the audience. Playwrights strove to touch the feelings of the spectators so that they could learn from the play and relate the events they witnessed on stage to their own lives, causing them to live more virtuously. Major works Richard SteeleThe best known work of this genre is Sir Richard Steele's The Conscious Lovers (1722), in which the penniless heroine Indiana faces various tests until the discovery that she is an heiress leads to the necessary happy ending. Steele wished his plays to bring the audience, \\"a pleasure too exquisite for laughter.\\" Steele was an Irish writer and politician, remembered mainly for co-founding the magazine The Spectator. While he wrote a few notable sentimental comedies, he was criticized for being a hypocrite as he wrote moral plays, booklets, and articles but enjoyed drinking, occasional dueling, and debauchery around town. Scholars argue whether a more important writer of the genre was Colley Cibber, an actor-manager, writer, and poet laureate who wrote the first sentimental comedy, Love's Last Shift, in order to give himself a role. The play did establish him as both an actor and a playwright, and though some of his 25 plays were praised, his political adaptations of well-known works met with much criticism. Neither Steele nor Colley, or any other writer, made a career of writing sentimental comedies as the genre was popular for only a short time. In fact, all of the authors of sentimental comedy at this time wrote other forms, including restoration comedy and tragedy. Sentimental comedies continued to coexist with more conventional laughing comedies such as Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer (1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals (1775) until the sentimental genre waned in the early 19th century. =Sentimental comedies= * Love's Last Shift by Colley Cibber (1696) * The Constant Couple by George Farquhar (1699) * The Lying Lover by Richard Steele (1703) * The Tender Husband by Richard Steele (1705) * The Conscious Lovers by Richard Steele (1722) * The Foundling by Edward Moore (1748) * The School for Lovers by William Whitehead (1762) * Le Pr√©jug√© √† la mode by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chauss√©e (1735) ‚Äì a good example of the French genre similar to sentimental comedy, com√©die larmoyante Significant environmental factors Sentimental comedy was a reaction to the bawdy restoration comedy of the 17th and 18th centuries. Many believed that the sexually explicit behavior encouraged by Charles II on the stage led to the demoralization of the English population outside the theater. Many felt that restoration comedies, which started out ridiculing vice, appeared to support vice instead therefore becoming one of the leading causes of moral corruption. One of the leading environmental factors that made way for this new genre was Jeremy Collier's Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, published in 1698. This essay signaled the public opposition to the supposed improprieties of plays staged during the previous three decades. Collier convincingly argued that the, \\"business of plays is to recommend Vertue, and discountenance Vice\\". Other sentimentalists took on the responsibility to moralize the stage in hopes of repairing the perceived damage of restoration comedies. These playwrights and theoreticians used the theater to instruct rather than delight after puritan opposition to theater grew from 1660 to 1698. At the opening night of Cibber's Love's Last Shift at Dury Lane Theater in January 1696 spectators experienced a new genre. They were genuinely surprised by the unexpected reconciliation and the joy of seeing this, \\"spread such an uncommon rapture of pleasure in the audience that never were spectators more happy in easing their minds by uncommon and repeated plaudits and honest tears.\\" This enthusiasm was aroused by the virtues of the characters, creating a sense of astonishment in the audience because they allowed them to feel admiration for people like themselves. This feeling became the hallmark of sentimentalism. Richard Steele stated that sentimental comedies, \\"makes us approve ourselves more\\" and Denis Diderot advocated that sentimentalism helps spectators remember that all nature is inherently good. Sentimentalists met resistance with playwrights of true comedy, who also had a moral aim but strove to reach it by exhibiting characters from which the audience should take warning instead of emulate. Sentimental comedy influenced and became absorbed into a new genre called domestic tragedy beginning around the mid-18th century. These tragedies intended to use real-life situations, settings, and prose to move an audience and foreshadowed the realism to come in the 19th century. Critical response =Beaumarchais' An Essay on Serious Drama= Pierre Beaumarchais was very much in support of sentimental comedy and describes his reasoning in his essay published in 1767. He explains first that the purpose of sentimental comedy is to offer a more immediate interest and more direct moral lesson than tragedy, and a deeper meaning than comedy. Since according to Beaumarchais noisy laughter is the enemy of thought, sentimental comedy gives its audience a chance to find silent sympathy and thought provoking isolation in tears. Being touched by the action on stage allows viewers to learn from the play and as good men are reminded of the rewards of virtues they are able to relate the play's events to real life. The form is praised for doing away with verse and rhyme as they can obscure the meaning ‚Äì making the truth disappear. Beaumarchais is instead in favor of language found in nature, and used in sentimental comedy. To combat the opposition, Beaumarchais lays out come criticism of laughing comedy. He argues that laughing at others distances the laughter from those being made fun of and that mockery is therefore not the best weapon to fight vice. A play that encourages this type of behavior also interests the audience more in the rascal than the honest man showing the viewers that morality is shallow, worthless, and inverted. Even Beaumarchais admits that some critics describe the genre as deadly dawdling prose with no comic relief, maxims, or characters with improbable plots that will inspire laziness in young writers who will not take the time to write verse. = Goldsmith's An Essay on the Theatre= In this essay, alternately titled A Comparison between Laughing and Sentimental Comedy and published in 1773, Oliver Goldsmith invokes the classical definition of comedy through Aristotle and Terence and insists that comedy is meant to expose the vices rather than the distresses of man. He argues that theatre is meant to amuse its spectators and while sentimental comedy might amuse the public, laughing comedy would amuse them more. He goes further to say that the characters of sentimental comedy are difficult to relate to and that audience members will, therefore, remain indifferent to the characters' plight. Goldsmith advocates that since sentimental comedies show distresses that they should be labeled as tragedies, though a simple name change will not enhance their efficacy. The essay is ended with a sarcastic comment about the ease with which any writer could create a sentimental comedy with just some, \\"insipid dialogue, without character or humour...make a pathetic scene or two, with a sprinkling of tender melancholy conversation...and there is no doubt that all the ladies will cry\\". Sentimental comedy had both supporters and naysayers, but by the 1770s the genre had all but died out, leaving in its place laughing comedies, such as Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer, which were generally concerned the intrigues of those living in upper-class society.

J. Turner\\", was an American composer, band leader and music professor. He was the first director of the Stonewall Brigade Band of Staunton, Virginia, the oldest continuous community band funded by tax moneys in the United States. They were mustered into the Stonewall Brigade under Stonewall Jackson of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Turner was a professor of music at both the Wesleyan Female Institute and the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute, and he played a part in the temperance movement. Ancestry and early years Augustus John Turner was born on October 12, 1818, in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, to Samuel M. Turner and Mahala Johnson Chapman. His father Samuel was a farmer living near the site of Fort Prince. Both Turner's grandfathers fought in the Revolutionary War. His father Samuel's father was James Turner, who settled in South Carolina near Coulter's Ford on the Pacolet River with his father George Henry Turner, after the death of his mother Hannah Middleton in Virginia. James Turner prepared beef for the patriots the night before the Battle of Cowpens. He married Margaret Headen. Horseshoe Robinson married Sarah Headen, making James Turner and Robinson brothers-in-law. Turner's mother's father was Jack Chapman, a Revolutionary war captain in Virginia. Jack Chapman married the sister of Jammie Seay. Both Samuel Turner and Jack Chapman were active at Mount Zion Baptist Church, whose pastor was John Gill Landrum. On his death, A. J. Turner wrote this acrostic: Lo! a Prince in Zion has been taken away. And mourners thread the streets day after day. No face is seen that does not deepest sorrow show; Departed are our joys and only bitter woe Remains, since thou, oh! Counselor and friend, Unto thy grave are gone can no longer lend Mankind thy sage advise - God pity on us send. Frederick County Before moving to Staunton, Turner lived in Middletown and Newtown (now Stephen's' City), near Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. He married Catherine (\\"Kate\\") Montrose Aby on July 1, 1845, in Frederick County. The ceremony was performed by John Allemong.Dodd, Jordan R., et al.. Early American Marriages: Virginia to 1850. Bountiful, UT, USA: Precision Indexing Publishers. Kate Aby's father was a shoemaker and veteran of the War of 1812. Her mother, who lived at Thorndale Farm, was the daughter of a drummer in the American Revolution.see Charles Hulett, Continental Army Drummer: A Revolutionary Life Reexamined by Anne Midgley In 1846, a son was born in Newtown, Charles W. Turner. Turner also spent time at Greenville, where he played with the famous banjoist Joel Sweeney in 1847, and organized a band in Middlebrook.Staunton Daily Leader, May 24, 1905, p. 1 In 1847 a second son was born in Middletown, T. M. Turner. Turner's house in Newtown was destroyed in a fire on December 2, 1856. Staunton =Stonewall Brigade Band= In Staunton, Virginia, in 1855, David W. Drake sought help in founding a band. He enlisted the help of Turner, his former music teacher in Newtown, persuading him to move to Staunton. Together with two other citizens of Staunton, they formed the Mountain Saxhorn Band. Turner was the band's first director, and it is still active today, the oldest continuous community band funded by tax moneys in the United States. They gave their first formal concert on July 17, 1857, at Union Hall on Beverley Street in Staunton. By 1859 the band had come to be known as Turner's Silver Cornet Band. At Armory Hall on April 4, 1861, Turner's Silver Cornet Band, together with the Staunton Musical Association and the Glee Club, presented the last concert to be given before the Civil War. Turner played the soprano cornet. Civil War Turner was Stonewall Jackson's (pictured) band leader.The band was mustered into the 5th Virginia Infantry Regiment under Stonewall Jackson and Colonel William S. Baylor, and left Staunton on April 17, 1861. Soon after the Battle of First Manassas, the band earned the name Stonewall Brigade Band, and has been known as such ever since. As well as playing their instruments, band members fought and acted as couriers and letter bearers or medical assistants. In addition to entertaining the troops in the field, the band frequently appeared in concerts in Fredericksburg, Richmond, Staunton, and elsewhere to support recruiting rallies, clothing drives, and war relief fundraising. An account of the Battle of Falling Waters in the Staunton Spectator reads: \\"Little Charley Turner, a boy about 15 years of age, insisted so strongly on going with the Augusta Guards that his father finally yielded to his importunities and allowed him to go.

It was coined to describe the rich social, artistic, and cultural collaborations of the period.Andrew Lamb (2000). 150 Years of Popular Musical Theatre. Yale University Press, p. 195. The same period is also referred to as the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age in the United States. In Germany, it is sometimes referred to as the Golden Twenties because of the economic boom that followed World War I.  Precursors  Paris Expo 1925 Polish pavilion, Exposition internationale des Arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes, Paris 1925 The Utopian positivism of the 19th century and its progressive creed led to unbridled individualism in France. Art nouveau extravagance began to evolve into Art Deco geometry after the First World War. Andr√© Gide, who founded the Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise literary review in 1908, influenced Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Tristan Tzara's 1918 Dada manifesto and the resulting Dada movement were very much a product of the interbellum: \\"Dadaists both embraced and critiqued modernity, imbuing their works with references to the technologies, newspapers, films, and advertisements that increasingly defined contemporary life\\". All these served as the precursors for the Ann√©es folles.  Caf√© society  The Closerie des Lilas in 1909. Caf√©s around Paris became places where artists, writers, and others gathered. On the Rive Gauche (left bank) the scene centered around caf√©s in Montparnasse while on the Rive Droite (right bank), the Montmartre area. = Left bank = The Ann√©es folles in Montparnasse featured a thriving art and literary scene centered on caf√©s such as , Le D√¥me Caf√©, Caf√© de la Rotonde, and as well as salons like Gertrude Stein's in the . The Rive Gauche, or left bank, of the Seine in Paris, was and is primarily concerned with the arts and the sciences. Many artists settled there and frequented cabarets like Le Boeuf sur le Toit and the large brasseries in Montparnasse. American writers of the Lost Generation, like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, met and mingled in Paris with exiles from dictatorships in Spain and Yugoslavia. The painters of the School of Paris for example included among others Chaim Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani and Marc Chagall, Lithuanian, Italian, and Russian, respectively. Later the American Henry Miller, like many other foreigners, gravitated to the and Boulevard Raspail. Montparnasse was, he said, \\"the navel of the world\\". Gertrude Stein also lived in Montparnasse during this period. =Right bank= Montmartre was a major center of Paris nightlife and had been famous for its caf√©s and dance halls since the 1890s. Trumpeter Arthur Briggs played at L'Abbaye and transvestites frequented La Petite Chaumi√®re. After World War I, the artists who had inhabited the guinguettes and cabarets of Montmartre, invented post-Impressionism during the Belle √âpoque. In 1926, the facade of the Folies Berg√®re building was redone in Art Deco style by the artist , adding it to the many Parisian theatres of the period in this architectural style.  Art  = Surrealism = The Elephant Celebes, Max Ernst 1921. The Tate, London. Surrealism came to the forefront in the 1920s cultural scene, bringing new forms of expression to poetry with authors like Andr√© Breton, whose Surrealist Manifesto appeared in 1924, Louis Aragon, Paul √âluard, and Robert Desnos. √âmigr√© artists had created Post- Impressionism, Cubism, and Fauvism in Paris before World War I, and included Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, and Piet Mondrian, along with French artists Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, and Albert Gleizes. Surrealists also included artists like Max Ernst, Joan Mir√≥, Salvador Dal√≠, and Francis Picabia, sculptors like Jean Arp, Germaine Richier and even early film-makers, like Luis Bu√±uel and Ren√© Clair. = Avant-garde = Jean Cocteau, while he denied belonging to the surrealists, was unquestionably avant-garde and collaborated with many of its members.  Entertainment  Josephine Baker dancing the Charleston at the Folies-Bergere in Paris ‚Äì Negro Dance Revue (1926). In the 1920s, Parisian nightlife was greatly influenced by American culture. One of its greatest influences was the ragtime called jazz, which became very popular in Paris. \\"Ragtimitis\\" came to Paris with a rendition of \\"The Memphis Blues\\" by a U.S. Army band led by New York Army National Guard Lieutenant James Reese Europe. The band, known as the Harlem Hellfighters of the 369th Infantry Regiment, \\"... started ragtimitis in France\\". According to band member Noble Sissle. It was very successful in 1925 at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es where the Revue N√®gre also was playing, led first by Florence Mills, known by her stage name as Flossie Mills, and later by Josephine Baker. In 1926, Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Berg√®re. In a new revue, La Folie du Jour, in which she danced the number \\"Fatou\\" wearing a costume revealing all but a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Wearing only her loincloth of bananas, Baker suggestively performed \\"danse sauvage\\" to a Charleston tempo ‚Äì a genre still new to Europe. Her French producer Jacques-Charles produced her dance numbers with French preconceptions of eroticized savages in mind. Baker performed the piece mostly nude with her partner, Joe Alex. This dance inspired a 1929 tempera painting titled Josephine Baker, first shown by the painter Ivanhoe Gambini in an exhibition of the Radiofuturista Lombardo group he founded. The scandal which erupted over Baker's dancing gave way to enthusiasm and quickly generated excitement among Parisians for jazz and black music. The Charleston can be danced solo, in pairs or in groups, to the rhythms of jazz. It is based on the movements of the body weight from one leg to the other, with the feet turned inward and knees slightly bent. Of all the fashionable cabarets, the most famous was called Le Boeuf sur le Toit where the pianist and French composer Jean Wiener played. Such entertainment reached only a tiny part of the French population, the elite. Nevertheless, it gave the impulse, created the event. =American influence= American culture of the Roaring Twenties had a substantial influence on France, which imported jazz, the Charleston, and the shimmy, as well as cabaret and nightclub dancing. Interest in American culture increased in the Paris of the 1920s, and shows and stars of Broadway theatre introduced as innovations for the √©lite and were imitated thereafter. This was the case for the famous Revue N√®gre in 1925 at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. Josephine Baker danced the Charleston almost naked, with provocative gestures set to music by Sidney Bechet. Important Paris designers like Paul Poiret fought to design clothes for her. Inspired and influenced by the French Colonial Empire, Josephine Baker put on La Folie du Jour in 1926, and from the caf√©s chantants, also successfully picked up popular songs such as by Vincent Scotto. In 1927 she starred in the silent film Siren of the Tropics, which opened to rave reviews. The 1930 song enshrined Baker as a full-featured star of Parisian nightlife, who not only danced, but also commented on the music and did comedy. While she appeared at the Folies Berg√®re, Baker opened her own nightclub, called \\"Chez Jos√©phine\\", in the rue Fontaine. =Dance= Amadeo Modigliani - Paul Guillaume Paul Guillaume in 1919 organized a \\"Negro festival\\" at the Th√©atre des Champs-√âlys√©es. Six years later, he also produced the Paris '. On rue Blomet, the Bal N√®gre cabaret attracted both aesthetes and the curious.  Ballets su√©dois  The 1920s also marked a renewal in ballet. The Ballets Russes were based in Paris during this time. In 1921 the Ballets su√©dois offered L'Homme et son d√©sir by Paul Claudel, with music by Darius Milhaud. The company then presented Les mari√©s de la tour Eiffel, written by Jean Cocteau. Alas, it did not meet with public success. In 1923 another ballet was born, La cr√©ation du monde; Darius Milhaud wrote the music, and Blaise Cendrars the scenario. Fernand L√©ger designed the costumes and put onto the stage gigantic animals, birds, insects and totemic gods. The adventure of the Ballets su√©dois ended in 1924 with a ballet called Rel√¢che written by Erik Satie and sets by Francis Picabia. Salon gatherings were Another important form of entertainment. Princess de Polignac's gatherings continued to be important to avant-garde music. The circles of Madame de Noailles included Proust, Francis Jammes, Colette, Gide, Fr√©d√©ric Mistral, Robert de Montesquiou, Paul Val√©ry, Cocteau, Pierre Loti, Paul Hervieu, and Max Jacob. =Music= thumb During this period the music hall permanently replaced the caf√©-chantant. People often went to the Casino de Paris, the Paris concert, the concert Mayol and the theater; spectacles, attractions, and songs occurred at a rapid pace. Artistic productions had a meteoric rise. Some of the best-known examples were American-influenced shows at the Casino de Paris -- Paris qui dance (1919), Cach' ton piano (1920), and Paris qui jazz (1920‚Äì21), Mon homme and Dans un fauteuil gave rise to stardom for Maurice Chevalier and Mistinguett. American influences such as musicals underlay the success of the Folies Berg√®re, the famous \\"Mad Berge\\", inaugurated with Les Folies raging in 1922. A number of classical music composers, such as those of the School of Paris and Les Six, also flourished at this time. \\"The musical influence of Paris, dominated first by Debussy and then by Stravinsky, seems to have been almost inescapable for composers in the first four decades of the century.\\" = Operetta = Operetta had a turning point on with the premiere of Phi-Phi by Henri Christin√© and Albert Willemetz. Up to a thousand performances were played in just two years. The popular D√©d√© was staged in 1921 by Maurice Chevalier. Operetta attracted talented composers such as Marseille's Vincent Scotto, and also Maurice Yvain (a composer of Mistinguett's signature song Mon Homme), and author Sacha Guitry, who wrote the libretto for L'amour masqu√©. In the Olympia at the Bobino, the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©-Montparnasse showcased Marie Dubas and Georgius, who inaugurated the Singing Theatre by staging popular songs. From 1926, American titles such as No, No, Nanette, Rose-Marie and Show Boat began to be adapted for French viewers. = Sports = Cyclist Henri Desgrange in 1922 Sports spectacles were also popular during the Ann√©es folles. Attendance at sporting venues increased significantly in the years following the war and the press gave sporting events an audience and growing popularity. The newspapers played a significant role in promoting sports through dedicated sports pages, giving popularity to the Tour de France, football and rugby. Moreover, sports, which previously had been limited only to those of affluent backgrounds, now began to extend to the masses. The major sporting event during this decade was Olympic Games in Paris in 1924, in which 3,092 athletes from 44 countries participated, and no fewer than spectators attended. = Film = Silent film, called \\"cin√©ma\\", rose to popularity in the 1920s. Scientists of the time were predicting little future for it. Silent film is considered by some as the carefree innocence of years or 7th Art. Max Linder, after being discovered by Charles Path√©, became integral in making the film a cultural phenomenon. European film production almost completely stopped during World War I, as most actors were drafted into the war. The public took refuge in theaters trying to forget the horrors of the front with films such as Charlie Chaplin's A Dog's Life. Hollywood films saw massive growth in demand thanks to a sharp decline in European production; it exported an increasing number of films. In 1919, films from the United States accounted for about 90% of films screened in Europe. Some films showed the influence of surrealism, with director Luis Bu√±uel collaborating with Salvador Dal√≠ on his first short film, Un Chien Andalou. Ren√© Clair's silent films blended comedy and fantasy. = Theatre = In the Paris of the 1920s, the theater was essentially dominated by four directors -- Louis Jouvet, Georges Pito√´ff, Charles Dullin and Gaston Baty. They decided in 1927 to join efforts to create the \\"Cartel of Four.\\" However, they had much less success than Sacha Guitry in Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. There are also parts of Alfred Savoir, comedies of √âdouard Bourdet and those of Marcel Pagnol that met with some success. Specifically, the theatrical performance was a great success with audiences and had an undeniable renewal in 1920, first at the stage performance. Around the \\"Cartel\\" develops a creative effort to bring in staging the concerns and aspirations of the time. The change is also reflected in the choice of themes and atmosphere that emerges from the works presented. But parallel to this, the educated public is interested elites increasingly to authors and works that combine classical in the form and the opposition reality/dream at the theatrical atmosphere. Also, the theater Jean Cocteau, the first pieces of Jean Giraudoux such as Siegfried in 1928 and the works of Italian Luigi Pirandello are famous examples that were very successful. In 1920 post-impressionist painter Nils Dardel and de Mar√© together created Ballets su√©dois at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. In the autumn of 1924, Giorgio de Chirico curated the scenography and costumes for Pirandello's La Giara.  The birth of a popular culture  Along with the elite culture that characterized the 1920s, there arose at the same time in Paris, a popular culture. The First World War upset many things, even in song. After four years without Belle √âpoque, new artists emerged in fashionable places. The music hall, for example, while attracting artists and intellectuals in search of novelty, also gives the popular media. There certainly has the exotic big fees journals Moulin Rouge. In the same period were the beginnings of Maurice Chevalier, the ultimate illustration of good French mood through one of his songs, \\"Valentine\\". The lead dancer Mistinguett, nicknamed La Miss, had successful popular tunes such as Always on the grind, I'm fed up. All shows, however, does not reduce as the review.  Fashion and style  Women's fashion of the year 1927 = The emancipated look = The gar√ßonne (flapper) look in women's fashion emerged in Paris, promoted especially by Coco Chanel. The boyish look was characterized by a loose, streamlined, androgynous silhouette where neither the bust nor the waist are evident, accompanied by a short hairdo. It became the symbol of the emancipated woman: free and autonomous, and expressing a new social freedom for a woman‚Äîshe goes out on the town, smokes, dances, engages in sports or outdoor activities, drives a car, goes on trips‚Äîand, flying in the face of moral conventions of the day, she flaunts an extra-marital liaison, perhaps even her homo- or bisexuality, or cohabits openly with a partner. Also by Chanel, the celebrated little black dress came out in 1926. A straight sheath with 3/4 sleeves and no collar, the cr√™pe de Chine tube all in black (a color previously reserved for bereavement) was the perfect evocation of gar√ßonne style, erasing the forms of the female body. Copied many times over, this \\"Ford signed 'Chanel'\\" as Vogue magazine dubbed it, referring to the mass-produced American car, would become a classic item of womenswear of the 1920s and beyond. Economic growth The Ann√©es folles were also a period of strong economic growth. New products and services in booming markets boost the economy: radio, automobile, aviation, oil, electricity. French production of hydropower increases eightfold during the decade.\\"The war economy and its consequences (1914‚Äì1929)\\" by Belisaire Cheaper electricity favored industrial companies, which in 1928 had three of the top five highest market capitalizations on the Paris stock exchange and five out of the top ten, in a decade where total stock market valuation soared by a factor of 4.4. The 6th is a young innovative company, which is only fifteen Air Liquide, already has a global stature. The manufacturing production index reached in 1928 the level of 139 for a 100 in 1914,Basic \\"History of twentieth century: 1st and agricultural terminal\\" by Florence Cattiau Maryse Chabrillat, Annie Constantine, Christian Peltier, Gwen Lepage, in Educagri Press, 2001 with very strong sectoral disparities: it is only 44 for the index shipbuilding 100 to steel and 422 to the automobile. The French overall index fell to 57 in 1919 and 50 in 1921, but already risen to 104 in 1924. It took 6 years to clear the shortage of energy caused by the reconstruction of the northern mines, that the Germans had drowned during the World War I. Radio Radio played a leading role, becoming a preferred vehicle for the new mass culture. It provided greater information on news and culture to an increasing number of people, especially the working classes. Radio quickly propelled Mistinguett and Maurice Chevalier to the rank of national and international stardom, and they quickly become icons of Parisian lifestyle. End of an era The Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to the exuberant zeitgeist in the United States, although the crisis didn't actually reach Europe until 1931. In 1928, the Parisian theater La Cigale, then the Olympia and the Moulin Rouge suffered the same fate in 1929, being torn down at the end of the decade. Although production was intended for a wide audience, most people attended music halls and other dance halls. Their world of song was primarily that of the street, the javas and tangos of dances, weddings, and banquets and not of the Parisian high society. Parallel to this culture of elites, at the same time in Paris, existed a popular culture that was increasingly successful and came to dominate the late 1920s and early 1930s through artists such as Maurice Chevalier or Mistinguett.

She is principally known for her jewelry. She has been called \\"an icon within the tradition of modernist jewelry\\" and \\"a seminal figure in American Modernist studio jewelry\\". Her pieces have been shown nationally and internationally and are included in a number of museum collections, including the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. She is regarded as an important role model for other artists and craftspeople. Biography Cooke was born in Baltimore, Maryland on May 5, 1924. She was an enthusiastic member of the Girl Scouts, attending Camp Whippoorwill. =Education= After taking art classes in high school, she went to the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), where she studied from 1942 to 1946. She received a BFA in education, the only way to get an art degree there at that time. During her last year at the Institute, she began to learn jewelry making as part of an apprenticeship, which started her on a career in jewelry design. =Teaching career= After graduating from MICA in 1946, Cooke taught there for 22 years. In addition to teaching jewelry design, she developed a class in \\"Design and Materials\\" for furniture design with wood, metal, fabric, and leather. One of the students who took that class was artist Bill Steinmetz. They later began dating, and eventually married. = Design Career = Gold necklace designed by Betty Cooke, circa 1960 Bill Steinmetz, in 2004 Early in her career, Cooke designed furniture and household articles as well handbags, belts and jewelry. Her first store-front was a small house on Tyson Street in Mount Vernon in Baltimore, where she lived. In 1946, Cooke bought the old rowhouse for $3,000 and began to restore it. She and her partner Bill Steinmetz restored it for use as a house and shop and established a design consultancy there. In 1955, Cooke and Bill Steinmetz were married. The couple worked together as designers \\"Cooke and Steinmetz\\". Their projects included a restaurant, a bowling alley, and a church. Cooke explains her style as applying to large and small media: \\"I think in terms of jewelry, but jewelry is also sculpture that can be done on a large scale.\\" They later established The Store Ltd at the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore in 1965. Jewelry design Although she is widely read in the areas of art and design, Betty Cooke is largely self-trained. Her jewelry style is influenced by Bauhaus and modernism. It is very simple and pure, both geometric and minimalist. Given her early aspiration to become a sculptor, it may not be surprising that she thinks of her jewelry as \\"sculpture in motion\\". Wearing her jewelry has been compared to having a miniature Calder mobile around your neck. Her pieces have been sold through museums such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and contemporary designers such as Keegs in Seattle, Washington. Cooke has designed jewelry for Kirk Stieff and for Geoffrey Beene's shows in New York and Milan. Cooke's work is discussed in Modernist jewelry 1930‚Äì1960 : the wearable art movement, Form & function : American modernist jewelry, 1940-1970, and exhibition catalogs including Messengers of Modernism: American Studio Jewelry 1940-1960. Much of Cooke's work incorporates diamonds, gold, and pearls, and she has won awards for her diamond pieces in competitions sponsored by the De Beers Consolidated Mines, now the De Beers Group. In her annual enumeration series, she has created an ongoing series of numeric-inspired pieces for patrons who wished to commemorate specific events in their lives by commissioning a piece.

Biography  He was born to a farming family. As a child, he suffered from frequent serious illnesses and developed a curved spine (kyphosis).Brief biography @ Finnica His long periods of convalescence kept him from agricultural labor and gave him time to display his artistic abilities. In 1890, he was sent to study at the Lyceum in Jyv√§skyl√§. While there, he also learned to play the violin and was, for a time, torn between pursuing a career in art or music. Brief Biography @ the Avoin Museo. Self- portrait (date unknown) In 1898, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki, where he studied with Eero J√§rnefelt. He began participating in shows held by the \\"Helsinki Society of Artists\\" and was one of a large group of artists chosen to represent Finland at the Exposition Universelle (1900). It was then that he first became interested in impressionism and pointillism. From 1902 to 1904, he was a student at the University of Helsinki, graduating with a degree in drawing. He briefly returned to his hometown, making sketches and paintings around the family farm, but eventually settled in Jyv√§skyl√§, where he set up a studio and gave drawing lessons to the young Alvar Aalto, who was studying at Heiska's old alma mater, the Lyceum.The life of Alvar Aalto @ Lapin: Kulttuuri Kuvina In 1918, he designed the first flag for the Republic of Karelia, but it was replaced in 1920 with one designed by Akseli Gallen-Kallela.The Flags of Karelia @ Heninen His home was also a gathering place for local musicians. In 1920, he married Maikki Aron (1889‚Äì1961), a music teacher. He made an extensive series of illustrations for the classic Finnish novel Seven Brothers by Aleksis Kivi in 1930. They were meant to be published as a book of deluxe prints, but the cost turned out to be too high. His last exhibit was in 1936 at the Strindberg Gallery in Helsinki. His daughter, Vappu, also became an artist. Before her death in 1993, she gave the family home to the city of Jyv√§skyl√§ for use as a museum.

Hamilton's son, John C. Hamilton, commissioned Conrads to sculpt this statue, which was dedicated on November 22, 1880, and donated to the city. Conrads used the bust of Hamilton created by the sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi as a model for Hamilton's head. American founding father Alexander Hamilton lived nearby in Manhattan, at Hamilton Grange, when he died in 1804. Description Hamilton is dressed in Colonial style with a wig, ruffled collar, knickers, and buckle shoes. His right hand is on his chest, while his left hand is holding a rolled document, resting on a stone column. Thirteen stars encircle the top of the pedestal. A sword, scabbard and military hat are near the base of the pedestal. Conrads, working for New England Granite Works owned by James G. Batterson, used a block of Westerly granite since it was both beautiful and durable, able to withstand the highest pressures. Dedication Statue view showing left hand, document, and column The dedication, held on November 22, 1880, a cold and windy day, was attended by nearly 500 people. Hamilton's son, John C. Hamilton, made a brief speech to the crowd and guests, including members of the Society of the Cincinnati. Hamilton described the statue: The Mayor, Edward Cooper, then made a brief address praising Alexander and thanking John C. for his donation. Since the weather was so bad, the outdoor ceremony was moved inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art where later speakers included Alexander Hamilton Bullock and Chauncey M. Depew. Depew's speech covered Hamilton as a soldier, financier and statesman. Inscription On the base of the pedestal: {  } On the left side: {  } Legacy While Ceracchi, born on July 4, 1751, created busts for several founding fathers, his life did not end well. After returning to Europe, he first celebrated Napoleon with a bust, but then turned against him. After an unsuccessful plot, Napoleon had him guillotined at the Place de Gr√®ve on January 30, 1801.

Facts Mr Boyo was an accountant for Lambeth London Borough Council until suspended and dismissed as the police charged him with fraud. His contract said he would only be dismissed after an investigation and consideration of allegations of gross misconduct, but the council did nothing because it did not want to interfere with the police investigation or prosecution. It initially claimed frustration but then admitted wrongful dismissal. First instance awarded six months' wages, for one month notice and a five month disciplinary. Mr Boyo claimed damages for salary loss up to trial date, when he accepted the repudiatory breach of contract. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that while the employer did not unilaterally terminate the contract, the employer was liable to pay compensation up to the time when it could lawfully unilaterally terminate. This meant the time for giving proper notice plus disciplinary time. Ralph Gibson LJ said he was bound to follow Gunton in that an employer's repudiatory breach would only terminate the contract when accepted by the employee, but preferred a partial survival theory. Staughton LJ said that an employment contract is ‚Äòin a class of its own‚Äô because neither an employee nor an employer should be compelled to work together. Sir Francis Purchas concurred.

It was built by the British between 1897 and 1899, and most of it was demolished in the 1980s. History By the mid-1890s, the RML armament of the nearby Fort Pembroke had become obsolete, and the fort was turned into an ammunition depot. The British decided that it would be cheaper to construct a new battery rather than upgrade the fort's guns. Pembroke Battery was built between 1897 and 1899, and it formed part of a new series of fortifications meant to house breech-loading (BL) guns. The battery was oval in shape, and its magazines and other features were located underground. It was surrounded by a ditch and a glacis, which was defended by barbed wire. It was armed with two 9.2 inch Mk X guns, which were mounted en barbette. These were dismantled in 1919 and the battery was struck off the armaments list. The battery remained unused until the 1980s. Present day The western gun emplacement and part of the battery's underground complex were demolished in the 1980s during a housing expansion project. All that remains of Pembroke Battery today is a single reinforced concrete semi-circular gun emplacement, and remains of some of the other structures at the rear. The Pembroke Local Council and the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) are currently restoring the remains of the battery to transform it into a museum.

Facts Mr Edwards was dismissed from his surgeon job for ‚Äògross misconduct‚Äô without having his contractual disciplinary procedure followed for alleged impropriety toward a female patient. The contract also said ‚Äúthe employment is subject to three months‚Äô notice on either side‚Äù. The General Medical Council summarily dismissed his appeal. He claimed ¬£3.8m in lost earnings and damage to reputation, arguing that if the procedure were proper, by having a lawyer and someone from his department on the panel, the allegations would not have been established against him, and his career would not have been wrecked. The GMC, however, did not prevent him continuing to work. The judge held that damages could not exceed the earnable income in the notice period, plus the period that a disciplinary procedure would last, and further damages were excluded by Johnson for the manner of the dismissal. The Court of Appeal held Mr Edwards could recover full damages for breach of express contractual disciplinary proceedings, and Johnson v Unisys Ltd only precludes a term being implied at common law for the manner of dismissal. Moore-Bick LJ ‚Äòin cases where the claimant relies on the common law implied term it will sometimes be necessary to determine whether the act relied on formed part of the process of dismissal or preceded it. The need for that inquiry does not arise, however, in a case where the employee relies on an express term of the contract and accordingly in such cases the Johnson exclusion area is not a relevant concept.‚Äô Ward LJ and Lloyd LJ concurred. The case was joined to Botham v Ministry of Defence. Mr Botham was a youth community worker in Germany till he was dismissed by the MoD for gross misconduct for inappropriate behaviour with two teenage girls in September 2003. He was placed on a list of people unsuitable to work with children under the Protection of Children Act 1999, and not removed until July 2007. He claimed unfair dismissal. The Tribunal found he was unfairly dismissed, and was awarded the maximum, his name removed from the register. He then claimed damages for breach of contract in the High Court. Slade J in the High Court held that he could not recover damages, because it related to the manner of dismissal.[2010] EWHC 646 Pill LJ approved an appeal, because of the Edwards case, and gave permission to go to the Supreme Court. Judgment The Supreme Court held (Lady Hale, Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson dissenting) that neither Mr Edwards, nor Mr Botham, could claim more loss than would be available in an unfair dismissal claim. Breach of a disciplinary rule counted to the fairness of a dismissal in ERA 1996, and that was so during the EA 2002 and EA 2008 amendments. Parliament‚Äôs enactment of unfair dismissal legislation, which was less generous than the common law, precluded any claim for damages relating to the manner of dismissal, whether formulated as either an express or an implied term. An employee could seek an injunction to halt the threatened breach of contract, however, as it still plainly remained a breach of contract. Lord Dyson and Lord Walker said the following. Lord Phillips gave a short speech. Lady Hale said the following. Lord Mance agreed with Lord Dyson. Lord Kerr (and Lord Wilson concurring) would have held that Mr Edwards should succeed in his claim, but because Mr Botham‚Äôs reputational damage was inextricably linked to the manner of his dismissal, he could not have a successful claim.

She is a professor in the Department of Biology at Stanford University, where she is the Susan B. Ford Professor of Humanities and Sciences, a Bass University Fellow, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor. Education McConnell graduated with a joint A.B. degree from Harvard College and Radcliffe College in 1980. She did her doctoral work in the research group of Simon LeVay and received her PhD in neurobiology from Harvard University in 1987. She was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Carla J. Shatz at Stanford University. Research McConnell's research focuses on understanding how neurons in the developing cerebral cortex are produced, differentiated, and connected to form functional circuits. McConnell's research showed that progression through the cell cycle plays a key role in determining the final differentiated state of a neural progenitor cell. McConnell also confirmed the hypothesis that asymmetric cell division, as determined by the orientation of the dividing progenitor's cleavage plane, regulates cortical development. Her work elucidated the first molecular mechanism for this process, showing that asymmetrically inherited Notch proteins determine whether a new daughter cell will differentiate into a neuron or remain a neural progenitor. Her work also showed that developing cortical neurons use a variety of different migratory paths as they move from their birthplace to their final destination in the cortex. This work stood in contrast to a prevailing theory at the time, that all neuronal migration in the cortex was dependent upon radial glia. McConnell's recent work has continued to outline the molecular mechanisms underlying neural differentiation, neuronal migration and axon guidance. Teaching Stanford University has recognized McConnell with its two highest teaching honors, the Hoagland Prize for Undergraduate Teaching and the Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching. She has taught undergraduate courses on neural development since joining Stanford's faculty in 1989. From 2010 to 2012, McConnell co-chaired a university-wide commission that evaluated undergraduate education at Stanford. The commission's recommendations encouraged students and teachers \\"to reconsider what they do, how they do it, and why it matters\\", and urged reforms to the university's general education programs. In addition, Dr. McConnell and author Andrew Todhunter were the principal force behind the creation of Stanford's Senior Reflection in Biology, a capstone course for senior undergraduates where life-science students undertake creative projects synthesizing the arts and sciences. Conservation photography In addition to her career in research and teaching, McConnell is an accomplished wildlife photographer. After photographing animals during a trip to the Svalbard archipelago in Norway, she developed an interest in using photography to tell stories about animal behavior. She teaches undergraduate classes on conservation photography at Stanford. Her photos have been featured in various publications including Smithsonian and National Geographic. McConnell was the first non-art Stanford faculty member to have a show in the Stanford Art Gallery. Her show was called On the Shoulders of Giants and focused on elephants, their poaching, and the crisis of the ivory trade. Personal life McConnell is married to Richard Scheller, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Therapeutics at 23andMe. Awards and honors McConnell is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.

Facade of Palazzo Bichi Ruspoli. History The sober stone palace is just south of the Palazzo Salimbeni and north of the Palazzo Tolomei on the Via Banchi di Sopra. The three story palace with a curved facade was enlarged by Alessandro Bichi in 1520.Artistic Guide to Siena and Its Environs, (1908), page 68. The palace originally was owned by the Rossi family and housed Charles of Anjou during a stay in Siena. It was built with rusticated limestone blocks in the 14th century around an earlier, 13th century, castle- like block with a tower and peaked ground floor arches. The present rectangular upper windows date to later reconstructions.Renaissance Siena: Art in Context, edited by A. Lawrence Jenkens, page 53-45. The present Neoclassic style interiors were commissioned in the 18th century by the Marquis Bichi Ruspoli from the artist and architect Jacopo Franchini. The entrance was designed by Pietro Marchetti. Despite successive reconstructions, the baroque interior decoration of the chapel remain. The interiors maintain much of the original Neoclassical fresco decoration by Alessandro Franchi, Cesare Maffei, and Giovanni Bandini.Beni Culturali Siena.

It stands at the entrance to Victoria Tower Gardens, south of Victoria Tower at the southwest corner of the Palace of Westminster. Its main feature is a bronze statue of Emmeline Pankhurst by Arthur George Walker, unveiled in 1930. In 1958 the statue was relocated to its current site and the bronze reliefs commemorating Christabel Pankhurst were added. Campaign for and unveiling of the memorial Shortly after Emmeline Pankhurst's death in 1928 a Pankhurst Memorial Fund was established, with her fellow suffragettes Rosamund Massey and Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Marshall (Pankhurst's former bodyguard in the Women's Social and Political Union) as joint secretaries. The fund's objectives were to arrange a headstone for her grave, to acquire Georgina Brakenbury's portrait of Pankhurst and to erect a public statue. Some spectators, such as Nancy Astor, believed the idea of a statue impractical, noting that Pankhurst herself did not believe she was \\"statuesque\\" and the fact that the British public were facing austere times, which would impose financial constraints on the project. In reality raising the money, which was largely organised by The Suffragette's editor Rachel Barrett, was not the issue; finding a location for the statue was the real problem. Although the Chief Commissioner of Public Works, Sir Lionel Earle, was sympathetic to their cause, he believed that it would be impractical to place the statue in Westminster. After several locations were rejected Marshall secured permission to erect the statue in a corner of Victoria Tower Gardens near the Houses of Parliament. Though this required a special Parliamentary bill, the Conservative MP William Bull ensured its smooth passage. A bronze statue of Emmeline Pankhurst, with arms outstretched as if addressing a rally, was sculpted by Arthur George Walker; Sir Herbert Baker was the architect of the plinth. As well as covering the cost of the plinth and statue the fund paid the Ministry of Works ¬£160 to have the statue cleaned in perpetuity and a further ¬£330 to always have a plant placed in a vase next to the statue. The statue's unveiling on 6 March 1930 The statue was unveiled by the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on 6 March 1930. Marshall had arranged for two facing platforms to be erected near the statue, one for the three speakers, Baldwin, Lady Rhondda and Fred Pethick-Lawrence, and the other for a band. Loudspeakers were provided and the stages draped in the colours of the WSPU. In Baldwin's speech he said: \\"I say with no fear of contradiction, that whatever view posterity may take, Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which will last for all time.\\"Monument to a woman who changed history: Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Victoria Tower Gardens The composer Ethel Smyth, a close friend of Pankhurst's, conducted the Metropolitan Police Band during the unveiling, playing an arrangement of her song \\"The March of the Women\\" and music from her opera The Wreckers. \\"The March of the Women\\" was the anthem of the women's suffrage movement.The Times shot some pictures of this event, one of it is in possession of Susanne Wosnitzka.

Our picture shows Dame Ethel Smythe [sic] conducting the Metropolitan Police Band when they played \\"The March of the Women\\" and the chorale from her composition \\"The Wreckers\\" at the unveiling of Mrs Pankhurst Statue\\". Relocation in 1958 In 1958 the statue was moved from its original position in the south of the gardens to a new site further north, and a low stone screen was built flanking the statue, terminating at either end with bronze medallions sculpted by Peter Hills. These depict, on the left, the \\"prison brooch\\" or \\"badge\\" of the WSPU,Holloway brooch , Parliament of the United Kingdom and, on the right, a profile bust of Christabel Pankhurst, who died in 1958. The unveiling of this dual memorial was performed on 13 July 1959 by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir. Sylvia Pankhurst died in 1960; she is not commemorated. The statue was granted a Grade II listing in 1970. Proposed relocation in 2018 In August 2018, a group called \\"The Emmeline Pankhurst Trust Limited\\" led by former Conservative MP Neil Thorne applied for planning permission to remove the statue from its site next to Parliament to the private grounds of Regent's University London. 889 objections were received, including from MPs Caroline Flint and Vicky Ford, and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, and the application was withdrawn on 14 September.

Philipse was the only son of Maria Sparkes, daughter of the Governor of Barbados, and Philip Philipse, eldest son of Frederick Philipse I, 1st Lord of the Philipsburg Manor. Philip predeceased his father, and family lands passed on to younger son Adolphus Philipse. Upon his uncle's death Frederick II inherited his share of Philipse lands and commercial interests, thereafter becoming the elder Philipse male and 2nd Lord of Philipsburg Manor. He also inherited the Highland Patent (later called the \\"Philipse Patent\\"), a parcel of land on the east bank of the Hudson River spanning the northern Westchester County line clear to the Connecticut border. Frederick II represented Westchester in the New York Assembly from 1724 to 1751. Upon his death in 1751 his eldest son, Frederick III, became the 3rd and final Lord of Philipsburg Manor. Early life Map of Philipsburg Manor with current borders overlaid on the property Philipse' was born at Spring Head, the estate of his father in Barbados, . He was the only son of his parents, Philip Philipse (1663‚Äì1699), and Maria (n√©e Sparkes) Philipse, who both died in Barbados shortly after his birth in 1698 (on September 14 and October 18, respectively). Following their deaths, young Frederick went to New York to live with his grandfather, who immediately sold the Barbados estate to ensure that young Frederick would not be induced later to settle there, which reportedly greatly upset his mother's relatives. His mother was the youngest of the four daughters of Joyce (n√©e Farmer) Sparkes and Sparkes, Esq., who was reportedly a governor of Barbados. Two of his maternal aunts had returned to their father's estate in Worcestershire, England, and the others accompanied their parents to the Barbados. When his paternal grandfather died on November 6, 1702, Frederick was thereafter raised by his grandfather's second wife, Catharine (n√©e Van Cortlandt) Philipse, the daughter of New York mayor Stephanus Van Cortlandt, who took him to England to be educated. His grandmother and the elder Frederick's first wife was Margaret Hardenbroeck Philipse, who predeceased his grandfather. While in England, young Philipse studied law, and upon reaching his majority, inherited a large part of the Philipse estate and became the 2nd Lord of Philipsburg. Upon the death of his bachelor uncle Adolphus Philipse, Frederick II inherited Adolphus' share of Philipse lands and commercial interests received from Frederick I, as well as the upper Highland Patent (later known as the Philipse Patent) that Adolphus had been granted by the Crown for lands purchased north of Westchester County between the Hudson River and the Connecticut Colony. Career Philipse II served as a Justice of the Peace, an Alderman and was repeatedly elected as Representative for the County of Westchester in the New York Assembly for the last twenty-seven years of his life until 1751. In the assembly, he served alongside Robert Livingston, the 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, who represented Livingston Manor from 1737 to 1790. He was appointed Third Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature in 1731. He took office as Second Justice in 1733, a position that he held until his death in 1751. On April 6, 1733, Philipse II, as a committee member, helped to lay out the original Bowling Green in lower Manhattan. Later that year, he became one of the lessee's in charge of Bowling Green at the cost of one peppercorn per year. Justice Philipse was a member of the majority that found in favor of Governor William Cosby in Cosby v. Van Dam, the 1733 case that precipitated the political crises that led to the Zenger trial. As Second Justice, Philipse participated in the New York Slave Conspiracy trials of 1741 which, based upon questionable testimony, resulted in death sentences for thirty-four defendants and the deportation of ninety-one others away from the colony. Personal life Philipse Manor Hall, the Lower Mills manor house In 1726, Philipse was married to Johanna Brockholst (1700‚Äì1765), youngest daughter of Anthony Brockholst, Esq., the 4th Governor of New York after it became part of Great Britain, and Susanna Maria, the daughter of Paulus Aemilius Schrect, of the Pompton Estate, in New Jersey, who had emigrated from West Friesland in Holland.

The name \\"Cistus incanus\\" (synonym C. villosus) has been used by other authors in a different sense, for Cistus creticus (at least in part). The English name hoary rock-rose may refer to this species, among others. Description Because of confusion between the original species named by Linnaeus in 1753 and the way in which the name was used by later authors (see ¬ß Taxonomy), plants described under this name may actually belong to different species. C. √ó incanus is a shrubby plant, to about tall, with grey-green leaves and pink to purple flowers. Taxonomy The name Cistus incanus was first used by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. Confusion exists among this name and two later names published by Linnaeus, Cistus creticus in 1762 and Cistus villosus in 1764. There is general agreement that C. villosus, at least as used by later authors, is not a distinct species. Two treatments are then found. In the first, generally older, treatment, C. incanus is accepted, with C. villosus being a synonym. C. creticus is treated as C. incanus subsp. creticus. According to Demoly (1996), Linnaeus's Cistus incanus was recognized to be a hybrid as early as 1904. The second treatment (followed here) is based on this recognition. C. creticus is accepted, with C. villosus as a synonym. C. √ó incanus L. is treated as the hybrid C. albidus √ó C. crispus. As used by previous authors, but not Linnaeus, the name \\"C. incanus\\" is taken to refer to Cistus creticus, particularly C. creticus subsp. eriocephalus. Two formerly recognised subspecies of C. incanus are regarded as subspecies of Cistus creticus: *Cistus √ó incanus subsp. corsicus = C. creticus subsp. corsicus *Cistus √ó incanus subsp. creticus = C. creticus subsp. creticus References incanus Category:Hybrid plants ","title":"Cistus √ó incanus"},{"id":"45537536","text":"Strange Sisters () is a 1995 Iranian written and directed by Kiumars Pourahmad and it's written and is written based on \\"Lottie and Lisa\\" a book by Erich K√§stner.

He was the founder of the Angelos dynasty, which went on to rule the Byzantine Empire in 1185‚Äì1204 and found and rule the Despotate of Epirus (1205‚Äì1318) and the Empire of Thessalonica (1224‚Äì1242/46). Life Constantine was born in to an obscure family of the local aristocracy of Philadelphia. The family's surname, \\"Angelos\\", is commonly held to have derived from the Greek word for \\"angel\\", but such an origin is rarely attested in Byzantine times, and it is possible that their name instead derives from A[n]gel, a district near Amida in Upper Mesopotamia. The historian Suzanne Wittek-de Jongh suggested that Constantine was the son of a certain patrikios Manuel Angelos, whose possessions near Serres were confirmed by a chrysobull of Emperor Nikephoros III (), but this is considered unlikely by other scholars. Manuscript miniature of Manuel I, Vatican Library, Rome Despite his lowly origin, Constantine was reportedly brave and exceedingly beautiful, and managed to win the heart of Theodora Komnene (born 1097), the fourth daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos () and Irene Doukaina. Theodora had already been married once, to Constantine Kourtikes, but her husband had died without having had children. The marriage probably took place in , certainly after the death of Alexios I; Empress Irene apparently disapproved of it, and it seems to have soured her relations with Theodora, who is listed last and with the least favourable provisions in the typikon that Irene granted to the Kecharitomene Monastery. Constantine's marriage lifted him out of obscurity, and gave him the title of sebastohypertatos, one of the highest Byzantine dignities, given to the husbands of an emperor's younger daughters. The rank may have been created specifically for Constantine, as he is one of the first two recorded holders. His activities during the reign of Theodora's brother John II Komnenos () are unknown, but he, like his brothers, Nicholas, John, and Michael, enjoyed the favour of John's son and successor, Manuel I Komnenos (). Thus on 26 February 1147 he participated in the church council of Blachernae that deposed Patriarch Cosmas II Attikos, being ranked in fourth place behind the heir-apparent, despotes Bela-Alexios, the Caesar John Rogerios Dalassenos, and the panhypersebastos Stephen Kontostephanos. In summer 1149, he accompanied Emperor Manuel in his campaign in Dalmatia. After Manuel captured the fortress of Razon, Constantine was left to guard the area, and launched an expedition into the Nishava valley. In 1154, as Manuel prepared for war with William I of Sicily, he gave his uncle command of the Byzantine fleet and ordered him to proceed to Monemvasia, where to await further reinforcements. Constantine, however, was persuaded by his astrologers that if he attacked the Sicilians he would win. Disobeying the Emperor's orders, he proceeded to intercept a far larger Sicilian fleet returning from a raid against Fatimid Egypt. In the ensuing engagement, the Byzantines were defeated and most of their ships were captured. His brother Nicholas managed to escape with a handful of ships, but Constantine was captured and imprisoned in Palermo until 1158, when Manuel concluded a peace treaty with William. In June or July 1166, Emperor Manuel charged him and Basil Tripsychos with repairing and strengthening the fortifications of Zemun, Belgrade, and Ni≈°, and generally strengthen Byzantium's frontier with Hungary along the middle Danube. As part of this process, he organized the resettlement of Braniƒçevo. The date of his death is unknown; his wife possibly predeceased him, as she is last mentioned in 1136. Children Through his marriage with Theodora, Constantine had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Through his sons, Constantine was the progenitor of the Angelos dynasty, which produced three Byzantine emperors in 1185‚Äì1204, as well as the \\"Angelos Komnenos Doukas\\" dynasty that ruled over Epirus and Thessalonica in the 13th‚Äì14th centuries. * John Doukas ( ‚Äì ), had several children by one or two marriages, and a bastard son. The latter, Michael I Komnenos Doukas (), would go on to found the Despotate of Epirus, and was succeeded by his half-brothers. * Maria Angelina (born ), married Constantine Kamytzes, by whom she had a number of children, including Manuel Kamytzes. * Alexios Komnenos Angelos (born ), married and fathered one son. * Andronikos Doukas Angelos ( ‚Äì before September 1185), married Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa, by whom he had nine children, including emperors Isaac II Angelos () and Alexios III Angelos (). * Eudokia Angelina (born ), married Basil Tzykandeles Goudeles. The couple had no children. * Zoe Angelina (born ), married Andronikos Synadenos. The couple had several children, whose names are unknown. * Isaac Angelos Doukas (born ), married and had at least four children, including the unsuccessful usurper Constantine Angelos Doukas. Identity Beginning with Du Cange, many earlier historians distinguished between two persons of this name, since the sources record that a minor noble named Constantine Angelos, from Philadelphia, married the fourth daughter of Alexios I Komnenos and received the title of pansebastohypertatos, whereas the Constantine Angelos, uncle of Manuel I and active during the latter's reign, is recorded in the sources as a sebastohypertatos. However, in 1961 Lucien Stiernon demonstrated that the two persons are in fact the same, with pansebastohypertatos being merely a rhetorical augmentation of the proper title.

Produced by Ross Robinson, it was featured on the band's second studio album Iowa and released as the lead single from the album on October 29, 2001. The single reached number 30 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and number 5 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2002. Composition and lyrics \\"Left Behind\\" was originally known as \\"Lust Disease\\": \\"An old song that we'd been playing around with before the first album,\\" recalled frontman Corey Taylor. \\"We ripped it apart and rebuilt it. We wanted to have a melodic element in there somewhere, and 'Left Behind' had a darkness that meant it sat well with the other songs.\\" It was described by British magazine Kerrang! as \\"considerably more melodic than the rest of the album, providing a brief moment of respite from the outright nastiness elsewhere\\". Taylor recalls that the song was originally \\"much more melodic\\". Producer Ross Robinson accused the vocalist of \\"trying too hard\\" and encouraged him to make it \\"a little more guttural and put a lot more emphasis on it and just make it a smack in the mouth.\\" Taylor has explained that the lyrics inspired by a period during which he was homeless, living under a bridge in his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. Speaking to VH1, he reminisced that \\"'Left Behind' is a song about a time of my life that was really hard - I was homeless ... it's funny how many people you meet when you're homeless ... you find out so much about them, and you rely on them so much, and then when things start happening for you, those faces disappear and they're gone,\\" concluding that the song is \\"about leaving behind the lives that make up your past.\\" Promotion and release Prior to its official release, \\"Left Behind\\" (along with \\"People = Shit\\") was leaked online and made available for digital download in July 2001. The song was subsequently played by several radio stations in the United States, forcing Roadrunner to officially release the track to radio earlier than originally intended. The song was released as a single on October 29, featuring live versions of Slipknot tracks \\"Liberate\\" and \\"Surfacing\\" as B-sides. \\"Left Behind\\" was performed regularly on tour in 2002, and according to set list aggregation website Setlist.fm is the fourth most frequently-performed song from Iowa, behind \\"People = Shit\\", \\"Disasterpiece\\" and \\"The Heretic Anthem\\". Music video The music video for \\"Left Behind\\" was directed by Dave Meyers and filmed in Los Angeles, California. The video combines footage of the band performing in a forest with a narrative centred around a young protagonist, who is described by Metal Injection's Nick Dauk as \\"something of an outcast\\". Ryan Book of The Music Times outlined the narrative of the video as follows: \\"A filthy kid works at a butcher shop chopping meat. He gets bullied. He lives alone in a rotting hulk of a house and eats his cereal with filthy water for some reason. Eventually those bullies throw a rock through the window of his rotting home and it rains.\\" The director's cut of the \\"Left Behind\\" music video was featured on the band's second video album Disasterpieces, released in November 2002. \\"Left Behind\\" has received praise from a number of commentators for its music video. Noisecreep ranked \\"Left Behind\\" as the sixth best Slipknot music video of all- time in 2013. Metal Injection ranked it the band's ninth best video, praising it for effectively capturing \\"the remorseful lyrics that focus on vocalist Corey Taylor's sorrow in leaving behind the support system he had while going through a period of homelessness\\". Rock Sound magazine included \\"Left Behind\\" at number two on its list of \\"Slipknot's 10 Most Shocking Music Video Moments\\", describing it as \\"the stuff of nightmares\\". Reception =Commercial= \\"Left Behind\\" debuted at number 37 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It spent a total of 10 weeks on the chart and peaked at number 30. Outside of the United States, the song reached number 97 on the Australian Singles Chart, number 24 on the UK Singles Chart, number 22 on the Scottish Singles Chart, and number five on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. =Critical= \\"Left Behind\\" received positive reviews from critics. Steven Wells of the NME praised Slipknot as \\"the perfect American rock band\\" on the song, outlining that it \\"stammers, spasms and shits itself and then it splatters the spinal columns of hard-bodied jock-zombies all over the fucking walls\\". Loudwire ranked \\"Left Behind\\" as the band's eighth best track, claiming that \\"it shows off the band's attention to and knack for melody, without losing its meaty, metal edge\\". The website also ranked it as the 15th best hard rock song of the 21st century, praising its \\"frantic drum patterns, blistering riffs and ... venomous screams\\". In January 2002, \\"Left Behind\\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards, alongside \\"The Wizard\\" by Black Sabbath, \\"Disciple\\" by Slayer, \\"Chop Suey!\\" by System of a Down and \\"Schism\\" by Tool. The band's bassist Paul Gray commented that \\"It's cool that we're nominated. I guess it's somewhat of an honor to be nominated. I'm not really worried about if we win or not\\", adding that he predicted System of a Down would win the award. The Grammy was instead won by Tool for \\"Schism\\", the lead single from the band's third full- length studio album Lateralus.

He was retired to stud at the end of his four-year-old season and has had some success as a sire of winners. Background Anabaa Blue is a bay horse with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by the French breeders Haras d'Etreham. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Anabaa, the European Champion Sprinter on 1996. Anabaa went on to sire the outstanding racemare Goldikova and the Hong Kong Cup winner Precision. Anabaa Blue was the second foal of his dam Allez Les Trois, who won three races including the Prix de Flore. Allez Les Trois was a half-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner King's Best and to Urban Sea, a mare who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and produced both Galileo and Sea the Stars. In August 1999, the yearling was consigned to the Deauville sale and was bought for ‚Ç£650,000 by Charles Mimouni. He was sent into training with the Argentinian-born Carlos Lerner at Maisons-Laffitte and was ridden in all but one of his races by the Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Anabaa Blue began his racing career by finishing third in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 15 September. A month later he appeared in the Prix de Blaison over the same distance at Longchamp Racecourse and finished third again, beaten three quarters of a length and one and a half lengths by Leger and Technicolor Lover. =2001: three-year-old season= Anabaa Blue began his second season in the Prix Aqua Tinte II over 2000 metres on heavy ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 2 March. Starting the 8/5 favourite he took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won easily by three lengths from Art Contemporain. On 8 April, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Two Prix Noailles (a trial race for the Prix du Jockey Club) run over 2200 metres at Longchamp and was made favourite against five opponents. He led from the start, went clear of his opponents in the closing stages and won by six lengths from Gris de Fer with the Zetland Stakes winner Worthily two lengths back in third. Lerner commented \\"We've always thought a lot of Anabaa Blue and now he's proved himself to be one of the best in France. The main target is the Jockey-Club. He has taken time to come to himself and has done well during the winter. I think he will be just as good on better ground\\". The colt was stepped up in class again for the Group One Prix Lupin and started odds-on favourite ahead of the Crit√©rium de Maisons- Laffitte winner Amiwain, the Aidan O'Brien-trained Milan and the Royal Lodge Stakes winner Atlantis Prince. He took the lead 400 metres from the finish but was overtaken by the outsider Chichicastenango and beaten a head, with Milan a neck away in third. On 3 June, Anabaa Blue started at odds of 8.6/1 in a field of fourteen colts for 164th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly. Chichicastenango, Milan and Art Contemporain were again in opposition, but the favourite was Maille Pistol, who had won his last four races including the Prix Greffulhe and the Prix Hocquart. The other contenders included Sensible (Prix de Suresnes), Sagacity (Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud), Okawango (Grand Crit√©rium) and Doctorate (Prix de l'Avre). Soumillon (riding on the eve of his 21st birthday) sent the colt into an early lead before settling in second place behind Maille Pistol. Anabaa Blue regained the lead 300 metres from the finish and was driven out to prevail in a blanket finish, beating Chichicastenango by half a length ahead of Grandera, Okawango, Milan and Foundation Spirit. After the race, an emotional Soumillon said \\"This is the best day of my life. Anabaa Blue was a bit unlucky in the Prix Lupin and he fully deserves the red badge of courage. This was Anabaa Blue's day and he fully deserved it\\". Anabaa Blue was sent to England to contest Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse on 28 July. He started an 18/1 outsider and finished seventh of the twelve runners behind Galileo. After a seven-week break, the colt returned in the Prix Niel (a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 16 September. He led from the start but was overtaken 300 metres from the finish and beaten three quarters of a length by the British-trained favourite Golan, with Chichicastenango two lengths away in third. On his final appearance of the season, Anabaa Blue started at odds of 11.2/1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 7 October. He reached third place in the straight but faded in the closing stages and finished ninth of the seventeen runners behind Sakhee. =2002: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Anabaa Blue contested the Group One Prix Ganay at Longchamp over 2100 metres on 28 April. He led until 400 metres out but faded to finish fifth of the six runners behind the filly Aquarelliste. Six weeks later the colt contested the Group Two Grand Prix de Chantilly over 2400 metres for which he started 7/2 second favourite behind Califet, a colt who had won the Prix d'H√©douville and the Prix Jean de Chaudenay in his last two races. The other runners included St Expedit (twice winner of the Ormonde Stakes), Jomana (Prix Exbury, Prix Corrida) and Sangreal (Prix Ridgway). Anabaa Blue raced just behind the leaders before moving forward in the straight where Soumillon briefly struggled to obtain a clear run. He took the lead 150 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from St Expedit and Ange Gabriel, who dead-heated for second place. Ange Gabriel's jockey Thierry Jarnet lodged an objection, but the racecourse stewards confirmed the result after an inquiry. After the race Lerner aid \\"I didn't have him 100 per cent for this race. I put a cross noseband on him and he relaxed much more during the race... he just loves Chantilly\\" whilst Soumillon commented \\"The horse is back to his form of last year and I still had something in the tank. He relaxed so well and didn't have a hard race\\". In the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud three weeks later he started second favourite but never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the six runners behind Ange Gabriel. After a two and a half month break, Anabaa Blue returned for the Prix Foy at Longchamp in September. Starting at odds of 5.9/1 he had trouble getting a clear run in the closing stages but finished strongly to take second place, a length behind Aquarelliste and a short head in front of the Italian colt Falbrav. On October 6, the colt ran in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe for the second time. He started a 23/1 outsider and finished seventh of the sixteen runners, four and quarter lengths behind the winner Marienbard. Stud record Anabaa Blue was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. In 2015 he was standing at the Haras du Grand Chesnaie at a fee of ‚Ç¨2,500. The best of his progeny to date has been Spirit One, who won the Arlington Million in 2008. Other winners sired by Anabaa Blue include Zinabaa (Prix du Muguet, Prix Daniel Wildenstein), Tres Bleu (Prix de Reux, Grand Prix de Deauville) and Tres Rapide (disqualified \\"winner\\" of the Grosser Preis der Badischen Unternehmen). Pedigree *Anabaa Blue was inbred 2 x 4 to Riverman, meaning that this stallion appears in both the second and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Life and career Franz Xaver von Sch√∂nwerth's grave, decorated for the 125th anniversary of his death in 2011 Sch√∂nwerth was born in Amberg as the first of five children of Joseph Sch√∂nwerth, a royal drawing professor.

He received his first permanent position with the administration of Upper Bavaria in 1840. In 1845 he became private secretary to Crown Prince Maximilian of Bavaria. In 1847 first the prince and then his wife Marie of Prussia entrusted him with managing their wealth, which he did well; during the upheavals of 1848, he disguised himself as an odd-job-man, loaded some 3 million thalers' worth of cash, securities, and valuables on a handcart, and took them to Nymphenburg Palace for safekeeping. After the prince's accession as King Maximilian II, he headed his cabinet as well as continuing to serve as his private secretary and manage his wealth; he was responsible for guiding the king in his patronage of the arts and sciences.\\"Sch√∂nwerth, Franz Xaver von\\", Oberpf√§lzer Kulturbund e.V., retrieved 3 March 2015 . In 1851 he was made a Regierungsrat; in 1852 he transferred to the Ministry of Finance as a MinisterialratWolfgang Rappel, \\"Sch√∂nwerth, Franz Xaver von, Ministerialrat und Volkskundler 1810-1886\\", Bosls bayerische Biographie, ed.

Sch√∂nwerth read Greek, Latin and Hebrew and also the Scandinavian languages and Gothic, and later in life studied Sanskrit and cuneiform. After beginning his folklore research, he served on the board of the Historical Association of Upper Bavaria from 1868 to 1875. He retired in 1880 and died in Munich in 1886; he is buried in the Old North Cemetery there. Folklore collecting Inspired by Jacob Grimm, particularly his Deutsche Mythologie, beginning in 1854, Sch√∂nwerth researched the lives of the people of the Upper Palatinate.\\"Sch√∂nwerth: Lebenslauf\\" , Town of Amberg, 17 April 2008 . His wife, Maria Margaretha Rath, was like him a native of the region and was able to provide him with much information about its folklore and traditions. He also drew on the knowledge of the family's housekeeper and her acquaintances in Munich, and showed an unusual ability to draw information from informants without prying, and in exchange for no more than coffee and cigars. From 1854 he also sent out a standardised questionnaire. In 1857-59 he published some of his observations in a 3-volume work titled Aus der Oberpfalz --Sitten und Sagen (From the Upper Palatinate--Customs and Legends). In 1860 and 1861 he went on personal folklore collecting expeditions in the region, but most of that material remained unpublished at his death. Sch√∂nwerth recorded legends, fairytales, comic stories, children's games, nursery rhymes, children's songs and proverbs. He also observed how people lived, describing the everyday life of peasants, their customs and their traditional costumes. Grimm wrote in a review: \\"Nowhere in the whole of Germany has anyone collected more circumspectly, more completely, or leaving so few traces.\\"Jacob Grimm, \\"Sch√∂nwerth, Fr., k. b.

Unlike Grimm, Sch√∂nwerth did not seek a unified picture of Germanic folk culture and its pre-Christian origins, but focussed on the distinct features of the Upper Palatinate; he held a now discredited view that the regional dialect showed close parallels to Gothic. In 2009, unpublished material collected by Sch√∂nwerth, including some 500 folktales, was discovered in Regensburg by the Oberpfalz cultural expert Erika Eichenseer, who has published some of the tales. Honours Sch√∂nwerth was made a knight of the Bavarian Order of St. Michael in 1851 and of the Bavarian Order of the Crown in 1859. He was an honorary member of a number of German historical associations. A memorial plaque was placed on the Sch√∂nwerth family house in Amberg in 1889. The Staatliche Realschule in Amberg has been named for him since 2010, and a \\"Sch√∂nwerth summer\\" was held in the town in 2005.

The site of the cottages was subdivided into a 6.75-acre parcel, which allowed the portion of the historic Lilburn complex to fall outside of the Ellicott City Historic district development protections. In 2013, owners Ronald and Gail Spahn allowed the Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services to burn the historic structures, including the adjacent Lilburn (Hammond) Cottage and Grimes house, before to subdividing the property. Spahn's Autumn Development Corporation used Howard County slope stabilization legislation to help fund clearing the historic wooded site for single-family homes. KB homes marketed the subdivision as Autumn Overlook.

Fictional character biography =Early life= Norman Clegg was the only child of a builder and decorator, David Clegg, and his rather volatile wife Violet (Peter Sallis and Maggie Ollerenshaw). David, a war veteran, was very quiet and rarely interacted with his family, much to the concern of Norman, who thought his father didn't like him (Vi felt the same way). His mother was overprotective of her son, and panicked when he was walked home by a girl a year older than him. =Later years= Norman married his wife, Edith, in the 1940s; she died in 1971.Comedy Playhouse, Series 13 - Of Funerals and Fish Especially in earlier episodes, Norman reminisced about his wife and her traits: how she hated his camping phase; and her sharp tongue. After her death and being made redundant from his job as a lino salesman, he hung around with his school- friends Compo Simmonite and Cyril Blamire. They divided their time between the local library, pubs, eating at Sid's Caf√© and devising adventurous exploits to stave off boredom. Clegg was a cynic, and more critical of the schemes than the others, preferring to take a back seat and casually watch, for example, an antic involving three meat pies; Compo, Cyril and Sid; an alloy spoon and a very angry Ivy.Series 2, Episode 5 - Ballad for Wind Instruments and a Canoe Norman enjoys watching Compo and the third man, usually Foggy, arguing or trading insults such as \\"great long dollop\\" (Sid), \\"Elsie\\" (Foggy) and \\"Rex Hammond\\" (Cyril). He often goes along with the ideas just to please the others. Clegg aims for a relaxing, peaceful retirement following his redundancy from his job as a lino salesman, but is continually involved in the schemes of Foggy and the others. Happy just reading alone in his cosy home, he also finds enjoyment in some of the simpler things in life, such as Sid's skirting board and the price of beer. He is also so anxious and shy that he wears several layers of clothing: vest/long johns, shirt, jumper/sweater, waistcoat/suit vest, jacket/sport coat, and finally a plastic mac, which he just carries when it's not windy or raining. He is also the only one of the trio with a driving licenceSeries 1, Episode 5 - The New Mobile Trio and so finds himself pressured into driving on the very rare occasions that they are not TV walking about locally and manage to find a vehicle but no driver. This invariably results in a panic attack for Clegg, who fumbles about uncontrollably with the gears and pedals, limiting his speed to about 3 mph (5 km per hour) (which is just to his liking). In the series 1 episode \\"The New Mobile Trio\\" he decides that the trio should buy a car, but shortly after they bought one he accidentally crashed it into a passing tractor. Because Clegg was at first optimistic on the idea of driving, it is likely that incidents such as this triggered his fear of driving and he mentions in series 21 that he doesn't hold a drivers license any more and is proud as a result. He sometimes could also be quite superstitious as in one episode he believed he, Compo and Foggy had aroused the anger of an old Yorkshire god named Earnshaw and in the episode where Compo is buried he believed Compo heard him shouting \\"Goodbye Compo\\" when in fact it was a random passerby who overheard him. Clegg was the sounding-board for Compo's glee and the third man's authority, and was often instrumental in pointing out the pitfalls concealed within the schemes of the third man.Bright and Ross (2000), p. 50 Clegg is also well known for his philosophical asides, which have received praise for interjecting intellectual material into the series. In early episodes, Clegg was much more opinionated and courageous. Sometimes he was shown to be the leader of the trio in the earlier episodes (such as taking them on a camping trip in the hills one stormy night). Within a few years he became more quiet and laid-back (although he was still seen to relish the odd practical joke or escapade), and the group came to be led by Foggy and the \\"third men\\" who succeeded him. During the earlier episodes he was also less awkward and more talkative when interacting with women which is shown when he once made an offhand remark about Nora Batty's father (which she overheard). When Cyril commented on how brave it was to do so, he claimed to have had \\"years of marital combat experience\\". Eventually he became more nervous when interacting with the local ladies. Despite his neurosis and frequent skepticism, Clegg was the one who had the most average lifestyle and particularly in earlier episodes is portrayed as the most friendly out of the trio. From series 9 onwards Howard often involved Clegg in his risky schemes to have an affair with Marina without Pearl finding out. As a result, Clegg is often shown to be afraid of Pearl (though when not involved in any of Howard's schemes they are both shown to be friendly with each other). He is also reluctant to help Howard through his affair with Marina because he is terrified of the latter. It is revealed in the episode \\"A Sidecar Named Desire\\" that he'd previously got trapped in a lift with Marina and she cuddled him for warmth which left him frightened of her. Because Howard frequently sends Clegg in his place to deliver messages to Marina, this leads the latter into believing that Clegg is interested in her and throughout the series she is shown to have a soft spot for him. However one notable exception where Clegg grows to enjoy Marina's company is when she ended up having lunch with him and Truly on his birthday, (much to the jealousy and anger of Howard). He is also terrified of going near Auntie Wainwright's shop because she always manages to sell him something that he does not want. Throughout most of the series he was generally closer to Compo than the \\"third men\\" and the two of them often got enjoyment out of the mishaps of Cyril and later Foggy. Clegg was the most devastated by Compo's death and felt guilty about not giving him a proper send off. Subsequently, he became closer to Truly. With the introduction of Alvin Smedley to the main trio (making them a quartet), Clegg's roles were gradually reduced from series 25 onward's due to Peter Sallis's health (though there are occasional episodes where he does play a major role). After Keith Clifford departed the show after series 27, the quartet became a trio again; however, Clegg's role (along with Truly's) continued to decrease and most episodes focused on Alvin and Entwistle's schemes. In the two final series he became a secondary character, as Sallis and Frank Thornton were now over 80, leading to complications over insurance when on location filming, so his role was filled by Entwistle (Burt Kwouk). Prior to this Entwistle had filled Clegg's role on a number of occasions. Despite being a widower, Clegg rarely refers to his wife, although he mentions that she was strongly against his camping phase and that she has a brother, whom Clegg toasts for \\"keeping well away\\". An early exchange with Nora Batty hinted that Edith was of a similar vein to Nora and Ivy, but this was never elaborated on. In another episode, a cousin of Edith's comes to stay with Clegg, but ends up holding Clegg hostage in his own home. Compo and Foggy are left to break him out, but Howard relishes in the situation, comparing it to his own marriage. Throughout the series, Edith is only referred to by name once. He was the only character to appear in every single episode of the programme.

The Proclamation of South Australia 1836, Charles Hill. History Hill was born in Coventry, England; his father was an officer who served under Lord Wellington, and served at Badajoz, Salamanca, Vitoria, and Toulouse, and was later the reforming Governor of Leicester County Prison. Charles was more interested in art than a military career, and served an apprenticeship as line engraver to Mark Lambert in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1840 he enrolled in the Newcastle Fine Arts Academy and took lessons at the Government School of Design with W. B. Scott, later editor of The Art Journal. He helped mount the posthumous exhibition of David Scott's works. He produced the engraving The Choristers after Barraud. He was one of those responsible for the famous engraving which depicted the opening on The Crystal Palace in 1851. Hill emigrated to South Australia on the recommendation of Archdeacon Farr (1819‚Äì1904), in the hope that a change of climate would be good for his health, arriving on the Historia in 1854. He found employment as art teacher at St. Peter's College also J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, Mrs. Woodcocks Christ Church school room, at Miss Roland's school on Tavistock Street, and later Mrs. Bell's school. He opened his own School of Art in his home in Pulteney Street in 1856. Wilton Hack succeeded Hill as drawing master in 1868 at both St. Peter's and AEI. It was largely due to the efforts of Hill and W. W. Whitridge that the South Australian Society of Arts was formed; the first meeting held to establish the Society was held at his home. He moved to \\"Alix House\\", 100 South Terrace around 1866, their home for fifty years. When the Society of Arts and the South Australian Institute founded the South Australian School of Design in 1861, he was chosen as its first Master, a role he maintained through several changes of name and focus, until he retired around 1886. He was an active member of the South Australian Volunteer Force, and was an expert marksman. He was also a member of Adelaide's Bohemian Club.

Business model Fluidigm's products leverage the capabilities of multilayer soft lithography to create microfluidic devices: specifically, technology developed by one of the co- founders and branded \\"Integrated Fluidic Circuitry\\". Fluidigm is a public company traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLDM. Fluidigm has a number of academic partners whose engagement is aimed to provide a wow factor to exemplar product uses; partners include Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Broad Institute, the Genome Institute of Singapore and Kyoto University. Among companies which include \\"integrated microfluidic technology\\" into their products, the only competitor which a market focus on biotechnology as of 2011 appeared to be RainDance Technologies. Going into 2015, the company is making an effort to infuse industrial design, aesthetic and customer centricity principles to help distinguish their products from those of competitors and generate a distinctive brand experience for users. History Fluidigm was founded in 1999 as \\"Mycometrix\\" by Stephen Quake and Gajus Worthington. The company was formed to commercialize technology developed by Quake at the California Institute of Technology referred to as microfluidic large-scale integration and \\"branded\\" under the name Integrated Fluidic Circuits. As of 2015, Worthington remains with the company as president and chief executive officer (CEO), while Quake was a member of the company's scientific advisory board as of 2011. The company completed a successful initial public offering (IPO) in February 2011, raising about . This followed a failed, ill-timed IPO in 2008. As of the 2011 IPO, Fluidigm had not yet become profitable, but had accumulated nearly in debt. Operations At the end of 2014, Fluidigm had a headcount of 500 personnel. In addition to its headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco, California, which it expanded in 2014, the company in 2005 established the first biochip manufacturing facility in Singapore. The Singapore facility was in 2009 led by Grace Yow, who also held the position of Fluidigm vice president of worldwide manufacturing. =Products= Fluidigm's products typically consist of single-use biochips, instrumentation for handling biochips and software for instrument operation and data collection and analysis. No Fluidigm products had been approved for clinical use in the United States as of 2009. Fluidigm's first commercial product was aimed at the protein crystallization market and was launched in 2003 under the brand \\"Topaz\\". The company's second marketed product targeted high-throughput DNA amplification and was launched in 2006 under the brand \\"BioMark\\". By 2013, BioMark had been adapted to real-time PCR and was capable of running >9000 reactions in parallel. A high-throughput genotyping system, FLUIDIGM EPI, was introduced in 2008. The C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep, or C1 system, was released in the early 2000s aimed at delivering 96 single-cell capture and processing events in parallel. One aim of development forward from the C1 system is increasing parallel throughput. This initial line of instruments purportedly cost about apiece to purchase in 2011. One reported use for the instruments is \\"to identify signatures of induced pluripotent stem cells\\". In June 2015, Fluidigm introduced Helios‚Ñ¢, the third-generation CyTOF¬Æ platform that enables system-level biology at single-cell resolution, on an accessible, expandable system designed for clinical trials. CyTOF technology provides a high- resolution proteomic profile of each cell, which distinguishes it from all other cells and reveals the heterogeneity of the sample. Fluidigm also announced proteomics sample barcoding, which enables Helios and all other CyTOF customers to take advantage of multiplexing in their experimental design.

Judgment Brandon LJ held that while Mr Nelson was not \\"redundant\\"‚Äîthe BBC could have found other work for him‚Äîand therefore dismissal on the grounds of redundancy was technically unfair, Mr Nelson's behaviour reduced his damages to zero as his behaviour was \\"perverse or foolish ‚Ä¶ or ‚Ä¶ bloody minded.\\" The Court of Appeal laid out a three-stage test to whether there is contributory fault in an unfair dismissal claim. The test is as follows: # Was the employee culpable or blameworthy? # Did the employee's actions cause or contribute to the dismissal? # Is it just and equitable in the circumstances to reduce the award?

Civil Rights Movement =Voter Registration= On April 9th, 1963, Turnbow, with a group of 13 other African Americans, including Hollis Watkins, Ozell Mitchell, and Alma Mitchell Carnegie arrived at the Holmes County, Mississippi courthouse in Lexington in an attempt to register to vote. This group became known as the ‚ÄúFirst Fourteen‚Äù. The ‚ÄúFirst Fourteen‚Äù were approached by a myriad of whites who attempted to intimidate and prevent the group from registering to vote. In a thick mob of angry whites, deputy sheriff, Andrew Smith, with his hand on his gun holster, called out, ‚ÄúAll right now, who will be the first?‚Äù At that point, Turnbow stepped forward and told the deputy sheriff \\"Me, Hartman Turnbow.

Wright began his playing career with Harwich & Parkeston, but by 1932 he was on the books at Charlton, where he remained for three years. He spent time with Aldershot and then Derby County before the outbreak of World War II. He also appeared for Southern League sides Chelmsford City and Colchester United. He represented an England XI once in 1935 against an Anglo-Scot team in a friendly game for the King George V Jubilee Trust Fund. Wright took up a coaching role at Guildford City following his retirement in 1949, before holding similar positions at Walsall and Luton Town. He was named as head coach at Everton in 1956, and later coached the India youth team between 1961 and 1963 in preparation for the 1963 AFC Youth Championship. In 1963, he inherited Syed Abdul Rahim's India national team, where Wright led the side to the runners-up spot in the 1964 Asian Cup, which remains the most notable triumph in professional football for India. Club career Wright was understudy to the younger Sam Bartram during his stint with Charlton Athletic. Born in Tottenham, London, Wright initially played for Essex outfit Harwich & Parkeston, but by 1932 he had joined Football League side Charlton Athletic. Between 1932 and 1935, Wright made 38 league appearances, despite being understudy to Sam Bartram as Charlton rose from the Third Division to the First Division. During the 1936‚Äì37 season, Wright played 28 times for Aldershot as they finished bottom of the Football League. However, a fee of ¬£2,500 saw him move to Derby County for the following season, where he played 25 times. In the war years, Wright played at Layer Road, the ground of his future club Colchester United alongside his future manager Ted Fenton while playing for an Eastern Command side. Having also played for Southern League side Chelmsford City, Wright signed for Essex rivals Colchester United on 11 July 1946. Despite playing 23 times for Colchester, the club initially decided to not retain Wright for the 1947‚Äì48 season, but a month later, a change of heart saw Wright re-sign. In his second season, he helped Colchester reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, but within weeks of the beginning of the 1948‚Äì49 season, Wright had suffered an injury that saw him lose his place to Ken Whitehead. His attempted comeback on 23 April 1949 against Merthyr Tydfil ended early due to injury, meaning Colchester were forced to play forward Vic Keeble in goal. It would be his final appearance for the club. He made 69 appearances for Colchester in all competitions. International career Wright made one appearance for an England XI side that played an Anglo-Scots team in the King George V Jubilee Trust Fund friendly held at Highbury on 8 May 1935. A crowd of 8,944 witnessed the 1‚Äì0 defeat for the England side, with Manchester United's George Mutch scoring the only goal of the game. Coaching career On leaving Colchester in the summer of 1949, Wright was appointed trainer-coach at Guildford City. After qualifying as an FA coach and physiotherapist, Wright would hold coaching positions at Walsall and Luton Town before being appointed head coach of First Division Everton in September 1956. Between 1961 and 1963, Wright spent time in India coaching the Indian youth team in preparation for the 1963 AFC Youth Championship in Malaya. Wright then inherited Syed Abdul Rahim's side to become the first foreign coach of the India national football team after Rahim died in 1963. Wright was tasked with taking his side to the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. They finished as runners-up to hosts Israel in the round-robin tournament, which to-date remains the best achievement in Indian professional football. Wright retired to King's Lynn in Norfolk, where he died in April 1994.

Facts The Port of London Authority attempted to dismiss trade union officials. In July 1989 they wished to reduce workers at Tilbury. Dockworkers were dismissed and 17 were shop stewards. They claimed the dismissals were actually motivated by their being union officials. An industrial tribunal found the complaints to be justified. It ordered re-engagement under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 section 69 for 12 applicants, and gave compensation to the others. The Port of London Authority did not comply with the orders. Under section 75A a new tribunal found that on the balance of probabilities it was practicable to comply with the order, and so made a special award of compensation. The EAT upheld the Port of London Authority‚Äôs appeal against the re-engagement order. Judgment The Court of Appeal denied reinstatement because the employer had shown there were no vacancies and it would be disruptive to ask others to take voluntary redundancy. The Tribunal had failed to give due weight to the employer‚Äôs commercial judgment about that practicability, unless the employer was to be disbelieved. Neill LJ said the following.

It is commonly known as the \\"Czech Avignon\\" or \\"Hitler's Bridge\\". The original bridge over the Sedlick√Ω River near Borovsko was under construction at KM 59 of the highway between 1939‚Äì42 and 1948-50. Construction was commenced in July 1939 by the civil engineering company \\"ing. J. Domansk√Ω\\". The planned budget was 5,552,400 crowns. Despite most civil engineering projects in Czechoslovakia being halted after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, in order that material schedule for them could be diverted to the Nazi war effort, the construction of the bridge continued, although it was halted after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi overlord of Czechoslovakia. Under the Communist regime which came about at the end of World War II, construction resumed, even though the emphasis at the time was on heavy industry and railroads rather than on automobile travel.Burgess, Bruce (exec. prod.) (May 18, 2017) \\"The Tesla Conspiracy\\" (season 1, episode 6) Mysteries of the Abandoned (TV series) Science Channel The bridge itself was completed at the end of 1950 and formally approved by the authorities in 1952. However, highway construction was suspended in the 1950s, the rampart at the southern end was never finished, and the bridge was abandoned. The 1960s brought new hope for the Borovsko Bridge and Czech highways. At the time, a project for a new large drinking-water reservoir for Prague was under consideration. Natural supply provided a high quality of water but a huge artificial lake was to flood a number of valleys, including two valleys where the Borovsko Bridge and the smaller neighbouring Sedmpansk√Ω Bridge were situated. Various scenarios were examined. One of them was reducing the lake size, but the city of Prague required millions of litres of drinking water. The other option was hydroinsulation of the bridge construction - but this approach was almost as costly as building a new bridge, even without considering the cost of water protection in case of accident etc. Finally, the decision was made to bypass the valley and to build a completely new bridge 1.4 km upriver to the south. The dam has been in operation since 1976 and the sector of the D1 highway since 1977. The Borovsko Bridge and the Sedmpansk√Ω Bridge were abandoned, as were the routes a few kilometres west and east from the bridges' location. Today, huge spans of the Borovsko Bridge have been flooded almost up to the roadway. The bridge rests unseen in the middle of the forests of the Bohemian- Moravian Highlands, as the whole lake district is a forbidden area and entry is strictly prohibited to protect the watershed.\\"Borovsko Bridge\\" DangerousRoads.org References Category:Bridges to nowhere Category:Bridges in the Czech Republic Category:Bene≈°ov District ","title":"Borovsko Bridge"},{"id":"45537945","text":"Geroda may refer to: * Geroda (moth), a genus of moth * Geroda, Lower Franconia, Bavaria, Germany * Geroda, Thuringia, Germany * Jayrud (ancient Geroda), a city in Syria ","title":"Geroda"},{"id":"45537949","text":"The fourth election to the City and County of Swansea Council was held in May 2008.

The battalion supports the United States Army Japan (USARJ). The battalion has four subordinate units - Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) (Camp Zama), 287th Signal Company (Camp Zama), 333rd Signal Company (Okinawa), and 349th Signal Company (Okinawa). Mission The battalion mission is to provide and defend the Pacific LandWarNet and expeditionary communications capabilities as part of U.S. Army Pacific's Theater Information Grid, enabling mission command and information superiority. History The 78th Signal Battalion was activated October 16, 1992, and based at Camp Zama, Japan but is tied to the U.S. Army Signal Corps history and lineage dating back to the end of World War II. In August 1945, the 232nd Signal Operations Company was deployed to Yokohama and the 4035th Signal Support Seaborne Communications Detachment was deployed to Tokyo. Jointly, they comprised the First U.S. Army Communications Center with general headquarters in the Dai-ichi Life Building, Tokyo. Shortly thereafter, other small signal elements in Japan were absorbed and the unit was redesigned the 71st Signal Service Battalion. The unit was assigned the mission of operating the long lines communication system in the Far East. Post, camp and station communication responsibilities were given to the Japan Signal Service Battalion, which had been formed just prior to the 71st Signal Service Battalion activation. In 1947 on Okinawa, the 8111th Army Service Unit was activated. Part of its mission was the performance of signal functions. In 1957, the 8111th was redesignated the U.S. Army Signal Group, Ryukyu Islands. In 1958, the 71st Signal Service Battalion and the Japan Signal Service Battalion combined to form the U.S. Army Communications Agency. In 1960 it assumed responsibility for signal supply elements of U.S. Army Depot, Sagami. In 1963, the depot mission was transferred to U.S. Army Depot, Japan. At the same time, the Army Communications Agency was re-designated U.S. Army Signal Command. In 1964, the Signal Command transferred the long haul communications mission, including tape rely, transmitter, receiver, microwave, and troop sites to the United States Air Force. From 1965 to 1966, the battalion remained a facility operated by the U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command (STRATCOM) and underwent two name changes. They were STRATCOM Station-Okinawa which soon changed to STRATCOM Signal Group-Okinawa. In November 1966, they were again re-designated was redesigned to U.S. Army Strategic Communication Signal Group (USASTRATCOM), Japan. In 1970, a major addition to STRATCOM Signal Group-Okinawa was activated. The Area Maintenance and Supply Facility (AMSF) concept was implemented in Okinawa. The unit provided maintenance and supply support to the electronics and signal units on the island, and eventually, its mission was expanded to cover the entire Pacific region. In 1973, USASTRATCOM became U.S. Army Communications Command (USACC), Japan. In 1984, the name was changed to U.S. Army Information Systems Command (USAISC), Japan, due to a U.S. Army reorganization. Signal activities on Honshu became Signal Activity North (SAN). At that time, the SAN commander became assumed additional duties as Director of Information Management (DOIM) for the U.S. Army Japan‚Äôs subordinate command on Honshu. In Okinawa in November 1973, U.S. Army Communications Command (USACC) and another battalion changed to USACC Signal Support Agency South. In 1976, it was renamed USACC- Japan Signal Activity South (SAS). In 1977, it was designated the 71st Signal Battalion (Provisional). In 1978, it reverted to USACC-Japan SAS. In 1979, the basis for the signal battalion as we know it today was formed. The AMSF and a new unit, the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Detachment, became subordinate units of SAS. A headquarters detachment and operations company were formed providing the battalion with four subordinate elements. In 1980, SAS was renamed U.S. Army Activity (USAA)-Japan Signal Battalion and in 1982, the signal battalion grew again when the Tactical Satellite Detachment was added. In May 1984, the U.S. Army Communication Command was re-designated and Okinawa‚Äôs battalion fell under the newly named U.S. Army Information Systems Command (USAISC), and its mission has remained the same, to be the \\"Voice of the Army\\" and the voice of United States government agencies on Okinawa. Meanwhile, the Headquarters Army staff also reorganized to fully integrate the information functions of automation, administration, communication, and command and control under the assistant chief of staff for information management, which provided direction and leadership at the Department of Army level. This reorganization was necessary to achieve better oversight, disciplined acquisition, and improved the quality, flow, and processing of information. In August 1984, subcommands came under USAISC. At that time, the U.S. Army Japan Office of Assistant Chief of Staff, Communication-Electronics, was re-designated as USARJ Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Information Management. In 1985, the INSCOM Detachment was inactivated and AMSF became a separate, subordinate element of USAISC- Japan, at Camp Zama. In April 1985, the USARJ information mission consisting of audiovisual and automation functions was transferred to USAISC-J. On November 1, 1985, the signal battalion in Okinawa was restructured and provisionally reorganized into two separate subcommands, USAISC-J Signal Battalion and USAISC-J Area Maintenance and Supply Facility-Pacific. On mainland Japan, the reorganization of SAN under the Information Mission Area (IMA) concept continued through the 1980s. The Audiovisual IMA was transferred to SAN on April 1, 1985. During 1986, the USARJ television studio and closed- circuit television cable and public address system also were incorporated into SAN. The Administrative Services Division, Consolidated Data Processing Center, and Information Center came under the operational control of SAN in February 1988 thereby placing all five IMAs under SAN. On June 30, 1989, SAN was reorganized as the 1141st U.S. Army Signal Battalion with two units, a base operations company and a headquarters and headquarters detachment. A year later, the 1141st and a sister battalion, the 1140th U.S. Army Signal Battalion, Okinawa, came under the command of the newly organized 1104th U.S. Army Signal Brigade in Japan. The 1104th was inactivated September 30, 1991, and command of the battalions transferred to the 1106th U.S. Army Signal Brigade in Hawaii. Operational control of the 1141st U.S. Army Signal Battalion remained with the Commander, USARJ/9th Theater Army Area Command (TAAC). As part of a continuing reorganization of USAISC, driven by an Army drawdown, the 1141st U.S. Army Signal Battalion was inactivated and the 78th Signal Battalion was activated October 16, 1992, at Camp Zama, Japan, assuming Army Signal responsibilities for mainland Japan. Meanwhile, on the same date, the 58th Signal Battalion was activated and assumed Army Signal duties on Okinawa. Additionally, the 287th, 333rd, and 349th Signal Companies were also activated. Command of the 78th remained with the Hawaii-based 516th Signal Brigade (formerly 1106th) and operational control remained with the commander, USARJ/9th TAAC and since December 19, 2007, USARJ/I Corps (Forward). Following the devastating magnitude 9.1 T≈çhoku earthquake in northeastern Honshu, Japan March 11, 2011, 78th Signal Battalion unit personnel contributed significantly to the disaster relief efforts during Operation Tomodachi. On October 12, 2012, 78th Signal Battalion assumed control of all Army Signal duties in Japan when the Okinawa-based 58th Signal Battalion was inactivated.

The term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures. Decacorn is a word used for those companies over $10 billion, while hectocorn is used for such a company valued over $100 billion. According to CB Insights, there are over 450 unicorns . The largest unicorns included ByteDance, DiDi, Stripe, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies and Airbnb. Lyft is the most recent decacorn that turned into a public company on March 29, 2019.  History  When Aileen Lee originally coined the term \\"unicorn\\" in 2013, there were only thirty-nine companies that were considered unicorns.Fan, Jennifer S. \\"Regulating Unicorns: Disclosure and the New Private Economy.\\" BCL Rev. 57 (2016): 583. In a different study done by the Harvard Business Review, it was determined that startups founded between 2012 and 2015 were growing in valuation twice as fast as companies from startups founded between 2000 and 2013. In 2018, 16 U.S. companies became unicorns, resulting in 119 private companies worldwide valued at $1 billion or more.  Reasons behind the rapid growth of unicorns  = Fast-growing strategy = According to academics in 2007, investors and venture capital firms are adopting the get big fast (GBF) strategy for startups, also known as Blitzscaling. GBF is a strategy where a startup tries to expand at a high rate through large funding rounds and price cutting to gain an advantage on market share and push away rival competitors as fast as possible.Sterman, J. D., Henderson, R., Beinhocker, E. D., & Newman, L. I. (2007). Getting big too fast: Strategic dynamics with increasing returns and bounded rationality. Management Science, 53(4), 683-696. The rapid exponential returns through this strategy seems to be attractive to all parties involved. However, there is always the cautionary note of the dot-com bubble of 2000 and the lack of long-term sustainability in value creation of the companies born from the Internet age. = Company buyouts = Many unicorns were created through buyouts from large public companies. In a low-interest-rate and slow- growth environment, many companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google focus on acquisitions instead of focusing on capital expenditures and development of internal investment projects. Some large companies would rather bolster their businesses through buying out established technology and business models rather than creating it themselves. = Increase of private capital available = The average age of a technology company before it goes public is 11 years, as opposed to an average life of four years back in 1999. This new dynamic stems from the increased amount of private capital available to unicorns and the passing of the U.S.'s Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act in 2012, which increased the amount of shareholders a company can have by a multiple of four before the company had to disclose its financials publicly. The amount of private capital invested in software companies has increased three-fold from 2013 to 2015. = Prevent IPO = Through many funding rounds, companies do not need to go through an initial public offering (IPO) to obtain a capital or a higher valuation; they can just go back to their investors for more capital. IPOs also run the risk of devaluation of a company if the public market thinks a company is worth less than its investors. A few recent examples of this situation were Square, best known for its mobile payments and financial services business, and Trivago, a popular German hotel search engine, both of which were priced below their initial offer prices by the market. This was because of the severe over-valuation of both companies in the private market by investors and venture capital firms. The market did not agree with both companies' valuations, and therefore, dropped the price of each stock from their initial IPO range. Investors and startups also do not want to deal with the hassle of going public because of increased regulations. Regulations like the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act have implemented more stringent regulations following several bankruptcy cases in the U.S. market that many of these companies want to avoid. = Technological advancements = Startups are taking advantage of the flood of new technology of the last decade to obtain Unicorn status. With the explosion of social media and access to millions utilizing this technology to gain massive economies of scale, startups have the ability to expand their business faster than ever. New innovations in technology including mobile smartphones, P2P platforms, and cloud computing with the combination of social media applications has aided in the growth of unicorns.  Valuation  The valuations that lead these start-up companies to become unicorns and decacorns are unique compared to more established companies. A valuation for an established company stems from past years' performances, while a start-up company's valuation is derived from its growth opportunities and its expected development in the long term for its potential market. Valuations for unicorns usually come from funding rounds of large venture capital firms investing in these start-up companies. Another significant final valuation of start-ups is when a much larger company buys out a unicorn and gives them that valuation. Recent examples are when Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club and when Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, effectively turning Dollar Shave Club and Instagram into unicorns. Bill Gurley, a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark predicted in March 2015 and earlier that the rapid increase in the number of unicorns may \\"have moved into a world that is both speculative and unsustainable\\", that will leave in its wake what he terms \\"dead unicorns\\". Also he said that the main reason of Unicorns' valuation is the \\"excessive amount of money\\" available for them. Similarly, in 2015 William Danoff who manages the Fidelity Contrafund said unicorns might be \\"going to lose a bit of luster\\" due to their more frequent occurrence and several cases of their stock price being devalued.Reuters (01 December 2015). Fidelity star Danoff grows cautious about unicorn phenomenon, CNBC.com, accessed 31 Jan 2020 Research by Stanford professors published in 2018 suggests that unicorns are overvalued by an average of 48%. = Valuation of high-growth companies = For high-growth companies looking for the highest valuations possible, it comes down to potential and opportunity. When investors of high-growth companies are deciding on whether they should invest in a company or not, they look for signs of a home run to make exponential returns on their investment along with the right personality that fits the company.MacMillan, I. C., Siegel, R., & Narasimha, P. S. (1985). Criteria used by venture capitalists to evaluate new venture proposals. Journal of Business venturing, 1(1), 119-128. To give such high valuations in funding rounds, venture capital firms have to believe in the vision of both the entrepreneur and the company as a whole. They have to believe in the company can evolve from its unstable, uncertain present standing into a company that can generate and sustain moderate growth in the future.  Market sizing  To judge the potential future growth of a company, there needs to be an in-depth analysis of the target market. When a company or investor determines its market size, there are a few steps they need to consider to figure out how large the market really is: * Defining the sub-segment of the market (no company can target 100% market share, also known as monopolization) * Top-Down market sizing * Bottom-Up analysis * Competitor analysis After the market is reasonably estimated, a financial forecast can be made based on the size of the market and how much a company thinks it can grow in a certain time period.  Estimation of finances  To properly judge the valuation of a company after the revenue forecast is completed, a forecast of the operating margin, analysis of needed capital investments, and return on invested capital needs to be completed to judge the growth and potential return to investors of a company. Assumptions of where a company can grow to needs to be realistic, especially when trying to get venture capital firms to give the valuation a company wants. Venture capitalists know the payout on their investment will not be realized for another five to ten years, and they want to make sure from the start that financial forecasts are realistic.  Working back to the present  With the financial forecasts set, investors need to know what the company should be valued in the present day. This is where more established valuation methods become more relevant. This includes the three most common valuation methods: * Discounted cash flow analysis * Market comparable method * Comparable transactions Investors can derive a final valuation from these methods and the amount of capital they offer for a percentage of equity within a company becomes the final valuation for a startup. Competitor financials and past transactions also play an important part when providing a basis for valuing a startup and finding a correct valuation for these companies.  Trends  = Sharing economy = The sharing economy, also known as \\"collaborative consumption\\" or \\"on-demand economy\\", is based on the concept of sharing personal resources. This trend of sharing resources has made three of the top five largest unicorns (Uber, DiDi, and Airbnb) become the most valuable startups in the world. The economic trends of the 2010s powered consumers to learn to be more conservative with spending and the sharing economy reflected this. = E-commerce = E-commerce and the innovation of the online marketplace have been slowly taking over the needs for physical locations of store brands. A prime example of this includes the decline of malls within the United States. The sales of malls within the United States have declined from $87.46 billion in 2005 to $60.65 billion in 2015. The emergence of e-commerce companies like Amazon and Alibaba (both unicorns before they went public) have decreased the need for physical locations to buy consumer goods. Many large corporations have seen this trend for a while and have tried to adapt to the e-commerce trend. Walmart recently bought Jet.com, an American e-commerce company, for $3.3 billion to try and adapt to consumer preferences. = Innovative business model = In support of the sharing economy, unicorns and successful startups have built an operating model defined as \\"network orchestrators\\". In this business model, there is a network of peers creating value through interaction and sharing. Network orchestrators may sell products/services, collaborate, share reviews, and build relations through their businesses. Examples of network orchestrators include all sharing economy companies (i.e. Uber, Airbnb), companies that let consumers share information (i.e. TripAdvisor, Yelp), and peer-to-peer or business-to-person selling platforms (i.e. Amazon, Alibaba).

Contents The Employment Act 2002 contained new rules on maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay, and changes to the tribunal system in the United Kingdom. Paternity leave is when a male counterpart is able to have time off to spend with the child and the mother while receiving paid leave. Maternity leave is one which is included with the leave a mother should get when she has given birth to a child. In the UK a mother would get 26 weeks of paid leave for time they will need to spend with their child. Also, under this Act, there were many other factors such as equal pay, fixed-term work, flexible working. The Act introduced a mandatory minimum dismissal procedure for employees. After complaints from unions and employers alike that it was merely encouraging a \\"tick-box\\" culture, it was repealed in the Employment Act 2008.

The building was associated with an ancient mercantile family of Siena. Palace facade History It was built in 1473 by Ambrogio Spannocchi, adjacent to the Gothic Palazzo Salimbeni and faces the Mannerist Renaissance Palazzo Tantucci. Spannocchi had been named Treasurer to Pope Pius II of the Sienese Piccolomini Family. The design and construction was entrusted to the Florentine Giuliano da Maiano. The facade closely parallels the Palazzo Medici Riccardi of Florence built a few decades prior. The sober facade, of smooth stone, has three stories, with mullioned windows with round arches on the second floor. Unlike earlier Gothic palaces, which often afforded transient wooden scaffolds for either balconies or awnings, this palace has a solid protruding ceiling cornice near the roofline with classical busts putatively of Roman emperors. The interior courtyard had a scenic stairwell leading to second floor. It faces a square with a statue of the Sienese scholar Sallustio Bandini (1882) by Tito Sarrocchi. This entire square was reformulated in the 19th century by removing a garden found in front of the Spannocchi palace. To the left of this palace, at the bottom of the piazza stands the Gothic style Palazzo Salimbeni (14th-century), also once belonging to an important banking family of Siena, and now historical of the Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank. Across the piazza is the late-Renaissance style Palazzo Tantucci (1548), offices of the bank. South along Via Banchi di Sopra, are the Palaces Bichi Ruspoli and Tolomei.

Graeber previously wrote Debt: The First 5000 Years and The Democracy Project, and was an organizer behind Occupy Wall Street. Graeber signed a book deal with Melville House toward the end of 2014, and The Utopia of Rules was released on February 24, 2015.  Summary  The author, in 2015 Graeber describes the contemporary era as the \\"age of total bureaucratisation,\\" in which public and private bureaucracies, now so intertwined as to be effectively indistinguishable, have become the main mechanisms for Wall Street profits, and describes how bureaucratization brings the threat of violence (through legal and police enforcement) into almost every aspect of daily life in wealthy countries. Graeber argues that bureaucracies are no longer analyzed or satirized as they were in Catch-22 or The Castle. The book centers on the \\"political implications\\" of bureaucracies and Graeber's solutions. Graeber notes that Americans largely dislike bureaucracies, but while they are not motivated to change bureaucracies, he thinks they should be. He makes an urgent call to remove the bureaucratic limits that hamper creativity. He argues that the \\"order and regularity\\" of bureaucracy is more harmful than valuable, and elaborates that rules do not apply equally in practice and are more \\"instruments through which the human imagination is smashed and shattered\\".  Reception  Tomas Hachard wrote for NPR that the book is part academic and part radical politics. He noted the appearance of \\"Baudrillard and bell hooks\\" and other academic language. Hachard wrote that Graeber's non-bureaucratic Occupy politics also undergirds the book's arguments. Hachard wrote that Graeber's points are \\"almost always insightful, thought-provoking\\", and worthy of their \\"serpentine\\" reasoning around topics including the history of philosophy, linguistics, and science-fiction films. The reviewer felt that the book paired well with Nikil Saval's book on the \\"evolution of offices\\", Cubed, which followed the balance between office creativity and office rules.  Legacy  The book's questions prompted the theme of the 2016 Taipei Biennial, in which artists produced work on how institutional bureaucracies structure human imagination. * *  References   Further reading         *  * * Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:Melville House books Category:American non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books about anarchism Category:Books by David Graeber ","title":"The Utopia of Rules"},{"id":"45538080","text":"The Eintveit Bridge () is an unused road bridge in Etne municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

Only seven were built but they had great success in several contests during 1934. Design and development The C.530 was a low wing cantilever monoplane, wood framed and fabric covered, with a good deal in common with its predecessor and namesake, the Caudron C.430 Rafale, though with a lower wing loading. Its wing was tapered, round tipped and carried split flaps. Its fuselage was flat sided, with a deep, rounded decking running the full length. It had an air cooled Renault Bengali Junior inverted four cylinder inline engine in the nose, driving a two blade, variable pitch propeller. This engine was a version of the Renault 4P with its compression increased to 6:1 and running at the higher speed of 2,450 rpm. The Rafale's two seats were in tandem, one over the wing and the other just behind the trailing edge, under a long (about a third of the fuselage length), narrow multi-framed canopy with a blunt, vertical windscreen and sliding access. Behind the canopy a long fairing continued its profile to the straight tapered, round tipped vertical tail. The horizontal tail was mounted largely ahead of the fin on the top of the fuselage. The Rafale had a fixed wide track, tailskid undercarriage. Its wheels were on vertical, slender aerofoil section legs from the wings and were largely enclosed within magnesium alloy fairings. The date of the first flight is not certain but it was certainly flying by 7 June 1934, possibly for the first time. Another six examples built were registered soon after. Operational history The C.530 Rafale was intended as a competition aircraft and in 1934 it was very successful. On 8 July Rafales took the first three places in the Angers 12 hour event and later that month filled the top six Esders Cup positions. Late in August, one won the Z√©nith Cup with a flight over the prescribed course at . In 1935 two of the C.530s were converted into C.660 Rafales, powered by Renault six cylinder inverted online engines. One of these won that year's Angers 12 hour event.

Mr Burrell did not apply for the new post and got redundancy. He then claimed unfair dismissal. The Tribunal held the employers had not demonstrated Mr Burrell was redundant, because the new job involved the same work as before. Judgment Peter Clark J held the Tribunal had used the wrong test for redundancy as understood from ERA 1996 section 139(1)(b).

He solved a waste collection crisis by privatizing the service, and his administration was known for numerous public works projects, such as street paving and the construction of a bridge on the north side of the city. Governor of Morelos Estrada Cajigal was the first opposition governor of the state of Morelos (2000-2006). A licensed helicopter pilot, Estrada Cajigal became embroiled in controversy when he rented a helicopter for use by the state, supposedly to improve police and emergency functions. The governor was often seen flying the helicopter, accompanied by female friends; the press soon dubbed it the Helic√≥ptero del Amor (\\"Helicopter of Love\\"). As governor, Estrada Cajigal was accused of having links to drug cartels and a car-theft ring, as well as misuse of funds, although he denied such links and no charges were ever filed. Due to changing markets, Estrada Cajigal supported the shift of the state's agricultural base away from sugarcane production to that of ornamental flowers for exportation. The governor was accused of supporting expropriation of communal farmlands in favor of large businesses and as ex-governor, for personal gain in the Ejido of Acapantzingo. He says the land \\"was gifted\\" (fue regalado) by Eduardo Moreno Ramos, son of a local landowner.

Rolls Royce, challenging the collective agreement that it had itself agreed to, asked the court whether this was compatible with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. The High Court[2008] EWHC 2420 (QB) held that under EE(A)R 2006 r 3, the employer would have a defence to age discrimination because the collective agreement pursued a legitimate business aim, and in any case points for long service conferred a benefit on employees within regulation 32. Rolls Royce argued that the judge had failed to consider whether the provision was proportionate, and there was no ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô under regulation 32. Judgment Arden LJ, Wall LJ and Aikens LJ dismissed the appeal in the Court of Appeal. Although the length of service criterion could be indirect discrimination, it pursued a legitimate aim, especially where part of a collective agreement.

It established new rules for customs in England in order to boost the Crown's finances. One of its most important provisions was the establishment of a rule that it was illegal to land or load goods anywhere other than authorised Legal Quays in London and other ports, under the supervision of customs officers. The legislation also set out which towns were authorised to act as ports. Origins The Act was enacted largely at the instigation of Sir William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester and long-serving Lord Treasurer. It established the Legal Quays and appointed commissioners to designate such quays at every port in the realm. At the most important port by far, London, Paulet himself was appointed along with Sir Richard Sackville and Sir Walter Mildmay, the Under-Treasurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer respectively, to undertake \\"the limitation, assigning and appointing of all the quays and wharves and places appertaining and belonging to the Port of London for the loading and lauding, discharging, unloading and laying on land thereof wares and merchandises\\". Their role consisted of surveying London's wharves and quays to recommend which should be designated as Legal Quays. Legal Quays in London Map of London's Legal Quays (on the north bank) in 1862 Although many quays already existed along the Thames shoreline, Paulet, Sackville and Mildmay decreed that \\"all creeks, wharves, quays, loading and discharging places\\" in Gravesend, Woolwich, Barking, Greenwich, Deptford, Blackwall, Limehouse, Ratcliff, Wapping, St Katherine's, Tower Hill, Rotherhithe, Southwark and London Bridge should be \\"no more used as loading or discharging places for merchandise\\". Twenty existing quays with a frontage of , all located on the north bank of the Thames between London Bridge and the Tower of London, were designated as Legal Quays. In order of their position between London Bridge and the Tower of London, they were: To cope with the volume and complexity of trade in London, particular quays were required to specialise in particular cargoes. For instance, Bear and Young's Quays were reserved for trade with Portugal, due to the presence nearby of warehouses used by Portuguese merchants; other wharves were reserved for the import and export of commodities such as fish, corn, woollen cloths, oil and wine. They were privately owned and operated as a de facto monopoly. During the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which started a short distance to the north in Pudding Lane, all of the Legal Quays were destroyed. They were quickly rebuilt and were all back in operation by the mid-1670s. Expansion The regime set out in the 1559 Act lasted into the 18th century. Seventy-four English towns were eventually designated as ports and authorised Legal Quays were established within them. However, this system proved too limited to cope with the demand in the Port of London and further wharves, known as \\"public sufferance wharves\\", were established under an Act of 1786. Most were located on the south bank of the Thames. They were used to land low-duty goods, but with no expansion in the list of ports or Legal Quays, or increases to the size of the quays themselves, quay space was constantly in short supply and was not remotely adequate for the demands of increasing levels of trade. By way of illustration, by 1800 around 1,775 vessels had to moor in a space with capacity for only 545. The legal quays had not added any more frontage since 1666 and warehouse space was very limited. Congestion and delays were constant and chronic, with most vessels forced to unload while moored in the river rather than being able to moor alongside a quay. The long delays and lack of security led to widespread problems with theft and pilferage. The issue was eventually addressed with the construction of enclosed docks to the east of the City, notably on the Isle of Dogs and in Wapping, Blackwall and Rotherhithe, each with their own Legal Quays and secure bonded warehouses. The Customs Consolidation Act 1853 allowed Legal Quays and bonded warehouses to be built outside the docks, and by 1866, nearly 120 riverside wharves had obtained these privileges.

Grady. Morrison presented the plan to the British Parliament on 31 July 1946.Hansard PALESTINE, HC Deb 31 July 1946 vol 426 cc957-1075 In the United States, President Truman's initial support for the plan changed after American Zionist lobbying against it before the November mid-term elections. The pressure from American Zionists resulted in President Truman rejecting the plan, despite it having been proposed by Truman's own appointee. The United States then had no Palestine policy. The plan became the point of departure for the London Conference of 1946‚Äì47, convened by the British on 1 October 1946. Details of the Plan Proposals for the Future of Palestine ‚Äì July 1946 ‚Äì February 1947, Cmd 7044 Under the terms of the plan, Jewish and Arab provinces would exercise self-rule under British oversight, while Jerusalem and the Negev would remain under direct British control. Reaction The Arab states discussed the plan with the British at the London Conference of 1946‚Äì47; they rejected the plan on the grounds that it would lead to partition, and instead proposed an independent unitary state. The Jews refused to attend the conference, having rejected the provisional autonomy plan at a separate Zionist conference. They made attendance conditioned on having their detained leaders released to represent them at the table (which the British did not permit). At a later meeting of the Conference the following February, Britain proposed a plan, known as the Bevin Plan, for a five-year British trusteeship. The trusteeship was to lead to a permanent settlement agreed by all parties. When both the Arab and Jewish sides rejected the plan, Britain decided to refer the problem to the United Nations. It set up the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. Negev settlement In response to the plan, the Jewish Agency decided to settle the Negev desert, in a scheme known as 11 points in the Negev. References Bibliography * H.

Early life Foley was born in Charters Towers to Andrew Foley and his wife Margaret (n√©e McKeegan). He was educated at Charters Towers State School and later studied at night school. After he left school Foley held various jobs before becoming a contractor, supplying timber sleepers to the railways. By 1919 he had become an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union.Foley, Thomas Andrew (Tom) (1886‚Äì1973) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 1 March 2015. Politics Foley entered state politics in 1919. During the next 41 years he held the seats of Leichhardt from 1919 till 1932, Normanby from 1932 till 1950, and Belyando from 1950 till 1960. He stood for the seat of Barcoo at the 1960 election but was defeated. During his time in parliament he held the roles of Secretary for Mines, Health and Home Affairs, Public Lands and Irrigation, and Labour and Industry. Foley also held the role as Government Whip from 1932 till 1936. His time in politics was highlighted by several controversies. In 1946, Foley was charged after illicit tobacco was found in his garage. The magistrate dismissed the charge however two other men, one of them being Foley's brother- in-law, were found guilty of possession of the contraband. After this affair Foley was given the nickname \\"Fine Cut\\" Foley. In that same year, he was involved in a fist fight with Frank Barnes in the member's dining room. Foley apologised to parliament for his actions but Barnes refused to do so and was suspended from the house. As Secretary for Public Lands, he introduced legislation for closer-land and war-service settlement. In 1956, both allegations of maladministration and claims of corruption regarding graziers being forced to pay bribes to secure lease renewals were made in both state and federal parliament, and the state government instituted the Royal Commission on Land Leases to investigate the issues. After initial hearings resulted in an interim report critical of Foley, the commission was suspended, Foley stepped aside as Minister for Lands, and criminal charges were instigated against Foley, which resulted in an acquittal and Foley's reinstatement. However, the Royal Commission was then reopened and handed down a verdict that Foley was guilty of corrupt conduct for soliciting bribes, resulting in his final resignation as minister. After his resignation from the ministry his wife was found unconscious on the bedroom floor of their home and died the next day. It was suggested that she had heard of his resignation on the radio and the shock of this news caused her to suffer a stroke. Foley was subsequently expelled from the Labor Party in October 1956. After the 1957 Labor split, Foley was accepted into the newly formed Queensland Labor Party. He managed to hold his seat at that year's state elections but the electorate was abolished before the 1960 election and, standing for Barcoo, was defeated. Personal life Foley married Christina Madeline Pianta at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Capella in 1920 and they had three children. After politics he retired to Coochiemudlo Island where he became a pawpaw farmer. He died at South Brisbane in 1973 and was buried in Nudgee Cemetery.

There, however, Princess Leutogi found herself to be held in low esteem by the people of Tonga; when she discovered a wounded baby bat, Leutogi took pity on him and nursed him back to health herself until it could be returned to its family colony. Leutogi was ridiculed by the more warlike Tongans for this, and for all of her acts of kindness. But the baby bat's family did not forget her kindness to them; when the king's family fell into misfortune, Princess Leutogi was used as a scapegoat and sentenced to die by fire, accused as a witch. As the flames surrounded her, thousands of bats filled the sky and urinated down on the pyre and the crowd, extinguishing the flames and saving Princess Leutogi's life. The Tongans then exiled Princess Leutogi to a barren and deserted island, expecting her to soon starve to death. Princess Leutogi, however, survived there happily for many years, thanks to the bats, who kept her constant company, brought her plenty of fresh fruits, berries, nuts, and seeds for food (and anything else she needed). Eventually, they had colonized the island and its many caves, and made the island fertile again. In time, Princess Leutogi became a goddess and protector of the bats and fertility, and was worshiped by her native Samoans.

She discontinued her acting career and began performing \\"kosher comedy\\" to women-only audiences after becoming a baalas teshuva (embracing Orthodox Judaism) in the early 2000s. In 2003 she moved to Jerusalem. She performs both in Israel and internationally. Biography Born Ayelet Ben Hur, she grew up in a secular Jewish family in Long Island, New York. After high school, she moved to Los Angeles to audition for roles in TV and film. Among her acting credits are an HBO series, a Lifetime TV movie, and a bit part in the 2003 film The Hebrew Hammer. She also performed stand-up routines on Comedy Central and at the New York Comedy Club and The Improv. Her career took a 180-degree turn when she began attending Torah classes at the Los Angeles branch of Aish HaTorah, an Orthodox Jewish outreach organization. As she embraced a Torah-observant lifestyle, she quit acting and began performing what she calls \\"kosher comedy\\" - stand-up routines that are devoid of off-color humor, vulgar references, cursing, and personal attacks, but that instead focus on the humor in daily life. She also stopped performing in front of men, but plays to female audiences exclusively. Her hour-long show for Orthodox women and seminary girls includes stand-up routines on topics such as modesty, dating, dieting, kosher laws, Jewish prayer, motherhood, and malapropisms in Hebrew. While most of the show is rehearsed, Ayelet does some improvisation. Her signature routine is a pre-flight safety briefing on the fictional \\"Glatt Kosher Airlines\\", in which passengers receive emergency instructions such as: \\"Should there be, God forbid, a rapid change in cabin pressure, a book of psalms will fall from the panel above your head\\". \\"Please say your own tehillim [psalms] prior to assisting the small child, elderly passenger or recent baal teshuvah seated next to you\\". She has produced the comic audio CDs It's a Frum Frum Life and Life in Israel. Personal Since she started her comedy career in the Orthodox Jewish world as a single woman, Ayelet was reluctant to reveal her age to media sources lest it limit her marriage opportunities. She has since married a full-time kollel student and is the mother of four.

She is best known as the lead guitarist for Dead Sara, a band she founded with Emily Armstrong in 2005. Early years Medley was born in Los Angeles to Stan Medley and Sandra Sherman. Medley was raised by her father after her parents separated. Medley's interest in music began at age 9 when she started practicing on a Fender Telecaster owned by her nanny, Dexy Valentine of the band Magic Wands. She then used two years‚Äô worth of saved allowances to purchase her own guitar, a Fender Squier, at age 11. Medley started acting at age 12 when she won a part in an international commercial. The commercial played mostly in Europe and Medley became a SAG actress as a result. She was pursuing an acting career until she met Emily Armstrong in 2002 and the two began writing songs together. Dead Sara Medley and Armstrong first performed live in March 2005 at The Mint nightclub in Los Angeles, under the name Epiphany. Later that year they changed their band's name to Dead Sara as a reference to the Fleetwood Mac song \\"Sara\\" and its lyric ‚Äú...said Sara‚Äù, sometimes heard as \\"dead Sara\\". Armstrong and Medley have cited Stevie Nicks, who wrote \\"Sara\\", as a primary influence. Around this time, Medley began styling her first name as \\"Siouxsie\\", as a nod to the Sioux Indians tribe and the Native American heritage of one of her great- grandparents (rather than a reference to the musical artist Siouxsie Sioux). Dead Sara has since released two full-length albums and several EPs, most recently Temporary Things Taking Up Space in 2018.  Accolades  In 2012, Medley was the only woman among the 10 finalists for the Loudwire rock guitarist of the year award.

Later in 1839, he once again served as paymaster general under Albert Sidney Johnston and in 1843 was quartermaster of the army and an assistant inspector general of the republic. Snively Expedition In January 1843 Snively proposed an operation to intercept a train of Mexican traders who would be returning from Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail by way of Texas territory and to seize their goods. This was to be in retaliation for the Mexican raids on San Antonio in 1842 and for the mistreatment of Texas prisoners captured in the Mier Expedition and on the Texan Santa Fe Expedition. Snively was given authorization on February 16, 1843, but instructed not to violate the sovereignty of the United States. He was to raise and command a detachment of partisans not officially connected to Texas. Leaving on April 24, this 170-man strong Battalion of Invincibles fought and defeated a detachment of 100 Mexican soldiers on the Arkansas River on June 20. However, on July 15, they were in turn surrounded and disarmed by a detachment of the U. S. Dragoons under the command of Captain Philip St. George Cooke for intruding into U. S. territory and killing a Mexican citizen. Many of the expedition left for Texas or for Missouri with the Dragoons. The remainder, less than 70, did continue and intercepted the train of goods they were after, but guarded by a strong force of Mexican soldiers under Governor Manuel Armijo, in their weakened condition it was too strong to attack and they returned to Texas.H.

California, New Mexico, and Arizona Territory Ruins of the Jack Swilling residence During the California Gold Rush in 1849, Snively left his interests in Corpus Christi with his brother David and crossed northern Mexico, then sailed to the California gold fields from Mazatl√°n. After spending nine years searching for gold there, he moved to New Mexico Territory in 1858. There he led a group that discovered gold placers on the Gila River twenty miles east of Fort Yuma. The resulting gold rush created the short-lived boomtown of Gila City. Snively subsequently was involved in the discovery of the silver-lead ore of the Castle Dome silver mine in the Castle Dome Mountains to the north of Gila City. With Hermann V. Ehrenberg he created the Castle Dome mining district in spring of 1863. That same year, after the first territorial election in for the newly organized Arizona Territory, its Governor John Noble Goodwin appointed Snively a judge. From 1866 Snively's affairs prospered with the success of the Castle Dome mine and as he made and lost small fortunes in New Mexico and Nevada ventures. Death On March 27, 1871, Snively was with a group that left from his home, in what is now Phoenix, to prospect in the direction of Wickenburg, Arizona, when his group was attacked by an estimated 150 Apache at the White Picacho. Snively, mortally wounded, was abandoned by his companions. Later found in the arroyo where it fell, his badly decomposed and partially devoured body was buried nearby. Seven years later his friend and fellow Arizona pioneer Jack Swilling and two friends recovered his remains from its remote grave and reburied them behind the Swilling house in what is now Black Canyon City near the Wells Fargo stage stop and ore mill settlement.

Michigan borders four of the five Great Lakes and is a signatory to the Great Lakes Compact. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is responsible for the management of Michigan's water resources. Sources of water =Groundwater= The state is divided into 12 hydrologic provinces based on geology, aquifer recharge rates and water quality. Bedrock aquifers provide potable water in five provinces. Glacial-deposit aquifers provide potable water in three provinces. Four provinces have a problem with low water quantity or quality. =Surface water= Runoff from rain and snow melt provide the water for rivers and creeks. The water then flows into the Great Lakes. Uses of water SS Arthur M. Anderson =Commercial= The Great Lakes are used to ship iron ore, coal, limestone, and cement to and/or from ports in Michigan. Energy generation is a large user of water. From damming rivers to generate electricity, to power plant cooling, to the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant. Irrigation and industrial uses also account for water usage. Bottled water such as Nestl√© Ice Mountain brand is extracted and bottled in Michigan. =Municipal= Municipal water systems withdraw water from surface water of the Great Lakes and ground water aquifers. =Recreational= Michigan has almost 1,200 public and private beaches on lakes and rivers. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources operates six fish hatcheries and stocks game fish in many lakes and rivers. The state has over 1,300 boating access sites and over 80 harbors and marinas operated by various government entities. Protected areas Michigan owns all rivers and lakes not surrounded by a sole owner. It has regulations governing structure placement and remedial actions such as chemical treatments to remove plants. Michigan is home to three wetland habitat National Wildlife Refuges: Seney, Shiawassee, Detroit River International. Michigan has 16 Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers and 16 State Natural Rivers. Three rivers are on both lists: Au Sable, Pere Marquette, Pine. Wetlands, commonly known as bogs, swamps, or marshes, are protected. Michigan requires a permit to disturb a wetland and requires mitigation if a wetland will be destroyed. Mitigation requires the creation of a new wetland of 1.5 times or more the size of the destroyed wetland depending on the importance of the wetland. Michigan has 13 Underwater Preserves to protect shipwrecks and natural features. Flora and fauna =Endangered species= The following clams found in Michigan are listed as endangered: clubshell pearly mussel, northern riffleshell, Snuffbox mussel. Round goby =Invasive species= The Great Lakes have been impaired by invasive species such as the sea lamprey, zebra mussel, quagga mussel, alewife, round goby, and Eurasian milfoil. Asian carp are a threat to enter the Great Lakes. The opening of the Welland Canal allowed the sea lamprey and alewife to bypass the natural barrier of Niagara Falls. Quagga, zebra mussels, and round gobies arrived in the ballast water of ocean-going ships that originated in Europe and Asia and discharged the water in the Great Lakes. Eurasian milfoil was intentionally introduced as an aquatic ornamental plant. Pollution Michigan has banned phosphorus in detergents and lawn fertilizers due to it causing algae growth. Pharmaceuticals have been detected in Great Lakes water tests. The effects on wildlife are in the early stages of study. Endocrine disruptors have been linked to altered reproductive organs in fish. Some municipalities in Michigan have a combined sewer for both sewage and storm water. Heavy rains can overwhelm sewage treatment plants and allow partially treated or diluted sewage to enter waterways. The state has schedules with these municipalities to eliminate or mitigate the overflows. , the Michigan legislature is considering legislation to ban the sale of products containing microbeads. The beads have been detected in the aquatic food chain because they look like food to animals. In July 2010, an oil pipeline burst resulting in the Kalamazoo River oil spill. The Tittabawassee River, Saginaw River, and Saginaw Bay have been designated a Superfund site by the EPA due to dioxin contamination from a Dow Chemical Company plant.

It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. Historically, it was a stagecoach station, and then a settlement formed around an ore mill serving the Tip Top Mine, on the Agua Fria River in Yavapai County in what was then Arizona Territory. It was named for the mining developer of the Tip Top Mine, Dan B. Gillett and is spelled incorrectly as Gillette on U. S. Topographic Maps and elsewhere.John and Lillian Theobald, Arizona Territory Post Offices & Postmasters, The Arizona Historical Foundation, Phoenix, 1961 History Gillett was founded by the superintendent of the Tip Top Mine, where he located the mill to process the ore from Tip Top, nine miles away.Gillett, Arizona, Arizona Pioneer & Cemetery Research Project from apcrp.org website accessed February 28, 2015] Its post office opened October 15, 1878. At its height in 1878 Gillett, had six streets and aside from its mill and post office, a bank, assay office, hotel, real estate office, livery stable, lumberyard, meat market, truck farm, dairy, warehouse, two blacksmiths, two stagecoach stations, four stores and nine saloons/gambling houses. Jack Swilling Jack Swilling, the founder of Phoenix, and his wife Trinidad Swilling had various business interests in Gillett. The Swillings owned the \\"Gillett Real Estate\\" where they sold lots ranging from $100 to $250 depending on the location, a cattle and horse ranch and a vegetable farm in partnership with L.A. Stephens.Gillett, Arizona In the spring of 1878, word reached the Swillings that Colonel Jacob Snively, a family friend, had been killed by the Apaches in the Wickenburg Mountains near the peak called White Picacho. Mrs. Swilling suggested that Mr. Swilling and two companions, which included Andrew Kirby and George Monroe, founder of Castle Hot Springs, go on a trip to recover and rebury the remains of their old friend. On April 17, Mr. Swilling and his two companions went on their Snively exhumation trip. Mr. Swilling and his companions returned to Gillett after exhuming Col. Snively's remains at White Picacho Mountains on April 23. He was seen walking the streets of Gillett with a bag or sack containing the remains of Col. Snively. Mr. Swilling buried the bones of Col. Snively on his property next to his house. Jack Swilling Three hooded men, one tall, one medium-size, and one short, robbed a stagecoach near Wickenburg. Six men, including the driver, were shot and killed. Among them was Frederick Wadsworth Loring, a young writer from Boston who had been sent as a correspondent for Appleton's Journal. The incident became known as the Wickenburg Massacre. On one occasion Mr. Swilling and his friends were in a saloon in Gillett discussing the incident and the description of the murderers, Mr. Swilling jokingly mentioned that he and his friends matched the description. Thus, Mr. Swilling and his companions became suspects in the robbery. Pima County Sheriff Wiley W. Standefer arrested Mr. Swilling and Andrew Kirby. They were eventually turned over to Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph W. Evans so that the state could charge them in the federal courts. Evans escorted them to the federal jail in Yuma. Prior to his arrest Mr. Swilling had developed a habit of using a combination of narcotics and liquor to relieve the pain caused by old injuries, thus he was not very healthy. The sanitary conditions inside the prison at Yuma were terrible and combined with the August heat, aggravated Mr. Swilling's chronic ill health. He died in his cell on August 12 while awaiting a hearing. The real culprits of the massacre were caught proving his innocence too late. Mr. Swilling was buried in an unmarked grave on the grounds of the Federal prison Cemetery before his family could be notified. Gillett treasure Sheriff Henry Garfias Among the tales of lawlessness in Gillett is that of Henry Seymour. Seymour was the town's blacksmith who engaged in robbing the Wells Fargo stage coach before it reached the town. In 1882, alone he held up three coaches and no one suspected Seymour because he would already be in his shop before the arrival of the stage coach. The robber, whose total amount in the three robberies added up to $68,000, became known as the \\"Ghost Bandit\\". The Ghost Bandit Normally, Seymour hid his loot after a robbery, however suspicions as to his activities as an outlaw came about when in one occasion he used some of the money from a robbery in a local saloon's poker game. Maricopa County Sheriff Lindley Orme sent deputy Henry Garfias to investigate the situation. During his investigation Garfias was told by witnesses that on the day of the last robbery they spotted Henry Seymour, the blacksmith, with a rifle under his arm along with several gunny sacks. Garfias suspected that Seymour was the Ghost Bandit and decided to set a trap. As soon as he found out that the next stagecoach was about to arrive in Gillett, Garfias hid close to the Agua Fria crossing and waited. As soon as he spotted Seymour, who was armed with a rifle, Garfias arrested him. Thus, Seymour, the \\"Ghost Bandit\\", was finally caught when he attempted to rob his fourth stage coach that year. He was tried in Maricopa County and sent to prison. Seymour never told anyone where he hid his treasure and when he was released from prison he never returned to Gillett. Henry Garfias later become the first marshal of Phoenix. Legends of Arizona The decline of Gillett After the mill was closed in 1880, and moved to Tip Top in 1884, the town was soon abandoned. Its post office had postmasters appointed up to October 1883, but it was discontinued in August 1887. What remained was a store and a stagecoach station and a population of two. The stagecoach station was within the Black Canyon wagon road and stage route. The portion of the trail around Gillett and south of Prescott was surrounded by boulders and scrub. This portion made it easy for stagecoach robbers to hide and ambush stagecoaches, making the trail a dangerous one to travel on. This resulted in the Wells Fargo Express Company halt of shipments over the route.Trips into history The stagecoach station remained opened until 1912 when it also was abandoned. The Burfind Hotel was the largest structure in Gillett and ruins of it and a neglected cemetery remain. Currently, it is still designated as a populated place as per the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Census Bureau. Tourist and locals in Arizona can visit Gillett by taking Interstate 17 (I-17) North and exiting at Table Mesa Road. Take West Table Mesa Road, cross the shadow Agua Fria River and continue to drive for approximately 0.3 miles to Gillett. The exact coordinates are: N 34* 01' 07.5\\" W 112* 09' 49.3\\".

The San Luis Closed Basin is a 2,940-square-mile endorheic basin in the Alamosa and Saguache counties of south-central Colorado. It includes San Luis Creek and its tributary, Saguache Creek. While the basin is east of the majority of the Rocky Mountains, it lies west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. An elevated plateau in Alamosa County, the San Luis Hills, separates the San Luis Closed Basin drainage from most of the San Luis Valley, which is southward-flowing and drains through the Rio Grande. Hydrology The San Luis Closed Basin forms a major segment of the eastern slope of the Colorado section of the Continental Divide. Historically, all of the waters that naturally entered the basin through hydrologic processes were disposed of by evapotranspiration, of which the endpoint was a playa adjacent to the Great Sand Dunes. Starting in the 1970s, part of the water that had previously flowed toward the playa was diverted to the Rio Grande drainage through a canal constructed in the 1970s as part of the Closed Basin Project. As part of the Project, part of the former playa was redeveloped as an intermittent recreational lake, San Luis Lake. Some of the water from the Basin continues to be allocated to San Luis Lake for recreational purposes. The hydrology of the Closed Basin is currently maintained on a 24/7 basis by the Rio Grande Water Conservation District. Ecology The San Luis Closed Basin is disturbed semiarid land characterized by widespread patches of greasewood, often locally called \\"chico\\" or \\"chico brush.\\" It forms part of the breeding area of the southwestern willow flycatcher, a United States endangered subspecies.

He was twice declared a Hero of the Soviet Union before his death in a training flight on 17 May 1945. Early life Golubev was born on to a Russian family in Petrograd. His family moved to Uglich in 1918, where he remained until completing his initial schooling in 1932. He then went to a trade school in his home town, where he held several jobs as a mechanic before graduating from the aeroclub in 1936. In October he joined the military, where he worked as a mechanic the 7th NKVD Aviation Detachment. After graduating from the Kharkov Military School of Border and Internal Troops in September 1939, he went on to study at the Engels Military Aviation School. Upon graduating from Engels in October 1940 he was assigned to the 209th Bomber Aviation Regiment. World War II Upon the start of Operation Barbarossa, Golubev entered combat as part of the defense of the Western Front. He flew seven sorties on the Su-2 before he was injured and sent to the rear of the front to retrain to fly the Il-2. During one of his missions with the 209th Bomber Regiment, on 26 July 1941, his gunner was killed when the plane was shot down by the enemy, but Golubev survived with injuries to his leg and neck. Having managed to land on safe territory, he was taken to a medical battalion and treated for his injuries, but when he returned to his unit a few days later it turned out that the commander of his regiment had already sent a death notice to his family, believing him to be dead. He was soon sent to Voronezh to be retrained to fly the Ilyushin Il-2. After completing training he was appointed as a flight commander in the 285th Attack Aviation Regiment. On 15 May 1942 he was first nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having flown 100 sorties on the Il-2; the title was awarded on 12 August, after he had been sent to retrain to fly the two-seater Il-2. On 10 September he returned to the front to fight in the Battle of Stalingrad. During the battle he missions attacking enemy warehouses, tanks, vehicles, and weapons; he sometimes made as many as four sorties per day. In January 1943 he took out six transport aircraft on the ground over a period of five days. That month he flew in an attack that was personally ordered by Major General Sergey Rudenko. In February the 285th Regiment was honored with the guards designation and renamed as the 58th Guards Attack Aviation Regiment. The unit was one of the first to become equipped with the PTAB, a anti-tank bomb; the new bomb was more effective in penetrating the armor of German tanks; Golubev became one of the first pilots to drop the new bomb on a tank column in the Battle of Kursk. For his actions in that battle as squadron commander and for flying an additional 148 sorties on the Il-2 after his first nomination he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union again on 24 August 1943. While he was assigned to combat he flew on the Western, Central, Don, Southwest, and Byelorussian fronts in the battles for Kharkov, Rostov, Kursk, Oryol, Stalingrad, Pripyat, and other cities. In total he flew 150 sorties on the Il-2 and shot down three enemy aircraft in addition to damaging a large amount of enemy equipment on the ground. In November 1943 he was sent to attend the Air Force Academy in Monino, where died during a crash of a practice flight in an Il-2 on 17 May 1945 and was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery.

This type of surveying method is called a towboard survey, towed- diver survey,https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/cred-towed-diver-benthic- characterization-survey-at-niihau-main-hawaiian-islands-in-2010 and the manta tow technique, the latter named after the Manta Board, an oval towboard marketed for recreational use.http://www.unesco.org/csi/pub/source/rs12b.htmhttp://www.aims.gov.au/334 A variant is the SAM or \\"Single-armed Manta-board\\". This consists of a small board with a strap to secure and tow the diver by the forearm. This frees the other arm, allowing the diver to take notes on a pad held by the towing arm. The use of a towboard is considered safe for NOAA reef surveys by trained divers at depths where no decompression stops are required (down to approximately 90 feet). Towboards may be equipped with sensors to record the temperature and depth every few seconds and the tow vessel may have a GPS to record position. Position of the diver is approximate and must be calculated from the boat position, heading and towline length.

He went on to become a Colonel-General of Aviation in the Soviet Air Forces.  Early life  Gulayev was born on 26 February 1918 to a working-class Russian family in Aksai village. After completing secondary school in 1934, he attended a vocational school until 1935 and then worked at an enamel factory in Rostov while training at a local aeroclub. He left his factory job to join the military in December 1938 after completing training at the aeroclub.  World War II  Two years after joining the military Gulayev graduated from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School and was assigned to a fighter aviation regiment in the Belorussian Military District. He was sent to the front in June 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union as part of the 162nd Fighter Aviation Regiment on the Western Front, but did not begin flying combat missions until August 1942. From July to September 1941 he underwent retraining in Kuznetsk as part of the 13th Reserve Fighter Aviation Regiment. After completing training he was assigned to the 423rd Fighter Aviation Defense Regiment where he served from April to August 1942 until he was reassigned as commander of the 487th Fighter Aviation Defense Regiment. Despite holding the position of regimental commander he flew missions on MiG-3 and Yak-7B aircraft to provide air cover to strategically important areas of Gorky and Voronezh. On 3 August he scored his first aerial victory when he shot down a Heinkel He 111 at night. He did not receive permission to takeoff from his superior and was reprimanded for making the departure but especially given his lack of training in flying at night but was later praised for the successful shootdown of an approaching enemy aircraft. In January 1943 he completed navigator's courses from the 3rd Reserve Aviation Brigade based in Saratov and was sent to the 27th Fighter Aviation Regiment as deputy regimental commander. In addition to serving as deputy regimental commander he served as a navigator and squadron commander on missions; the unit later received the Guards designation and was renamed the 129th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in October 1943. He distinguished himself in battles over the Voronezh and Steppe fronts and in the battles of Kursk, the Dnieper, Kirovograd, Korsun Shevchenko, Umansko-Botoshanskoy, and Lvov-Sandomir. On 14 May 1943 he rammed a Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber with his Yak-1 over Gostishchevo, Belgorod and bailed out with his parachute after running out of ammunition taking out two other German planes. In June he made his first flight on a Bell P-39 Airacobra; in early July he led a formation of four fighters in an attack on a numerically superior enemy formation of roughly 100 aircraft. All four of his squadron's aircraft safely landed after shooting down enemy four bombers and two fighters, disrupting the formation. That same day his formation made more combat missions and collectively shot down 16 enemy aircraft. For his heroism in aerial combat and his first 95 sorties he was awarded his first Hero of the Soviet Union gold star on 28 September 1943 by decree of the Supreme Soviet. In early 1944 he served as squadron commander of a group of six Bell P-39 Airacobras and led them in an attack on a formation of 27 bombers led by eight fighters. Within the span of four minutes the group shot down eleven enemy aircraft, five of which were shot down by Gulayev himself, making him an ace-in-a day. On three other occasions other he personally shot down four planes over the course of a single day. After an aerial engagement on 31 May 1944 he sustained a serious wound to his right hand that required surgery, but managed to lead his squadron back to the airfield just before passing out. On 1 July 1944 he received his second gold star for his service. After recovering in the hospital he went back to flying combat missions in August and scored three more victories, but was soon recalled from the front lines to attend the Air Force Academy like many other flying aces from the war. In total he made 200 combat sorties and fought in 69 aerial engagements, scoring 55 individual and five shared aerial victories in the process, giving him one of the highest kill ratios of any allied ace in the war.  Postwar life  After the war Gulayev graduated from the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy in 1950 and then went on to hold various leadership positions in the Soviet Air Forces. In 1960 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff and was appointed as commander of the 15th Air Defense Division in Lipetsk, where he served until he was transferred to the 2nd Air Defense Corps in the Tver oblast. He rose through the ranks and held multiple commands before reaching the rank of Colonel-General in 1972. In 1974 he became the deputy commander-in-chief of the combat training division of the Air Defense Forces and in 1976 went on to become the assistant commander of the armament division Moscow Air Defense District, a position he held until he retired from the military in 1979. He passed away on 27 September 1985 in Moscow and was buried in the Kuntsevo Cemetery.

Born in Clarksville, the county seat of Tennessee's Montgomery County, Peters was eight when his family moved to Leighton, now in Colbert County, Alabama in 1819. He briefly attended LaGrange College (located on the top of the LaGrange Mountain in Leighton, Alabama, which is now a famous historical site) and graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor's degree in 1834 and a master's degree in 1836; being admitted to practice law that same year. He practiced for several years in partnership with David G. Ligon.James Edmonds Saunders, Elizabeth Saunders Blair Stubbs, Early Settlers of Alabama - Part 1 (1899), p. 221-22. He served in the Alabama House of Representatives (1845‚Äì1846) and the Alabama Senate (1847‚Äì1848). He was elected to represent Lawrence County, Alabama as by that time he had moved to Moulton, Alabama. Even though he owned slaves prior to the American Civil War, he was a steadfast Unionist and left Alabama during the war. Peters considered the Confederates traitors and even wanted to hang Jefferson Davis and \\"all his traitorous set\\". Despite this, Peters, a Republican, was elected to the Alabama Supreme Court in 1868 and became the Chief Justice in 1873. He was defeated for reelection in 1874, likely because he supported equal rights for women and African Americans. He returned to his law practice in Moulton and worked there until his death. He was inducted into the Alabama Lawyers' Hall of Fame in 2006. German-American botanist Charles Mohr praised Peters' botany work, writing in the book Plant Life of Alabama: \\"In his love for botany [Thomas Minott Peters] found recreation from his professional duties, and his greatest enjoyment was to wander through the adjacent mountains in search of plants. The study of lichens and fungi attracted him particularly, and he was one of the few mycologists working in the Southern field along with Curtis and Ravenel.\\" The rare fern Trichomanes petersii (A.Gray 1853) was discovered by and is the namesake of Peters. He also did notable work with the genus Carex. He left his personal herbarium to the University of Alabama. Peters married Naomi Sophia Leetch (20 September 1820 ‚Äì 18 June 1880), who was from Moulton. They had six children. Peters died June 14, 1888 in Moulton and is buried in Moulton Cemetery, as are his family.

It affects children more often than adults. The first radiological description of the condition is credited to Feilchenfeld in 1896; however, the first histological description was given by Rankin in 1886. The Swedish botanist and fysician Carl von Linne was the first to mention the condition by the name \\"spina ventosa\\" 1746 in his \\"V√§stg√∂ta resa\\" . Multiple bones are involved in children and usually only a single bone is involved in adults suffering from tuberculous dactylitis. Tuberculous dactylitis affects the short tubular bones of the hands and feet in children. It often follows a mild course without fever and acute inflammatory signs as opposed to acute osteomyelitis. There may be a gap of a few months to 2 to 3 years from the time of initial infection to the point of diagnosis. Spina ventosa is the term given for tuberculous dactylitis. Reviewed in Nearly 85% of the patients of spina ventosa are below 6 years of age.The bones of hands are more commonly involved than those of the feet. Proximal phalanx of the index and middle fingers are the commonest sites of involvement.Up to nearly 7% of children with pulmonary tuberculosis may develop this condition. Spread to the skeletal system is believed to occur via blood and lymphatics.  Pathogenesis  In the pediatric age group, the marrow in the phalangeal bones are still active, a conducive place for the tuberculous bacilli to multiply. Slowly, the whole marrow space gets involved and this underlying granulomatous disease leads to expansion of the overlying soft cortex. Finally there is a fusiform dilation of the bone, with thinned out cortex and destruction of the marrow space leading to a balloon like shape; this cystic type of expansion of the bone is termed as spina ventosa.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of the condition is made on the basis of histological and bacteriological studies. Tuberculosis dactylitis may be confused with conditions like osteomyelitis, gout, sarcoidosis and tumors.

Early life Denisov was born on to a Ukrainian family in Rossosh, Russian Empire. After completing his fourth grade of schooling in 1921 he went on to attend trade school, and in 1926 he completed his third grade of trade school, after which he worked as a mechanic until joining the military in 1929. Military Career Having entered the military in October 1929, he was based in Gomel until being transferred to the 83rd Training Squadron in Smolensk, which soon became a flight school. There he studied with future twice Hero of the Soviet Union Stepan Suprun before graduating in July 1931; he became a member of the communist party in 1930. He then spent just a few months in the 9th Aviation Squadron before switching to the 33rd Aviation Squadron, where he rose through the ranks to flight commander; there he flew the I-4 and I-5, but when made commander of the 41st Squadron in May 1934 he switched to the I-16. = Spanish Civil War = Not long after the outbreak of the civil war in Spain between the Republicans and the Nationalists, Denisov volunteered to go to Spain as part of the group of Soviet volunteers assisting the Spanish Republican Air Force. He was deployed in Spain from November 1936 to April 1937, during which he flew on the I-16 fighter and gained multiple aerial victories; his exact tally of aerial victories in Spain is somewhere around 2-3 solo victories and 3-4 shared victories. For his actions in the conflict he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 4 July 1937, although his participation in the war was not publicly acknowledged since the Soviet role in the war was classified. = Khalkhin Gol = Upon returning from Spain he was made commander of the 142nd Fighter Aviation Brigade, which he remained in command of until April 1939. He then began attending command improvement courses at the Military Academy of General Staff. He was then tasked with studying and correcting the reasons for unsatisfactory performance of the 57th Separate Corps in the battles against the Japanese. In late May he arrived in Mongolia, where he was stationed at the headquarters of the 1st Army. When he returned from Mongolia, he spoke with Mikhail Kaganovich, Nikolai Polikarpov, Alexander Yakovlev, and Stalin about the design of Soviet fighters. = Winter war = Less than a year after returning from Mongolia, Denisov began his role in the Winter War as the commander of the 7th Air Army, which managed to break through the Mannerheim Line. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 21 March 1940 for his command in the war. That year he was promoted to General-lieutenant of Aviation. = World War II = Shortly before the start of Operation Barbarossa, he was made commander of aviation in the Transcaucasian Military District in April 1940, but was demoted just two days before the start of the invasion due to alcoholism. Many of his colleagues from Spain, Khalkhin Gol and Finland, including Pavel Rychagov, Yakov Smushkevich, and Ivan Proskurov, were arrested on fabricated charges of treason shortly before the German invasion; Denisov survived the purges. After the start of the war he was made head of the Kacha Military Aviation School in August, which had been evacuated to Saratov. When the school was inspected in 1942, major problems were noted, with the final report being critical of Denisov for failure to resolve problems at the school, rarely took charge, and continued to abuse alcohol; on 4 November 1942 he was fired from the school. In February 1943 he was made commander of the 283rd Fighter Aviation Division, which took part in the battles for Kursk, Chernigov, Pripiyat, and Gomel before he was removed from the post in December due to failure to maintain discipline among his unit. After another demotion he was eventually posted to the 4th Tactical Training Division as an assistant chief until October 1946. Having graduated from the Military Academy of General Staff in September 1947, he soon entered the reserve in November.  Civilian life  After leaving the military he began working as the head of a test flight station at an aircraft factory in 1948, and in 1951 he headed the test station at a Mil-Mi factory. He learned to fly the Mi-1 before leaving the institution in 1953. Starting in 1955 he headed a branch of a school for training engineers in Moscow. The school was turned into an independent institution in 1957, but he left it in December 1958. In July 1964 he started work, where he managed a laboratory at the All-Union chamber of commerce. He died on 6 June 1971 and was buried in the Novodevichy cemetery.

The lyrics and rhythm also differ, most obviously on \\"The Mad Hatter's Song\\" and \\"Blues for the Muse\\". The demos were mainly solo efforts by Heron and Williamson as their contributions were relative to whoever composed the track. Of the seven tracks that do not appear on the second album, \\"Iron Stone\\" is the only one to appear on any studio album by the band. The demo of \\"Iron Stone\\" is the first take and lacks the last instrumental section, but includes lyrics not on the album version. Two tracks, \\"God Dog\\" and \\"Lover Man\\", were not released by the band, but were later covered by other artists. \\"God Dog\\", which features Dolly Collins on flute organ, was left out of 5000 Layers as it did not fit the album's style, and was later covered by Shirley Collins and Dolly Collins on their album, Anthems in Eden. \\"Lover Man\\" was considered too similar to \\"Painting Box\\", but was covered on Al Stewart's album, Bedsitter Images. The remaining four tracks were previously unreleased material not completed for any studio album. The album was released on 7 October 1997 on the Pig's Whisker label. The cover by Chris Sands is an image of Heron and Williamson outside the recording studio walls in the beginning stages of development. Liner notes offer in-depth analysis of the sessions, and the demos created. The album has been reissued several times, most notably the 2000 reissue which includes a bonus track.

It is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Description Conostylis aurea is a rhizomatous, tufted perennial, grass-like herb. It grows to a height of and a width of about . As with others in the genus, the leaves are strap-like and the flowers occur in clusters on stalks which arise from the base of the leaves. There are six tepals and six stamens, one at the base of each tepal-lobe. In his notes on his original description of the species, John Lindley noted \\"Conostylis abounds the most in species, some of which are handsome but others are mere weeds..... C. aurea is a much handsomer species....flowers of a bright golden yellow.\\" Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1840 by botanist John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (aurea) is derived from the Latin word aurum meaning \\"gold\\". Distribution The golden conostylis occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographical regions of Western Australia. It grows on white or yellow sand or gravelly loam in winter-wet situations.

Early life Yefremov was born on to a working-class Russian family in Tsaritsyn. Having finished his initial education in 1929 after completing his seventh grade of school, he went on to study at a trade school, which he graduated from in 1932. He then worked as an electrician in Stalingrad until entering the military in 1934. After graduating from the Stalingrad Military Aviation School of Pilots in November 1937 he became a pilot in the 33rd High-speed Bomber Aviation Regiment, which was later renamed to the 10th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment. There he flew several sorties on the SB bomber during the Winter War.  World War II  By the time Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Yefremov has already been promoted to flight commander. In the early days of the war, he flew on the obsolete SB bomber. Despite that, during his first sortie in June 1941, his navigator shot down an enemy fighter; however, on 10 July he was shot down over Korostyshev. Forced to bail out in parachutes, he and his crew eventually made it back to friendly territory, although the navigator was wounded. By the start of September Yefremov had flown a total of 39 sorties. During the Battle of Stalingrad he flew nearly 200 sorties, often making several in one day - resulting in the destruction of five trains, 15 cargo vehicles, 11 aircraft, and other equipment. During his bombing of a crossing on the Don river on 23 August 1942 he remained over the target area for three hours despite heavy counter-fire and persistently attacked troops that were attempting to rebuild the crossing. That night he flew three sorties. In November that year alone he flew 24 sorties and took out ten tanks and five trains in addition to other targets. On 3 February 1943, he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having flown 293 sorties; by then he was a squadron commander. The title was awarded on 1 May 1943. While flying mostly in the American-made A-20B he flew in the battles for Donbass, Melitopol, and Crimea, during which he was hit by enemy fire three times, making one emergency landing in the SB bomber and two in the A-20B. After having totaled 320 sorties he was nominated for a second gold star, becoming a double hero on 24 August 1943. By the time he left the front in fall 1944 to attend the Monino Air Force Academy he had reached a total of 350 sorties flying SB, Ar-2, and A-20 bombers, during which his crew shot down four enemy aircraft.  Postwar  After graduating from the academy in 1949 he became deputy commander of the 277th Bomber Aviation Regiment. From July 1950 to March 1953 he served as the deputy commander of the 668th Bomber Aviation Regiment, after which he became the senior flight inspector for the bomber aviation units of the 48th Air Army, but in August that year, he transferred to the 132nd Bomber Aviation Division. From January to June 1954 he returned to the 277th Regiment as deputy commander, during which he was demoted from lieutenant colonel to major. In June 1954 he began working at the 4th Center for Combat Employment, where he started out as a senior flight inspector but went on to work as a test pilot and research officer. After retiring in 1960 he was honored with lighting the eternal flame at a memorial to fallen soldiers and wrote a memoir. He died in Kiev on 19 August 1990 but was buried in Mamayev Kurgan.

Under-19 career Hossain is a right-handed batsman and off-spin bowler. He played for Bangladesh in two ICC Under-19 World Cups: in Australia in 2012 and in Abu Dhabi in 2013-14. He captained Bangladesh Under-19 in a two-match series of four-day matches against Sri Lanka Under-19 in April 2013, scoring 107 in the first match and 74 in the second. He then captained the team again in a five- match series of limited-overs matches immediately afterwards, scoring more than 200 runs, including 98 in the third match which Bangladesh win by one wicket. In England later that year, in a \\"superb all-round performance\\",Wisden 2014, p. 789-90. he scored 110 not out off 113 balls then took 3 for 38 off 10 overs in a 38-run victory over England Under-19.

The cells typically measure 0.5 by 2.0 Œºm. They appear as pleomorphic or coccoid rods. They tend to be grouped singly, or in short chains. Sometimes, they are grouped into V-shaped pairs. T. pyogenes is found in the urogenital, gastrointestinal, and upper respiratory tracts of cattle, goats, horses, musk deer, pigs, and sheep, in which it may cause abscesses, mastitis, metritis, and pneumonia. It can thrive in either anaerobic or aerobic environments, but is ideally suited to one with high (about 7%) levels of carbon dioxide. The species was originally classified as Corynebacterium pyogenes then Actinomyces pyogenes, then Arcanobacterium pyogenes, now Trueperella pyogenes. When the genus Arcanobacterium was split into two (Arcanobacterium and Trueperella gen. nov.), the new genus name was chosen in honor of the German microbiologist . The specific name pyogenes is used in various bacterial genera and was derived from the Greek word puon or Latin word pyum, and the suffix -genes, yielding pyogenes, meaning \\"pus-producing\\".

Early life Zaitsev was born on to a Russian peasant family in Semibratskoe, Moscow Governorate. His parents died before he and his younger brothers finished growing up, leaving him as the head of the family. After leaving his brothers with relatives he began looking for work, but faced challenges due to having only four years of schooling. In 1927 the Kolomna district Komsomol committee helped him get into trade school, where he developed a passion for machinery and graduated in 1929. He worked at a locomotive plant until entering the military in May 1932. After graduating from the Luhansk Military Aviation School of Pilots in December 1933 he became a pilot in the 16th Fighter Aviation Squadron. Three years later he completed flight commander training at the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School of Pilots, after which he briefly worked as a flight instructor. In November 1939 he transferred to the 42nd Fighter Aviation Regiment. Initially a pilot, there he became an assistant squadron commander, and was promoted again in January 1941 when the unit was based in Vilinus. Until later that year when they were sent for retraining on the LaGG-3 the unit was equipped with I-153 fighters, which became obsolete in World War II. World War II Starting in July 1941 Zaitsev was on the front lines of the defense of the Soviet Union against Operation Barbarossa. The squadron under his command was transferred to Colonel Zotov‚Äôs mixed aviation group later that month. During the battle for Smolensk he remained a squadron commander. However, he soon went on to be promoted to regimental navigator of the 129th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which became the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment upon receiving the guards designation in December. By the end of the war, the unit had shot down more enemy aircraft than any other regiment in the Soviet Air Forces. Zaitsev became a flying ace by September 1941, and in January 1942 he was nominated for his first gold star for having engaged in 46 dogfights and shot down 12 enemy aircraft. The tally stated by his award nomination sheet indicated he had the second-highest number shootdowns in 1941 of any Soviet pilot, with Boris Safonov being in first. In September 1942 he was promoted to commander of his regiment, and later that year they retrained to fly La-5 aircraft. Despite his senior position as regimental commander he continued to fly combat sorties, and in doing so he accumulated more aerial victories. Eventually by August 1943 he tallied nearly 300 sorties and 22 shootdowns, for which he was nominated for and later awarded his second title of hero on 24 August 1943. Over the course of time many more pilots in his regiment went on to be awarded the title, including Vitaly Popkov, who was awarded it twice. During his tenure as regimental commander he would make a point of flying in simulated dogfights with the new pilots, and was given a Yakovlev UT-2 by Air Force commander Marshal Alexander Novikov for his success. However, he was badly injured in the plane on 5 November 1943 after being forced to dodge two enemy fighters, landing upside down in a field. After remaining in a Moscow hospital for several months he returned to the front in March 1944, but as deputy commander of the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division. He left the unit in the month before the war ended to become the deputy commander of the 2nd Guards Assault Aviation Corps. During the war he flew in the battles for many major cities and strategically important areas including Smolensk, Stalingrad, Voroshilovgrad, Kharkov, Belgorod, Donbass, Dnepropetrovsk, Kursk, the Dnieper, and Dresden, accumulating over 323 sorties. The exact breakdown of his tally is unclear; British historian George Mellinger credits him with 34 solo and 19 shared, but estimates by Russian historians are lower, with Andrey Simonov and Nikolai Bodrikhin indicating his tally to have been either 19 solo or 27 solo plus one shared.  Postwar  Due to an accident on 2 October 1945 in which a truck hit the car in which he was a passenger, he suffered a badly broken leg. Despite being forced to remain in the hospital for a long time with a cast on his leg, he did not fully recover and ended up retiring with the rank of colonel in September 1946 due to the injury. He then returned to his hometown, where he headed the Kolomna aeroclub from 1947 to 1953 and was the director of the local tire factory from 1957 to 1959. He died shortly thereafter on 19 May 1961 and was buried in the local cemetery.

Draug He dramatically escaped Norway in April 1940 as crew member on the Norwegian destroyer . During the night of 9 April, Draug was patrolling and watching shipping in the Karmsund. At about 0200hrs, the ship's captain Thore Horve was notified that Oslofjord Fortress was engaging an unknown enemy force in the Oslofjord, leading to the crew being ordered to full combat stations. At 0400hrs, an unknown ship, flying no national flag, was observed sailing northwards through the Karmsund. The ship refused to stop after both flares and warning shots had been fired and Draug had to give chase and capture the vessel. After leading the unknown ship into Haugesund, its identity was found to be the 7,624 ton German vessel , with papers claiming she was carrying a cargo of 7,000 tons of coke to Bergen. When Draug s second-in-command, Lieutenant √òstervold, tried to inspect the cargo, however, he was refused by the German captain, all entrances to the cargo hold also being blocked off to make a proper search impossible. In response, the inspecting officer decided to take the ship under arrest and sealed the radio room. The cargo hidden on board Main later turned out to have consisted of provisions and mat√©riel for the invading German forces at Trondheim, chiefly some 2,000 naval mines. Lt. Cdr. Thore Horve (later vice admiral) decided to take the enemy ship as a prize and bring it to a British port. Since Draug had almost no anti-aircraft weapons to speak of, and the skies were full of enemy aircraft, the destroyer could do little good by remaining where she was. He ignored an order from Naval Command to go to the Hardangerfjord and block German naval forces from gaining access to that fjord. As Horve knew that the Naval Command headquarters in Bergen had been captured by the German invaders, he assumed that the order was false, although it later turned out it was not. When ordered to steer his ship towards Britain, the captain of Main refused, only yielding after the Norwegian warship fired several warning shots and threatened to torpedo him. To the United Kingdom After the two ships had left Haugesund at about 0900hrs on 9 April, they soon came under attack from a Luftwaffe bomber around 40 nautical miles (74 km) off the Norwegian coast. The bombs, aimed at the Main, missed but the German captain immediately scuttled his vessel and ordered his crew to abandon ship. As the order came very suddenly the evacuation was carried out with some panic, the boatswain drowning in the process. After the German sailors had boarded and lowered their life boat Draug fired eight to ten rounds into the waterline of the scuttled merchantman to ensure that she would sink. Now carrying sixty-seven German sailors along as PoWs in addition to her own crew of seventy-two, Draug sped away towards Sullom Voe in the Shetland Islands. The prisoners were kept on the open deck during the crossing. By the next morning she was met by three of the Royal Navy's Tribal-class destroyers. Two of the British ships, and , followed Draug into Sullom Voe, arriving at 1700hrs local time on 10 April, where the German PoWs were handed over to British authorities. Thereafter Draug sailed to Scapa Flow, escorted by the French destroyer Boulonnais, arriving at 1000hrs on 11 April The German prisoners from Main departed Sullom Voe for Kirkwall at 2000hrs on 10 April on the French destroyer Brestois before the French ship proceeded to Scapa Flow. After arriving in the United Kingdom, many members of Draug s crew were transferred to Royal Navy ships and would serve aboard them during the remainder of the Norwegian Campaign.

From 13 January, he flew sorties in the East Prussian Offensive. On 20 January 1945 he flew another sortie, but due to an engine problem the P-39 stalled and crashed. He never recovered from injuries sustained in the accident and Kamozin spent Victory Day in the hospital. Most 21st century estimates of his final tally credit him with 34 solo and 4 shared victories.  Postwar  In 1946, Kamozin was discharged. He returned to Bryansk and worked in civil aviation. He also conducted social work. Kamozin was made an honorary citizen of the city in 1966 and died on 24 November 1983. He was buried in a city cemetery.Memorial to Kamozin in Bryansk Awards * Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1 May 1943 and 1 July 1944) * Order of Lenin (1 May 1943) * Two Order of the Red Banner (23 March 1943 and 21 November 1943) * Order of Alexander Nevsky (31 January 1944) * Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (19 December 1942)  Legacy  A street in Bryansk is named for Kamozin.

Early life Karpov was born on to a Russian family in the village of Filenevo, located the mordern-day Ferzikovsky District. After completing his seventh grade of school in 1933 he attended trade school for two years, going on to work as a toolmaker at the Kaluga Engineering Plant from 1935 until entering the military in 1939; previously, he graduated from the local aeroclub in 1938. Upon graduating from the Kachin Military Aviation School of Pilots he was assigned to the 161st Reserve Aviation Regiment, but in January 1941 he transferred to the 20th Fighter Aviation Regiment.  World War II  Shortly after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Karpov transferred as a flight commander to the 121st Fighter Aviation Regiment, a Moscow-based air defense unit, and flew his first combat sorties in late July. However, the post was short and he was soon reassigned to the 123rd Fighter Aviation Regiment in October; a little over a year later the regiment was awarded the guards designation and renamed as the 27th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. Earlier, he had been wounded during a sortie on 15 August 1941, but he quickly recovered and the regiment relocated to Leningrad later that month. Despite being tasked with defensive, not offensive, missions, Karpov became a flying ace in August 1942, having tallied five solo shootdowns in addition to several shared in addition to quickly rising through the ranks. After shooting down a Bf-109 on 30 June 1943 he was congratulated by various high Soviet officials including Aleksandr Yakovlev, since the shootdown was credited as the thousandth Nazi plane shot down over Leningrad. He frequently flew as wingman for Iriney Belyaev, another flying ace, until they were both shot down on 8 July 1943. While Karpov survived due to his parachute, Belyaev was killed in action. He was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union For flying 370 sorties, engaging in 83 dogfights, and gaining 16 solo plus 7 shared shootdowns he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 7 August 1943, which was awarded on 28 September 1943. He was nominated for a second gold star on 25 June 1944 after increasing his tally to 26 solo victories over the course of 421 sorties, which included 94 dogfights. However, he did not live to receive the award; while escorting a group of Li-2 aircraft to an airbase in Tallinn at night in poor weather, his Yak-9 crashed in the Gulf of Finland. Despite the efforts of a search and rescue operation, Karpov and his plane were never recovered. Throughout the war he flew 456 sorties, engaged in 97 dogfights, tallying 27 solo and nine shared shootdowns, flying the Yak-1, Yak-7B, and Yak-9 fighters.

During the war he completed 457 sorties, in which he gained at least 31 individual kills, making him one of the highest-scoring Soviet flying aces.  Early life  Klubov was born on 18 January 1918 to a working- class Russian family. His father, who died when Aleksandr was a young child, had served on the Aurora. His oldest brother Aleksey was a farmhand, but bore much of the responsibility of raising Aleksandr and his sister. The family left Okishevo in 1931 where Klubov completed his first four years of school; he live in Yarunovo until 1934, after which he moved to Leningrad where he completed his schooling and began working at a steel mill. Later he worked at a carburetor factory and trained at the local aeroclub before joining the military in January 1939. He went on to graduate from the Chuguev Military Aviation School in October 1940, after which he was assigned to the 84th Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Armenia; the unit used the I-153 fighter.  World War II  Not long after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Klubov was deployed in August as part of the allied invasion of Iran. He briefly fought in the conflict before returning to his post less than a month later in September. In July 1942 he was deployed to the front of the Battle for the Caucasus as a flight commander. He scored his first aerial victory in August after he shot down a Bf 109 while flying an I-153. He soon increased his tally of victories, but after engaging in one dogfight that resulted in gaining two shared kills of Bf 109s he was shot down. Despite desperately trying to land his I-153, he was forced to parachute out of his stricken plane after suffering serious burns. His face and neck bore scars from the incident long after he was released from the hospital in January 1943. When he returned to his regiment, he began flying missions in the I-16 fighter his regiment had switched to, but he did not score any aerial victories with it. In April his unit was sent away from the warfront for retraining, but in May he and fourteen other pilots from the 84th Fighter Regiments were transferred to the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. Klubov and several ofhis colleagues were then assigned to the 1st squadron and underwent training under the supervision of Aleksandr Pokryshkin, one of the highest-scoring aces of the Soviet Union. On 4 September 1943 Klubov was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having completed 310 sorties, engaged in 84 dogfights, and personally shot down 14 enemy planes. He received the title on 13 April 1944. Klubov was one shootdown away from becoming an \\"ace-in-a-day\\" on 30 May 1944, since he shot down two Ju 87 and two FW-190. Earlier that month he was almost permanently grounded from flying after having gotten into a bad fight with a mechanic from another regiment, who ended up badly injured. He was detained and sent to be tried by a military tribunal, which likely would have resulted in him being sent to an infantry penal battalion with a high mortality rate, but Aleksandr Pokryshkin intervened and requested a more lenient sentence, insisting that losing a flying ace to a penal battalion would be result in many additional losses of Soviet aircraft. Klubov died on 1 November 1944 after experiencing loss of control on a training flight of the new La-7 fighter. He was buried in the Hillov Glory in Lviv until his was reburied in the Vvedensky cemetery of Vologda in 2001. Throughout the war he scored 31 solo victories, gained three shared shootdowns, flew 457 sorties, and engaged in 109 aerial battles. After his death he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union again and awarded the title for a second time on 27 June 1945.

It was sculpted by James Laurence Watts from 1912 to 1919. It is also known as Boer War Memorial and The Scout. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The first overseas conflict in which colonial Queensland troops were involved occurred during Second Boer War (1899-1902) in South Africa. The Queensland Government despatched volunteer contingents of mounted infantrymen to the war to aid the forces of the British Commonwealth involved in the armed intervention. Eighty-nine Queenslanders died during the war. In the years after the war a public committee was established to erect a memorial to the fallen, but the funds raised were insufficient and the project lapsed. In 1912 James Laurence Watts, a Brisbane sculptor, was commissioned to provide \\"an equestrian statue in bronze\\" for the South African Fallen Soldiers Memorial Committee. His commission was conditional on his final design being scrutinised by a panel representing \\"no less than four areas of expertise\\", which included art, veterinary surgery, architecture and soldiery. The statue, which depicts a fully equipped mounted trooper of the Queensland contingents to South African war, was sent to England to be bronzed, but the outbreak of World War I delayed its return. Watts meanwhile was also commissioned to provide another memorial in London to Queenslanders who died in South Africa. Finally in 1919 the completed statue (known as The Scout) returned to Brisbane and was placed in a position of prominence atop the rise at the intersection of Turbot and Edward Streets, where it faced towards the City Botanic Gardens and dominated the street vista. The pedestal on which the statue sat was constructed by local firm Lowther & Sons. Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams unveiled the memorial in December 1919. The African War Veterans Association of Queensland organised annual marches to the statue on 31 May, Anniversary Day, the anniversary of the signing of the peace Treaty of Vereeniging in South Africa. The marches were followed by commemorative services on the site. After creation of Anzac Square in 1930, the African War Veterans Association made a number of approaches for the memorial to be moved to the square. This was done in early April 1939 in time for the Anzac Day ceremonies of that year, Lowther & Sons reassembling the pedestal. The memorial still stands in Anzac Square, fronting Adelaide Street. In 1991 restoration work was carried out on behalf of the Returned Services League.  Description  Plaque #1 Plaque #2 The life-size bronzed statue depicts a Queensland Mounted Infantryman. Uniform and accoutrements show meticulous attention to detail, such as the Queensland hat- badge and emu plumes affixed to the slouch hat, and even the horse on which the trooper sits marked with the Queensland Government \\"QG\\" brand. On two sides of the trachyte pedestal large bronze plaques contain the names of the eighty-nine Queensland soldiers who lost their lives in the South African war.  Heritage listing  South African War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The South African War Memorial is significant as the only memorial in Brisbane dedicated to all members of the Queensland contingents who died during the South African conflict, and one of the few South African War memorials in the state. The Memorial reflects the strong parochial feeling still evident in post-Federation Queensland and of a continuing attachment to British Imperialism.

Early life, Russian Civil War, and interwar period  Kozak was born on in the village of Iskorost, Volhynian Governorate. During the Russian Civil War, from March 1921, he worked as a storekeeper on the Southwestern Railroad. Kozak fought as part of a separate company of the Forces of Special Purpose (ChON) against the nationalist armed bands of Garas and Ditrovsky in Ovruch between May and August 1922. He began a year of studies at the provincial Soviet Party School at Zhitomir in October 1922 and at the end of this period was sent to Olevsk and Barash as a party worker. With a detachment of workers of the district executive committee and the district party committee, Kozak participated in the suppression of the band of Vasilenko near Barash in December 1923.

When he was killed in action during World War II near Leningrad, he was a lieutenant general in command of the 215th Fighter Aviation Division. Early life Kravchenko was born on to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Golubovka, located within present-day Ukraine. In 1914 his family moved to Pakomovka (located within present-day Kazakhstan), where they lived until 1920; they then moved to Zverinogolovskoye. He completed his seventh grade of school in 1930, after which he attended the Moscow Land Management College until 1931; he became a member of the Communist Party that year. Military Career After entering the military in May 1931, he graduated from the Kacha Military Aviation School of Pilots. He then worked as a flight instructor at the school and trained seven cadets until he was transferred in March 1933 to the 118th Fighter Aviation Squadron. In July 1943 he began work at the State Air Force Research Institute as a test pilot, where he flew with a squadron that conducted tests with I-5, I-14, I-15, and I-16 fighters. After returning from China in November 1939 he continued doing test flights, flying the I-16, I-153, and DI-6 until he left for his deployment to Mongolia in Spring 1939. =Second Sino-Japanese War= In March 1938 Kravchenko was deployed to China as a flight commander in squadron of Soviet volunteers to assist in the defense of China against the offensive of Japanese aviation. By August when he was recalled from the front, he had attained the position of squadron commander, flown 78 sorties on the I-16, and gained four confirmed shootdowns of enemy aircraft, though some sources credit him with six victories during the conflict. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 22 February 1939 for his actions in the conflict, though newspapers made no mention of his role in the war and simply described him as a hero since the participation of the Soviet Union in the conflict was a military secret. =Khalkhin Gol= Upon his arrival to Mongolia on 2 June 1939 with a group of Soviet pilots, Kravchenko was posted to the 22nd Fighter Aviation Regiment as an adviser. On 27 June he participated in an intense air battle against over 100 Japanese planes heading to bomb Soviet airfields. He singled out a Ki-15 and tailed it for so long that he ran out of fuel and was forced to make a belly landing. He did not shoot it down, but he survived the ordeal and after two days he was found by the Red Army and returned to his unit, which had mistakenly believed him to have been killed in action and already sent a telegram to Moscow about his \\"death\\". Less than a month later he was made commander of the 22nd Regiment after the previous commander was badly wounded. Before the end of the battle he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 August 1939; he and Sergey Gritsevets were the first people awarded the title twice. Just a few days before the decree awarding him the title he scored his last shootdown, bringing up his tally to four solo and three shared kills. In total he flew 78 sorties in the battle before being recalled from the front on 11 September, when he and other pilots who were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for actions in the battle of Khalkhin Gol took off from Mongolia to Moscow. En route they stopped by Ulaanbaator, where they were greeted by Khorloogiin Choibalsan. =Winter War= In October 1939 Kravchenko was appointed as head of the Fighter Aviation Combat Training Directorate, and in December he was made commander of a Special Aviation Brigade based in Estonia; from there they would launch attacks on Finland. = Peacetime = From April to June 1940 he was in charge of the flight inspection division of the air force, after which he was placed in commander of the aviation sector of the Baltic Military District. Earlier that year he had been promoted to the rank of general lieutenant. After graduating from the Military Academy of General Staff in March 1941 he was made commander of the 64th Aviation Division, but he left it in April to return to the military academy. He did not stay at the academy for long due to the start of Operation Barbarossa. =World War II= Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union he was placed in command of the 11th Mixed Aviation Division. By November he was promoted to commander of the 3rd Air Force Army. In spring 1942 he served as commander of the 8th Strike Group. From then until his death he was in command of the 215th Fighter Aviation Division. Despite his high rank he actively participated in the battles for Smolensk, Bryansk, Orel, and Leningrad. Vasily Yemelyanko recalled an incident when Kravchenko was in charge of the 11th Division in which he took off in an obsolete fighter and engaged a group of Messerschmitts. On 23 February 1943 he was killed in action after a mission on a La-5 near Leningrad. He had entered the dogfight by having been lured by a single Bf 110 attacking Soviet troops on the ground, while a group of fighters hid behind the clouds near it; when he pursued the Bf 110, the other fighters attacked and shot him down. After bailing out of his stricken plane his parachute failed to open; he survived the landing and was rescued by Soviet troops on the ground, but was unconscious and died just an hour and a half later after remaining. His ashes were interned in the Kremlin Wall.

The regiment was formed in November 1917 in Volhynia, and in 1921‚Äì1939, it was garrisoned in Suwa≈Çki, in the barracks of former Imperial Russian Army's 2nd Pskov Dragoons Regiment. In the 1939 Invasion of Poland it was part of Suwalska Cavalry Brigade. Regimental badge Suwalska BK w 1938  World War I  Second Uhlan Regiment was formed in November 1917 in Antoniny, Volhynia, a village which at that time belonged to the House of Potocki. Soon afterwards the regiment joined Polish I Corps in Russia, and its two squadrons were made of ethnic Poles, who had served in Russian 2nd Guards Cavalry Division. First regimental order was issued on December 14, 1917, and in January‚ÄìFebruary 1918, the unit was strengthened by mounted artillery and third cavalry squadron. Since the number of soldiers increased, fourth squadron was formed in March 1918. By March 20, the regiment had almost 900 soldiers and officers. In early spring 1918, fourth and fifth squadrons were formed in Belarus. On May 30, 1918, the regiment had 47 officers, 4 clerks and 1091 soldiers. In the first half of 1918, the regiment fought against bands of armed peasantry and Bolshevik groups. On February 23, it captured Starokostiantyniv, together with large stocks of food, weapons and ammunition. On March 23, the regiment began its march to Babruysk, to join main forces of Polish I Corps. Along the way from Volhynia through Polesie to Belarus, it fought both Bolshevik and German forces of the Ober Ost. The regiment was disarmed by Germans in May 1918, together with whole Polish Corps. Most of its officers and soldiers decided to march to Congress Poland.  Second Polish Republic  Second Uhlan Regiment was recreated by Polish military authorities in November 1918. Its squadrons were located in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, ≈Åowicz and Siedlce, while the headquarters, commanded by Colonel Mieczyslaw Kudelski, were placed in Warsaw. In late 1918, the headquarters were moved to Kalisz, while its squadrons were stationed in Konin, Kutno and W≈Çoc≈Çawek. In 1919, the squadrons of the regiment were sent to different conflicts: 1st Squadron fought the Ukrainians and the Soviets in Volhynia and Polesie, 2nd and 3rd Squadrons fought in Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War in eastern Galicia, 4th Squadron was transferred to Podlasie, 5th Squadron at first fought the Czechoslovaks in Cieszyn Silesia, to be transferred to Galicia. First to enter the battle was 4th Squadron, commanded by Rittmeister Kazimierz Zelislawski. In December 1918 it took part in clashes with retreating Germans in southern Podlasie. On February 6, 1919, together with other units it captured Brest Fortress, and then rail junction at nearby Zhabinka. The uhlans then marched eastwards, to Pinsk and ≈Åuniniec. Meanwhile, 5th Squadron clashed with the Czechoslovaks at Lipowiec, Ustro≈Ñ (January 30, 1919), and on February 27 entered Cieszyn. In March 1919 the squadron was transferred to Kalisz, and shortly afterwards, it fought the Ukrainians near Belz. 1st Squadron fought along rail line from Che≈Çm to Kowel, as part of Operational Group of Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. In June 1919 it joined the second regiment near Zamo≈õƒá. In April 1919, 2nd, 3rd and 5th squadrons concentrated in northern Galicia, and clashed with the Ukrainians near Rawa Ruska. Next they moved to Polesie, and fought near Sarny. In late July 1919, three squadrons concentrated near Zbaraz, and spent the winter of 1919/1920 patrolling the border along the Sluch river. In April 1920, the regiment, which was part of Third Cavalry Brigade, crossed the Sluch and engaged with the cavalry of Semyon Budyonny. In the summer it was moved northwards, and fought Soviet cavalry near Ostro≈Çƒôka. On August 15, 1920, the regiment captured Ciechan√≥w, and then chased after the retreating forces of Hayk Bzhishkyan. On September 1, 1920, the regiment was transferred by train from the area of M≈Çawa to Che≈Çm, and joined Second Cavalry Division. In mid- September it captured R√≥wne, and moved towards the Sluch river, behind the retreating Red Army. In December 1920 Second Uhlan Regiment left border area and garrisoned at W≈Çodzimierz Wo≈Çy≈Ñski. In March 1921 it was moved to W≈Çodawa, and in May of the same year the regiment was welcomed at Suwa≈Çki, where it remained until 1939. Rittmeister of the Second Regiment  1939 Invasion of Poland  Second Uhlan Regiment in September 1939 The regiment, which was part of Suwalska Cavalry Brigade, belonged to Independent Operational Group Narew. Since September 1, 1939, it covered the area northwest of Suwa≈Çki. On September 2 the Germans seized Bakalarzewo, but Polish uhlans recaptured the town after a few hours. On September 3, the Wehrmacht attacked near Filipow, but was repelled. Second Regiment decided then to cross the border and enter East Prussia, reaching the village of Mierunksen (Mieruniszki). On September 4, the regiment was ordered to move southwards. After two days, it reached Knyszyn. In the evening of September 7, General Zygmunt Podhorski ordered the unit to move to the forests east of Zambr√≥w, and prepare defensive positions analog the Narew river. On September 10, Colonel Karol Anders, who had replaced Colonel Kazimierz Plisowski, decided to advance to Rutki, where the uhlans clashed with the enemy. Since 18th Infantry Division was unable to keep its positions fighting against General Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps, Colonel Anders divided the regiment into two columns and retreat to Wolkowysk. After several clashes with the Germans, only 1st and 4th Squadrons managed to get to Wolkowysk, where they joined 102nd Uhlan Regiment. On September 20‚Äì22 they fought in the Battle of Grodno, after which 102nd regiment crossed the Lithuanian border on September 23. Meanwhile, other elements of the Second Regiment, concentrated near Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, joined the improvised Cavalry Division Zaza, which consisted of Cavalry Brigade Plis and Cavalry Brigade Edward. On September 21, the division moved southwards. Three days later, after capturing Mielnik, it crossed the Bug river. On September 29, Cavalry Division Zaza merged with Independent Operational Group Polesie, and the united force fought in the Battle of Kock. Last elements of the Second Regiment capitulated on October 6, 1939, and its soldiers were imprisoned at the Fortress of Deblin.  Operation Tempest (1944)  In the summer of 1944, the Second Uhlan Regiment was recreated by the Home Army Inspectorate of Bielsk Podlaski. The unit fought in the Operation Tempest in the area of Bielsk, Bra≈Ñsk, Nurzec and Hajn√≥wka. It consisted of some 600 soldiers, who protected local population and attacked German outposts.

Polish Attache at Kaunas sent the flag in a diplomatic package to France, and finally it ended up in Great Britain. Since 1927, all officers of the regiment had the right to wear a badge of Estonian First Hussar Regiment, due to a mutual alliance of both units. The regiment had its own ≈ºurawiejka: \\"Uhlan Regiment of Grochow tends to its problems with a shot-glass. Lampas made of trousers, coat made of rags, this is the 2nd Uhlan Regiment. The sotnias of Budyonny will remember the Regiment of Dwernicki Uhlans\\". In the interbellum period, the regiment sent its newly promoted officers to the tomb of its patron, General J√≥zef Dwernicki, located in Lopatyn near Brody (current Ukraine). In 1995 ‚Äì 2000, the traditions of Second Uhlan Regiment were continued by 2nd Tank Battalion of 4th Suwa≈Çki Armored Cavalry Brigade from Orzysz. In 2003, Association of Grochow Uhlans of General Dwernicki was founded in Podkowa Le≈õna.  Sources  * Adam Dobro≈Ñski: 2 Pu≈Çk U≈Çan√≥w Grochowskich im. gen. J√≥zefa Dwernickiego.

After the war he became a general-major.  Early life  Kuznetsov was born on to a Russian family in Agarino village, located within the present-day borders of the Moscow oblast. Having moved to the city of Moscow in 1921, he went on to complete his seventh grade of school in 1930, after which he worked as an electrician at a tannery until 1932. From then until he entering the military in mid 1933 he worked for the Komsomol of Kirovsky district of the city, serving as deputy chairman of a bureau of young pioneers, secretary of a university Komsomol committee, and secretary of a factory Komsomol committee. After graduating from the Yeisk Military School of Marine and Observer Pilots in December 1934 he was assigned to the 6th Light Bomber Aviation Squadron as a pilot. Later he transferred to the 106th Fighter Aviation Squadron, and in August 1938 he became adjutant and assistant squadron commander in the 15th Fighter Aviation Regiment. In that position he saw combat during the Soviet invasion of Poland and later the Winter War with Finland, during which he flew sorties on the I-153. After leaving the warfront he attended training for squadron commanders in Lipetsk.  World War II  Almost immediately after completing training to become a squadron commander in June 1941 he was deployed with his previous regiment to combat the German invasion of the Soviet Union; before leaving the unit in March 1942 he had been promoted to navigator; after briefly serving as deputy commander of the 1st Reserve Fighter Aviation Regiment he took command of the 814th Fighter Aviation Regiment in June that year. Despite holding the high post of regimental commander he frequently flew combat sorties and participated in aerial battles, resulting him tallying enough shootdowns of enemy to be nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 2 August 1943 for having totaled 245 sorties, entered 53 dogfights, and gained 17 solo aerial victories. That month his regiment was awarded the guards designation and renamed as the 106th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. Later in the war on 22 February 1945 he and his comrades flying in a group of six Yak-1s participated in an intense aerial battle with a large group of German FW-190s; during the engagement Kuznetsov personally shot down two of them. In April he was nominated for a second gold star, which was awarded after the surrender of Nazi Germany. Throughout the war he fought on the Northwest, Leningrad, Kalinin, West, Southwest, 1st Ukrainian, and 3rd Ukrainian fronts, participating in the battles for Leningrad, the Baltics, Kursk, Lvov, Silesia, Berlin, and Prague. During the conflict his unit was one of the highest- performing fighter regiments in the Soviet Air Forces, tallying 296 enemy aircraft shot down in addition to 18 destroyed on the ground. By the end of the war he totaled 344 sorties, participating in 73 aerial battles, tallying 19 solo and one shared shootdown while flying the MiG-3, Yak-1, and Yak-9.  Postwar  Kuznetsov remained in command of the 106th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment until July 1945. From then until February 1946 he served as the deputy commander of the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division; afterwards he attended the Air Force Academy in Monino. Upon graduation from the academy in 1951 he headed the Chernigov Military Aviation School of Pilots until December 1955, for the next four years afterwards he headed the 10th Military Aviation School.

He was one of the pioneer sculptors in Australia and his works appear in many Queensland public buildings and places. Early life James Laurence Watts (1849‚Äì1925) was born in the town of Bedminster, Somerset, England to John and Betsey (n√©e Dowdney) Watts. Bedminster being today a district of Bristol. James is the third eldest in a family of 4 sons. The family moved to Weston- super-Mare on the Somerset coast about 1855. Here John found work as a fisherman. It is not known what inspired James to be a sculptor but his elder brother is a mason and this may have been the inspiration. It is believed that James received his early art training at the South Kensington School of Arts, London during the period of 1870s. He then married Mary Louisa Lloyd on 15 January 1880 at Pembroke, St Mary, Pembrokeshire, Wales. On the 31st November 1884 he and his wife and family of one daughter and two sons arrive in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia aboard the ship ‚ÄòRoma‚Äô.http://www.archives.qld.gov.au/Researchers/ImmigrationIndexes/Documents/Roma_1884_Jul_QSA_Item_18481.pdf James Watts‚Äô family were listed as ‚ÄòBounty‚Äô passengers, as was the majority of passengers on ship. The meaning of ‚ÄòBounty ‚Äò is a form of assisted passage by the Queensland Government at that time to provide industry in Queensland with skilled labourers and tradesmen. Career James accepts work on arrival with James Campbell and Sons, a large sawmilling and building materials merchant of Brisbane. James Campbell and Sons had purchased in 1883, Petrie's Quarry and Brickworks along with Fischer‚Äô Pottery at Albion as part of the company's expansion. There was a market at the time for good quality pottery and James was employed as a clay modeller at the pottery. James continued to be employed at the pottery for most of his working life. His first known sculpture is in 1888 in the form of a bust of Sir Anthony Musgrave, an early Governor of Queensland who died in office. This sculpture was displayed at the head office of James Campbell and Sons. Bronze Bust of Mr. L. A. Bernays held at Queensland Parliament Bronze Bust of Sir Hugh M. Nelson held at Queensland Parliament Bronze Bust of Sir Thomas McIlwraith held at Queensland Parliament Queensland Parliament House holds a collection of Watts‚Äô work being a bronze' portal bust of Mr. Lewis Adolphus Bernays (c. 1909) who was the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, and Thomas Joseph Byrnes (c. 1899), Sir Hugh Nelson (c. 1906), and Sir Thomas McIlwraith, all were one-time Premiers of Queensland when the state was a colony. Jardiniere ‚Äì James Campbell & Sons held at Queensland Art Gallery The Queensland Art Gallery holds two items of Watts‚Äô a Jardiniere c.1890 a product of the James Campbell and Sons pottery works and a Sketch model of the late David Bowman (c.1916). Other bust sculptures include Alderman R. Fraser, Mayor of Brisbane (c. 1895), James Campbell (c. 1906), being his employer being noted industrialist and politician along with Judge Edward Mansfield (c. 1906). Marble Bust of Emma Miller held at Queensland Council of Unions All of these works involve sculpturing in plaster and then in some cases bronzing. He is then commissioned in 1918 by the Queensland Trades and Labour Council to sculpture a marble bust of Emma Miller (1839‚Äì1917), a seamstress and women's rights and labour activist. That bust is now held in the Emma Miller Room at the Queensland Council of Unions. The National Gallery of Australia holds a collection of 25 ceramic and earthenware items from James Campbell and Sons Albion and it thought that Watts was the originator of most of these items. James Watts most noted work was a bronzed sculpture of Boer War soldier on horseback titled ‚ÄòThe Scout‚Äô which dominates the Boer War Memorial in Anzac Square in Brisbane. An agreement was made in 1912 with the Boer War Memorial committee for Watts to supply the status in its finished state for ¬£1760. Owing to the difficulties of casting in Australia, the plaster model was sent to Parlanti Bronze Foundries England, and the statue reached Australia in 1917. The ability to cast a sculpture of this size was acquired by previous commercial sculpture work for the International Exhibition held in Brisbane during 1897. This was in the form of life-sized equestrian statue of a knight in armour for the brand Champion's Vinegar, whilst the other item is a group of cooks who are disporting themselves over a giant tin of Coleman's mustard. Architectural Terracotta The Albion Pottery was also well known for architectural terracotta, which was incorporated into buildings of the time giving a sculptured look to the building. The South Brisbane Town Hall built in 1892 is one of the well-known buildings that still exist that employed this architecture. The exterior decoration used terracotta paneling which was supplied by James Campbell & Sons of Albion. It is thought that Watts was the designer and modeller of this form of terracotta because during that period his name is associated with a number of commercial premises being constructed in Brisbane. He was mentioned as the modeller or architectural sculptor for the Queensland Trustees building, the Commercial Union Assurance Building, South British Insurance Company building in Queen Street and the decorative moulding on the front of the Burns, Philp and Co warehouse in Brisbane. It is not known if the latter architecture was terracotta or entailed sculpturing stone. Landscape Painter Indooroopilly Bridge after the 1893 Flood, held at the John Oxley Library Brisbane As well as a sculptor, James Watts was also a noted landscape painter exhibiting at the Brisbane Art Society Exhibitions with many of his works being acquired by local residents. Many of his landscape paintings are of the Brisbane River around the district of Sherwood where he lived prior to moving to the suburb of Taringa. The John Oxley Library, which contains Queensland's most comprehensive record of documented history, has two items of Watts‚Äô, a landscape painting titled \\"Indooroopilly Bridge after the 1893 flood\\" and a framed plaster cast of Robert Dunne, Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. The latter item was mass-produced after the death of Dunne and was recommended by the Catholic Church to its parishioners. Rare examples come to auction these days and are a collector item. Teaching career Watts was the instructor in modelling at the Central Technical College, Brisbane School of Arts as well as the Ipswich Technical College. He was one of the founders of the Queensland Art Society and served as its Vice President for many years. Being disaffected by the society, Watts and other professionals formed the New Society of Artists in 1904 and it was not until 1916 that the two societies amalgamated. The establishment of the Queensland Art Gallery followed successful advocacy by artists Isaac Walter Jennerhttp://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jenner-isaac-walter-6838 and Richard Godfrey Rivers.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/rivers-richard-godfrey-8217 Rivers had persuaded the Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Robert Fraser, to provide a room in the now-demolished old Brisbane Town Hall building in Queen Street. Rivers began as the voluntary curator of the gallery along with assistance from Watts and Watts‚Äô son James Arthur Watts. His son became full-time curator on the resignation of Rivers in 1915 and remained in that post until 1949. James Laurence Watts died early on Saturday 26 September 1925 at his home in Hillsdon Road, Taringa aged 76. The private interment took place to Toowong Cemetery on Saturday afternoon. The chief mourners were his widow, his three daughters (Mrs. Watkins and the Misses Watts), and three sons (Messrs. James Arthur, H. T., and E. W.

On August 20, 1939, Kossecki was named commandant of the 18th Infantry Division (≈Åom≈ºa), which in September 1939 belonged to Independent Operational Group Narew.  1939 Invasion of Poland  During the September 1939 Campaign, Kossecki fought in the area of Zambr√≥w, against Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian. On September 12 near Andrzejewo he was seriously wounded when five German bullets hit him during a charge which he personally led. Kossecki was taken to the hospital at Zambr√≥w, and then to Bia≈Çystok, the city which in late September was occupied by the Red Army. After leaving hospital (November 1939), he wanted to cross the newly established Soviet - German demarcation line, but was captured by the NKVD near Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem.  Death  Epitaph of Stefan Kossecki in the Mausoleum of the 18th Infantry Division in Andrzejewo Until March 28, 1940, Kossecki was kept in a Soviet prison at Brze≈õƒá. His further fate is unknown, according to one witness, the Soviets drowned him in the White Sea, together with other Polish prisoners of war. His symbolic tomb is located in the mausoleum of the 18th Infantry Division in Andrzejewo. In 1964 in London, General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders posthumously promoted Stefan Kossecki to Genera≈Ç brygady. This decision was confirmed on November 9, 2004 by President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski. On April 5, 1997, 2nd Regiment of Vistula Army Unit from Czerwony B√≥r was named after General Kossecki. Also, on January 25, 2008, a street in Zambr√≥w was named after him.

Sept. 14, 1720. The sponsors at his baptism were Adolphe Philipse and Susanna Brokholls. From Sabine's Loyalists, we learn that though holding an elevated position in Colonial society, he was not a prominent actor in public affairs; He was, however, a member of the Assembly and Colonel in the militia. On account of his loyalty to the British crown during the war of the Revolution, his estate, one of the largest in the province, was confiscated by the New York Legislature, and upon the withdrawal of the British troops from New York in 1783, he went to England, where he died at the city of Chester, April 30, 1785. He married ELIZABETH RUTGERS, a widow, the dau. of CHARLES WILLIAMS, ESQ., and had with other issue, Frederick, Jr., for an account of whom see Burke's Dictionary of the Landed Gentry, etc., and Bolton's History of Westchester, vol. 1, p. 322.

He did not receive his uncle's ‚ÄúHighland Patent‚Äù, a tract later known as the Philipse Patent, which became today's Putnam County, New York. It was divided among three of his siblings: Philip, Susannah (wife of Beverley Robinson), and Mary (wife of Col. Roger Morris). Career Philipse was a member of the Assembly of the colonial Province of New York, and a Colonel in the militia. =American Revolution= Like the rest of his family, Philipse was a Loyalist during the American Revolution. He was arrested and imprisoned by Colonial authorities on August 9, 1776, on order of George Washington. An American Loyalist: The Ordeal of Frederick Philipse III, Stefan Bielinski, New York State Museum (1976) After numerous charges and many travails he was paroled on December 23 by Governor Trumbull of Connecticut, where he had been held. In the spring of 1777 he warned the British garrison at Knightsbridge of an impending Colonial raid. His note was intercepted, causing Philipse and his family to flee to British-held New York City, never to return to their estate. There they moved into Philipse's large house at Whitehall and Stone Streets, where they spent the rest of the war. Philipse integrated himself and his wife into Loyalist society, purchased commissions in the British army for his five sons, and their daughters were \\"the talk of New York's winter balls as they had been in pre-war days\\". Victim of an effort led by his own cousin, John Jay, Philipse was attainted by the Provincial Congress of New York in 1779 and his Manor and other lands in today's Westchester County were seized.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"An Act for the forfeiture and sale of the estates of those who have adhered to the enemies of this state\\" was passed by the Provincial Congress on October 22, 1779. The law seized the land of fifty-nine loyalists, and, if they were found guilty of loyalism, banished them from the State of New York upon penalty of \\"death without benefit of Clergy.\\"(5) Among those attainted was Frederick Philipse, owner of the Manor of Philipsburg, the largest tract of land in Westchester County.(6) Also on October 22, 1779, writes historian Vivienne L. Ratner, \\"the Governor was authorized to appoint Commissioners of Forfeitures to dispose of the confiscated estates,\\" with tenant farmers, \\"who had leased‚Ä¶and improved the land,\\" given first priority to purchase their tracts.\\" Several months later their sale was ordered.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"A law passed on March 10, 1780, called for the immediate sale of portions of the forfeited lands to pay for apparel and provisions needed by the troops.(8) On March 18, 1780, the United States Congress passed an Act which mandated the issuance of new currency, backed by the credit of the states to which the bills were allotted. Each state was to pay off one-sixth of the bills annually. On June 15, 1780, the New York legislature reserved the larger of the forfeited estates, including that of Frederick Philipse, as collateral for the redemption of the bills issued by New York in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 18, 1780. The Commissioners of Forfeitures, however, were not permitted to sell any of the mortgaged lands until further instructions from the Provincial Congress.\\" Philipse family holdings belonging to other members, principally the Highland Patent, were also seized by the Commissioners of Forfeitures. Sale was withheld during the war, as its outcome was uncertain, confiscated lands had been pledged as collateral against monies borrowed by the provisional government to finance the conflict,Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"Sales of the estates set aside on June 15, 1780, and of other forfeited lands were authorized by the state legislature on October 7, 1780. The Governor was to appoint commissioners to sell forfeited lands for gold, silver, or Congressional bills of credit, in order to pay off one-sixth the bills issued in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 18, 1780. These early transactions were not conducted by the Commissioners of Forfeitures, but rather by \\"commissioners of specie\\" who bridged the gap between the Commissioners of Sequestration and the Commissioners of Forfeitures. The majority of the forfeited estates, however, were not disposed of until after the conclusion of the war.\\" and tenants lobbied for the right of preemptive purchase of leased land.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"On March 31, 1781, the right of tenants to preemption of purchase of their farms was again affirmed and the procedure for such sales further described. An act of the Provincial Congress on April 14, 1782, mandated that none of the seized lands in the Southern District was to be sold 'until the further order of the legislature.'\\" Sale proceeded after the Revolution ended. In spite of assurances of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris signed with the British,Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"'Article V of the peace treaty signed by Britain and the United States in Paris on September 3, 1783, insists on 'the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects\\" and to noncombatant loyalists. Tories who fought the United States were to be given one year to reclaim their property and leave the country. Payments were to be made to loyalists whose estates had already been sold. Article VI prohibited any future confiscations.\\" and the enormous sum raised - the better part of a quarter of a million pounds SterlingDescription of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"The Commissioners of Forfeitures ceased operation on September 1, 1788, by an act of March 21, 1788. They had sold nearly all the tracts of land entrusted to them, raising large amounts of revenue for the state of New York. Philipse Manor alone brought in ?234,170 18 s. - New York's Provisional Congress reneged and no payment from them was forthcoming.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"Many citizens of New York, however, still harbored strong resentment against the loyalists, leading the Provincial Congress to effectively nullify the Treaty of Paris of 1783 by an act of May 12, 1784.\\" Later, it is claimed by Bielinski, Philipse was \\"compensated handsomely by the crown\\" for his loss. No amount was specified, only a prior reference by him to a royal pension granted Philipse for his \\"attachment to his majesty's government\\" that only reached 200 pounds by 1782, a minute fraction of the over 220,000 pound loss he had suffered via attainder. Some 35,000 or so acres of the Philipse estate were purchased by almost 200 tenant farmers who had previously worked their parcels, which averaged 170 acres apiece.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"These farmers were not poor as one might expect. A combination of advantageous economic and geographic circumstances ensured that few Westchester County farmers had financial problems; many were well-to-do and some agricultural families were quite wealthy.(15) When tenant farmers could not afford or did not wish to purchase their lands, the tracts were sold to wealthy landowners, Revolutionary leaders, and businessmen from New York City.(16) Most of the buyers of confiscated estates were men. The only women to buy tracts of forfeited estates in the Southern District were either widows or administratrices of estates, or were pooling their resources with male family members to purchase a tract of land.\\" In all, there were 286 new properties owners, 16 of which could be characterized as outside speculators, who acquired some six percent of the land. Two of these, however, acquired prime parcels, Cornelius Low the Manor Hall and Gerard Beekman the Upper Mills. Historian Beatrice G. Reubens argues that the confiscation of Loyalist estates was a major reform for social and economic equality upstate New York. The state law of 1779 permitted attainted as well as patriot tenants on confiscatory lands to have the first right to purchase farms on which they resided. About 80 percent of the new owners of Philipsburgh Manor (Philipse Manor) were small farmers, most of whom had been tenants.Beatrice G. Reubens, \\"Pre-Emptive Rights in the Disposition of a Confiscated Estate, Philipsburgh Manor, New York.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1965), 22#3 pp 435-456. online Personal life In 1764, Philipse was married to Elizabeth (n√©e Williams) Rutgers, the twenty four year old widow of Anthony Rutgers.

After losing his New York holdings due to his loyalist stance during the American Revolution, Frederick III and his family relocated to the area, where he spent the remainder of his life.

Much of the album consists of electronically processed traditional instruments and voice, and a cadre of synthesizers (a custom E-mu Modular Synthesizer controlled by and processed through then-cutting-edge computer technology, with software patches and compositions by Lagin; an ARP 2500 and ARP 2600; and a Buchla Modular System). The early computers employed by Lagin included an Interdata 7/16 computer with a high speed arithmetic logic unit and magnetic core memory; an Intel 8080 microprocessor system built by Lagin; and at the beginning of 1975 an Altair 8800. The computer-controlled systems was designed and built for group live performance, with the performers instruments and voices routed through analog and digital synthesis and processing hardware.

In many Chinese records, his name was given as L√π D≈çngz√†n () or L√πn D≈çngz√†n (); both are attempts to transliterate the short form of his title and name, L√∂n Tongtsen. Career Gar Tongtsen was born into the Gar clan, an important Tibetan family based in modern Maizhokunggar County. According to Clear Mirror on Royal Genealogy, Tongtsen was dispatched as envoys to Licchavi Kingdom (in modern Nepal) together with Thonmi Sambhota by the emperor Songtsen Gampo. Amshuverma, who was the ruler of Licchavi, married Princess Bhrikuti to Songtsen Gampo. But the historicity of the princess is not certain because no reference to her has been found among the documents discovered at Dunhuang. Tongtsen was dispatched to Tang China together with Dri Seru Gungton and Thonmi Sambhota in 640, requesting a marriage between the Tibetan emperor and a Tang princess. Taizong, the Tang emperor, agreed and married Princess Wencheng to Songtsen Gampo. Taizong appreciated his talent and promoted him to \\"Right Guard Senior General\\" (), but was refused by him. Later, the L√∂nchen Khyungpo Pungse invited Songtsen came to visit his fief. Tongtsen was sent there to set up the emperor's camp, but found it was a conspiracy. Tongtsen fled stealthily and told the conspiracy to the emperor. After the death of Pungse, Tongtsen was appointed as L√∂nchen. Songtsen Gampo died in 650, and Mangsong Mangtsen succeeded. Tongtsen acted as regent because Mangsong was an infant. During this period, Tongtsen carried out a tax reform in 653, conducted a census in 654, and made the first law of Tibet in 655. Relations between China and Tibet began to sour during this period. Tibet conquered (Ngari) and (Tsang) in 652, and finally 'A-zha (which was called \\"Tuyunhun\\" by Chinese people) in 663. Tibet held over the whole of the Tibetan plateau, and tried to seize the Western Regions of Tang China. Tongtsen left in 'A-zha to defend against Tang China, and was dismissed by Mangsong due to his age. Not long after his successor Omade Lotsen was executed because the \\"guilty of rebellion\\", and the position turned back to him. Six years later, he died of neck cancer on his way back to Lhasa. Family Gar Tongtsen had five sons, all of them were famous Tibetan generals: *Gar Tsenye Dompu () *Gar Trinring Tsendro (), also known as Lon Trinring () and L√πn Qƒ´nl√≠ng () *Gar Tsenba () *Gar Tagu Risum () *Gar Tsenyen Gungton () References *Old Tibetan Chronicle, P.T. 1287 *New Book of Tang, vol. 230 - Category:7th-century Tibetan people Category:Tibetan Empire Category:667 deaths Category:590 births ","title":"Gar Tongtsen Yulsung"},{"id":"45540408","text":"The St Patrick's Basilica or Oamaru Basilica, as it is popularly known because of its style of architecture,In Roman Catholic ecclesiastical terms, St Patrick's Basilica is not a Minor basilica. See: List of minor basilicas in the world. is a Catholic church in Oamaru, New Zealand. It was designed by the prominent New Zealand architect Francis Petre and is one of his most celebrated works. It is one of the most important historic buildings of Oamaru and of the North Otago region. The Basilica's classical portico and three domes are an admired feature of the Oamaru townscape and the building is particularly noted for the high quality of the stone carving and fine plasterwork of its architectural features. The Basilica \\"must surely have one of the most noble church interiors in the country. Built entirely of Oamaru stone the exterior has weathered more than one would have expected, but inside the church glows with reflected light from the creamy stone which is virtually in its original state.\\" \\"The interior is bathed in abundant natural light, and with clear glass rather than stained in the high nave windows, the quality of light is enhanced.\\" Basilica St Patricks Basilica is an important example the work of Francis Petre. The Basilica is an aesthetically imposing building that makes a vital contribution to the streetscape. It stands at the end of a long street (Usk St) leading from the Oamaru shore and ending at the great portico of the building. This Portico is composed of eight Corinthian columns of Oamaru stone (six in front, two behind), whose pedestals rest on elongated plinths, and a high pediment closely reflecting those of a Roman or Greek temple. However, the church's palladian heritage is emphasised by the front dome on each side and the great dome behind. The Irish character of the church's early clergy and congregation is attested to by the great statues of St Columba on the left and St Patrick on the right. The building's bulk, form and architectural styling are impressive. The interior is richly decorated, with two impressive ranges of carved limestone Corinthian columns creating colonnades along the nave, completed by the pressed zinc ceilings, wooden pews and religious sculptures. Light floods in from the clerestory above. On the ceiling plaster cornices frame the richly ornamented pressed-zinc panels. \\"The Basilica is culturally significant emphasising the importance of the Roman Catholic Church to Oamaru, and is a landmark for the town. The design is technically accomplished and forms a vital element in Petre's Basilican architectural ouvre and the building is among his most well known and iconic works. The Basilica is an important component in Oamaru's white-stone architecture, characteristic of the township, and is as well the key component of the group of buildings associated with the Catholic Church in Oamaru [(presbytery, school buildings and large convent- all located near the Basilica)] .\\" Foundation The inspiration and effort behind the building of St Patricks came from Father (later Monsignor) John Mackay, who became Parish Priest in Oamaru on 3 March 1890. He wished to build a Church that would suit the needs of his congregation and began fundraising. By April 1893 he was had enough money to start on the building. On an earlier trip to Europe, he had seen buildings he considered would suit the needs of the Oamaru Parish and he had commissioned Francis Petre to put his observations and ideas into a practical design. The laying of the foundation stone coincided with the silver jubilee of ordination of Mackay, who was parish priest of Oamaru for 36 years (1890-1926) and who supervised the construction of the Basilica from its commencement in 1893 until its final completion 25 years later in 1918. The foundation stone was laid on Trinity Sunday 1893, by Bishop Moran of Dunedin. The successful tender for the construction of the church had been made by D.W. Woods: ¬£3,460 exclusive of the sanctuary and dome. The whole building was to be of Oamaru stone, cut from the nearby quarry at Weston, Mr Joseph Kelly of Weston being the Quarry contractor. Nave The first contract was for the nave, organ loft and temporary sanctuary only. Petre used concrete on the outer lower portion of the main walls of the nave to a height of seven feet. He also specified that the floor of the organ loft be of poured concrete. By November 1894 this was finished and the church was dedicated on 18 November with the front portico, a flight of steps, the two front domes, the main dome, the permanent sanctuary, sacristies, tribunes and side chapels yet to be bulilt. Ceiling In 1898, the coffer type ceiling that was originally designed in wood panels and mouldings, was completed in zinc supplied by Wunderlich & Co. of Sydney. The richly embossed zinc, while giving an impression of massiveness, was actually light and had the advantage of being an excellent resonator, greatly improving the acoustic of the Basilica. Five shades of colouring were utilised on the 78 squares of zinc and this work was undertaken by McKay assisted by some of the \\"best\\" pupils of the Convent school. This colouring work was done before the ceiling was erected. Frontage McKay, who was unremitting in his efforts to complete the building, pressed on with fundraising by means of bazaars and raffles to finance the next stage of the construction. This involved the front portico, the flight of steps, the two front domes and the carving of the columns. The completion of this stage was celebrated on 26 April 1903. The stone work for this stage was done by Messrs. Fergusson, Given & Co. and Mr David Given carved the columns and pilasters. It was noted at this time that the Oamaru Basilica was the first building in New Zealand in which domes had been adopted. Early descriptions of the building stated that it was as near as possible for modern purposes, severely Greek, not only in general design but also in its constructional features, but the introduction of domes and arches, meant that it deviated somewhat from the transom and colonnade of the old Greek models. It is actually a palladian revival building Completion St. Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru, crossing and main dome interior. In 1917 construction began on the permanent sanctuary, sacristies, tribunes, side chapels and the main dome. Considerable excavation was necessary to take the massive foundations needed to support the 150 foot dome. On 3 June 1917, the \\"corner stone\\" (the second foundation stone for the building) was lowered into position. Bishop Verdon of Dunedin \\"plied the trowel\\" and carried out the ceremony. The dome is not located above the crossing, the normal placement, but above the sanctuary. Petre had already adopted this revolutionary approach in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch completed in 1905. This last stage of St Patrick's Basilica was completed in 1918, 25 years after the first foundations were laid. The final cost of the building was ¬£13,000. Opening The opening ceremonies were carried on 8 December 1918. Monsignor McKay, the driving force behind the whole concept from start to finish, was by now celebrating the golden jubilee of his ordination and on the day, was highly praised for his untiring work over so many years on the basilica project. He was presented with appropriate gifts. Two days after the official opening, Francis William Petre died on 10 December 1918. Organ In 1915, a highlight in the Basilica's history had been the installation of a Positive pipe organ \\"which added greatly to the meaning of the services as well as enhancing the skills of the choir.\\" Changes There have been minor alterations and additions to the Basilica in the ensuing years, such as removal of the main altar, the stone communion rails, the stone pulpit, the addition of confessionals, under floor heating and the removal of the slate roof and its replacement with long run iron, but these cosmetic changes have detracted little for the original design of the church.

The band achieved regional success with singles mostly consisting of cover versions of popular songs. Their material is considered one of the earliest examples of proto-punk, which has led to re-releases of their work. History =Beginnings= The band originated from a group known as The Fantastic Dee Jays, which was formed in 1965 by Denny Nicholson, Dick Newton, and Tom Junecko. The three performed locally until being hired by disc jockey, Terry Lee, of WMCK Radio. Lee, who was manager of several other bands, became their manager/producer, and dictated their song lists, uniforms, and purchased their equipment. In live performances, the band performed covers of British Invasion pop songs, and soon gained a following in Pittsburgh. In March 1965, the band released their first single, \\"Apache\\" b/w \\"Fight Fire\\", both cover songs. They would recruit vocalist and drummer, Bob Hocko, for their next releases, which included original material like \\"Get Away Girl\\", co-written by all the members. They released a self-titled debut in early 1966 and disbanded soon after. =The Swamp Rats= Terry Lee created the Swamp Rats with Dee Jay member, bass guitarist Newton, and newcomers David Gannon on drums, and Don Schreiner on lead guitar. Lee signed the band to the small St. Clair label, and produced their debut single, \\"Louie Louie\\" b/w \\"Hey Joe\\". The recordings were a contrast to their previous band's material as they were more heavier and punk orientated. Soon after their debut, Hocko returned to the group as lead vocalist along with bassist Paul Shalako being added. They would appear on the band's second release \\"Psycho\\" b/w \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", again both covers. Gannon would not be involved in the group's further releases, but remained their live drummer. Hocko's vocals on \\"Psycho\\" was an example of scream-singing. The band produced several more singles on the same label which sold well in Pittsburgh, and they performed in Lee's dance clubs with revolving lineups. Despite their popularity locally, the band suffered from personal disagreements, limited single distribution, and the lack of original material. Lee prevented the band from writing much of their own compositions, which caused disputes between Lee and Newton on what type of material to write. Newton left the band in 1967 and was replaced by Joey Guido. Lee was replaced by Nick Cenci who had the band signed to Co & Ce. for their final single, \\"In the Midnight Hour\\". When Guido fled to Canada to escape the draft, the band performed in two final gigs with Nicholson returning to the band, before disbanding in mid-1967. In 1979, following a returning interest in garage rock, the band's material was released on a compilation album titled Disco Sucks!, on the Keystone label. The album consisted of singles by the group, two tracks from 1972 reunion demos, work from Hocko's band, Galactus, and an outtake. The album was poorly circulated, however, and did not received as much attention as expected. A bootleg follow- up was released in 2003 on the Get Hip label called Disco Still Sucks!. It included all of the band's singles except \\"Two Tymes Too\\" and \\"Mr. Sad\\", along with more outtakes, and original material by Hocko. David Gannon died on October 4, 2014; he was 67 years old.

From 1966 to 1968 he was member of the German Council of Economic Experts (). He coined the concept of Macroeconomic Mechanics of Balances ().Short summaries of St√ºtzel's mechanics of balances in English are available in (1) Charlotte Bruun 1995: Logical Structures and Algorithmic Behavior in A Credit Economy (online), Chapter 3: \\"The Logical Structure of a Monetary Economy\\", pp. 78‚Äì98 (online); (2) Fabian Lindner 2015: Does Saving Increase the Supply of Credit? A Critique of Loanable Funds Theory (online), and (3) Johannes Schmidt 2016: Reforming the Undergrate Macroeconomics Curriculum: The Case for a Thorough Treatment of Accounting Relationships (online). Among other things, balances mechanics enabled the theories of John Maynard Keynes in which he argued that government deficit spending can be necessary during a deflationary depression to be placed on a formal, structural arithmetic foundation based on accounting identities. St√ºtzel used balances mechanics to explain how a deflationary depression results from aggregate planned revenues from sales of goods being greater than aggregate planned expenditures on purchasing goods. He also showed on the same basis how an inflationary exuberance results from aggregate planned expenditures for purchasing goods being greater than aggregate planned revenues from sales of goods. He, therefore, not only explained the validity of Keynes' theory of demand-driven output and employment but also showed that it applies only in the special case of a buyer's market situation.Wolfgang St√ºtzel (1953): Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft. Aalen 1979, p. 183-199  Life  Wolfgang St√ºtzel was born in Aalen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. His father Hermann St√ºtzel was a chemist, a master codebreaker in both war and peacetime, and ran a small pottery factory. His mother Frieda (Hennig) was from Wittenberg. He had three older siblings, a brother and two sisters.

T√ºbingen 2001, Vorwort V. In the spring of 1945, after one and a half years in a radio operators squad, he escaped from captivity in Italy. He began to study Protestant theology and ancient languages in T√ºbingen, Germany, because only the theology faculty was still operational. He began studying economics in 1947. He received his diploma in 1950, and a doctorate in 1952 for his thesis on The Relation of the Economy to the State ().Wolfgang St√ºtzel 1952: Preis, Wert und Macht.

He focused on banking management and national economics with emphasis on money, currency and credit. St√ºtzel became a member of the German Council of Economic Experts (Sachverst√§ndigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung) in February 1966, then resigned in September 1968 because he did not support the revaluation of the Deutsche Mark and his dissenting view was not accepted.Der Spiegel, 30.

He taught for almost thirty years as a professor at Saarland University, refusing several job offers at other universities. In 1986, St√ºtzel suffered a stroke from which he did not recover.

After the development of his Balances Mechanics of Economocs (), he adopted a critical approach against the prevailing doctrines of economics.Heiner Flassbeck: Gesamtwirtschaftliche Paradoxa und moderne Wirtschaftspolitik (PDF, 15 p.; 143 kB), Einf√ºhrung, p. 1. In the 1970s, St√ºtzel veered away more and more from Keynesian and demand-driven positions.Peter Bofinger: Wolfgang St√ºtzel After the recession of 1973/74, high unemployment had developed. St√ºtzel viewed that as a structural rather than a cyclical problem and advocated for cuts in the social sector and the reduction of job security protections. In his book Market Price and Human Dignity () he argued for a conversion of the social state according to the views of economic liberalism in the Kronberger Kreis.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Marktpreis und Menschenw√ºrde. Thesen zur Wirtschafts- und Bildungspolitik. Stuttgart 1981, p. 37: ‚ÄûIndem ich mich f√ºr eine Marktwirtschaft mit systemkonformer Sozialpolitik einsetze, setze ich mich nicht f√ºr einen Abbau ... des Systems sozialer Leistungen ein, wohl aber f√ºr dessen Umbau, und zwar f√ºr einen Umbau in eine Richtung, die nach allen dargelegten schlechten Erfahrungen der letzten Jahrzehnte darauf hinausl√§uft, dass das sozial Erstrebte unter geringerer Vergeudung volkswirtschaftlicher Ressourcen auch tats√§chlich erreicht und gehalten werden kann.‚Äú In his book, he explains his thesis that \\"good social intentions‚Äú can often have \\"evil social outcomes‚Äú - for example, strong job protections or excessive tariffs would reduce the ability of employers to employ people at all. The obligation for employers to continue to pay salaries in the case of employee illness would decrease the chances of employment for healthy people. He spoke for a \\"market economy with system compliant social policy‚Äú wherein the state's task is to ensure equal starting conditions and provide help to the weak, but there is little regulatory intervention in to the market economy. He was already questioning the belief that a healthy market economy would need continuous economic growth in the 1960s.Saarbr√ºcker Zeitung, 4 March 1987: Nachruf f√ºr Wolfgang St√ºtzel, verfasst von Prof. Johannes Welcker. = Fiscal and monetary policy = In 1968, as a member of the council of economic experts, St√ºtzel refused to support the revaluation of the Deutschemark. The recession of 1967, triggered by the high interest rates set by the German Federal Bank, had strongly decreased inflation in Germany and thereby given a price advantage to German exports. As a dedicated opponent of the revaluation (he was already against revaluation in 1961), St√ºtzel left the board in September 1968, in conflict with the majority of its board members.
