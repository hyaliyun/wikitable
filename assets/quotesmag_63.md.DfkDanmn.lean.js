It is expected to launch in November 2021. Formerly known as Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the mission was renamed after the introduction of the Artemis program. The launch will be held at Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center, where an Orion spacecraft will be sent on a mission of 25.5 days, 6 of those days in a retrograde orbit around the Moon. The mission will certify the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket for crewed flights beginning with the second flight test of the Orion and Space Launch System, Artemis 2, which will carry a crew of four around the Moon in 2023 for a week-long mission and back prior to the assembly of the Gateway.  Overview  Artemis 1 will use the Block 1 variant of the Space Launch System. The Block 1 will use five-segment solid rocket boosters producing of thrust at liftoff. The core stage will use four RS-25D engines of the Space Shuttle. The upper stage ICPS will be based on the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage, consisting of one RL10 engine. Once in orbit, the ICPS will perform a trans-lunar injection burn, which will transfer the Orion spacecraft and 13 CubeSats on the way to the Moon. If the maneuver is successful, the Orion will separate from the ICPS and coast to the Moon. The ICPS will deploy 13 CubeSats that will do scientific research and perform technology demonstrations. Originally, the mission was planned to follow a circumlunar trajectory without entering orbit around the Moon. Current plans are expected to have the Orion spacecraft spend approximately 3 weeks in space, including 6 days in a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon. History View of the Artemis 1 mission as it was planned in May 2019 The flight now named Artemis 1, was originally named by NASA Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) in 2012, when it was set to launch in 2017 as the first planned flight of the Space Launch System and the second uncrewed test flight of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle where Orion was to perform a circumlunar trajectory during a seven-day mission. Before then, this initial flight had been referred to as Space Launch System 1 or SLS-1. On 16 January 2013, NASA announced that the European Space Agency will build the European Service Module based on its Automated Transfer Vehicle, so the flight could also be regarded as a test of ESA hardware as well as American, and of how the ESA components interact with the American Orion components. The Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) flight article was consciously constructed in a way that if all the missing components (seats, life support systems) were added, it would not meet the mass target. In January 2015, NASA and Lockheed announced that the primary structure in the Orion spacecraft would be up to 25% lighter compared to the previous one. This would be achieved by reducing the number of cone panels from six (EFT-1) to three (EM-1), reducing the total number of welds from 19 to 7, saving the additional mass of the weld material. Other savings would be due to revisiting its various components and wiring. For Artemis 1, the Orion spacecraft will be outfitted with a complete life support system and crew seats, but will be left uncrewed. On the seats, two mannequins will be strapped and used as radiation imaging phantoms. Prior to April 2017, the planned initial launch date had slipped to November 2018, and in April 2017, NASA delayed the planned date to \\"sometime in 2019.\\" In the event, the 2019 planned launch date did not hold, and the maiden launch of SLS was subsequently further delayed; as of May 2020, it is currently planned for 2021. =Crewed Exploration Mission-1 study= Welding sequence of Orion spacecraft for Artemis 1 This flight will be uncrewed, however, NASA did a study in 2017, at the request of President Trump, to investigate a crewed version of the initial SLS flight. A crewed version of Exploration Mission-1 would have been composed of a crew of two astronauts, and the flight time would be much shorter than the uncrewed version due to safety reasons. The study investigated a crewed mission even with the possibility of further delays to the launch. On 12 May 2017, NASA revealed that it will not be sending astronauts to space for Orion's EM-1 mission following a months-long feasibility study. The study helped NASA make some decisions relating the flight test such as adding a full Orion hatch onto the spacecraft rather than a makeshift metal covering. =Alternative launcher study= On 13 March 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine testified in front of a Senate hearing that NASA was considering moving the Orion spacecraft that was to fly on the first Space Launch System mission to commercial rockets to keep that mission on schedule for mid-2020. Bridenstine stated that the \\"SLS is struggling to meet its schedule\\", and that \\"We're now understanding better how difficult this project is and that it is going to take some additional time\\". Bridenstine testified that NASA was considering launching the Orion spacecraft being built for Exploration Mission-1 on commercial vehicles such as Falcon Heavy or Delta IV Heavy. The mission would require two launches: one to place the Orion spacecraft into orbit around the Earth, and a second carrying an upper stage. The two would then dock while in Earth orbit and the upper stage would ignite to send Orion to the Moon. One challenge with this option would be carrying out that docking, as NASA does not have an ability to dock the Orion crew capsule with anything in orbit until Artemis 3. Since mid-2019, the idea was put on hold, due to another study's conclusion that it would delay the mission further. Orion payloads AstroRad vest on ISS NASA has partnered with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Israel Space Agency (ISA) in conjunction with StemRad and Lockheed Martin to perform the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE), which will measure tissue radiation dose deposition and test the effectiveness of the AstroRad radiation vest in the radiation environment beyond low Earth orbit. While radiation shielding strategies of the past have relied on storm shelters in which astronauts can seek refuge when solar storms erupt, the AstroRad's ergonomic design provides a mobile protection system with a similar shielding factor as storm shelters without hindering the astronauts' ability to perform their tasks. The crew compartment of the uncrewed Artemis 1 Orion spacecraft will include two female mannequins imaging phantoms which will be exposed to the radiation environment along the lunar orbit, including solar storms and galactic cosmic rays. One phantom will be shielded with the AstroRad vest and the other will be left unprotected. The phantoms provide the opportunity to precisely measure radiation exposure not only at the surface of the body but also at the exact location of sensitive organs and tissues inside the human body. Radiation exposure will be measured with the implementation of both passive and active dosimeters intentionally distributed throughout the inside of the anthropomorphic phantoms at precise locations of sensitive tissues and high stem cell concentrations. The results of MARE should enable Orion as a platform for other scientific experiments, provide accurate radiation risk projections of deep space exploration, and validate the protective properties of the AstroRad vest.International Science Aboard Orion EM-1: The Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE) Payload.

Secondary payloads MPCV Stage Adapter for 13 CubeSat spring-loaded dispensers Thirteen low-cost CubeSat missions were competitively selected as secondary payloads on Exploration Mission-1, later Artemis 1. All of them have the six-unit configuration, and will reside within the second stage on the launch vehicle from which they will be deployed. Two CubeSats have been selected through NASA's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnership, three through the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, two through the Science Mission Directorate, and three were chosen from submissions by NASA's international partners. The CubeSat spacecraft selected are: * ArgoMoon, designed by Argotec and coordinated by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), is designed to image the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) of Orion for mission data and historical records. It will demonstrate technologies necessary for a small spacecraft to maneuver and operate near the ICPS. * BioSentinel is an astrobiology mission that will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond low-Earth orbit. * CubeSat for Solar Particles (CuSP), designed at the Southwest Research Institute will study the dynamic particles and magnetic fields that stream from the Sun and as a proof of concept for the feasibility of a network of stations to track space weather. * EQUULEUS, designed by Japan's JAXA and the University of Tokyo, will image Earth's plasmasphere to study the radiation environment around the Earth while demonstrating low thrust maneuvers for trajectory control in the space between Earth and the Moon. * Lunar Flashlight is a lunar orbiter that will seek exposed water ice, and map its concentration at the scale within the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. * Lunar IceCube, a lunar orbiter designed at the Morehead State University, will search for additional evidence of lunar water ice from a low lunar orbit. * Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map), a lunar orbiter designed at the Arizona State University,LunaH-Map - Homepage at the Arizona State University. will map hydrogen within craters near the lunar south pole, tracking depth and distribution of hydrogen-rich compounds like water. It will use a neutron detector to measure the energies of neutrons that interacted with the material on the lunar surface. Its mission is planned to last 60 days and perform 141 orbits of the Moon. * Near-Earth Asteroid Scout is proof-of-concept of a controllable CubeSat solar sail spacecraft capable of encountering near-Earth asteroids (NEA). Observations will be achieved through a close (~) flyby and using a high resolution science-grade monochromatic camera to measure the physical properties of a near-Earth asteroid. A variety of potential targets would be identified based upon launch date, time of flight, and rendezvous velocity. * OMOTENASHI, designed by JAXA, is a lander probe to study the lunar radiation environment. * SkyFire is a spacecraft designed by Lockheed Martin to fly by the Moon and collect surface spectroscopy and thermography. The remaining three slots were selected through a competition pitting CubeSat teams from the United States against each other in a series of ground tournaments called 'NASA's Cube Quest Challenge', and were announced by NASA Ames on 8 June 2017. The competition was to contribute to opening deep-space exploration to non-government spacecraft. These slots were awarded to: * Cislunar Explorers will demonstrate the viability of water electrolysis propulsion and interplanetary optical navigation to orbit the Moon.

It is also known as \\"Tangkai\\" in other cultures. The takrut is similar to a talisman ( / transliterated: ). The word Takrut, is used for both Singular and Plural, although many people do add an 's' (Takruts). However, the proper way to refer to takrut when in plural, is 'Takrut'. They are worn by Thai people as a protective amulet and have existed for thousands of years. They are by rule, a talisman that is an elongated shape, taking the shape of a scroll. The scroll can be made of any type of metal, paper, leaf, papyrus, animal skin, or many other mediums, including bamboo and wood vines. They are mostly worn on a cord around the waist, but are also often seen accompanying amulet on neck chains. The Sacred Inscriptions made upon the Takrut are a form of Sacre Geometry based in Thai Buddhist and Ancient vedic and animist traditions, which has come to be a very well known Niche Topic around the world since the Hollywood movie star Angelina Jolie received a Sak Yant Tattoo, which is also a yantra like a Takrut, except tattooed in the skin. Also, since the existence of the now well known website on Sak Yant (sak- yant.com) and the more anthropological and academic website 'sakyant.org', both run by Ajarn Spencer Littlewood, (citation needed) it has caused a great increase in the amount of interest in both the tattooed aspect of sacred geometry and the beliefs in its magical powers, as well as in the Takrut Amulet, which is one of the most favored types of Thai amulet. Yant (ยันต์, talisman) are incantations and sacred geometry designs with Pali gatha and Buddhist prayers (Invocations and Empowerment Spells), usually, but not always inscribed using the Ancient Khom Pali (looks very similar to Khmer). In Northern Thailand, they use Lanna script and works just like Khom, except very similar to the actual Lanna script. The takrut is used for all purposes from Maha Sanaeh (attraction), Metta Mahaniyom (Business Success and Popularity), Mercy Charm, Maha Pokasap/Lap (Riches attraction), and Kong Grapan (Invincibility). Potential takeouts include gems, especially engraved gems, statues, coins, drawings, pendants, rings, plants and animals; even words in the form of a magical spell, incantation, to repel evil or bad luck. Variations of traditional takrut Takrut are usually put inside a special type of case and worn with a chain around the neck at chest level. They are also worn about the waist but can also be worn as most pieces of jewelry. They are worn about the body to protect specific parts of the body or to grant power to those body parts. But whether it is worn at the chest or the waist, its purpose is still the same: to give protection to its wearer. Some smaller takrut can be kept between the teeth to allow the carrier to be a more powerful speaker. This power is called sariga, a golden tongued celestial magpie, featured in Vedic and Thai Buddhist Legends.

The primary building on the complex is in the Italianate style and constructed in 1865. It is a three-story, 54 feet by 110 feet, stone structure built into a hillside. It features a bell tower, gable roof with dormers, stuccoed upper stories, and barrel vaults. The original building was enlarged on at least six occasions. A long, narrow stone addition (20 feet by 120 feet) was built in 1890 and expanded in 1903-1903 with a mansard roof in the Second Empire style. Another major addition was built in 1884 and expanded in 1887. It included a champagne fluting room, an additional storage vault, and tasting porch. A 54 feet by 109 feet addition of reinforced concrete was built in 1912. Other contributing buildings are the Pornace House (1909) and brandy distillery (1865). See also: History The Urbana Wine Company is four miles north of the village of Hammondsport, in the town of Urbana. The winery was established in 1865, and known as the Urbana Wine Company until 1881 when it was reorganized under the name of \\"New Urbana Wine Company\\". The company was renamed the \\"Urbana Wine Company\\" in 1896, and the company reorganized after the Volstead Act was ratified as the Amendment outlawing drinking alcohol. The company then was renamed the Gold Seal Products Company until the repeal of Prohibition, when the company changed its name back to \\"Urbana Wine Company, Inc.\\" During Prohibition the company produced sacramental wine. The company applied for the Gold Seal trademark in 1887. After Prohibition, Edwin Stewart Underhill, Jr., President of the company went to Rheims, France and brought Charles Fournier, from Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, where he served as Production Manager. He became the winemaker and production manager of Urbana Wine Company, and although intending to stay just a few years, remained employed there the rest of his life. He introduced several important French-American Hybrid grape varieties into the production of wine. He was made president of the company in 1951. The company was known for introducing the European Vitis vinifera grape to the United States and for its production of Finger Lakes champagne. Fournier brought Dr. Frank to help advance the effort to grow traditional European grapes in the Finger Lakes, and they brought Native American rootstock from Quebec to plant and graft with the European grapes in the Finger Lakes. These innovations proved visionary. They allowed grapes to grow in a cool climate, and to be resistant to the common phylloxtera louse, which decimated vineyards worldwide. In the 1950s, Dr. Konstantin Frank was a consultant to the winery and established a vitis vinifera grape nursery. He remained with the company until establishing his own winery in 1962. The Urbana Wine Company was renamed the \\"Gold Seal Vineyards, Inc.\\" in 1957 and it later was sold to Joseph E. Seagram & Sons in 1979, then to Vintners International in 1987 and in the 1990s to Canandaigua Wine Company which was later renamed Constellation Brands. The winery closed in May 1984 however some brands are still made with the Gold Seal name which is trademarked by Pleasant Valley Wine Company. The buildings and some acreage were sold to Linda & John Giglio in the first decade of the 21st century, and their effort to \\"restore\\" the properties began. Many wooden casks were sold and all the large stainless steel tanks used in wine production were removed. The new owners are about to begin a bright new chapter in the restoration of the building, removing several cinder-block additions of more recent years.

After some answers, he looked upon the Suzie Zeldin's response, who was also looking for musicians, and decided to meet each other. They soon found out that they had studied in the same school on Bellmore, Long Island, but never met. The two decided than to collaborated in music, around October 2006, naming the band under a different name \\"January Window\\", before changing it to The Narrative. Zeldin spoke to U-T San Diego, explaining the following about the change of band name, \\"We came up with the name while we were recording the 'Just Say Yes' EP. At one point, we had put together a list of random band names, mostly from literary terms, poems, or song lyrics we liked and sent them around to our friends. For a short time, we settled on January Window which is from a Sylvia Plath poem. We ended up not liking it after a while and revisited the list and found The Narrative Paradigm which seemed a little wordy and pretentious so we shortened it to The Narrative. We decided it was a good name and have been happy with it.\\" The band's first song released was the demo version of \\"End All\\", on January 1, 2007, which was later used on their debut album. Jesse would not sing in the band initially, but Suzie asked him and he decided to sing \\"Slide\\" by the Goo Goo Dolls.

The Seven Realms include the mountainous Queendom of the Fells, the Kingdom of Tamron, the Kingdom of Arden, the southern Kingdoms of Bruinswallow and We’enhaven, the Southern Islands, and the Northern Islands. The four books in the current series are: The Demon King, The Exiled Queen, The Gray Wolf Throne, and The Crimson Crown. A sequel series titled The Shattered Realms was released in 2016 with the first book titled Flamecaster. Set a generation after The Seven Realms, the books are set in the same world, following the progeny of many of the characters in the original series. The four books in this series are: \\"Flamecaster\\", \\"Shadowcaster\\", \\"Stormcaster\\", and \\"Deathcaster\\". Synopsis 16-year-old Han Alister encounters three underage wizards setting fire to the sacred mountain of Hanalea. Alister is unaware that this will lead to a series of events that threaten to consume the world in chaos. To prevent the wizard Micah from using a magical amulet against him, he makes Micah give him the amulet. Later Alister learns that the amulet has an evil history, and it once belonged to the Demon King. The Demon King is an evil sorcerer who almost destroyed the world a millennia ago. Now, the wizards will stop at nothing to get their amulet back. Meanwhile, Princess Raisa ana’Marianna, heir to the Gray Wolf throne of the Fells, has her own battles to fight. After spending three years of freedom with her father’s family at Demonai Camp, riding, hunting, and working at the famous Clan markets, she learns that her life is going to completely change. Court life in Fellsmarch pinches like a pair of tight shoes, and Raisa feels like a cage is closing in around her. However, an arranged marriage and an eroded inheritance are the least of her struggles. The power of the Wizard Council is growing, and her people are starving and rebellious. Even though both Alister and Raisa come from different backgrounds, they wind up in a race to keep balance in the Queendom and to save Fellsmarch. Series * The Demon King * The Exiled Queen * The Gray Wolf Throne * The Crimson Crown Main characters =Hanson Alister= Hanson Alister, Han for short, is the first main character that the reader meets. He is presented as the tragic hero and the dangerous charmer throughout the series, going by various names. In his early life as a gang leader, he went by Cuffs Alister (referring to a permanent pair of silver handcuffs he has worn since birth, which became his gang trademark). His clan name is Hunts Alone and spends every summer in Marisa Pines. Growing up, Alister led a gang known as the Raggers, which he abandoned for his younger sister's safety. Alister tells his mother that he wishes to start a life making an honest living. This would normally take him to the clans in the Spirit Mountains, where he learned hunting, botany and other fresh-air trades. He also acted as delivery boy for the mysterious Lucius Frowsley. Alister is now sixteen and comes across the wizard Micah Bayar and his cousins, while hunting with his clan brother, Fire Dancer. The other boys are wizards, who have started a magical forest fire (supposedly so that Princess Raisa and her mother can hunt upland deer). After a standoff, Alister takes Micah's magic amulet, sparking a series of events that include Alister being accused of murders, kidnapping a disguised Princess Raisa and accidentally causing the death of his sister and mother after a standoff with Lord Bayar, Micah Bayar's father. Taking refuge again with the Spirit clans, Alister learns that he is actually the descendant of the villainous Demon King. Alister finds out he is actually a wizard himself (his silver cuffs have drained his natural magic since birth). Alister agrees to travel with Fire Dancer to Oden's Ford wizard university, Mystwerk, where he will learn wizardry. This will lead him to champion the clans against wizards led by the Bayars. Han's amulet is a relic of the Breaking which once belonged to the Demon King. A mysterious man, known as Crow, is sealed inside the amulet and he teaches Han ancient magic. Alister is described as a handsome young man with a scar near his right eye and a large personality. This resulted in several flirtations with females throughout the series. The silver cuff once worn around his wrists are magical restraints put on when he was a child. Since the beginning of his education, his appearance has changed to that of a bluebloods, or the people of the castle close, changing clothes, style and personality in order to fit in with the other bluebloods at Odens Ford. It has been said that Han has a face for different situations. He has a face of the former thief who isn't afraid of violence, then he can swiftly change to a charming young man that wins the hearts of women. =Raisa ana'Marianna= Raisa ana'Marianna, also known as Rebecca Morley, Briar Rose, or Brianna Trailwalker, is the princess heir of the Fells. She is known to be stubborn, headstrong, and ill tempered but has a kind heart. She is shown to believe in justice such as when she starts a prison escape to save tortured Raggers. Raisa is 16-years-old and is short with long, thick black hair. Her skin is said to be honey colored and her eyes emerald green. She is said to be very beautiful, with a waist a man can put his two hands around. At the beginning of the series, she is shown to be very naive - such as when she told Han he would be given a fair trial if he gave himself in; over the series, she becomes more worldly. Her best friend, Amon Byrne, is the captain of her guard. They nearly shared a romantic relationship, but that quickly ended when Raisa learned of the Bonding, but they remained best friends throughout the series. Oden's Ford: She left her queendom when her mother tried to force her into an illegal marriage, to Micah Bayar, under the influence of the High Wizard. The marrying of a queen to a wizard consort has been banned since the Naèming - the ceremony which was done by the Queen Hanalea in order to save the world from the Demon King in the Breaking. Raisa then traveled to Wein House at Oden's Ford, the best academy in all of the Seven Realms. She is accompanied by Amon and his triple, the gray wolves, with whom she forms close bonds with. There she crosses path with Han Alister who only knows her as Rebecca Morley. They quickly become entangled with each other. It is shown throughout the 2nd book (The Exiled Queen) that they both have deep feelings for one another. Her relationship with her mother isn't the best because her mother, Queen Marianna, favored her younger sister, Princess Mellony. Raisa and the queen are considered to be complete opposites, even in their appearance. But even though the relationship between Raisa and her mother is not optimal, she is very sad when her mother dies, leaving her as queen. Raisa takes after her father, Lord Averill Ligthfoot, a Demonai warrior and Royal Consort to the Queen. Her crest and clan name is Briar Rose. =Amon Byrne= Amon Byrne is introduced after he comes back from Wien House in Oden's Ford. Princess Raisa and Amon grew up as childhood best friends. Despite their difference in station, they were forced together due to the lack of children in court. They are still very close, and there is a steadfast romantic attraction that follows the two of them throughout several of the books, but the difference in their stations, and the bonding between the queen and the captain of the guard, keeps them apart. Throughout the series, Amon is completely concerned with Princess Raisa's safety and makes that clear to her numerous times, mostly to her dismay. Amon is also very blunt, kind, caring, honest, and straight to the point. Eventually, he becomes the Captain of the Queen's Guard. He is the son of Edon Byrne, the Captain of the Queen's Guard before him. He is also the commander of the Gray Wolves and attends Wien House in Oden's Ford with Princess Raisa for a time and is a commander there. =Mellony ana'Marianna= Princess Mellony ana'Marianna is the younger princess of the Fells. She is described as favoring the side of her mother, Queen Marianna ana'Lissa, by the blue eyes, blond hair, fair complexion, and most of all, her naive personality. In the beginning of the series, Mellony is described as \\"bubbly and outgoing\\". However, that changes when Raisa leaves the queendom, as Mellony succumbs to the throne and overlooks it as an attraction for her daring yet dangerous crush, Micah Bayar. In a certain event, the two are seen kissing passionately. Mellony begins to overlook the title of being a Gray Wolf queen and makes some choices that affect the queendom of the Fells greatly, such as not believing Raisa when Raisa accuses their dead mother of forcing her to marry the young Lord Bayar, which Mellony does not believe, because she overlooks Micah as a handsome toy she will later throw away. Mellony is the favored daughter of Queen Marianna and is rather spoiled, believing that once she has the throne, she can have the only thing she wants: Micah Bayar. =Micah Bayar= Micah Bayar is the handsome and daring son of the High Wizard, Gavan Bayar, and brother to Fiona. He is also related to Fire Dancer of Marisa Pines Camp, as his father seduced his mother for her looks and personality, as a younger half-brother. He begins to take an interest in Princess Raisa ana'Marianna for a bride, as instructed to by his father. When Raisa leaves the queendom, he is under the control of his father and takes control of Mellony, though he prefers Raisa. He is a powerful wizard, but not nearly as skilled as Han.

Portugal At the beginning of the 19th century, Portuguese overseas territories were referred to as overseas dominions; however, following administrative reforms, the term overseas province began to be used. This was in keeping with the idea of pluricontinentalism, or the idea that Portugal existed as a single, transcontinental country and therefore its territories were integral to the Portuguese state. Overseas possessions were seen as a part of the Portuguese identity. By the 20th century, most of these territories were referred to as colonies, although the term overseas province was concurrently used. The name was made official in 1951 by Antonio Salazar during the Estado Novo regime in order to retain the republic's remaining colonies and appease anti-colonial demands from the United Nations.G. J. Bender (1978), Angola Under the Portuguese: The Myth and the Reality, Berkeley, University of California Press p.xx. At the time, the following territories were reclassified: * Portuguese Angola * Portuguese Cape Verde * Portuguese Guinea * Portuguese Macau * Portuguese Mozambique * Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe * Portuguese Timor * State of India, including Damaon The classification lasted until the 1974 Carnation Revolution which lead to the dissolving of the Estado Novo regime, rapid decolonization of Portuguese Africa, and the annexation of Portuguese Timor by Indonesia. The remaining overseas provinces of the Azores and Madeira had their constitutional status subsequently changed to autonomous regions. In 1976, the territory of Macau became known as a \\"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\\" and was granted more of administrative, financial, and economic autonomy. Three years later, Portugal and China agreed to once again rename Macau, this time as \\"a Chinese territory under (temporary) Portuguese administration. This classification lasted until the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau and transfer of sovereignty of Macau from Portugal to the People's Republic of China in 1999.

The main characters refer to their employer as 'the Office', although it is not specified that it is Mossad (known internally in the Israeli intelligence community as HaMisrad [עברית: המשרד], literally 'the Office'). Allon's career began in 1972 when he, Eli Lavon and several others were plucked from civilian life by Ari Shamron to participate in Operation Wrath of God, an act of vengeance to hunt down and eliminate those responsible for killing the Israel athletes in Munich. Wrath of God is referenced in the books throughout the course of his life. Character biography Allon is portrayed as a sabra whose first language was German. He was raised Jewish, albeit in a secular home in the Jezreel Valley, and was not familiar with Shabbat candles until he saw them as an adult. That his parents, specifically his mother, Irene, was a Holocaust survivor (from Berlin) is a thread throughout the series; it is often alluded to that her unwillingness to discuss what happened to her is part of what makes Allon such a good spy and master of secrets. Not much is known about Allon's father beyond his death in the Six-Day War, other than that he was a Holocaust survivor (like his future wife) who was born and raised in Munich. According to Shamron, Gabriel's name was chosen for a reason, \\"Your mother named you Gabriel for a reason. Michael is the highest [angel], but you, Gabriel, are the mightiest. You're the one who defends Israel against its accusers. You're the angel of judgment -- the Prince of Fire.\\" Several books in the series make reference to Allon's linguistic versatility and it is confirmed that he speaks fluent English, French, German, Hebrew, and Italian, as well as also passable Arabic and Spanish. In The Prince of Fire, Silva lets the readers know that German, which he speaks with the Berlin accent of his mother, was his first language and remains the language of his dreams. According to press for The English Girl, Allon is in his 60s. Allon's grandfather was a well-known Berlin-based German Expressionist painter who passed his talents on to his daughter (Gabriel's mother) before he was killed at Auschwitz in January 1943. She, it turn, passed these talents to Gabriel. Allon served in the army and chose to attend the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. It was at Bezalel in Jerusalem in 1972 when Shamron approached him to join the Office and take part in the retribution operation being carried out by Israel against the Black September terrorists in retaliation for perpetrating the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Gabriel was one of the primary assassins in the operation conducted across Europe which lasted three years, resulting in the derailment of Gabriel's then-likely future career as a painter. In the aftermath, he left the Office and under the cover of an Italian art restorer, Mario Delvecchio, he lived in Cornwall while working for a London-based art dealer, Julian Isherwood. However, he was reluctantly convinced to return to the Office, while simultaneously continuing to work as Delvecchio in England and Italy as his primary unofficial cover, which also continues to play a large role in Allon's life. After long efforts to resist the move, Gabriel eventually becomes head of the Office. In January 1991, while on assignment in Vienna, Allon's car was bombed, resulting in the death of his son and serious injury to his wife, Leah. His wife survived and lives in a psychiatric hospital on Mount Herzl, not far from where their son is buried on the Mount of Olives. Allon felt he had to make peace with Leah's situation before he could propose to or marry Chiara, the Italian-born Office field operative who later becomes his second wife. His son's ghost frequently haunts Allon, especially after Chiara's miscarriage following her kidnapping and their ensuing inability to conceive. After many years, Chiara gets pregnant again, and delivers twins, a girl Irene, named in memory of Gabriel’s mother, and a boy, Raphael. Real-life spies that may have inspired some elements of Allon's fictional biography include Peter Malkin and Mike Harari. Real world impact The books are never explicit in the year in which they're set, although there are sometimes references to real-world events, such as the changing American presidency. In The Fallen Angel, Allon makes references to meeting Chiara ten years prior, which roughly matches up to the books' annual releases. However some titles, especially Moscow Rules and The Defector take place within greater proximity to one another based on the books' events. In an interview that coincided with the release of Moscow Rules, Silva revealed he heard an art professional quote Allon and some real-world news accounts make reference to the Allon series and wonder whether the specific news will become part of the series. Main characters =Gabriel's Team= Allon's team is known by the code name Barak, the Hebrew word for lightning. and most of his team plays a role throughout the novels in the series. Some of them include: *Ari Shamron — former head of the Office. A Polish-born Jew from Lviv, his parents sent him to Israel as a teenager before the war; consequently he was the only member from his entire extended family to survive the Holocaust. Shamron is a father figure and mentor to Gabriel and the person who recruited him into the Office with the three-year Wrath of God operation. To Allon and his team, he's known as the Memuneh (Hebrew for 'the one in charge'). He is officially retired as the head of the Office, but it still remains his private fiefdom; he groomed and raised an entire generation of its officers, many of whom comprise much of the service's current senior management and executive staff. Eventually after the departure of two of his successors, he makes Uzi Navot the director general of the Office after finally giving up trying to perpetually force Gabriel to take the job (who repeatedly refused to accept the position). He is known throughout the Israeli intelligence community as the Old Man, being one of the last remaining members of the generation of spymasters who founded the state back in 1948 and as a result whose advice and counsel is still sought out regularly by the highest ranking leaders of the current Israeli defense and security establishment. While his age isn't explicitly referenced (or consistent through the series) his aging and health is of concern to Allon and his team; it is mentioned many times that he is also an incessant chain-smoker of sixty filthy, vile-smelling Turkish cigarettes daily. Gilah, Ari's long suffering wife, frequently plays a role as a mother figure to Gabriel and his team. Shamron's niece Rimona Stern is a key figure in Gabriel's team. While Shamron's character is clearly based in history (he is known to Gabriel and his team [as well as most Israelis] as the man who apprehended Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires) his real-world character is never identified in the novels. However, in an interview, Silva said that Shamron is a composite of several historical figures including Isser Harel, head of Mossad when Eichmann was apprehended. Following this connection, Harel wanted to meet Silva, but they were not able to establish a meeting before Harel died. *Chiara Allon (née Zolli) — Gabriel's wife and now retired Office agent whom he meets in The Confessor. She is the incredibly beautiful and intelligent daughter of Venice's chief rabbi. After what happened with his wife and son, he wasn't sure he could ever let himself fall in love another woman ever again, and it took several years (and the light but unending pressure and reminding of Shamron and his wife) for him to be willing to marry Chiara. When they first meet at her father's office in Venice during the course of his investigation into a Brenzone abbey (in the third book), he does not realize Chiara is a member of the Office, later having been assigned to follow him while he was in Rome. When he escapes while under fire (and wounded) from the Carabinieri who have been sent to apprehend him at a Rome hotel (albeit on a false tip), she saves his life when he is cornered in an Rome alleyway by an assassin in pursuit, appearing at the last moment on a motorcycle, taking him to an Office safehouse where she bandages his wounds and sits awake at his bedside with a pistol in her lap through the night, standing guard over him while he sleeps. She holds a master's degree in history from the University of Padua. Her own background and understanding of art and history as someone who grew up in the Jewish ghetto in Venice is a nice complement to Allon's art restoring work. *Uzi Navot – first appears early in the series as the Office chief of station in Paris, steadily advancing to assume responsibility for supervision for all western European case officers, later director of special operations and as Office director general. He is not viewed as successful in this role and is eventually replaced by Gabriel, who convinces Navot to remain and work under Allon. Like Gabriel, he is the son of Holocaust survivors (albeit several years younger and from a long lineage of Viennese Jews). Also very linguistically versatile; known to be fluent in English, French, German and Hebrew, as well as speaking passable Arabic and Spanish. He eventually marries Bella, his longtime on-and- off lover, who is a university professor in Israel. Uzi's appetite and fluctuating weight is regularly mentioned as a problem for him, as well as Bella's unremitting monitoring and occasional verbal scolding of him for it, much to the amusement of other characters. *Eli Lavon — a former Office agent who is now a professor of biblical archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The wispy haired professor is usually on an excavation when Gabriel recruits him to take part in another job. Their history together dates back to Gabriel Allon's first mission, Operation Wrath of God, for which Lavon was an ayin, a tracker and surveillance specialist. He is known as the finest street surveillance operative that the Office has ever produced; No recruit graduates from the Office training academy without spending a few days studying at the feet of Eli Lavon. After the Wrath of God operation he resigned from the Office and moved to Vienna, where until the bombing at the beginning of the 4th novel, he was the director of a very successful Holocaust restitution research and investigative agency named the Bureau of Wartime Claims and Inquiries. Lavon is shown to speak fluent English, German, Hebrew and Russian, as well as passable French. It is stated that Lavon is several years older than Gabriel and that he has known Gabriel longer and better than anyone else among the supporting cast, except Ari Shamron. *Shimon Pazner – Negev-born Office chief of station in Rome (which doubles as headquarters for Office operations throughout the Mediterranean). Usually interacts or meets with Gabriel during operations in Italy. Gabriel's requesting and Pazner's granting of unwarranted favors and Gabriel's subsequent actions usually end up destroying Pazner's goodwill towards him and often nearly his career in the process. *Dina Sarid — an Office research department analyst driven by an attack by a suicide bomber that injured her and killed her mother and two sisters. She still walks with a limp. Her encyclopedic knowledge of names, faces and dates of terrorist attacks is second to none. Is part of the assorted group that comprises Gabriel's Barak team that assembles on short notice in response to occurrences of terrorist attacks and operations. *Rimona Stern—Shamron's niece who Allon has known since she was a child. A major in the IDF's military intelligence directorate, in later books it is stated that she assigned to Israel's joint task force assigned to deal with Iran's increasing imminent nuclear ambitions. *Mikhail Abramov — Moscow-born former special forces officer currently on loan to the Office from the IDF's elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit. Has been described as Gabriel without a conscience, having dismantled a large portion of the upper echelons of Hamas and Islamic Jihad \\"practically by himself\\". Was romantically linked to Sarah Bancroft. *Yaakov Rossman — an active case officer in Shabak who serves in the Arab Affairs department, running agents and sources inside the West Bank and Gaza. Speaks fluent Arabic. Known as one of Shabak's most skilled interrogators. *Oded — German-speaking agent often used by Gabriel as an all- purpose operative who specializes in the direct (and often lethal) action portions of Gabriel's operations (kidnappings, interrogations, mobile hit-and- runs, etc.) Usually brought in by Gabriel with Mordecai. *Mordecai — usually brought in by Gabriel with Oded. The primary tech specialist and troubleshooter within Gabriel's team, specializing in vehicular surveillance, communications, and electronics equipment/devices. Combat/Muscle Section There is no part of the team that is actually called that (or something similar) in the series, but what it refers to is the specific members of Gabriel's team that have significant combat training and generally support Gabriel during the more physical and deadly aspects of his operations (armed and hand-to-hand combat, kidnappings, interrogations, and executions) while all the other members of his team stay behind. This usually includes: *Mikhail: (always). As the member of the team with the most advanced combat/special forces training (armed, hand to hand, and otherwise) aside from Gabriel, Mikhail usually acts as Gabriel's motorcycle driver on drive-by hits (or vice versa), as well as his primary partner while executing targets on foot. *Yaakov: an integral part of this section, specializing primarily in conducting interrogations but also usually present while conducting surveillance, armed assaults as well as kidnappings. Occasionally acts as Gabriel's driver. *Uzi: when present. Although not an expert like Gabriel and Mikhail (or always in the best of shape physically), as a katsa Uzi has extensive combat and firearms training. Also as easily the largest man on Gabriel's team in terms of size he is usually the one who breaches the entrances when the element of surprise is no longer a factor. *Oded: when present. Participating in any physical aspects, doing a little of everything. =Other recurring characters= *Leah Allon - like Gabriel, an artist, she was severely burned in the bomb attack that killed their son and left her physically and mentally impaired. Other than for brief instances of lucidity, a combination of depression and post-traumatic stress has left her mind permanently replaying the events leading up to the Vienna bombing. She had been originally placed in a psychiatric hospital in England, but after a kidnapping, she was moved to an Israeli hospital on Mount Herzl. *Sarah Bancroft — CIA officer who worked with Gabriel and his Office team on several assignments. The daughter of a wealthy Citibank executive, she spent most of her early years being educated at the finest boarding schools throughout western Europe, returning to the States to attend university. Holds a bachelor's in art history from Dartmouth; studied at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London before receiving a Ph.D from Harvard, where she was the author of a highly acclaimed doctoral dissertation on the German Expressionists. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks (in which her fiancée was killed) she applied to the CIA, but was dismissed. When Carter arranges for Gabriel to meet her during The Messenger as a prospective candidate for an assignment in a joint US-Israeli deep cover operation, she was working as a curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington. Later in the series, after working with him on an operation, she dated Mikhail for a significant period (much to Gabriel's consternation). *Graham Seymour — the Oxbridge-educated deputy director general of MI5, known to be several years older than Gabriel. Shown to be a very strict by-the-book officer in regards to operational parameters (often legally-speaking) and very much attuned to internal British politics in regards to MI5/MI6. Often very hesitant and wary to grant Gabriel permission to operate on British soil and very quick to reprimand Gabriel's actions and distance himself if their joint operations go awry. Over the course of the series, he begins to see Gabriel and the Israelis in a much more forgiving light, to the point where in the later books he considered Gabriel to be a good and trusted friend, especially after The English Spy, when he becomes the director general of MI6. After UK Prime Minister Jonathan Lancaster's mistress Madeline Hart is kidnapped and vanishes, he turns to Seymour for help, who entrusts Gabriel with the task of investigating. After Gabriel is successful in unearthing the kidnapping plot, the Russian government's involvement, and locating and rescuing Madeline Hart and returning her to London, his esteem for Gabriel increases significantly. *Adrian Carter – longtime CIA director of operations, later director of clandestine services. Known to be a polyglot. Has a decades-long working relationship with Shamron (known to be several years older than Carter) as well as a strong professional and personal relationship with Seymour. His service (the CIA) generally ends up footing the bill of all of the Anglo- Israeli joint operations and is responsible for the documentation (passports, visas, etc.), as well as logistical relations and political support from other countries not usually involved and their corresponding security and intelligence services. His relations with Gabriel tend to be much warmer than Seymour's. *Julian Isherwood, born Isakowitz — the son of a Jewish Parisian art dealer, he was smuggled out of France before the Nazis killed his father. He is owner of Isherwood Fine Arts, a London-based art gallery specializing in Old Masters. Was recruited as a sayan by Shamron in the mid-1970s for one very specific purpose: to facilitate and maintain the identity of Mario Delvecchio, a Cornwall-based Italian expatriate art restorer of Old Masters paintings; in reality the operational cover of Gabriel Allon. *Christopher Keller — The London-born son of Harley Street physicians, Keller enlisted in the British Army against the wishes of his parents and was accepted into the Special Air Service, becoming known as one of its most talented and accomplished operatives, assigned to the Sabre squadron, specializing in desert warfare. He served undercover in Belfast in the mid-1980s, until he was caught by the IRA and tortured. He managed to escape and kill all of his captors in the process. In 1991, he was deployed to Iraq with his SAS squadron, and was thought to have been killed as a result of a friendly fire incident. He survived, and managed to make his way to Corsica, where Don Orsati took him into his employ as one of his professional assassins, becoming his most valuable employee. He was the antagonist in The English Assassin but returned in The English Girl, The Heist and The English Spy to work with Gabriel and his team. At the end of The English Spy, he returned to service with the United Kingdom.

The Voice was centrally concerned with the dramatic social changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution, as workers came to depend on corporations for a wage. The Voice, a small four-page newspaper, started publication on May 29, 1845 in Fitchburg, Massachusetts under the auspices of the New England Workingmen's Association, with the young mechanic William F. Young at the helm. While primarily concerned with land and labor reform, the paper addressed a number of other social issues, including war, education, women's rights, religion, slavery, and prison reform. All of the writing was done by the \\"workingmen and women,\\" who, Young wrote in his inaugural editorial, \\"can wield the pen with as much perfection as the instruments of their respective vocations,\\" and to whom he extended \\"a hearty welcome ... whether they agree with us on all points or not.\\" Shortly after it was established, the paper moved from Fitchburg to Lowell, where it was adopted by the first union of working women in the United States, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association led by the young labor leader Sarah Bagley.  Criticism of the Industrial Revolution  Workers writing in the Voice were sharply critical of the character and effects of the Industrial Revolution. Their concerns mirrored those of the broader American labor movement in the 1840s, a period in which worker unrest was directed towards the loss of status and economic independence experienced under the new economic system. It was, as the historian Norman Ware noted, \\"this social revolution that primarily affected the industrial worker in this period, and against which his protests were made. At the center of this revolution was a dramatic loss of control over economic life, as workers were made to sell their labor for a wage. This new dependence was, they argued, the natural result of an economic system driven by an imperative to accumulate wealth. It was this acquisitive, selfish drive that was the target of many workers in the 1840s who opposed the new economic order. Accordingly, criticism in the Voice spanned a broad range. Workers denounced the new ethic of accumulation itself, seeing it as both immoral and destructive of the benevolent parts of human nature. They expressed alarm at how the profit motive directed technological change, as new 'labor-saving' machinery that might have been used to reduce toil was instead deployed to increase output. They protested the new ways of organizing work, which, in the name of maximizing profit, was divided into confined, repetitive tasks that diminished their capacity for self- development. They were dismayed by how economic power infected the political system, resulting in dubious and expensive wars, and making labor reform efforts difficult. And all of this, of course, in addition the harsh disciplinary power wielded by the corporations directly, which worsened their position amidst unprecedented corporate prosperity. = Loss of status and independence = The overarching theme of worker protests during the 1840s was, as Norman Ware has observed, the loss status and independence that took place as \\"sovereignty in economic affairs passed from the community as a whole into the keeping of a specialized class\\". Ware notes that this shift was symbolized by the changing terms of the labor contract, in which the term \\"price\\" was displaced with \\"wage\\", as work was divorced from social life and offered as a commodity for sale: > The old term for the remuneration of the mechanic was 'price'. It referred > to his product rather than to his labor, for it was his product that he > sold. When the producer, whether master or journeyman, sold his product, he > retained his person. But when he came to sell his labor, he sold himself. > The term 'wage' that displaced 'price' as the Industrial Revolution advanced > had formerly applied only to day labor, and the extension of the term to the > skilled worker was regarded by him as a symbol of a deeper change. Significantly, many workers in the 1840s saw their new, dependant status as opposed to American ideals of freedom and equality. This was especially true of the women writing in the Voice, many of whom were granddaughters of American revolutionaries, and self-identified as \\"Daughters of Freemen.\\" These women, the historian Thomas Dublin observes, felt \\"no deference toward their employers,\\" expressing the conviction that they \\"were the social equals of their overseers, indeed of the millowners themselves.\\" This sense of dignity and social equality had played a significant role in the strikes of the previous decade, which were prompted by wage cuts by the mills. In response to one of these cuts in 1834, a petition circulated \\"to obtain the names of all who imbibe the spirit of our Patriotic Ancestors who preferred privation to bondage,\\" was signed by 800 women, and concluded with the following poem: > Let oppression shrug her shoulders, > And a haughty tyrant frown, > And little upstart Ignorance, > In mockery look down. > Yet I value not these feeble threats > Of Tories in disguise, > While the flag of Independence > O’er our noble nation flies. This identification with revolutionary republicanism continued into the 1840s. Much of the writing in the Voice, such as this piece advocating for the Ten Hour workday, evokes the rhetoric of the American Revolution: > Are you the sons of those who fought so nobly the battles of freedom? Are > you the sons of the fathers of '76? If so, let your voices be heard in > thundertones, and your hands be stretched forth to save us from the same > evils that threatened us when they declared themselves free from a foreign > power. = Selfish individualism as immoral = Workers were bitterly opposed to the ethic of selfish individualism at the heart of the new economic system. One labor leader, writing in the Voice, denounced this new \\"Spirit of the Age\\", the imperative that people \\"get gain … gain wealth … forgetting all but self.\\" A society organized on principles of selfish individualism was, a worker in the Voice put it, \\"at war with the better and higher feelings of man's nature.\\" The emphasis on accumulation was seen by many as corroding the more altruistic and social parts of human nature. \\"Man is a social being,\\" wrote another worker, \\"the very nature and the circumstances necessary to the development of his natural capacities proclaim. ... Sympathy,\\" he continued, was \\"the only true principle\\" which \\"rightly associates the human family. But how often is this great principle misruled by the demands of want – or the schemes of vain or pecuniary policies?\\" The single-minded pursuit of wealth had equally pernicious effects on the minds of the industrialists who oppressed them. \\"Business men,\\" wrote one operative, \\"in the general scramble for more, almost or entirely neglect all faculties of the mind but those directly called into action by their love of gain.\\" This \\"love and pursuit of riches\\" not only \\"choke[s] the mind and dwarfs it,\\" wrote another operative, \\"but the disease itself is hopelessly beyond remedy.\\" The profit motive was also seen as in conflict with Christian ideals of benevolence and charity. Many workers voiced intense opposition to an economic system founded on the sin of \\"avarice,\\" and the \\"undue exercise of … selfish propensities.\\" The pursuit of wealth, wrote one worker, \\"make[s] a total wreck of everything noble, generous or philanthropic,\\" making \\"dollars … the only joyous sounds that strike upon the ear…the only objects of sincere worship.\\" The divorce of religious principles from industrial relations was, in the words of another, \\"a fatal wrong\\", which allowed \\"professed christians to practice injustice in their business, social and political capacities.\\" They were equally critical of fellow workers who worshiped \\"at the altar of mammon,\\" a Biblical reference to the demon of gluttony and riches. Disturbed by the rapid spread of this selfish, individualistic ethic, workers looked to the various reform movements of the period, which organized production according to cooperative, rather than competitive, principles. = Technology as biased towards output = Many workers were alarmed the disconnect between the enormous liberating potential of the new 'labor-saving' machinery, and the way this technology was instead developed and applied, in the name of maximizing profit, to increase output. Machinery, they argued, should be developed with the aim of freeing people from toil, allowing them more time to cultivate and develop their talents.\\"With such gigantically increased means of production,\\" wrote one worker, \\"would it not be supposed that the Laboring Classes would be rendered more comfortable?\\" Instead, they watched with dismay as their work increased, and was fragmented into narrow, routine tasks, leaving them physically and mentally debased. \\"Compared with their employers,\\" wrote a worker in the Voice, \\"[workers] are as a class sinking day by day into a still deeper degradation.\\" Another observed that while there was now \\"machinery enough in New England to do the work of five times its present population performed in the old way ... the consequence is we are nearer starvation.\\" This was not the attack of the caricatured, machine-sabotaging, \\"luddite.\\" These workers were instead criticizing the definition of \\"efficiency\\" under the new economic system, in which \\"costs\\" were restricted to monetary expenses, and \\"benefits\\" were defined by physical output. Any benefit outside of this narrow calculus—such as whether the work was enjoyable, or was designed to engage workers' intelligence—were not counted as a \\"gain\\", and was seen instead as either irrelevant or counterproductive to \\"profitable\\" work. = Criticism of the division of labor = Workers were also critical of the new ways in which factory work was organized, which was often reduced to fragmented, monotonous, and tedious tasks. While this division of labor produced unprecedented increases in productivity and output, workers were weary of its effects on their character, and their capacities for learning and self-development. Many workers had come to Lowell for its vibrant, working class intellectual culture: they read voraciously in libraries and reading rooms, attended public lectures on topics ranging from astronomy to music, and even pursued literary composition (defying factory rules, some would even fasten verses to their spinning frames, \\"to train their memories,\\" and pin up mathematical problems in the rooms where they worked).See generally, articles and pieces in \\"The Life of the Mind\\", at industrialRevolution.org: http://industrialrevolution.org/the-life-of-the-mind.html}} But they quickly found that this desire and capacity for self-development was incompatible with the long days filled with dreary tasks required by factory work. \\"Who,\\" asked an operative writing in the Voice, \\"after thirteen hours of steady application to monotonous work, can sit down and apply her mind to deep and long continued thought? … Where is the opportunity for mental improvement?\\" A former Lowell operative, looking back on her experience in the mills, expressed a similar view: \\"After one has worked from ten to fourteen hours at manual labor, it is impossible to study History, Philosophy, or Science,\\" she wrote. \\"I well remember the chagrin I often felt when attending lectures, to find myself unable to keep awake. ... I am sure few possessed a more ardent desire for knowledge than I did, but such was the effect of the long hour system, that my chief delight was, after the evening meal, to place my aching feet in an easy position, and read a novel.\\" This sentiment—that repetitive and exhausting work was corrosive to \\"the expression and cultivation of the intellectual powers\\"—echoed concerns about the division of labor voiced by Adam Smith from almost a century earlier. In the Wealth of Nations Smith had observed that a worker \\"whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations…has no occasion to exert his understanding…He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.\\" Smith argued that this epidemic of \\"gross ignorance and stupidity\\" wrought by the division of labor in civilized societies can be countered by extensive public education. = Worker losses amidst prosperity = The Voice appeared during a period of unprecedented, explosive growth in the textile industry: between 1840 and 1860, the number of spindles in use went from two million to over five million; bales of cotton used from 300,000 to nearly a million, and the number of workers from 72,000 to nearly 122,000. This tremendous growth translated directly into large profits for the textile corporations. Between 1846 and 1850 the dividends of the \\"Boston Capitalists,\\" the group of textile companies that founded Lowell, averaged 14% per year. Most corporations recorded similarly high profits during this period. Workers saw none of these gains. Indeed, most saw their positions decline sharply during the 1840s, as the corporations employed fewer workers to tend more machines at faster speeds, for reduced wages. Not surprisingly, this gave rise to considerable discontent. Writing in the Voice as \\"one of the vast army of sufferers,\\" a worker protested that while workers now tended \\"three or four looms, where they used to tend but two,\\" and produced twice as much cloth, \\"the pay is not increased to them, while the increase to the owners is very great. Is this just?\\" Another, writing in 1845, observed that while the profits of eleven Lowell mills had doubled from the year before, the workers were being paid 12.5% less. \\"This is the natural result of the state of things in New England,\\" she concluded, \\"the more wealth becomes concentrated in a few hands, and the poorer the great mass becomes.\\" This gap between profits and the condition of workers was partly due to the increase in corporate power during this period. While textile corporations had cut wages twice in the previous decade, their power had been limited, as frustrated workers could leave the factories and return to their nearby rural homes. By the early 1840s, however, many New England farms had been lost to a severe economic depression, leaving workers with no place to find respite from the harsh discipline of factory life. A permanent factory population was established in Lowell, and policies designed to increase worker discipline were suddenly more effective. Corporations colluded to increase the work week and the number of hours in the workday. They maintained 'blacklists' that prevented discharged workers—fired, in many cases, for trivial reasons—from finding employment at other mills. A \\"premium system\\" was adopted in which supervisors were paid bonuses for pushing operatives to produce more. As a result, by the mid-1840s, workers were spending 11 to 13 hours each day in factories that were often overheated and poorly ventilated, doing dreary, exhausting work. While they often wrote about being treated by mill owners as \\"living machines,\\" the reality was much worse—unlike their inanimate counterparts, workers were being compelled to produce more by applying discipline and control.  Writing on other issues  = On the Mexican–American War = The Mexican–American War took place between 1846 and 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk, a Tennessee Democrat and expansionist, made the declaration after a military incident in which 16 American soldiers were killed by Mexicans. The location of the incident was used as the justification for the war and was highly controversial—although Polk claimed that it took place on American soil, this was famously challenged by a newly elected senator from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. Although many major newspapers that expressed strong views on the need for war also reported broad public support for it, the real extent of popular support remains unclear. There were a number of well-known dissenting voices: A handful of anti-slavery Congressmen who voted against the war, including John Quincy Adams, condemned it as a way to extend the slavery system throughout Mexico (the American Anti-Slavery Society was opposed the same grounds). Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson were also outspoken critics. Articles published in the Voice vigorously condemned the conflict. Writers were critical of the motivations for the war, of the role played by fear and patriotism in rallying the public, the disproportionate burdens of war on the working classes, and the massive amount of money spent on the war, which might have been otherwise been used to help the poor. \\"Give me the money that has been spent in the war,\\" wrote one worker, \\"and I will clothe every man, woman and child in an attire that Kings and Queens might be proud of. ... I will supply that schoolhouse with a competent teacher,\\" continuing, \\"I will crown every hill with a church, consecrated with the promulgation of the gospel of peace.\\" = On slavery = The majority of women operatives fighting for labor reform in the 1840s also stood against slavery, denouncing it the many letters, articles and poetry in Voice; indeed, the women of Lowell became known as the \\"Pretty Friends of the Slave\\", and the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association participated officially in several antislavery meetings.  Debate about the Lowell Offering  Once in Lowell, the Voice continued to advocate for land and labor reform, and was particularly vocal in its support of the emerging movement for the Ten Hour Workday. This focus, and the paper's often militant tone, stood in sharp contrast with another, more famous publication, the Lowell Offering, a monthly literary magazine that was also written, edited, and published by working women in Lowell. The Offering, initially organized in 1840 by the Reverend Abel Charles Thomas (1807–1880), was established to publish pieces written by women in the local \\"improvement circles\\" and literary societies organized by the First Universalist Church. In 1842, an operative named Harriet Farley, who had come to work in the mills in 1838 and who had contributed articles to the Offering, became its co-editor. The Offering painted a sanguine picture of life in the mills. The disconnect between these rosy images and the ever-worsening, dismal reality of factory life alarmed many operatives, including Sarah Bagely, a young operative who had moved to Lowell in 1836 to work in the mills. Bagely, who had joined one of the Lowell improvement circles and had written several articles for the Offering, began submitting articles critical of the factories. Many of these were denied. In a fiery public speech, a frustrated Bagley rebuked the Offering at a convention of the New England Workingmen Association in Worburn, Massachusetts on July 4, 1845, for its deference to the mill owners. Bagley's speech and following articles in the Voice of Industry set off a heated, public debate between Bagley and Farley. Farley responded in the pages of the Lowell Courier, stating that if any critical articles were rejected, it was not done under her tenure. Bagley replied by calling for Farley to cite a single article published in the Lowell Offering that was critical of the corporations. Farley refused, which prompted Bagley to accuse of her of being a \\"mouth piece of the corporations.\\" Indeed, writing in the pages of the Lowell Offering early in her tenure, Farley had been clear about her refusal to be drawn into any \\"controversies\\" over the conditions in the mills: \\"With wages and board,\\" she wrote, \\"we have nothing to do. These depend on circumstances over which we have no control.\\"  The Lowell Female Labor Reform Association  The Lowell Female Labor Reform Association was started by Sarah Bagley and twelve other women in January 1845. Its membership grew to 500 within six months, and continued to expand rapidly. The Association was managed completely by working women: they elected their own officers with Bagley as president and held their own meetings; they organized the Lowell's female workers, and helped establish similar association in other New England mill towns. They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. This labor reform association found considerable support from the workingmen's associations, who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals. Shortly after it moved to Lowell, the Voice, under Bagley's leadership, entreated female operatives in Lowell and other factory towns to use the paper as an instrument of their own emancipation, with a notice on November 7, 1845: \\"We cordially invite the Factory Girls of Lowell, and the operatives and working people generally, whether they agree with us or not, to make the Voice a medium of communication; for it is your paper, through which you should be heard and command attention. The Press has been too long monopolized by the capitalist non-producers, party demagogues and speculators, to the exclusion of the people, whose rights are as dear and valid.\\" To this end, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association under the direction of Bagley, established a \\"Female Department\\" within the Voice, which featured articles and poetry on a variety of subjects of interest to women. The LFLRA also published a series of pamphlets called Factory Tracts, which documented the deteriorating conditions in the mills, and provided, \\"a true exposition of the Factory system and its effects upon the health and happiness of the operatives.\\" In May 1846, the LFLRA bought the type and presses for the struggling Voice, and Bagley briefly assumed the editorial chair. A month later, a new editor was selected and Bagley was fired.  Support for the Ten Hour Movement  The struggle for the ten-hour day, more than any other issue, was the focal point for many workers organizations in the 1840s. By 1845, factory workers in Lowell were spending between 11 and 13 hours per day performing exhausting work in onerous conditions. It was recognized that in order to succeed, the Ten Hour Movement would require legislative action, which made government and the political process part of labor reform discussions for the first time. Accordingly, working men and women workers organized several petition campaigns demanding laws that limited the workday. The Voice was at the forefront of many of these efforts. In 1845, the paper spearheaded a vigorous campaign that collected over 2,000 signatures, mostly from women. This led to the creation of the Massachusetts Legislative Committee (the \\"Investigation of Laboring Conditions\\"), the first such committee in the United States. The committee was chaired by William Schouler, a state representative of Lowell, an appointment that dismayed many of the activists who had run the campaign. As the editor of a factory-friendly newspaper called the \\"Lowell Courier,\\" Schouler was perceived as being biased in favor of the corporations (his newspaper was often described by the Voice as a \\"political organ of the corporations.\\") The committee heard testimony from a number of Lowell female workers who spoke about the need for additional time for meals and shorter hours. The Committee Report amounted to an exoneration of the corporations. A law restricting the workday, the committee wrote, would negatively affect the competitiveness of the mills. It would also affect \\"the question of wages,\\" which the committee held should be set by the market, as negotiated between labor and capital. In Lowell, the committee said, \\"labor is on an equality with capital, and indeed controls it…Labor is intelligent enough to make its own bargains, and look out for its own interests without any interference from us.\\" The committee concluded by expressing confidence that any abuses in the mills would remedy themselves, through \\"the progressive improvement in art and science, in a higher appreciation of man's destiny.\\" The Voice reacted sharply to the report, charging that the political process had been hijacked by the corporations, and accused the committee of distorting the workers' testimony. When Schouler sought re-election following the release of the report, the Female Labor Reform Association vigorously campaigned against him, possibly contributing to his defeat.  Publication history  \\\\--- On May 29, 1845, the Voice, a small four-page newspaper, began publication in Fitchburg, Massachusetts under the auspices of the New England Workingmen's Association, with young mechanic William F. Young as editor. Shortly thereafter, the newspaper moved to Lowell, Massachusetts. \\\\--- In May 1846, the type and presses of the struggling Voice were purchased by the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association under the leadership of Sarah Bagley. \\\\--- In early 1847, the circulation further declined under the editorship of Associationist reformer John Allen, as the paper began to focus exclusively on the associationist movement. The paper's original editor, William F. Young returned briefly in an attempt to increase circulation, but his efforts failed and the paper ceased publication in 1847. \\\\--- In October 1847, the Voice was resurrected as An Organ of the People, edited by D.H. Jaques, with a focus on Cooperative reform movements. \\\\--- In December 1847, the An Organ of the People moved to Boston, where it advocated for Land Reform, before again becoming insolvent on April 14, 1848 (a shortfall of $350 stilled the presses). \\\\--- From June to August 1849, its final incarnation was as The New Era of Industry.

Plot Gabriel Allon and his team seek a lost Rembrandt whose previous owners have included both Holocaust victims and terrorists. In addition to regularly recurring characters, Julian Isherwood in his role as a gallery owner features prominently. Background Part of the reason that Silva delved into the topic of art theft was the realization of the impact it has on the art world. Beginning with the role it played during and after the Holocaust, art theft has continued into the present. Each year, between four and six billion dollars' worth of art and antiquities are stolen, ranking it as the fourth- most lucrative crime behind drug trafficking, arms dealing, and money laundering. Silva touched on arms trafficking when dealing with the crimes of Ivan Kharkov in The Defector and Moscow Rules. Silva was also intrigued by the greed that drove people such as Bernie Madoff and he, and some other key figures in the Great Recession were the inspiration behind this book's villain, Martin Landesmann. Reception Like others in Silva's Gabriel Allon series, this book was a New York Times bestseller.

He was also president of the Greek Community in Alexandria and consul general of Belgium. He was knighted by Queen Victoria. Location Situated near the Mahmoudia Canal at the southern entrance of Alexandria, the palace is surrounded by some of greenery, divided into several sections. They include the Antoniadis Garden, the Flower Garden, the Zoological and Botanical Gardens, and the Nouzaba Garden. The Nouzaba (Nuzha) Garden was a residential suburb once inhabited by Callimachus (310–240 BC), a promenient scholar at the ancient Library of Alexandria. In 640 AD, the Roman general Pompilius thwarted the King of Syria's attempt to capture Alexandria, while in the same year the cavalry of the Arab conqueror Amr ibn al-As pitched camp before entering the city. Description The Antoniadis Palace and its park are constructed as a miniature version of the Palace of Versaille. The villa and its garden date back to the 19th century, and are mainly used to house a collection of statues sculpted in the Greek style and owned by Sir John Antoniadis. It consists of a basement level of 434 square meters, a ground floor of 1,085 square meters, a second floor of 860 meters and a roof area of 480 square meters, for a total area of . The ground and second floors include 15 rooms each. There are several archaeological remains, including a tomb and a cistern. =Tomb= The tomb on the grounds, because of its setting and because of the Agathodaimon (god snake) that decorated its kline chamber, is popularly known as the \\"Tomb of Adam and Eve\\". Its entrance is down a deep staircase of forty-four steps that ends in a landing opening onto the court at the south end. It is believed to date from the first century BC. The principal rooms consist of an open-air court, a vestibule and an alcove with a funerary bed, on a single axis. Here, the kline is reduced from a functional couch to a facade treated in low relief. During Sir John Antoniadis lifetime, it was a gathering place for the social elite, and was the scene of much gaiety and many parties. Later history Antonis Antoniadis, the son of Sir John Antoniadis, later donated the family mansion, grounds and gardens to the Alexandria Town Council. Afterwards, it was used as a guest house to host visiting dignitaries to Egypt, including the King of Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Shah of Iran and Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was married to the Egyptian Princess Fawzia, the sister of King Farouk. The Villa also hosted the signing ceremony of the 1936 agreement between Egypt and Britain, which gave Egypt some limited independence, and it held the first meeting of the Egyptian Olympic Committee. After the 1952 revolution, part of the original garden of the villa itself was used to enlarge the Nouzaha and zoological gardens. There was a general decline in the condition of the villa after about 1970, but the gardens remain in fairly good condition.

Jack Kornfield commented on the first Buddhist Geeks conference was: \\"It's clear that the electronic virtual interconnected web and on-line world is the wild way the Dharma stream is flowing, and the geeks have their minds dialed into the revolutionary next generation.\\"Jack Kornfield, Facebook In 2012, Vincent Horn and Rohan Gunatillake were featured in Wired UK's Smart List 2012.  History  Founders Vince Horn and Ryan Oelke noticed how there was little in the media specifically addressing the interests of Westerners in Buddhism, and decided to create a podcast to fill the gap. It first appeared in 2007. Horn and Oelke were both Religious Studies students of Naropa University, a Buddhist-inspired liberal arts college in Boulder, Colorado. Gwen Bell joined within six months, and remained with the team for approximately one year.  Podcast  By 2010, podcast downloads had exceeded 1 million. To date, more than 330 episodes have been produced, including interviews, dharma talks, and other topics of interest to people involved in modern Buddhist teaching and practice. These often include explorations of the interface between Buddhism and branches of modern science, such as neurology or game theory. Occasionally interviewees have been invited from outside the Buddhist community, where their concerns might present matters of interest to Buddhist practitioners. Online magazine  To support increasing interest from the Buddhist community, the website or online magazine was updated in 2009. The Buddhist Geeks website is the online magazine, with pages for each podcast episode as the primary content, with additional video media and blog posts.  Conference  In 2010 Buddhist Geeks left the purely digital world with its first in-person event, the Buddhist Geeks Conference. The first event, held in the summer of 2011 in Los Angeles, has been featured in many publications, including Tricycle, Fast Company, and the LA Times. Since then the conference has become an annual event, featuring talks, round table discussions, and meditation. The Buddhist Geeks Conference 2012 took place August 9 through 11th in the University Memorial Center on the Colorado University campus; the 2013 Conference was in the same venue, August 16 through 18th.

Early life Bernard was born into poverty on February 2, 1912, in Berlin, Germany. He was put in an orphanage by parents who could not afford to support him. In 1923, his parents gave him a Rolleiflex camera, which led to a lifelong interest in photography. He attended Kiel University, where, in 1934, he earned a doctorate in criminal psychology. He became the general secretary of a Jewish youth organization, which led to his name appearing on a Gestapo hit list. In 1937, he fled to America from Nazi Germany, claiming to German authorities that he was leaving the country to continue his graduate studies. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he planned to continue his education but soon became interested in the arts. In 1940, he became a directorial apprentice at the Reinhardt School of the Theatre, opened by Max Reinhardt on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Career in Hollywood Unable to get a job as a director, however, Bruno returned to his interest in photography. In 1938 he set up a darkroom in the basement of his Los Angeles apartment. Inspired by his background in psychology, what he learned about directing, and collaboration with Alberto Vargas, Bruno developed a unique portrait style that he called the \\"posed candid\\"; a style that evolved into what is now known as \\"pin-up\\" photography. Bernard preferred a moderate use of artificial light. He preferred natural light like the sun at the beach and sometimes added a flash to his light concept. He never had any formal training in photography and credited his success to \\"two good teachers, trial and error\\". By 1940, Bruno's basement darkroom had become his first studio. He started out taking photos of the wives and children of the directors and producers he had come to know through his apprenticeship. As he began making money, he opened a proper studio at 9055 Sunset Blvd. As word spread, he soon came to the attention of agents and other Hollywood professionals who sent actresses his way for photo shoots. He became known as \\"Bernard of Hollywood\\". Bernard is credited with first photographing Marilyn Monroe at the Racquet Club in Palm Springs, California, in 1947, when she was still Norma Jeane. She is said to have told Bernard, \\"Remember, Bernie, you started it all\\".When Sex Was Innocent, Sweet and Seductive, Los Angeles Times, September 8, 2002 In the early 1950s, Bernard fought obscenity charges that ended with a case in the U. S. Supreme Court. He submitted as part of his defense a letter from then-General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was a fan of Bernard's pinup photography. The letter thanks Bernard for the morale-building effect of his pinups during World War II. Bernard's daughter Susan Bernard has made the case that the pinup style popularized by Bernard and his friend Vargas was \\"celebrating and empowering women rather than exploiting them\\". In the 1960s, he moved back to Berlin. He was a photojournalist for the German magazine Der Spiegel for the Eichmann Trial in Israel. In 1984, Bernard became the first still photographer to be honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with a 50-year retrospective of his work. In 1999, his photo \\"Marilyn in White\\" of Monroe in her wind-blown dress from the movie The Seven Year Itch (1955) was selected as the \\"Symbol of the Century\\" by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The same photograph was also chosen by the International Center of Photography as one of the \\"20 Unforgettable Photographs\\". In the 1980s Bernard was living in Palm Springs and writing his memoirs. He died of cancer on June 3, 1987, at the age 75 in Los Angeles, California.

Its ecclesiastical see is the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. The Holy Cathedral serves the Greek community of Alexandria. In the opinion of author Donald M. Reid, the cathedral was built in \\"neo- Gothic rather than neo-Byzantine style\\"Donald Malcolm Reid: Whose Pharaohs? Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I. University of California Press, Berkeley, 2002. , p. 150 The cathedral is located in Tahrir Square, Alexandria. The cornerstone of the cathedral was laid by Patriarch Hierotheus II on 16 November 1847. Completion of the work took nine years, which was officially marked on 25 March 1856 with a liturgy celebrated by Patriarch Hierotheus. Restoration work was completed in December 2004 with funding from the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation. The church was rededicated on 2 April 2006 by the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomewͺ and the Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, Theodore II, in the presence of the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias. The church has a length of 41.80 metres, a width of 23.6 metres, and a height of 32.4 metres. The total area is 1,1155.23 square metres. The architect who conceived the church was Ermetes Pierotis; it was completed under Lukowitz. The marble iconostasis, patriarchal throne, the sedilia and the ambo were all works by the Constantinopolitan Iakovos Varoutis. For the design of the doors, windows, pews, baldachin and other sculpture the work was done by George Philippides. The gilder of the iconostasis, the throne and the ambo was Michael Larozas. The gilders of the nave were the brothers Iordanou. The icons were produced both in Egypt and in Constantinople, the windows in Paris, the clock came from London (produced by Frederick Dent, of the same family responsible for London's Big Ben), and the chandeliers came from Russia.

History The Portuguese explorers João de Santarém and Pêro Escobar discovered the islands around 1470,Francisco, Agostinho, p.24 which they found uninhabited.Grivetti, Shapiro, p. 1849 The São Tomé island was named by the Portuguese in honor of Saint Thomas, as they discovered the island on his feast day, while the Príncipe island (Prince's island) was named in honor of Afonso, Prince of Portugal, his father's favorite. The first attempt of settlement in the islands began in 1485, when the Portuguese Crown granted to João de Paiva the São Tomé island. However, this attempt was not successful, because the settlers were unable to produce food in the specific conditions and climate that the islands offered, and because of the tropical diseases that affected the settlers. It was only in 1493 when King John II of Portugal nominated Álvaro Caminha as captain-major of São Tomé island, that the first successful settlement was established. Among these Portuguese settlers, there was a significant portion of criminals and orphans, as well as Jewish children taken from their parents to ensure that they were raised as Christians.Greene, Morgan, p.85 Settlement of the Príncipe island was initiated in 1500. In the following years, the Portuguese settlers started to import large numbers of slaves from mainland Africa to cultivate the rich volcanic soil of São Tomé island with highly profitable sugar cane. By the middle of the 16th century São Tomé generated enormous wealth to Portugal when it became the world's largest producer of sugar.Greene, Morgan, p.86 In the first decade of the 17th century, the competition of sugar plantations from the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the frequent slave revolts that occurred in the island, begun to slowly hurt the sugar crop cultivation, This meant the decline of sugar production, and the shifting of the local economy towards the slave trade, who remained mostly in the hands of the local mestiço population. The geographical location of the islands made them a crucial trading post of the transatlantic slave trade,Huang, Morrissete, p. 970 as they served as an assembly point of the slaves brought from the Gulf of Guinea and the Kingdom of Kongo and destined to the Americas. The Dutch occupied the São Tomé island in 1641, until 1648 when the Portuguese took back the island. The Dutch, however, did not take Príncipe island. In 1753, because of the frequent attacks by pirates and corsairs, the capital of the São Tomé island was transferred to Santo António on Príncipe, and the islands started being ruled as a single colony, with only one Governor. It was only in 1852 when the capital was transferred back to São Tomé island.McKenna, p.73 At the beginning of the 19th century, the Portuguese introduced coffee and cocoa in extensive large-scale plantations called roças, thus giving a great boost to the economy. The coffee production cycle ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by cocoa as the islands' main production. São Tomé and Príncipe then became a major global cocoa production area for several generations, and in the first decades of the 20th century, it was frequently the world's annual number one cocoa producer. In 1972, a nationalist political party of Marxist ideology, the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP), was created by exiles in Equatorial Guinea with the intent of creating an independent nation. The Carnation Revolution in 1974 ended the Estado Novo dictatorship in Portugal and initiated a process of decolonization of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. On 12 July 1975, the new Portuguese regime granted independence to São Tomé and Príncipe.

In a racing career which lasted from September 2004 to October 2005 she ran twelve times and won three races. After winning once from four starts as a two-year-old, she won the Group Three Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on her first appearance of 2005. She then recorded her most important success when winning the Classic 1000 Guineas two of her six races including an upset win in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Virginia Waters failed to win her remaining six races, her best results coming when she finished fourth in The Oaks and second in the Matron Stakes. At the end of her three-year-old season she was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Background Virginia Waters, a bay horse with a broad white blaze and three white socks, was bred in Kentucky by Barnett Enterprises, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud. Her dam Legend Maker, won the Group Three Prix de Royaumont for Michael Tabor in 1997. Apart from Virginia Waters, her foals include Alexander of Hales a colt who won the Gallinule Stakes and finished second in the Irish Derby. As a descendant of the broodmare Sunbittern, Virginia Waters was also related to The Derby winner High-Rise and the Breeders' Cup Turf winner In The Wings. Virginia Waters' sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, Light Shift, King's Best, Henrythenavigator and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Like many Coolmore horses, the details of Virginia Waters' ownership altered from race to race. For some of her races she was owned by Susan Magnier, while in others she was officially owned in partnership by Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor. She was trained throughout her career by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career Virginia Waters debut in September 2004 was unusual, in that she bypassed maiden races and was sent straight into Group race competition. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan she started at 14/1 and finished eighth of the eleven runners in the Round Tower Stakes at the Curragh. Two weeks later, she recorded her first win when she easily beat nine opponents in the Loder EBF Fillies Stakes at the same course. In October she finished third to Jazz Princess in the Group Three Meld Stakes and second to Bibury Fyler in a Listed race. On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Virginia Waters started 5/2 second favourite for the Leopardstown 1000 Guineas Trial on 10 April. Ridden by Kieren Fallon, who had recently taken over the job as first jockey for Coolmore, she showed improved form to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three lengths. Three weeks later, Virginia Waters was one of twenty fillies who contested the 1000 Guineas, a race in which she ran over a mile for the first time and raced on firm ground for the first time since her debut. The betting for the race was unusually open, with the Barry Hills-trained Maids Causeway starting favourite on 5/1 and Virginia Waters being made the 12/1 sixth choice. Fallon restrained the filly in the early stages before moving forward in the last quarter mile. Virginia Waters took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from Maid's Causeway. The win completed a rare double for Coolmore, O'Brien, and Fallon who had won the 2000 Guineas with Footstepsinthesand a day earlier. No owner-trainer-jockey combination had achieved the double since King George VI, Fred Darling and Gordon Richards won the races with Big Game and Sun Chariot in 1942. Virginia Waters' subsequent form was disappointing. Three weeks after her win at Newmarket she started 11/10 favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas but finished unplaced behind Saoire on soft ground. When it became clear that the ground at Epsom was likely to be firm, the filly's owners paid a supplementary entry of £20,000 to run her in the Oaks. She was made joint- favourite for the race but after moving into third place in the straight she weakened in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Eswarah. Later that month she finished unplaced behind Maids Causeway in the Coronation Stakes at \\"Royal Ascot\\" (run that year at York) when Fallon rejected her in favour of Magnier's other runner, Damson. In July she was unplaced in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood behind Alexander Goldrun. In September at Leopardstown, Virginia Waters produced her best performance since her classic success when she finished a close third behind the English challengers Attraction and Chic in the Group One Matron Stakes. On her final racecourse appearance, Virginia Waters finished last of the ten runners, beaten forty-seven lengths by the winner Peeress in the Sun Chariot Stakes on soft ground at Newmarket. Stud record Virginia Waters retired to become part of the Coolmores Stud's breeding operation. She has been sent to leading stallions including Storm Cat and Danehill Dancer, but the only winner from her first five foals has been the colt Emperor Claudius, by Giant's Causeway, winner of a Listed race at the Curragh in 2010. 2007 Emperor Claudius (USA): Bay colt, foaled 11 January, by Giant's Causeway (USA) – won 4 races including LR Celebration S, Curragh, placed twice including 2nd LR Chesham S, Royal Ascot from 8 starts in Ireland and England during 2009–10 2008 Ballroom (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 12 January, by Storm Cat (USA) – placed three times from 7 starts in Ireland 2011 2009 Visalia (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 31 March, by Dansili (GB) – unplaced only start in France 2012 2010 Where (IRE): Bay filly, foaled 28 March, by Danehill Dancer (IRE) – placed third once from 4 starts in Ireland during 2012 2011 Dove Mountain (IRE): Bay colt (gelded), foaled 1 April, by Danehill Dancer (IRE) – won 3 races and placed 6 times from 36 starts in Ireland and England; won 2 races and placed 3 times over hurdles in Ireland, to date (5/07/17) 2013 Lizard Point (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 1 January, by Fastnet Rock (AUS) – unplaced only start to date in Ireland 2015 Pedigree *Virginia Waters was inbred 3x4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and the fourth generations of her pedigree.

It is served in the dining room of the United States Senate every day, in a tradition that dates back to the early 20th century. The original version included celery, garlic, parsley, and possibly mashed potatoes as well. Tradition According to the Senate website, \\"Bean soup is on the menu in the Senate's restaurant every day. There are several stories about the origin of that mandate, but none has been corroborated.\\" On September 14, 1943, rationing due to World War II left the Senate kitchen without enough navy beans to serve the soup. The Washington Times-Herald reported on its absence the following day. In a speech on the Senate floor in 1988, Bob Dole recounted the response to the crisis: \\"Somehow, by the next day, more beans were found and bowls of bean soup have been ladled up without interruption ever since.\\" Recipes =Senate versions= A 1967 memo from the Architect of the Capitol to the Librarian of the Senate describes the modern recipe, calling for \\"two pounds of small Michigan Navy Beans\\". John Egerton writes in Southern Food that the use of ham hocks suggests an origin in Southern cuisine. Although the legislators credited with institutionalizing the soup did not represent Southern states, most of the cooks at the time were black Southerners who would prepare bean soup in their own style. There was a period when the Senate dining services omitted the ham and instead used a soup base. In 1984, a new manager discovered this practice; he reflects, \\"we went back to the ham hocks, and there was a real difference.\\" There are two Senate soup recipes: =Reviews and variants= According to The Best Soups in the World, \\"most reports ... suggest that it unfortunately leaves a lot to be desired.\\" Availability As of 2010, members of the public can try the soup between 11:30am and 3pm in the Senate dining room. There is a dress code, and entry requires a \\"request letter\\" from a senator.

While in emigration, he was recruited by the Soviet NKVD. After returning to USSR from France, he was executed. Family life Sergei was born in Moscow. He was the sixth of nine children born to Elizaveta Durnovo (1853–1910) and Yakov Konstantinovich Efron (1854–1909). Both were Russian revolutionaries and members of the Black Repartition. Yakov worked as an insurance agent and died of cancer in 1909. The following year, Elizaveta found one of her sons had committed suicide and soon after that day, killed herself. Yakov was from a Jewish family, while Elizaveta came from a line of Russian nobility and merchants; Yakov converted to the Lutheran faith to marry Elizaveta.Efron, Ariadna. (2009).

Efron contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and his mental and physical health was strained further upon learning of his mother's death. After becoming a student at Moscow University, Sergei volunteered for the military as a male nurse. Due to his poor health, though, he was unable to serve in that capacity. Instead, he enrolled in the officer cadet academy.Efron, Ariadna. (2009). No Love Without Poetry: The Memoirs of Marina Tsvetaeva's Daughter. Northwestern University Press. pp. 18-21. . When Efron was a 17-year-old cadet in the officers' academy, he met 19-year-old Marina Tsvetaeva on 5 May 1911 at Koktebel (\\"Blue Height\\"), a well-known Crimean haven for writers, poets and artists. They fell in love and were married in January 1912. While they had an intense relationship, Tsvetaeva had affairs, such as those with Osip Mandelstam and poet Sofia Parnok.Who's Who in the Twentieth Century. \\"Tsvetaeva, Marina Ivanovna\\". Oxford University Press, 1999.Feinstein, Elaine (trans.) Marina Tsvetaeva: Selected Poems. Oxford University Press, 1971. page pix. Tsvetaeva and her husband spent summers in the Crimea until the revolution. They had two daughters: Ariadna, or Alya, (born 1912) and Irina (born 1917), and one son, Georgy. Marina Tsvetaeva, Sergei Efron's wife and poet Ariadna (Alya) Efron, Sergei Efron's daughter, 1926 Russian revolution and civil war Efron volunteered for the military in 1914 and by 1917 he was an officer stationed in Moscow with the 56th Reserve. In October 1917, he participated in the battles with the Bolsheviks in Moscow, then he joined the White Army and participated in the Ice March and defense of the Crimea,Svanidze, Marina. (2007). Historical Chronicles with Nikolai Svanidze, Amfora, p.131. . while Marina returned to Moscow hoping to be reunited with her husband. During that time, though, the relationship between Efron and Tsvetaeva was severely strained with very little communication between the two. Efron was particularly disenchanted with what he felt was a revolution largely unsupported by the Russian people, the expression of which inspired Tsvetaeva's Daybreak on the Rails. She was trapped in Moscow for five years, where there was a terrible famine. The Moscow famine was to exact a toll on Tsvetaeva. Starvation and worry were to erode her looks. With no immediate family to turn to, she had no way to support herself or her daughters. In 1919, she placed both her daughters in a state orphanage, mistakenly believing that they would be better fed there. Alya became ill and Tsvetaeva removed her but Irina died there of starvation in 1920. Post civil war At the end of the civil war, Efron emigrated to Berlin. There, in May 1922, Efron was reunited in Berlin with his wife, Tsvetaeva, and daughter Ariadna who had left the Soviet Union.\\"Tsvetaeva, Marina Ivanovna\\" The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. In August 1922, the family moved to Prague. Living in unremitting poverty, unable to afford living accommodation in Prague itself, with Efron studying politics and sociology at the Charles University and living in hostels, Tsvetaeva and Ariadna found rooms in a village outside the city. She writes \\"we are devoured by coal, gas, the milkman, the baker...the only meat we eat is horse-meat\\".Feinstein, Elaine (trans.) Marina Tsvetaeva: Selected Poems. Oxford University Press, 1971. page px. In summer 1924, Efron and Tsvetaeva left Prague for the suburbs, living for a while in Jíloviště, before moving on to Všenory, where Tsvetaeva conceived their son, Georgy, whom she was to later nickname 'Mur'. He was a difficult child but Tsetaeva loved him obsessively. With Efron now rarely free from tuberculosis, their daughter Ariadna was relegated to the role of mother's helper and confidante, and consequently felt robbed of much of her childhood. In 1925, the family settled in Paris, where they would live for the next 14 years. During this time Tsvetaeva contracted tuberculosis.  NKVD agent  While in Paris, Efron was developing Soviet sympathies and was homesick for Russia. He was afraid because of his past as a White soldier. Eventually, either out of idealism or to garner acceptance from the Communists, he began spying for the NKVD, the forerunner of the KGB, and in doing so was established in a dacha, a cabin in the country. Alya shared his views, and increasingly turned against her mother. In 1937, she returned to the Soviet Union. Later that year, Efron too had to return to USSR. In September 1937, the French police implicated him in the murder of the former Soviet agent and defector Ignace Reiss (also known as Ignaty Reyss and Ignatz Reiss), on a country lane near Lausanne, Switzerland. After defecting and then criticizing Stalin and Yezhov, Soviet spy Reiss promised not to reveal any state security secretsReiss, Elsa, Ignace Reiss: In Memoriam, New International, Vol.4 No.9, September 1938, pp.276-278. and fled with his wife and child to the remote village of Finhaut, Valais canton, Switzerland, to hide. After they had been hiding for a month, they were contacted by Gertrude Schildbach at the instruction of Roland Lyudvigovich Abbiate, alias Francois Rossi, alias Vladimir Pravdin, codename LETCHIK (\\"Pilot\\"), a Russian expatriate, citizen of Monaco, and a Soviet NKVD agent. Schildbach was a German Communist refugee who was persuaded to write to Reiss to request a meeting and ask his advice. On 4 September 1937, Reiss agreed to meet Schildbach in Lausanne.Poretsky, Elisabeth K. (1969). Our Own People: A Memoir of \\"Ignace Reiss\\" and His Friends. London: Oxford University Press. pp. 243–270. Reiss using the alias Eberhardt was lured by Gertrude Schildbach onto a side road near Lausanne where Roland Abbiate was waiting for him with a Soviet PPD-34 sub-machine gun.Andrew, Christopher, and Mitrokhin, Vasili, The sword and the shield: the Mitrokhin archive and the secret history of the KGB, New York: Basic Books, (1999), pp. 78-79. Reiss was hit by fifteen bullets from Abbiate's sub-machine gun, killing him instantly.Rosmer, Alfred, Serge, Victor, and Wullens, Maurice, L'Assassinat d'Ignace Reiss, Les Humbles, April 1938: Reiss was found with five bullets in the head and seven in the body The two then dumped Reiss's body on the side of the road.Barmine, Alexander.

Efron was said to have been in the car of the assassins. He was also named as an NKVD boss and claimed to have had a “Union for Repatriation” office for recruiting NKVD operatives. A search of the office and Efron's flat yielded no evidence. After Efron's fled Paris, the police interrogated Tsvetaeva at the Paris Surete Nationale headquarters on 22 October 1937.Kelly, Catriona. (21 November 2004 ). Coded confessions. The Times Literary Supplement, posted online at Powells.com. Retrieved 6 August 2012. She apparently seemed confused by their questions, answered somewhat incoherently, but is quoted as saying that in September he had been fighting in Spain and that \\"His trust might have been abused -- my trust in him remains unchanged.\\" The police concluded that she was deranged and knew nothing of the murder. In fact, Efron had returned to Moscow under NKVD orders and was held under house arrest in a dacha until he was arrested on 10 December 1937. Some believe that Tsvetaeva did not seem to have known that her husband was a spy, nor the extent to which he was compromised. Return to Soviet Union In 1939, Tsvetaeva and son Georgy returned to Moscow, unaware of the reception she would receive. In Stalin's USSR, anyone who had lived abroad was suspect, as was anyone who had been among the intelligentsia before the Revolution. Efron and Alya were arrested for espionage. Alya's fiancé was actually an NKVD agent who had been assigned to spy on the family. Under torture Efron was pressed to give evidence against Tsvetaeva, but he refused to testify against her or anyone else., Channel one His daughter, however, confessed under beatings that her father was a Trotskyite spy, which led to his execution. Efron was shot in 1941; Alya served over eight years in prison. Both were exonerated after Stalin's death. In 1941, Tsvetaeva and her son were evacuated to Yelabuga. On 31 August 1941, while living in Yelabuga (Elabuga), Tsvetaeva hanged herself. According to her son Georgy's diary, she visited the local NKVD office, where they probably tried to recruit her.I. V.

It is the head temple of the Diocese of Zacatecas, and is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. The cathedral is located in the historic city center, and was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco. The main facade of the premises is known as one of the most outstanding examples of Baroque art in Mexico. History The current building was preceded by two temples. The first was built in the year 1568, as a parish church of the city, which was of small dimensions. A second temple was built in place of the old and was known to be consecrated in 1625. In order to build a temple of larger size worthy of the city of \\"the aristocrats of silver\\", everything built was demolished, and the walls of the building we meet in our day rose. The first stone was laid by Don José de Izarraguirre, episcopal vicar. The work was dedicated in 1752 and consecrated in 1841, when the construction of the façade and the north tower was completed. This tower holds a clock donated by Governor Genaro García Rojas. In 1862, Pope Pius IX gave the church cathedral status. And finally, in the year 1959, Pope John XXIII elevated it to a basilica. The building The floor of the building is shaped like a Latin cross. Three naves, the main and two sides, with less than the first. It has two side access covers, worked in stone and with no less detail than the first, the latter, the best finish and detail of Baroque art in the country. The original dome was replaced by the current, which bears a strong resemblance to the Templo de Loreto in Mexico City. It is octagonal, with lantern, surmounted by a wrought iron cross. The building's exterior is covered with pink stone and are very worked both covers and towers, unlike the interior of sober neoclassical. =The main facade= Elegant and decorated as a show of lace carved in stone.

The third, smaller body has five niches flanked by Baroque pilasters, decorated by floral motifs, and holding five sculptures: Four apostles and the central niche is chaired by the sculpture of Jesus Christ. The pediment of the façade, presents a picture of the glory to the Eternal Father, it could say the whole scene presides developed in the facade. It is said that the color tones in the quarry of the facade gives change as sunlight during the day. So the best time to observe is between 14.30 and 18.00 hours. =The side covers= With two side doorways. The first, north, dedicated to Lord of the parish. It consists of two parts, the first arc of half point, its spandrels have vegetable ornaments and angels, has a copy in stone of a Christ who is inside.

This can be seen with its large Doric columns and neoclassical side altars. On the keys of the arches, there are Marian symbols, figures of saints, evangelist, clergy and objects of passion. The cathedral contains an altar designed by artist Javier Marín from Michoacan, which is gilded in 24-carat gold. It is 17 feet high and ten wide and covered with 25 kg of gold from Mazapil. It was constructed from geometric prisms born of the upper platform of the sanctuary and contains niches where elaborate images of saints are placed. It weighs about 20 tons and is made of Finnish birch, a very hard wood that neither expands or shrinks, as it does not react to changes in humidity. The altarpiece has eleven images. At the top is the Virgin of the Assumption, who is consecrated the temple. On both sides are the parents of the Virgin, Santa Ana and San Joaquin.

The museum was founded to preserve the rich history of the base, and the memories of the people who served there. The museum recently completed an addition in 2011. This addition was funded by various fundraisers that the Loring Military Heritage Center put on as well as grants from the Maine Community Grant Foundation. The large addition houses many artifacts from the former runway as well as a KC135 Jet Engine. History Loring Air Force Base, was an active service facility from 1953 to 1994. Prior to its dedication, it was known as Limestone Air Force Base, due to its being located in Limestone, Maine. Limestone Air Force Base was eventually renamed Loring Air Force Base in honor of Charles J. Loring, Jr., a Maine native and Medal of Honor recipient, who perished during the Korean War after crashing his plane into a gun emplacement, saving the lives of his fellow airmen. The indoor museum opened in 2006 within the base's old bank. The Loring Redevelopment Authority approved the center alongside an expansion of the Loring Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Current funding is obtained through donations, membership, gift shop sales, and admissions. In 2007, the center expressed interest in acquiring a missile from the local American Legion chapter in Presque Isle, in order to restore it. The museum helped to also catalog artifacts from the base's former heating plant, which took two tries to demolish it In August 2012, the Center hosted the base's first official reunion. The reunion proved to be a success as 700+ people from as far as Alaska attended the event. 2014 saw the Center host a second reunion at Loring. This event saw many more prior Loring Veterans, Civilians, Families and interested people come out to enjoy the weekend. Many former base areas were opened to allow visitors a chance to see, what Loring was all about.

It is the oldest intact theatre in mainland Australia, having originally been built in 1840, the only earlier one in Australia being the still-operational Theatre Royal in Hobart, Tasmania (completed in 1836). It was not the first theatre to open in Adelaide however; there were two earlier, less sophisticated earlier venues created in 1838–9. The Queen's original incarnation only lasted for a couple of years before a recession forced closure, and the building was turned to other uses. The New Queen's Theatre operated in the billiard room of the tavern next door between 1846 and 1850, until the Queen's refurbishment and re-opening as the Royal Victoria Theatre in 1850. \\"The Victoria\\", as it was known locally, was Adelaide's only theatre until 1868, when competition from the new Theatre Royal in Hindley Street led to its closure. After a series of other uses, Heritage SA bought the building in the 1980s, and it was eventually restored and reopened as a performance venue in the 1996 Adelaide Festival of the Arts. History =Background= By the early 1800s, live performance was increasing in popularity in Australia, although no entertainment venues existed to house performances. In the 1830s, both Sydney and Hobart received two theatres, the first in the Australian colonies. The first theatre to open in Adelaide was the Theatre Royal in 1838, on the first floor of the Adelaide Tavern in Franklin Street, one of Adelaide’s main hotels, just two years after the colony was founded. On 23 November 1839, Samson Cameron, an actor and theatre company manager, opened the Royal Victoria Theatre on North Terrace near Morphett Street in a converted warehouse. =First Queen's= Attempts to build a more substantial theatre in an increasingly prosperous Adelaide were made, with a declaration by the South Australian Register stating \\"...Mr Solomon, of Currie Street, is about to make an important addition to the quarter of Gilles Arcade, by the erection of a spacious and handsome edifice which he ends to fit up as a theatre\\". It was built for ex-convicts Emanuel Solomon (1800–1873), who moved to Adelaide in 1837, and his Sydney-based brother Vaiben Solomon (1802–1860)Two of Vaiben's brothers lived in Adelaide: Emanuel and Isaac. The more famous Vaiben Louis Solomon was his great uncle, son of Judah Moss Solomon, son of Moss Solomon, who was the eldest brother of Emanuel, Vaiben and Isaac. in 1840 for £3000 with seating for over 1000 people. The project had dire predictions of failure from the press and opened with Othello on 11 January 1841, the manager John Lazar in the title role, to \\"mixed reviews\\". Unfortunately, public appetite for entertainment had waned with a financial recession brought on by Governor Grey's fiscally responsible regime following the prosperity of Governor Gawler's rule, when huge sums were invested in public infrastructure. After months of losing money, Lazar dismissed his company and converted the seating to something more appropriate to public meetings, and some use was made of the theatre for public meetings and lectures, but did not renew his lease. Solomon offered the government use of the theatre gratis if they would prohibit the building of further taverns in the vicinity (his Shakspere Tavern, subsequently named Temple Tavern, was adjacent). This was rejected, but in 1843 the government signed a contract with Solomon for three years' rental at £200 per annum for use as Resident Magistrates Court, Supreme Court and offices for the Registrar General, the Advocate General, the Assistant Crown Solicitor and Assistant to the Bench of Magistrates. Between 1846 and 1847 Solomon, whose nephew Judah Moss Solomon (1818–1880) was an occasional partner, attempted to sell the theatre and tavern by lottery, but it was never fully subscribed so he refunded to the punters their stakes. =Reopened as Royal Victoria= The building was reopened as a theatre, re-using the name Royal Victoria Theatre, under the management of John Lazar and George Coppin on 23 December 1850. In 1861 it closed for refurbishment and substantial remodelling, and reopened in July with A.J. Solomon the new lessee and Robert MacGowan the stage manager of what was Adelaide's only theatre until the opening of the Theatre Royal at 28 Hindley Street on 13 April 1868, which spelled the demise of the \\"Victoria\\". =Other uses= It then became successively a dance hall designated the \\"Prado\\", the headquarters for the City Mission, Formby's Horse Bazaar (1877–c.1900) From 1908 until 1928, J.W. Shannon occupied the premises for use as sales yards, livery, stables and forge. Between 1933 and 1973, it was occupied by McPherson’s Store and Warehouse, Dalgety’s Factory and Store, and McPherson’s Showroom, in that order. =20th–21st centuries= The partially restored interior, now used as a performance space, during a History Month tour in 2014 In the 1980s the building was at risk of demolition, until parts of the original theatre were discovered, which sparked protests from the public (including from Barry Humphries) to conserve the building. These features included dressing rooms and the orchestra pit. The South Australian Government, upon acquiring the property after negotiations in the 1990s, initiated efforts to conserve its surviving heritage architecture. the shell of the original theatre still stands within the 1850s facade of the Royal Victoria Theatre. Excavation also revealed historically significant remains and numerous artefacts, including clay pipes, bottles, plates, buttons, props and costumes, shoes, candlesticks and stage decorations, the most significant treasure being a gold and ruby earring featuring dangling ivy leaves, which is now in a collection managed by the History Trust of South Australia. Most of the artefacts were transferred to the South Australian Museum in 2016. The Queen's Theatre was reopened as a performance venue at the 1996 Adelaide Festival of Arts, with a performance of The Magic Flute by Opera Australia. Following essential refurbishments, it was reopened for the launch of the 1998 Festival by Robyn Archer. The theatre is still used as a performance space and function venue, but with stringent conditions intended to preserve as far as possible, the old character of the building.. The Theatre was managed by Arts South Australia from 2010 to 2018, before being taken over by GWB McFarlane Theatres. New Queen's Theatre (1846−c.1850) A new theatre was built in 1846 for George Coppin on nearby land on Light Square belonging to Solomon and managed by John Lazar, designed architect Thomas Price. Price, active 1845–50, had offices in Hindley Street The hall held 700 and had the distinction of prohibiting smoking in the boxes. In January 1850, the New Queen's Theatre was described by the South Australian Register as \\"a hotbed of demoralization\\" and that \\"no man can sit out a performance without being disgusted ; no lady can enter the impure precincts without contamination\\". This article was the subject of a successful libel case against editor John Stephens in March 1850. The Adelaide Garrick Club may have been the last company to mount plays there, with productions of three Thomas Morton comedies, the last in September 1850. There is no newspaper reference to this theatre after November 1850.

Initially a wine merchant and importer, today he is a wine writer. Born in London and raised partly in rural Essex because of the Blitz, Asher's career in wine began in 1950, when he took a part-time job at a wine retailer in London's Shepherd Market. He founded his own merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, in 1955, to import rare and lesser- known French wines to Britain. Active until 1970, the firm was widely seen as ground-breaking for its introduction to the British market of several previously obscure wines that proceeded to become popular. In 1971, Asher relocated to New York to take up a senior position at Austin, Nichols and Co, which imported Bordeaux-classed wines to the United States. The next year he also became wine editor at Gourmet magazine, a post he would hold for the next three decades, writing the \\"Wine Journal\\" column, which eventually became monthly. In 1974, he received the Mérite agricole from the French government for his contributions to French agriculture. He moved the same year to San Francisco, where he became head of the Monterey Wine Company. He writes that he had \\"a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine\\", having never tasted any before a 1967 visit, but he soon began championing it, organising the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner along with Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of New York's Four Seasons Restaurant. The barrel tasting, which started in 1976, played an important role in building the image and understanding of California wines on the East Coast of the United States, and over the next decade became seen by critics as the wine event of the year. Asher started the Mosswood Wine Company in 1978, within the McKesson Corporation, and headed it until 1987, when McKesson sold off its interests in wine and spirits to concentrate on pharmaceuticals. Asher took early retirement to focus solely on his wine writing, which he continues today. He retained the post of wine editor at Gourmet until 2002, and thereafter contributed a selection of wines to each issue until the magazine discontinued in 2009. Many of his wine essays from Gourmet have been republished in book form; five volumes of these columns have been published, most recently A Carafé of Red in 2012. Asher's writing and knowledge of wine are both acclaimed, with British wine critic Jancis Robinson calling him \\"America's most elegant wine writer\\". James Beard, an American chef and food writer, says Asher's writing \\"makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his ... awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine.\\" Asher has received many accolades for his writing and work with wine during his life. He was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame by the Culinary Institute of America in 2009. Biography =Early life= Gerald Asher was born in London in 1932. The family moved to rural Essex at the onset of the Blitz, and Asher was partly raised there, attending Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea. =First steps into wine= Shepherd Market, where Asher's career in wine began in 1950 Asher entered the wine industry in 1950, at the age of 18, when he took a part-time job assisting a wine retailer in Shepherd Market, between Curzon Street and Piccadilly in Mayfair, Central London. Within a year he had taken a full-time position with a small wine distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal & Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the Worshipful Company of Vintners in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in Jerez, the Spanish region that produces Sherry. Further such scholarships over the next two years despatched Asher to Burgundy in eastern France, then the Rheingau wine region in West Germany. =Asher, Storey and Co= In 1955, aged 23, Asher founded his own London merchant house, Asher, Storey and Co, to import rare and lesser-known French wines to Britain. The new firm was regarded as ground-breaking, and was for a long time unique in the British market. A 1983 Punch retrospective described its formation as \\"a breeze of change through the wine trade here [in Britain] and the trade of writing about wine.\\" Many of the wines the firm introduced to British consumers, including Beaumes de Venises, Arbois, Bandol, Chateau Grillet, Cahors and others, were considered utterly unknown when the company began, but soon became well known and popular. \\"Gerald Asher in London was the first, shipping the 'lesser' wines of France – names like Touraine and Roussillon, which today are considered almost classic. The old trade, weaned on Bordeaux and Burgundy, had never heard of them[.]\\" By December 1969, The Observer was describing the company as \\"famous for its list of the lesser-known wines of France: wines from the Loire, and the Jura, from Provence and from Savoy.\\" =New York= Asher wound up Asher, Storey in 1971, when he moved to New York City to become Vice-President and National Wine Sales Manager at Austin, Nichols and Co, perhaps better known as the distiller of Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey, but also an American importer of Bordeaux-classed wines from France. He joined the French wine committee of the U.S. National Association of Wine Importers, and became chairman of the Champagne Importers' Association. Around this time he also became interested in California wine, which he had first encountered during his first visit to San Francisco in 1967. In 1972, he was invited by Jane Montant of Gourmet magazine to start contributing essays on a periodical basis as the journal's Wine Editor, a role he would hold for the next three decades. Two years later, he was awarded the Mérite agricole by the government of France for his contributions to French agriculture. =California= The Four Seasons Restaurant in New York City was the original venue for the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner, which Asher was instrumental in starting and organising, from 1976 to 1985. Asher moved to San Francisco in 1974 to head the Monterey Wine Company, a joint venture between the McKesson Corporation and the McFarlane family to market The Monterey Vineyard's wines. He retained this role until 1976. He writes that he had \\"a topsy-turvy introduction to California wine\\", having never tasted any before his 1967 visit, but soon came to regard it as on a par with that from France. Surprised that wine from California was, in his own words, \\"more exotically rare in New York than many European\\" wines, he hit upon the idea of holding an annual tasting of California wine in New York, using as models the Paulée de Meursault tasting of Burgundy wine and its grander cousin, the Paulée de Paris held at Taillevent, with \\"the same elegant context ... but with an American flavour\\". Asher approached several Californian growers with this idea, but most were hesitant to take part. The idea became more real when the winemakers Karl Wente and Robert Mondavi agreed to participate. Paul Kovi and Tom Margittai of the prestigious Four Seasons Restaurant in Manhattan agreed to organise the practicalities of such an event in return for Asher's coordination of the California wineries' contributions. The first annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner was held at The Four Seasons in 1976, and soon became hugely popular; though there were only 228 places available for the 1978 tasting, over 2,000 people tried to buy tickets. Asher was vice-president of \\"21\\" Brands, a wine and spirits company within the McKesson Corporation, between 1976 and 1978. He then started the Mosswood Wine Company within the McKesson structure to import and distribute European wine across the United States. Meanwhile, Asher's annual California barrel tasting event in New York became highly acclaimed in the wine world; by 1985, it was being described in newspaper columns as the American wine industry's \\"most prestigious social event\\". \\"Everybody who is anybody in the world of food and wine is invited to the annual California Vintners Barrel Tasting Dinner,\\" Ruth Riechl wrote for the Los Angeles Times that year; \\"Ten years ago it was unclear whether anybody would even show up for the first dinner, held at the Four Seasons. This year the only problem was which one of the 10 people eager to fill each seat would[.]\\" \\"Invitations are as scarce as Manhattan taxis at rush hour,\\" wrote Chicago Tribune columnist Kristine Curry. Following the 1985 event, described by two wine writers as \\"the best ever\\", the annual barrel tasting moved to California. Since it was still generally considered a runaway success in New York, this came as a surprise to many, and Margittai admitted he was sad to see it go: \\"This is our pride and joy,\\" he said, \\"but the barrel tasting needs to go home\\". The move was in part because of the event's popularity; so many people sought places each year that the restaurant was having to refuse tickets to some of its regular customers. The venue used in 1986, San Francisco's Stanford Court Hotel, could accommodate twice as many guests. \\"Woody Allen may think that going West and dying are the same thing,\\" Asher explained, \\"but we're going to prove him wrong.\\" The first barrel tasting in San Francisco was also considered a success by most who attended, with the main difference being the atmosphere, which Barbara Ensrud, a wine writer who had attended every barrel tasting so far, said was \\"a lot more relaxed than it ever was in New York.\\" =Writing full-time= In 1987, McKesson sold off its wine and spirits operations so it could focus on pharmaceuticals. Aged 55, Asher took early retirement, and began to concentrate on his wine writing. His contributions to Gourmet magazine, which had evolved into a bi-monthly column called the \\"Wine Journal\\", now became monthly. Many of Asher's \\"Wine Journal\\" entries have been republished in book form as On Wine (1982), Vineyard Tales (1996), The Pleasures of Wine (2002), A Vineyard in My Glass (2011), and A Carafé of Red (2012). In 1996, he wrote the Wine Journal, published as a cellar book by HarperCollins. A number of the Gourmet columns were translated and published in the Japanese version of Playboy magazine, and in 1997 some of these were published in translation as The Secret World of Wine by Shueisha of Tokyo. Asher stopped writing for Gourmet in February 2002, but he continued to contribute a selection of wines to the monthly menu published in each issue until the magazine discontinued in November 2009. In addition to the many accolades he has won for his writing and work in the international wine trade—including \\"Wine Writer of the Year\\" from Wine & Vines magazine in 1984, a 1990 literature achievement award from the American Institute of Wine and Food, the San Francisco Wine Appreciation Guild's Literary Award for 2000, and the 2005 Journalism award from the New York-based European Wine Council—Asher was inducted into the California Vintners' Hall of Fame at the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena, California in 2009. Asher is generally considered a highly respected authority in the field of wine, and has received acclaim throughout his career for his expertise and writing style, which is widely held to be elegant and enjoyable. In her 1997 book Tasting Pleasure, British wine critic Jancis Robinson calls Asher \\"America's most elegant wine writer\\". S. Irene Virbila of the Los Angeles Times gave A Carafé of Red a very positive review, describing Asher as a \\"wonderful prose stylist ... His wide-ranging, astute appreciation is where it's at.\\" In a glowing review of On Wine (1982), the American chef and food writer James Beard called the book \\"a delight\\". \\"Reading it makes one feel that one is sitting in a room with Gerald, enjoying his personal views, his prejudices, his delightful sense of humour and his appreciation of life,\\" Beard elaborated; \\"not to mention his awesome knowledge and expertise in the world of wine.\\" Publications ;Collections of Gourmet \\"Wine Journal\\" works   ;Others * Notes and references ;Notes ;Journal and newspaper articles    * ;Online sources * ;Bibliography   Category:1932 births Category:English columnists Category:English expatriates in the United States Category:English non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:Wine writers Category:Writers from London Category:Writers from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Food and drink in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:English male non-fiction writers Category:People educated at Westcliff High School for Boys Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners ","title":"Gerald Asher"},{"id":"36642995","text":"Han Jinming (; born 28 February 1969) is a Chinese football coach and a former international Midfielder who played for China in the 1996 Asian Cup.

It was established in 1952. History Helen Brew, one of the founders of Parents Centre, had wanted a natural birth for her second child. Following her birth experience Helen Brew, together with Christine Cole Catley, went on to found the very first Parents Centre in Wellington in 1952. The original name for Parents Centre was the Natural Child Birth Association, as an early focus was to empower women and men to understand more about the birthing process and how relaxation and exercise could contribute to a positive birthing experience. The organisation was renamed ‘Parents Centre’. One of Parents Centres' early achievements was successfully advocating for the father to be able to be present at the birth. Husbands had not been allowed to attend the birth, or often to even support their wives through the labour. Doctors Jim and Jane Ritchie, both key figures in developmental psychology in New Zealand, as well as active members of Wellington Parents Centre, were key advocates in this long struggle. The article prompted a flood of supportive letters to the newspaper and Parents Centre sponsored a meeting which drew 150 people. A protest was arranged, but it was another eight years of advocacy before Wellington hospitals allowed men to be present at births. Over the years which have followed there have been many achievements by Parents Centre; baby’s ‘rooming in’ with mothers after birth ; sick children in hospital having their parents stay with them; the removal of salt and sugar from baby food; the establishment of childbirth education classes and the rights of women to form their own birth plans. Today, Parents Centres New Zealand operates through over 50 Centres nationwide. The organisation continues to work for parents and children of New Zealand, including most recently tackling issues around the repeal of Section 59 of the Crimes Act, spearheading the Flexible Working Conditions bill and Corrections breastfeeding of babies in prison bill, tackling the sensitive issues around child poverty and poor health and running parenting programmes in 19 of the country’s prisons. Parents Centres continue run a wide range of parenting programmes, from childbirth education through to conscious parenting programmes for children up to the age of 6, and publish New Zealand’s longest running parenting magazine (established in 1954), Kiwiparent.

While similar to the inaugural Summer Olympics torch relay of 1936 the Olympic Flame did not start in Olympia, instead the relay began in Morgedal, Norway, the birthplace of competitive skiing. Indeed, the Norwegian Olympic Committee were keen to stress that this was not the traditional transfer of the Olympic flame but a separate event that symbolised the use of torches while skiing in the dark. It was not until the 1964 Winter Olympics that the relay could be said to transport a true Olympic flame originating from Olympia. Organization Olav S. Bjaaland, a teacher in Morgedal, proposed the idea of a cross-country ski relay from Morgedal to Oslo in 1948. The process was seen as a good way to mark the commencement of the Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed that the relay could go ahead, including winning support from the IOC president, but that this relay would not carry the true Olympic flame as had been established as protocol in the Summer Games since 1936. Instead this torch was passed in the same way that Norwegian skiers historically did while travelling in the dark. Organisational duties were given to the committee for decorations and ceremonies. The flame would not be lit in Olympia, and a location would be chosen that symbolised the birthplace of skiing and Winter events. Since the 1964 relay the process has changed to bring the relay in line with the Summer Olympics and to officially carry the Olympic flame. While there were attempts to give the \\"Morgedal Flame\\" the same significance as the Olympic flame the IOC have insisted that all Olympic Games should use the symbolic fire lit in Olympia. Relay elements =Torch= The nine inch long torch was designed to cope with any weather condition that the relay team would face. Its cylindrical handle was topped off by a large, oval collar that depicted the Olympic rings, the year, and an arrow pointing from the start and end points of the relay (Morgedal and Oslo). =Torch-bearers= A total of 94 renowned skiers or their descendants participated in the relay, the names of whom remained secret until they began their leg of the journey. =Route= The stadium in Bislett, the final destination of the relay The relay began on 13 February at the Morgedal home of Sondre Norheim, a pioneer in competitive skiing. The location was chosen to celebrate the birthplace of skiing and the origins of such sporting events. In 1868 Norheim had skied from Morgedal to Oslo to compete in a skiing competition that was being hosted in the city. It would be fitting for a person of high regard to start the relay. Olav Bjaaland, the grandfather of the man who proposed the relay, was a member of the 1911 South Pole expedition. He was given the honour of kindling the fire, and did so by lighting a pine torch in the hearth of Norheim's home. He then passed the flame to the first relay skier. The torch relay then followed the route that Norheim is believed to have taken to Oslo. =Lighting of the cauldron= The final stretch of the relay to Bislett was undertaken by ski champion Lauritz Bergendahl on 15 February. On arrival at the Marathon Gate of the Stadium he passed the torch to the final torch-bearer, Eigil Nansen, grandson of explorer, winter event champion and Nobel Peace Prize-winning diplomat Fridtjof Nansen. Nansen skied with the torch around the snow embankment before walking up to and lighting the \\"Olympic Altar\\".

While typically trauma surgeons are heavily involved in treating such patients, the concept has evolved to other sub-specialty services. The leading cause of death among trauma patients remains uncontrolled hemorrhage and accounts for approximately 30–40% of trauma- related deaths. This technique places emphasis on preventing the \\"lethal triad\\", rather than correcting the anatomy. Damage control surgery is meant to save lives. A multi-disciplinary group of individuals is required: nurses, respiratory therapist, surgical-medicine intensivists, blood bank personnel and others. While this lifesaving method has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients, complications can result. This procedure is generally indicated when a person sustains a severe injury that impairs the ability to maintain homeostasis due to severe hemorrhage leading to metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and increased coagulopathy. The approach would provide a limited surgical intervention to control hemorrhage and contamination. This subsequently lets clinicians focus on reversing the physiologic insult prior to completing a definitive repair. While the temptation to perform a definitive operation exists, surgeons should avoid this practice because of the deleterious effects on patients can result them succumbing to the physiologic effects of the injury, despite the anatomical correction. Technique Damage control surgery can be divided into the following three phases: Initial laparotomy, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resuscitation, and definitive reconstruction. Each of these phases has defined timing and objectives to ensure best outcomes. The following goes through the different phases to illustrate, step by step, how one might approach this. There are clearly different approaches throughout the country, and no one way is necessarily correct. However, the ability to evaluate objectively the differences and then choose the one that fits your team is important. =Initial laparotomy= This is the first part of the damage control process whereby there are some clear-cut goals surgeons should achieve. The first is controlling hemorrhage followed by contamination control, abdominal packing, and placement of a temporary closure device. Minimizing the length of time spent in this phase is essential. For groups (i.e., trauma centers) to be effective in damage control surgery, a multi-disciplinary team is critical. The approach to caring for such critically ill patients is dependent on nurses, surgeons, critical care physicians, operating room staff, blood bank personnel, and administrative support. In addition to having the right team in place is having a prepared team. The more facile the team is enhances the ability for centers to effectively implement damage control surgery. This is referred to by some as damage control ground zero (DC0). The ability to mobilize personnel, equipment, and other resources is bolstered by preparation; however, standardized protocols ensure that team members from various entities within the health care system are all speaking the same language. This has been seen during implementation of complex processes such as the massive transfusion protocol (MTP). Controlling of hemorrhage as discussed above is the most important step in this phase. Eviscerating the intra-abdominal small bowel and packing all four abdominal quadrants usually helps surgeons establish initial hemorrhagic control. Depending up on the source of hemorrhage a number of different maneuvers might need to be performed allowing for control of aortic inflow. Solid organ injury (i.e., spleen, kidney) should be dealt with by resection. When dealing with hepatic hemorrhage a number of different options exist such as performing a Pringle maneuver that would allow for control of hepatic inflow. Surgeons can also apply manual pressure, perform hepatic packing, or even plugging penetrating wounds. Certain situations might require leaving the liver packed and taking the patient for angio-embolization or if operating in a hybrid operating room having perform an on table angio-embolization. Vessels that are able to be ligated should, and one should consider shunting other vessels that do not fall into this category. This has been described by Reilly and colleagues when they shunted the superior mesenteric artery to decrease the length of time in the operating room. Once hemorrhage control is achieved one should quickly proceed to controlling intra-abdominal contamination from hollow-viscus organs. The perception might be that one could quickly perform an anastomosis. This should not be attempted in the damage control setting. The key is to simply prevent continued intra-abdominal contamination, and to leave patients in discontinuity. A number of different techniques can be employed such as using staplers to come across the bowel, or primary suture closure in small perforations. Once this is complete the abdomen should be packed. Many of these patients become coagulopathic and can develop diffuse oozing. It is important to not only pack areas of injury but also pack areas of surgical dissection. There are various methods that can be used to pack the abdomen. Packing with radiopaque laparotomy pads allow for the benefit of being able to detect them via x-ray prior to definitive closure. As a rule abdomens should not be definitively closed until there has been radiologic confirmation that no retained objects are present in the abdomen. The final step of this phase is applying a temporary closure device. Numerous methods of temporary closure exist, with the most common technique being a negative-vacuum type device. Regardless of which method one decides to use it is important that the abdominal fascia is not reapproximated. The ability to develop Abdominal Compartment Syndrome is a real concern and described by Schwab. =ICU resuscitation= On completion of the initial phase of damage control, the key is to reverse the physiologic insult that took place. This specifically relates to factors such as acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia (lethal triad) that many of these critically ill patients develop. When developing a strategy to best care for these patients, the same principles of having a multi-disciplinary team that work together in parallel for the same end result apply. The intensivist is critical in working with the staff to ensure that the physiologic abnormalities are treated. This typically requires close monitoring in the intensive care unit, ventilator support, laboratory monitoring of resuscitation parameters (i.e., lactate). In using a number of different resuscitation parameters, the critical care team can have a better idea as to which direction is progressing. The first 24 hours often require a significant amount of resources (i.e., blood products) and investment of time from personnel within the critical care team. In many circumstances, especially trauma patients, require that other specialties address a variety of injuries. Moving the patient early on, unless absolutely necessary, can be detrimental. Certain circumstances might require this, and the patients should continue to receive care from the critical care team during the entire transport period. As the literature begins to grow within the field of damage control surgery, the medical community is continuously learning how to improve the process. Certain pitfalls have also become evident, one of which is the potential to develop abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). While it might sound counterintuitive since the fascia is left open during the placement of these temporary closure devices, they can create a similar type process that leads to ACS. If this occurs the temporary closure device should be taken down immediately. =Definitive reconstruction= The third step in damage control surgery is addressing closure of the abdomen. Definitive reconstruction occurs only when the patient is improving. At this point in process the critical care team has been able to correct the physiologic derangements. The optimization typically takes 24 to 48 hours, depending on how severe the initial insult is. Prior to being taken back to the operating room it is paramount that the resolution of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy has occurred. The first step after removing the temporary closure device is to ensure that all abdominal packs are removed. Typically the number of packs has been documented in the initial laparotomy; however, an abdominal radiograph should be taken prior to definitive closure of the fascia to ensure that no retained sponges are left in the abdomen. Once the abdominal packs are removed the next step is to re-explore the abdomen allowing for the identification of potentially missed injuries during the initial laparotomy and re-evaluating the prior injuries. Attention is then turned to performing the necessary bowel anastomosis or other definitive repairs (i.e., vascular injuries). An attempt should be made to close the abdominal fascia at the first take back, to prevent complications that can result from having an open abdomen. The concern for early closure of the abdomen with development of compartment syndrome is a real one. A method to pre-emptively evaluate whether fascial closure is appropriate would be to determine the difference in peak airway pressure (PAP) prior to closure and the right after closure. An increase of over 10 would suggest that the abdomen be left open. As mentioned above, it is important to obtain an abdominal radiograph to ensure that no retained sponges are left intra-operatively. Considering that not all patients can undergo definitive reconstruction at first return, there are other options that surgeons can consider. Data would suggest that the longer the abdomen is left open from initial laparotomy the higher the rate of complications. After about one week, if surgeons can't close the abdomen, they should consider placing a Vicryl mesh to cover the abdominal contents. This lets granulation occur over a few weeks, with the subsequent ability to place a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) on top for coverage. These patients clearly have a hernia that must be fixed 9 to 12 months later. Resuscitation Damage control resuscitation has had a dramatic impact on how care for critically ill patients is administered.. The core principles of resuscitation involve permissive hypotension, transfusion ratios, and massive transfusion protocol. The resuscitation period lets any physiologic derangements be reversed to give the best outcome for patient care. =Permissive hypotension= Typical resuscitation strategies have used an approach where aggressive crystalloid and/or blood product resuscitation is performed to restore blood volume. The term permissive hypotension refers to maintaining a low blood pressure to mitigate hemorrhage; however, continue providing adequate end-organ perfusion [Duchesene, 2010]. The key is to prevent exacerbation of hemorrhaging until definitive vascular control can be achieved, the theory being that if clots have formed within a vessel then increasing the patient's blood pressure might dislodge those established clots resulting in more significant bleeding. Permissive hypotension is not a new concept, and had been described in penetrating thoracic trauma patients during World War I by Bickell and colleagues demonstrating an improvement in both survival and complications. Subsequent animal studies have shown equivalent outcomes with no real benefit in mortality Recently there has been further data in trauma patients that has demonstrated increased survival rates [Morrison, 2011]. Cotton and colleagues found that the use of a permissive hypotension resuscitation strategy resulted in better outcomes (increased 30-day survival) in those undergoing damage control laparotomy. This would not be used in situations where patients might have injuries such as a traumatic brain injury considering that such patients are excluded from the studies. =Transfusion ratios= For over a century the casualties of war have provided valuable lessons that can be applied within the civilian sector. Specifically the past decade has seen a paradigm shift in early resuscitation of critically injured patients. Instead of replacing blood volume with high volumes of crystalloid and packed red blood cells with the sporadic use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets, we have now learned that maintaining a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 of plasma to red blood cells to platelets in patients requiring massive transfusion results in improved outcomes [Borgman 2007] While this was initially demonstrated in the military setting, Holcomb and colleagues extrapolated this to the civilian trauma center showing improved results as well Holcomb JB, Pati S. Optimal trauma resuscitation with plasma as the primary resuscitative fluid: the surgeon’s perspective. Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program. 2013; 656-9. Broad implementation across both the military and civilian sector has demonstrated a decreased mortality in critically injured patients. Debate has gone back and forth as to the correct ratio that should be used; however, recently Holcomb and colleagues published the Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study. They compared administration a higher ratio of plasma and platelets (1:1:1) compared to a lower ratio (1:1:2). The patients that received a higher ratio had an associated three to four-fold decrease in mortality. To help mitigate confounding variables a randomized control trial called the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) is being performed to evaluate the transfusion requirement. =Massive transfusion protocol= Initial resuscitation of trauma patients continues to evolve. Massive transfusion (defined as receiving greater than or equal to 10 units of packed red blood cells with a 24-hour period) is required in up to 5% of civilian trauma patients that arrive severely injured. Patients who are arriving severely injured to trauma centers can be coagulopathic. In fact, data suggests that around 25% of patients arrive having coagulopathy.Brohi 2008 New ways of measuring coagulopathy such at thromboelstography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) have allowed for a more robust assessment of the coagulation cascade compared to traditional methods of measuring international normalized ratio (INR) allowing clinicians to better target areas of deficiency. For trauma teams to systematically and efficiently deliver blood products institutions have created protocols that allow for this. The protocols allow for clear communication between the trauma center, blood bank, nurses, and other ancillary staff. They also allow for the quick delivery of certain set of blood products depending upon the institution. One example might be that a “cooler” would contain 10 units of packed red blood cells, 10 units of plasma, and 2 packs of platelets. The idea is that the coolers would continue to be delivered to the location where the patient is being treated until the trauma team leader (typically the trauma surgeon) would discontinue the order Certain factors have been looked at by Callcut and colleagues to determine the predictive ability of patients arriving at trauma centers. The different variables were systolic blood pressure below 90, hemoglobin <11 g/dL, temperature <35.5, INR > 1.5, base deficit >=6, heart rate >= 120 bpm, presence of penetrating trauma, and positive Focused Abdominal Sonography Trauma (FAST) exam. All the variables were found to be predictive of the need of massive transfusion protocol except for temperature (Callcut 2013). History Surgeons have used the concept of damage control surgery for years, and controlling hemorrhage with packing is over a century old. Pringle described this technique in patients with substantial hepatic trauma in the early twentieth century. The U.S. military did not encourage this technique during World War II and the Vietnam War. Lucas and Ledgerwood described the principle in a series of patients. Subsequent studies were repeated by Feliciano and colleagues, and they found that hepatic packing increased survival by 90%. This technique was then specifically linked to patients who were hemorrhaging, hypothermic, and coagulopathic. This extrapolation allowed for the first article in 1993 by Rotondo and Schwab specifically adapting the term “damage control”. This term was taken from the United States Navy who initially used the term as “the capacity of a ship to absorb damage and maintain mission integrity” (DOD 1996). This was the first article that brought together the concept of limiting operative time in these critically ill patients to allow for reversal of physiologic insults to improve survival. In addition, the description illustrated how the three phases of damage control surgery can be implemented. Since this description the development of this concept has grown both within the trauma community and beyond. Outcomes The data that have been published regarding definitive laparotomy versus damage control surgery demonstrate a decrease in mortality when performed in the critically ill patient. Subsequent studies by Rotondo and colleagues in a group of 961 patients that had undergone damage control surgery demonstrate an overall mortality of 50% and a 40% morbidity rate. There are four main complications. The first is development of an intra- abdominal abscess. This has been reported as high as 83%. Next is the development of an entero-atmospheric fistula, which ranges from 2 to 25%. The third is abdominal compartment syndrome that has been reported anywhere from 10 to 40% of the time. Finally fascial dehiscence has been show to result in 9–25% of patients that have undergone damage control surgery. References Bibliography   Surface Ship Survivability.

Life  Dorrit Cohn was born in Vienna in 1924. Her family left Austria only a few days before the Anschluss in 1938. She immigrated to the United States with her family in 1939, attending the Lycée Français in New York City. She studied Physics (AB, 1945) and Comparative Literature (AM, 1946) at Radcliffe College. She started graduate work in Comparative Literature at Yale and resumed it after an 11-year hiatus, earning a Ph.D in German from Stanford. Her dissertation (basis of her 1966 book) was on Hermann Broch's 1930-32 novel Die Schlafwandler. She taught at Indiana University from 1964 before moving to Harvard in June 1971, where (as one of the first women professors with tenure) she taught Comparative and German Literature as the Ernest Bernbaum Professor of Literature. She retired in 1995, and her final years were spent in Durham, North Carolina.  Work  Dorrit Cohn's main work was in Narratology. Her most prominent work, Transparent Minds (1978), studies how characters' consciousnesses are reflected in fiction in a variety of first- and third-person works, mostly from the 19th-century Realist and 20th- century Modernist traditions. Her work in this area was closely related to that of Gérard Genette and Franz Stanzel, with both of whom she had productive exchanges about the best way to analyze how consciousness is presented in fiction. Toward the end of her life she became very interested in the formal differences between fictional and non-fictional narratives; her 1999 book The Distinction of Fiction treats works by Freud and Proust, the fictional biography Marbot by Wolfgang Hildesheimer (who had also written a best-selling biography of Mozart), Thomas Mann's Death in Venice, and historical novels by Stendhal and Tolstoy. The book won the MLA’s Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literature Studies. In addition to the two books, she published many articles on works of fiction in German and other languages. She also had an abiding interest in Freud and Freudian interpretation.

Foundation The business that became the Colnaghi gallery was established by Italian firework manufacturer, Giovanni Battista Torre, in Paris, France, in 1760. Torre opened a shop with the name \\"Cabinet de Physique Expérimentale\\", where he sold scientific instruments, books and prints. In 1767, Torre's son Anthony Torre moved to London where he opened a sister shop, specialising in prints, in partnership with another Italian immigrant, Anthony Molteno. Giovanni Torre died in 1780, and in 1784 Anthony Torre hired Paul Colnaghi—newly arrived in Paris from Milan—to manage a new shop in Palais Royal, Paris. Paul Colnaghi (1751-1833) Paul Colnaghi was born in 1751 as Paolo Colnago, in the Brianza region of northern Italy. He was the younger child of the influential Milanese lawyer Dr Martino Colnago and Ippolita Colnaga (née Raggi).Paul Colnaghi - Dictionary of National Biography, Vol 11. He arrived in Paris after his father's death in 1783, where he initially worked for a Milanese optician named Ciceri, before Ciceri recommended Colnaghi's services to his friend Anthony Torre. Paul Colnaghi served as Torre's Paris agent (1784-7), mainly selling prints from England, but he left Paris for London in May 1785.Colnaghi (Biographical details) - British Museum Arriving in London, Colnaghi joined Torre and Molteno, who had become successful selling prints by leading engravers such as William Wynne Ryland and Valentine Green. The London business moved to 132 Pall Mall in 1786 and Colnaghi married Anthony Torre's sister-in-law Elizabeth Baker. Anthony Torre retired to Italy in 1788, and Molteno took over as senior partner. The firm operated as Molteno, Colnaghi & Co.Molteno & Colnaghi (130 Pall Mall & 98 Sloane Street) for a time, with a new business connection to Italian partners in Paris, before Molteno left to found a separate company in 1793. Colnaghi now ran the original firm with a succession of partnersColnaghi, Sala & Co.; Colnaghi & Puckle; Colnaghi & Co., concentrating on selling new prints and engravings of Old Master paintings. He published a very popular series of engravings, the Cries of London, from 1792 to 1797. He also moved premises to 23 Cockspur Street in 1799, and survived the disruption to his trade caused by the Napoleonic Wars. Paul Colnaghi's elder son Dominic Charles (sometimes also given as Dominic Paul) became a partner in around 1810, and later his younger son Martin also became a partner. The firm held monthly levées at its premises for its customers, many from the British aristocracy. Colnaghi became the official print-seller to the Prince Regent, and he was asked to organise the Royal Collection, receiving a Royal Warrant when the Prince Regent became George IV. Colnaghi was also print-seller to George's sister, Charlotte, Princess Royal, later Queen of Württemberg. His daughter Caroline had married John Scott in 1807. Scott was founder of the resurrected London Magazine, in 1820, but was killed in a duel the following year. Colnaghi's impending retirement to Italy was postponed when his son Martin sued both his father and his brother Dominic in 1824. The settlement of the lawsuit left Martin with the old shop. Martin became bankrupt in 1832 and 1843, and died in 1851, but his son Martin Henry Colnaghi, continued the separate business in Pall Mall. Paul and Dominic Colnaghi moved to 14 Pall Mall East—near the nascent National Gallery. Dominic married Katherine Pontet (d.1881) on 15 October 1831, and settled at 62 Margaret street, Cavendish square. Paul Colnaghi continued to work in the business until he died at his home at St George's Place Hanover Square, on 26 August 1833. Dominic Colnaghi (1790-1879) and John Scott (d.1864) Dominic Charles Colnaghi (1790–1879) Caroline Scott's son, John Anthony Scott, joined his cousin Dominic Colnaghi in the business in 1839. Scott commissioned William Simpson to go to the Crimea in 1854 to make watercolour sketches of scenes from the Crimean War, published as a series of 81 lithographs in The Seat of War in the East. The gallery also sold photographs by Roger Fenton. After this early experience with photography, the gallery commissioned Leonida Caldesi and Mattia Montecchi to take photographs at the Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857, published in Gems of the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1858, and Colnaghi published artistic photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron from 1864. The firm was associated with John Constable, assisting him to exhibit The Hay Wain at the Paris Salon in 1824, where it won a gold medal. The art dealership organised exhibitions for the British Institution, and of paintings by Eugène Delacroix in 1829. After Scott died in 1864, and Dominic Colnaghi retired in 1865, Scott's cousin Andrew McKay became sole proprietor. He was joined by his son William KcKay in 1879. \\"Old Dom\\" Colnaghi died the same year, on 19 December, and was buried in Brompton cemetery.http://shop.nvva.nl/info_nvva.php?bookid=8701960 He was survived by his wife Katherine (also spelled Catherine) and by his two sons. Old Master art dealer In 1910, Colnaghi and Knoedler acquired Woman Holding a Balance by Johannes Vermeer. On 11 January 1911 the painting was sold to P.A.B. Widener whose son, Joseph donated it to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. When Andrew McKay retired in 1894, William McKay was joined in partnership by Edmund Deprez and Otto Gutekunst. Gutekunst was the son of Hermann Gutekunst, who managed the London branch of Paris art dealer Goupil & Cie in the 1860s. From the early 1860s he was working in the firm's London branch then managed by . The change of partners led to a significant change in the focus of the dealership. Colnaghi had been known primarily as a print- seller in the 19th century, but the firm started to gain a reputation as a dealer of Old Master paintings. The sale of original Old Master works accelerated for a number of reasons: the Settled Land Act 1882 allowed the breaking of entailed estates, allowing sales of aristocratic collections; the need to pay death duties, introduced in 1894, spurred the sale of works from the collections of the British aristocracy; and American collectors developed a taste for Old Master works. With American art dealer Bernard Berenson, Colnaghi established a collection of Old Master paintings for Isabella Stewart Gardner for her house in Boston, including the Rape of Europa by Titian, acquired from Lord Darnley in 1896. The firm sold two paintings from the collection of Prince Mario Chigi Albani della Rovere—Botticelli's Madonna of the Eucharist and Titian's Portrait of Pietro Aretino—to Henry Clay Frick, now in the Frick Collection, although the sale of Italian paintings dried up after Prince Chigi was prosecuted under Italian new law prohibiting the export of pictures. The new law also prevented the sale of Titian's Sacred and Profane Love from the Borghese collection. Berenson was offered a partnership by Colnaghi in 1901, but decided not to accept the offer and later signed a partnership agreement with Colnaghi's arch-rival, Joseph Duveen. Colnaghi hired instead Charlie Carstairs of New York gallery Knoedler instead. Colnaghi developed a fruitful relationship with Knoedler, with Colnaghi finding suitable paintings in Europe for Knoedler to sell to wealthy collectors in the United States, including Andrew Mellon. Through Knoedler, Colnaghi sold to Mellon a Rembrandt Self-portrait that Gutekunst had acquired from the Duke of Buccleuch, and Holbein's Portrait of Edward VI. Colnaghi negotiated the sale of Lord Ashburnham's Botticelli, The Death of Lucretia to Isabella Stewart Gardner, and also the sale of Rembrandt's Preacher Anslo and his wife. Colnaghi assisted Wilhelm von Bode to negotiate for the acquisition of the Hope Collection (gathered by banker Thomas Hope and inherited by Francis Hope, later 8th Duke of Newcastle) for the Berlin State Museums. Colnaghi sold Holbein's Christina of Denmark, Duchess of Milan to the National Gallery in for a record price of £61,000, acquired from the collection of the Duke of Norfolk. Deprez retired in 1907, and William McKay in 1911. The firm merged with Obach & Co in 1911—Gutekunst having married Charles Obach's daughter Lena in 1882—and Gustavus Mayer, formerly manager of Obach in New Bond Street, joined as Colnaghi as a partner, with the firm renamed P. & D. Colnaghi and Obach. The firm moved to a new building in New Bond Street in 1912, but returned to the name P. and D. Colnaghi and Company in 1914 (perhaps due to popular sentiment against German-sounding names at the beginning of the First World War). Hermitage sales Colnaghi was involved in the secret sales by the Soviet government of works from the Russian Imperial collection in the Hermitage in the 1920s and 1930s, along with Knoedler and Matthiesen in Berlin. Calouste Gulbenkian had bought four sets of works from the Russian government in 1928 to 1930, most now held by the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon. Colnaghi, Knoedler and Matthiesen assisted Paul Mellon to acquire many Russian works, including van Dyck's Portrait of Philip, 4th Lord Wharton, Jan van Eyck's Annunciation, Botticelli's Adoration of the Magi, Perugino's Crucifixion, Raphael's Saint George and the Dragon and Alba Madonna, Titian's Venus with a Mirror, and other works by Rembrandt and van Dyck. Mellon later donated his collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Recent history In 1937, the firm becomes a limited company, with three directors: Otto Gutekunst, Gustavus Mayer, and James Byam Shaw. Gutekunst retired in 1939 and died in 1947; Mayer died in 1954. Meanwhile, Harold Wright and Tom Baskett became directors in 1939, and Roderic Thesiger in 1955. Colnaghi moved from New Bond Street to Old Bond Street in 1940, to share space with Knoedler. The Old Master Drawings department became pre-eminent under the leadership of James Byam Shaw, and Byam Shaw largely determined the direction of the firm after Mayer's death in 1954 until his own retirement in 1968. The gallery was involved in the sale of an outstanding collection of prints by the Prince of Liechtenstein. As Thesiger also wished to retire, and John Baskett wanted to start his own business, Jacob Rothschild bought the company in 1970. He sold Colnaghi to the Oetker Group in 1981, owned by a Colnaghi client Rudolf Oetker. Under Richard Knight, Colnaghi expanded in the buoyant art market of the 1980s, opening a gallery in New York in 1983. Changing market conditions led to the closure of the print and watercolour departments in 1989, followed by the closure of Paris gallery and then Colnaghi New York in 1996. In 2001, the Oetker Group sold Colnaghi to Konrad Bernheimer, owner of Bernheimer Fine Old Masters in Munich. Colnaghi was merged with the gallery of Katrin Bellinger who took charge of Colnaghi's drawings department. Since 2015, the CEO has been Jorge Coll. He has acquired Colnaghi from Konrad Bernheimer together with his business partner Nicolas Cortes. Konrad Bernheimer has retired as chairman. Colnaghi have since moved into a custom- built gallery in St James's in London where they show European Old Master paintings and sculpture, and art from the Spanish-speaking world. In 2017, Colnaghi opened a gallery in New York led by Carlos A. Picón, formerly curator of Greek and Roman Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, expanding their offering to include art of the ancient world.  The Archives of Colnaghi  Colnaghi includes a 225-foot archive of important art dealers records, currently stored outside London at the Windmill Hill Archives, Waddesdon Manor. In 2002, Katrin Bellinger Henkel and Konrad Bernheimer bought them from Christoph Graf Douglas, the former head of Sotheby’s in Germany and the son- in-law of Rudolf August Oetker, whose company owned Colnaghi and its archives between 1981 and 2001. Jorge Coll and Nicolas Cortes, the new owners of Colnaghi, also took over the Colnaghi Library and Archives. References External links * * History, Colnaghi website * P. & D.

Ferguson. The screenplay was written by Andy S. McEwan. In Search of La Che premiered at the Glasgow Film TheatreGlasgow Film Theatre Listing on 9 November 2011. Plot In Search of La Che follows he journey of hardcore music fan John Tavish (Played by Duncan Airlie James) on his quest to find out the circumstances behind the disappearance of Scotland most famous (fictional) son of rock and roll, Roxy La Che. Searching the internet, John finds that Roxy's life hasn't been very well documented and comes across very little other than an unofficial fan page for the rock star. The owner of the site, Larry, agrees to meet with John but his mental instability becomes visibly clear during the interview and John decides to make a quick exit after obtaining the information he needed. John tracks down Archie Munro, a pub landlord who gave Roxy his first taste of music fame when he persuaded him to take part in a karaoke night. Archie gives John a history of Roxy's troubled upbringing on Pishi Island where the local economy was decimated by the actions of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Without adequate means to make a living on the island, Roxy moved to Glasgow and managed to transform his life through his love for music. During the interview, John discovers for the first time that Roxy was in fact signed by two record companies instead of one. The first record label was run by Hector 'Blitzkrieg' Wallace who was a Nazi sympathiser and forced Roxy to sing songs about hatred. Roxy's time with Blitzkrieg was brief as he later jumped ship to Met Records run by Gary Pringle. After speaking with both of Roxy's managers, John is made aware of Roxy's various battles with depression which often lead to long stays at rehabilitation units. Moving from sofa to sofa, Roxy's last known appearance was with his old roadie friend Shimmy Quiffer. Shimmy explains to John that he had been staying with him for six months during the early 1990s but upon returning home one day, Roxy was packed up ready to go but couldn't tell Shimmy where he was going. Thinking the trail has gone cold, John receives an unopened letter from Shimmy that arrived for Roxy shortly after his departure. The letter is written by Alex H. Croy, an old friend of Roxy telling him that the pair should meet up as he is now staying in a hospice not far from Shimmy's location. John visits the hospice in the hope of meeting his idol but his hopes are dashed when it is revealed that Roxy La Che had died in 2002, twenty years after the release of his first album.

The study of equidissections began in the late 1960s with Monsky's theorem, which states that a square cannot be equidissected into an odd number of triangles. In fact, most polygons cannot be equidissected at all. Much of the literature is aimed at generalizing Monsky's theorem to broader classes of polygons. The general question is: Which polygons can be equidissected into how many pieces? Particular attention has been given to trapezoids, kites, regular polygons, centrally symmetric polygons, polyominos, and hypercubes. Equidissections do not have many direct applications. They are considered interesting because the results are counterintuitive at first, and for a geometry problem with such a simple definition, the theory requires some surprisingly sophisticated algebraic tools. Many of the results rely upon extending p-adic valuations to the real numbers and extending Sperner's lemma to more general colored graphs. Overview =Definitions= A dissection of a polygon P is a finite set of triangles that do not overlap and whose union is all of P. A dissection into n triangles is called an n-dissection, and it is classified as an even dissection or an odd dissection according to whether n is even or odd. An equidissection is a dissection in which every triangle has the same area. For a polygon P, the set of all n for which an n-equidissection of P exists is called the spectrum of P and denoted S(P). A general theoretical goal is to compute the spectrum of a given polygon. A dissection is called simplicial if the triangles meet only along common edges. Some authors restrict their attention to simplicial dissections, especially in the secondary literature, since they are easier to work with. For example, the usual statement of Sperner's lemma applies only to simplicial dissections. Often simplicial dissections are called triangulations, although the vertices of the triangles are not restricted to the vertices or edges of the polygon. Simplicial equidissections are therefore also called equal-area triangulations. The terms can be extended to higher-dimensional polytopes: an equidissection is set of simplexes having the same n-volume. =Preliminaries= It is easy to find an n-equidissection of a triangle for all n. As a result, if a polygon has an m-equidissection, then it also has an mn-equidissection for all n. In fact, often a polygon's spectrum consists precisely of the multiples of some number m; in this case, both the spectrum and the polygon are called principal and the spectrum is denoted \\\\langle m \\\\rangle. For example, the spectrum of a triangle is \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle. A simple example of a non-principal polygon is the quadrilateral with vertices (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (3/2, 3/2); its spectrum includes 2 and 3 but not 1. Affine transformations of the plane are useful for studying equidissections, including translations, uniform and non- uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon that might give it a more manageable form. For example, it is common to choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0). The fact that affine transformations preserve equidissections also means that certain results can be easily generalized. All results stated for a regular polygon also hold for affine-regular polygons; in particular, results concerning the unit square also apply to other parallelograms, including rectangles and rhombuses. All results stated for polygons with integer coordinates also apply to polygons with rational coordinates, or polygons whose vertices fall on any other lattice. =Best results= Monsky's theorem states that a square has no odd equidissections, so its spectrum is \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle. More generally, it is known that centrally symmetric polygons and polyominos have no odd equidissections.; A conjecture by Sherman K. Stein proposes that no special polygon has an odd equidissection, where a special polygon is one whose equivalence classes of parallel edges each sum to the zero vector. Squares, centrally symmetric polygons, polyominos, and polyhexes are all special polygons. For n > 4, the spectrum of a regular n-gon is \\\\langle n \\\\rangle. For n > 1, the spectrum of an n-dimensional cube is \\\\langle n! \\\\rangle, where n! is the factorial of n. Let T(a) be a trapezoid where a is the ratio of parallel side lengths. If a is a rational number, then T(a) is principal. In fact, if r/s is a fraction in lowest terms, then S(T(r/s)) = \\\\langle r + s \\\\rangle. More generally, all convex polygons with rational coordinates can be equidissected, although not all of them are principal; see the above example of a kite with a vertex at (3/2, 3/2). At the other extreme, if a is a transcendental number, then T(a) has no equidissection. More generally, no polygon whose vertex coordinates are algebraically independent has an equidissection.See for more precise statements of this principle. This means that almost all polygons with more than three sides cannot be equidissected. Although most polygons cannot be cut into equal-area triangles, all polygons can be cut into equal-area quadrilaterals. If a is an algebraic irrational number, then T(a) is a trickier case. If a is algebraic of degree 2 or 3 (quadratic or cubic), and its conjugates all have positive real parts, then S(T(a)) contains all sufficiently large n such that n/(1 + a) is an algebraic integer. It is conjectured that a similar condition involving stable polynomials may determine whether or not the spectrum is empty for algebraic numbers a of all degrees.; History The idea of an equidissection seems like the kind of elementary geometric concept that should be quite old. remark of Monsky's theorem, \\"one could have guessed that surely the answer must have been known for a long time (if not to the Greeks).\\" But the study of equidissections did not begin until 1965, when Fred Richman was preparing a master's degree exam at New Mexico State University. =Monsky's theorem= Richman wanted to include a question on geometry in the exam, and he noticed that it was difficult to find (what is now called) an odd equidissection of a square. Richman proved to himself that it was impossible for 3 or 5, that the existence of an n-equidissection implies the existence of an -dissection, and that certain quadrilaterals arbitrarily close to being squares have odd equidissections. However, he did not solve the general problem of odd equidissections of squares, and he left it off the exam. Richman's friend John Thomas became interested in the problem; in his recollection, :\\"Everyone to whom the problem was put (myself included) said something like 'that is not my area but the question surely must have been considered and the answer is probably well known.' Some thought they had seen it, but could not remember where. I was interested because it reminded me of Sperner's Lemma in topology, which has a clever odd-even proof.\\" Thomas proved that an odd equidissection was impossible if the coordinates of the vertices are rational numbers with odd denominators. He submitted this proof to Mathematics Magazine, but it was put on hold: :\\"The referee's reaction was predictable. He thought the problem might be fairly easy (although he could not solve it) and was possibly well- known (although he could find no reference to it).\\" The question was instead given as an Advanced Problem in the American Mathematical Monthly . When nobody else submitted a solution, the proof was published in Mathematics Magazine , three years after it was written. then built on Thomas' argument to prove that there are no odd equidissections of a square, without any rationality assumptions. Monsky's proof relies on two pillars: a combinatorial result that generalizes Sperner's lemma and an algebraic result, the existence of a 2-adic valuation on the real numbers. A clever coloring of the plane then implies that in all dissections of the square, at least one triangle has an area with what amounts to an even denominator, and therefore all equidissections must be even. The essence of the argument is found already in , but was the first to use a 2-adic valuation to cover dissections with arbitrary coordinates.; =Generalizations= The first generalization of Monsky's theorem was , who proved that the spectrum of an n-dimensional cube is \\\\langle n! \\\\rangle. The proof is revisited by . Generalization to regular polygons arrived in 1985, during a geometry seminar run by G. D. Chakerian at UC Davis. Elaine Kasimatis, a graduate student, \\"was looking for some algebraic topic she could slip into\\" the seminar. Sherman Stein suggested dissections of the square and the cube: \\"a topic that Chakerian grudgingly admitted was geometric.\\" After her talk, Stein asked about regular pentagons. Kasimatis answered with , proving that for n > 5, the spectrum of a regular n-gon is \\\\langle n \\\\rangle. Her proof builds on Monsky's proof, extending the p-adic valuation to the complex numbers for each prime divisor of n and applying some elementary results from the theory of cyclotomic fields. It is also the first proof to explicitly use an affine transformation to set up a convenient coordinate system. then framed the problem of finding the spectrum of a general polygon, introducing the terms spectrum and principal. They proved that almost all polygons lack equidissections, and that not all polygons are principal. began the study of the spectra of two particular generalizations of squares: trapezoids and kites. Trapezoids have been further studied by , , and . Kites have been further studied by . General quadrilaterals have been studied in . Several papers have been authored at Hebei Normal University, chiefly by Professor Ding Ren and his students Du Yatao and Su Zhanjun.; Attempting to generalize the results for regular n-gons for even n, conjectured that no centrally symmetric polygon has an odd equidissection, and he proved the n = 6 and n = 8 cases. The full conjecture was proved by . A decade later, Stein made what he describes as \\"a surprising breakthrough\\", conjecturing that no polyomino has an odd equidissection. He proved the result of a polyomino with an odd number of squares in . The full conjecture was proved when treated the even case. The topic of equidissections has recently been popularized by treatments in The Mathematical Intelligencer , a volume of the Carus Mathematical Monographs , and the fourth edition of Proofs from THE BOOK . Related problems consider a variation of the problem: Given a convex polygon K, how much of its area can be covered by n non-overlapping triangles of equal area inside K? The ratio of the area of the best possible coverage to the area of K is denoted tn(K). If K has an n-equidissection, then tn(K) = 1; otherwise it is less than 1. The authors show that for a quadrilateral K, tn(K) ≥ 4n/(4n + 1), with t2(K) = 8/9 if and only if K is affinely congruent to the trapezoid T(2/3). For a pentagon, t2(K) ≥ 2/3, t3(K) ≥ 3/4, and tn(K) ≥ 2n/(2n + 1) for n ≥ 5. Günter M. Ziegler asked the converse problem in 2003: Given a dissection of the whole of a polygon into n triangles, how close can the triangle areas be to equal? In particular, what is the smallest possible difference between the areas of the smallest and largest triangles? Let the smallest difference be M(n) for a square and M(a, n) for the trapezoid T(a). Then M(n) is 0 for even n and greater than 0 for odd n. gave the asymptotic upper bound M(n) = O(1/n2) (see Big O notation). improves the bound to M(n) = O(1/n3) with a better dissection, and he proves that there exist values of a for which M(a, n) decreases arbitrarily quickly. obtain a superpolynomial upper bound, derived from an explicit construction that uses the Thue–Morse sequence.

It was at one time the capital of the last Tunjur ruler, Shau Dorshid. It comprises large- scale area of stone and brick walls. It has been visited or described many times. Ain Farah moved one author to quote Macaulay – “like an eagle’s nest that hangs on the crest”, for it is built some above a spring. It is characterised by several hundred brick and stone structures and terraces, and is defended by steep ridges and by a massive stone wall long. There is a brick and stone edifice which appears to have served as a mosque, a large stone group which may have served as a public building, and a main group on the highest point of the ridge, described variously as a royal residence or military defence. Geography It lies in the Furnung Hills some northwest of El Fasher, and to the southwest of Dongola. The region is picturesque, with relatively fertile hills and spring sources. The archaeological site is situated close to a hill, about above the source lakes. Date palms thrive in the lakes. From there, the access goes through a dry valley, which was previously secured in the back by a wall.  Archaeology  Archaeological work is in early stages. A survey of a sample of houses and excavation of a grave was undertaken by Ibrahim Musa Mohammed (1986) during his survey of Darfur. The grave contained a flexed burial and over 200 iron beads, an ostrich eggshell necklace, a perforated cowrie shell, and iron jewellery. One of the corroded iron objects yielded a surprisingly early date (1500 +/- 200 bp, Q 3155), falling at least six and perhaps as many as eleven centuries before the likely time of the Tunjur; Mohammed interprets this as signifying a pre-Islamic presence and continuation into Islamic times. Christian Nubian pottery has been found at the site in the ruins of a brick-built monastery.

Susskind is known for his work on string theory and wrote a previous popular science book, The Cosmic Landscape, in 2005. Overview Hawking proposed that information is lost in black holes, and not preserved in Hawking radiation. Susskind disagreed, arguing that Hawking's conclusions violated one of the most basic scientific laws of the universe, the conservation of information. As Susskind depicts in his book, The Black Hole War was a \\"genuine scientific controversy\\" between scientists favoring an emphasis on the principles of relativity against those in favor of quantum mechanics. The debate led to the holographic principle, proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and refined by Susskind, which suggested that the information is in fact preserved, stored on the boundary of a system. Reception Sean M. Carroll in the Wall Street Journal praised the book for successfully explaining the topic in a way that lay readers could understand, despite the difficulty of the subject. Carroll writes that the book contains a \\"wealth of anecdotes\\", and that Susskind's \\"wit and storytelling abilities ... are pleasantly on display in\\" the book. George Johnson of The New York Times was critical of the beginning of the book, writing that the introduction on the basic concepts of relativity and quantum mechanics was excessive, especially for readers who have already read other popular science books on theoretical physics.

Eventually consisting of three beamlines at the Synchrotron Radiation Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA, it served the Canadian synchrotron community until the opening of the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, finally ceasing operations in 2008. Beginnings Opening ceremony for CSRF at SRC, October 1983. L to R: Norman Sherman, Bill McGowan, Brian Yates (UWO), Ed Rowe, Brenda Addison (UWO), Mike Bancroft, Kim Tan In 1972 Mike Bancroft, a chemistry professor at the University of Western Ontario (UWO) took part in a workshop organised by Bill McGowan on the uses of synchrotron radiation. At the time there were no synchrotron users in Canada, but as a result of contact established with then- director Ed Rowe at the meeting, he began work at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1975. After several failed attempts were made to establish a synchrotron facility in Canada, Bancroft submitted a proposal to the National Research Council (NRC) to build a Canadian beamline on the existing Tantalus synchrotron at SRC. Rowe had offered Bancroft 100% use of the beamline at no charge in perpetuity – Bancroft recalled that Rowe \\"had a soft spot for Canadians, he had some relatives from Canada, so he was extremely helpful\\". In 1978 the newly created NSERC awarded capital funding. This was not sufficient, and further funding was obtained from the UWO Academic Development Fund and NSERC the following year to complete two endstations. Bancoft would later say \\"We hoped to get more beamlines so we called it the Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility (CSRF)\\". Bancroft was appointed Scientific Director, with Norman Sherman of NRC, who were to own and manage the facility, as manager. Operating money was initially provided by UWO, and Kim Tan was hired as the CSRF operations manager, to be based in Madison. 1978–1988: Grasshopper beamline Kim Tan (L) and Masoud Kasrai UWO, (R) with the Grasshopper beamline on the Aladdin ring, late 1980s A Grasshopper-type monochromator – so-called as its mechanical drive arm resembled a grasshopper's hind legs – was ordered from Baker Engineering. This type of monochromator had been specifically designed for use with synchrotron radiation, and had proven easy to use, rugged and dependable at the existing SRC ring, Tantalus, and at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The beamline was installed within a year, and by late 1981 initial results showed the performance to be state of the art over the 50–500eV photon energy range. Notable early work included X-ray microscopy on biological samples, and gas- phase spectroscopy with a very influential series of papers on noble gases. In the mid-1980s the number of publications steadily increased, as did operating funding through NRC and NSERC. SRC was building a new synchrotron, Aladdin, and again Rowe offered CSRF 100% use of their beamline at no change in perpetuity on the new machine. Aladdin was seriously delayed, to the point where its funding was cut and future seemed highly uncertain. With the new machine's performance improving, the decision was made to transfer the beamline to Aladdin in January 1986, some months before Aladdin's funding was restored. Bancroft later commented: \\"We were I think, the first beamline to transfer over, maybe we took a little bit of a risk because Aladdin's performance wasn't completely confirmed\\". On Aladdin, with the higher X-ray intensity, new areas of science were opened up and the number of users increased mostly focused on X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy of gases and solids. A photoemission spectrometer was donated by Ron Cavell of the University of Alberta and modified for high resolution gas-phase work. 1988–1998: DCM beamline Opening ceremony for the DCM beamline, 1990 The X-ray intensity from Aladdin was much higher than on Tantalus, especially in the photon energy range up to 4000eV. These higher energies were potentially available using higher energy monochromators than the Grasshopper. In 1987, with Bancroft now chair of the Chemistry department at UWO he planned for a new beamline to cover the 1500-400eV energy range. A successful application was made to the recently formed Ontario Centre for Materials Research, and T.K. Sham was hired away from Brookhaven National Laboratory to design the beamline. A double crystal monochromator (DCM) was selected, to be built by the Madison Physical Sciences Laboratory, using a cylindrical mirror with a novel bending mechanism to focus the X-ray beam after the monochromator. B.X. Yang, also from Brookhaven, was hired in 1988 to construct the beamline. The beamline was built in less than 18 months, and was officially opened in 1990. The CSRF DCM beamline was regarded as particularly notable by SRC as it was the only beamline at the facility to reach energies higher than 1500 eV. With two beamlines, use by the Canadian community increased, with more than 40 scientists from 10 Canadian institutions using the facility from 1990–1992. Funding was now stable and adequate, with no charges to users. 1998–2008: SGM beamline The SGM beamline seen on the day of its official opening, 1999 The energy range from 300 to 1500 eV was still unavailable at CSRF, so in 1992 Bancroft applied to NSERC for a third beamline. Funding was obtained in 1994 and Brian Yates, who had been Bancroft's first synchrotron PhD student, was hired to construct the beamline. The design chosen was a so-called Dragon-type spherical grating monochromator, with a single grating covering the range 240–700 eV, designed and manufactured by MacPherson Inc. The beamline was somewhat delayed, but was operational for users in 1998. Adam Hitchcock of McMaster University donated a photoemission spectrometer for coincidence measurements. For the last 10 years of its existence CSRF was managed by Walter Davidson of NRC, with T.K. Sham (UWO) as Scientific Director. In 2004 the SGM beamline was decommissioned and taken to Canada for use on the new Canadian facility, while the remaining two beamlines, 30 and 15 years old, were still working well in 2007. The Canadian Light Source and the end of CSRF The Grasshopper monochromator, now a museum piece at the CLS Following a prolonged campaign by the Canadian sycnhrotron user community, the decision was made in 1999 to build a Canadian synchrotron in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: the Canadian Light Source (CLS). A proposal was made by the CSRF user community to take all three CSRF beamlines to the CLS and install them on the newer synchrotron. However the CLS' Facility Advisory Committee recommended that only the SGM beamline be re-used, with newer replacements constructed for the other two beamlines. In the event, only the monochromator and exit slit mechanism of the SGM beamline were taken to Canada and re-used, with some modifications, in the beamline of the same name at the CLS. The Grasshopper monochromator was also taken to the CLS, where it is now a museum piece, while the DCM beamline was left at SRC where it continues in use. At the CLS the VLS-PGM and SXRMB beamlines, respectively were built to replace those two beamlines. CSRF formally ceased operations on March 31, 2008. Several ex-CSRF personnel, including Kim Tan, moved to the CLS, and the Saskatoon laboratory employed many former CSRF users. Emil Hallin, then of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory which designed the CLS, now its Director of Strategic Scientific Development, got his first experience of synchrotron beamlines at CSRF.

The hamlet started as a mining community in 1850 on what eventually became the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad.The railroad commissioning can be found at Its existence was short lived as its non-favorable mineral composition and difficult ore availability was abandoned in favor of neighboring Benson Mines, located down the railroad to the east.Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Volume 25 After mining stopped in the community, other industries such as saw mills kept the population busy. Ultimately, these business were short lived. A further attempt to reopen the mines in 1914 failed and an eventual fire ended the existence of the hamlet of Jayville.New York State Museum bulletin, Issues 194-197 Today remnants of the hamlet can be found off the now abandoned railroad station located on New York State owned landMap of Jayville Location southeast of Harrisville on Jayville Road. History 1850-1880: According to old reports, the Jayville property was opened for iron ore in 1854 by Z.H. Benton. Little ore was removed at that time. In 1886, upon completion of the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad to Jayville, the property was leased from Beton by the Bryon D. Benson interest. Operation by the Bensons, under the name of the Magnetic Iron Ore Co, continued to 1888, in which year the property was abandoned in favor of the deposit at Little River (now Benson Mines)Geological Survey professional paper, Volumes 376-377 , pg. 135 1880s: One of the most significant events if Jayville history was in 1884 when New York State commissioned the building of the Carthage and Adirondack railroad to run from Carthage to Jayville. This railroad was completed in 1887. Later in 1889 the railroad was continued to Benson Mines.By New York (State) Board of Railroad Commissioners, New York (State). State Engineer and Surveyor , pg. 148 Mining thrived in the 1880s. Prior to 1889, the Megnetic Iron Ore Company had expended a large amount of money in building a railroad to the mines at Jayville, NY, developing them and securing the property at little river, before it was finally discovered that ore of good quality, in its natural state, could not be taken from the mines in paying quantities. It was therefore decided by the company that the only thing to be done, to save the investment in these properties, was to establish a large concentrating plant at Little River – now Benson Mines – and to extend the railroad to that point.Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Volume 25 , pg. 547 1890s: During the 1890s sawmills were opened in the hamlet of Jayville. Sawmills ultimately replaced the mining activity in Jayville. In 1892, costly litigation over mineral rights and railroad tariffs that traveled through private land owned by Proctor (Proctor vs Benson) ultimately stopped mining in the hamlet.Pennsylvania state reports, Volume 149 , pg. 254 Throughout the 1890s and through the early 1900s, Jayville remained in existence surviving on Railroad traffic and saw mill industries. 1900s: In 1914, the mines were attempted to be reopened; however this attempt was short lived and activity in the hamlet slowly wound down to its eventual demise in history.Engineering and mining journal, Volume 97, Issues 1-13 , pg. 450 Mr. Howard Hughes bought the mines property and sunk a lot of money pumping the water out of the old pits. He operated at a loss for about 3 years and then closed them. The mother load of ore hiding under Twin Ponds was the goal, but water kept seeping in and filled them as fast as they could be pumped out. 1940s: In 1941 the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp made geologic, dip-needle and Hotchkiss superdip surveys of the area on a scale of 1:600 and drilled eight inclined holes whole total length was 2,366 feet. Most of the diamond-drill holes were 200 to 250 feet deep, but several were 350 to 450 deep. As a result of this exploration, the company concluded that the property was of little interest as a potential producer of lump ore.Geological Survey professional paper, Volumes 376-377 , pg. 135 Railroad =Railroad Companies= *Black River and St. Lawrence Railway:The company was reorganized as the Carthage and Adirondack Railway in the spring of 1883 after a mine owner in Jayville acquired the Black River and St. Lawrence Railway. He planned to extend the rails from Little River in St. Lawrence County to Jayville. Construction of the extension was completed in 1889. *The Carthage and Adirondack Railroad: In 1883, the Carthage & Adirondack Railroad was chartered to finish a line begun in 1869 as the Black River and St. Lawrence Railway, originally laid with maple wood rails as far as Natural Bridge. Relaid with iron rails by the C&A;, it connected with the U&BR; and the CW&SH; at Carthage. The line was opened to a remote mining community known as Jayville by 1887; pushed on to Little River (Benson Mines) by 1889; and extended to Newton Falls (its current terminus) in 1896.New life in the North Country , 1997 *The New York Central Railroad: This rail company leaded the railroad in 1893 and in 1896 was responsible for extending the railroad from Benson Mines to Newton Falls. =Rail Station= Jayville Station in 2005 Location A railroad station existed at Jayville. The Jayville stop on the railroad was labeled as 4E.Guidebook, Volume 76, Part 2004 Its exact location was plotted by the USGS in 1913. That location is: 44°9′15″N 75°11′20″W.Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Issue 643 Workers As was customary for the times a telegrapher was stationed at Jayville. The position of telegrapher was a union job, organized in New York State under the Order of Railroad Telegraphers. In 1913 it was noted that Brother Seamen was the telegrapher for the hamlet.Trans- communicator, Volume 20 , pg. 666 Train Schedule As published by the Rand-McNally in 1902, there were three trains that ran through Jayville. (437,487,451) The train schedule was published by the New York Central & Hudson Railroad and posted under the Carthage and Adirondack Branch.Rand- McNally Official Railway Guide and Hand Book , pg 173 center Mining =Early Mining/Furnaces= The earliest mentions of Ore being removed from Jayville date all the way back to 1833. At that time a blast furnace was built by the Fuller brothers at Fullervulle, southwest of Edwards. It operated on ores from Little York mine, bog ores from Edwards, and magnetic ores from Jaayville and Clifton. This furnace was closed in 1882.Regional Geology of the St. Lawrence County Magnetite District Northwest Adirondacks, New York The next know uses of Jayville Magnetite was in 1855. IN 1846 the Alpine Host- blast Charcoal furnace was built. This furnace was owned by Z.H. Benton of Oxbow. Its location was southwest of Antwerp on the outlet of Boney Lake. 1,218 tonnes of iron out of red hermatite ore from Kearney or Indian Lake mine, mixed with black magnetite from the Jayville bed was used at the furnace.The iron manufacturer's guide to the furnaces, forges and rolling mills , Pg. 144 Also around this time speculation of an abundance of magnetic iron ore was starting to build at Jayville. At the time in the 1850s over 100 tons were taken from the Jayville Mines.A History of St. Lawrence and Franklin Counties, New York , pg. 431 One of the most significant figures in increasing mine activity at Jayville was Z.H. Benton. It was said that the Carthage & Adirondack Railway owes its existence to Colonel Benton as he was unceasing in their errors to establish a link to the Jayville mines.The growth of a century: as illustrated in the history of Jefferson county , pg 454 =Mineral Composition= The ore quality that was taken from Jayville was said to be of the utmost quality. Some very rich specimens of magnetic ore from the Jayville mine were shown in the Main Building at the May 5th, 1877 Iron Ores of the United States Philadelphia Exhibition.Engineering and Mining Journal, Volume 23, Pg. 299 Four specimens represent the Jayville Mine; taken June 22, 1881:Bulletin ..., Issue 42 , Pg. 142 # Magnetite, pyroxene (40857) # Magnetite, pyrite (40872) # Magnetite (40855) # Magnetite, (40860) The mine has yielded several tens of thousands of tons of magnetite ore; associated with the magnetite ore are supergene hematite, vonsenite, Fluorite in dar mica skarn, pyroxeneamphibole skarn and quartz-bearing amphibole skarn. Parts of the amphibole skarn and the iron ore are rish in Fluorite; this type of skarn is as much as a few feet thick and ranges from 20 to 60 percent fluorite. If the iron deposit is mined again, Fluorite and vonsenite should be considered as coproducts.Geological Survey professional paper, Volume 933 , Pg 78 =New Mining Techniques= Because of the magnetic properties of the ore in Jayville, new technologies were used, most notably the Magnetic Separation of Iron Ore. In 1895 the Ball-Norton electro-magnetic separator was used in a number of plants built and experiments made for magnetic separation, notably those at Benson Mines in St. Lawrence county, New York; at the Jayville mine and at the Mineville in Essex county.Transactions of the Federated Institution of Mining Engineers, Volume 10 =Mine Layout= In Jayville, the ore occurrences presents a phase quite dissimilar from that of Benson Mines and more like the magnetite deposits on the east side of the Adirondacks. There are innumerable shoots, lenses and irregular bunches in which the magnetite is found showing sharp boundaries in contact with the wall rock. The latter is for the most part a hornblende-biotite gneiss of sedimentary appearance. The horizon of the ore lie close to the contact of the gneiss with a red pegmatitic hornblende granite. Outcrops of the granite occur to the north and east within short distances where they break through and cut off the gneiss area in such a way that their intrusive character is plainly evidenced. In some of the openings the granite can be seen in immediate contact with the ore. The openings are on the northeastern and northwestern slopes of a low ridge of gneiss that rises just west of the railroad. The pits nearest the station are Hart no 1 and no2 of with the first is said to be 300 feet deep following a shoot 20 feet wide and 10 feet thick. Hart no2 is much shallower. At the northeastern end of the ridge where it curves to the west are the pits called New York no 1 and no2 both of inconsiderable depth. Benson no1 farther to the west is reported by smock to have depth of 250 feet on the incline; of its two levels the upper is about 25 feet long and the lower driven at a point 60 feet from the bottom of the slope runs off in a southerly direction for 160 feet and then north 60 feet. The pit supplied most of the shipping ore. Between Benson no 1 and no 2 an adit has been excavated into the hill on a lead which in the interior develops into a lens some 60 or 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The Fuller and Essler pits are located at the extreme west, the former being opened on a pod of ore 50 feet wide, dipping 45 degrees west. Jayville Mineral Composition by Mine Shaft The distribution of the ore in disconnected bodies which pitch and strike in all directions has probably resulted from the intrusion of granite. The bodies occupy approximately the same horizon and have the aspect of an originally continuous band which has been disrupted and faulted. The intrusion has exercised also a metamorphic influence upon the deposits shown by the abundance of garnet and horneblende that often replace the magnetite almost completely. Well-developed titanite crystals of unusual size are found in the contact zone. The analysis taken below from Putnams report, gives the composition of the Jayville ore. It was made from a sample of 500 tons mined in 1880 and shipped to the furnace at Alpine.Bulletin, Issues 423-424 , Pg 137 Jayville Quarry Materials More information on the mine layout and shaft coordinates can be found in the Geological Survey professional paper, Volumes 376-377 =Most Recent Prospecting= When Lump ore was at a premium, just before WWII, the Jayville property seemed promising enough to warrant exploration. Accordingly, in 1941 the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp made geologic, dip-needle and Hotchkiss superdip surveys of the area on a scale of 1:600 and drilled eight inclined holes whole total length was 2,366 feet. Most of the diamond-drill holes were 200 to 250 feet deep, but several were 350 to 450 deep. As a result of this exploration, the company concluded that the property was of little interest as a potential producer of lump ore.Geological Survey professional paper, Volumes 376-377 , Pg 135 In the winter of 1947, USGS performed a study on the Jayville mines. The [USGS] found an unidentifiable metallic mineral in ore from two drill holes at the Jayville [magnetite] deposit. The striking optical properties of the unknown set it apart from other metallics that had been investigated mineragraphically. It was thought for a while that the unknown might be ilvaite. In the spring of 1950, the USGS investigated the unknown.Vasenite at the Jayville Magnetite Deposit, USG S Saw Mills In the early 1890s, as mining was starting to be less fruitful as once anticipated, the timber on the land started to attract the attention of investors. Throughout the course of the hamlet's history, three separate investment groups operated sawmills in Jayville. =Post and Henderson Company= The partnership of Robert G Post and Washington J Henderson made its first venture into the Adirondacks in the early 1890s with a small sawmill in Jayville. Production in the mid-1890s was four million board feet of lumber yearly. However, once again, Jayville lost out to Benson Mines as in 1898 a much larger sawmill was built in the village of Benson Mines. In 1900 the two partners formed the post and Henderson Company.Logging Railroads of the Adirondacks , pg 212 The day-to-day operation of the mill was run by W.J. Henderson. The superintendent at the Post & Henderson was John Peter Kirch. His yearly salary was $1,200. John Peter Kirch would later become famous for running away on his family for a younger woman, Mrs. Hattie Covey, who was then tarred and feathered for her actions.Wicked Northern New York , pg 68. =J. S. Demott= J.S. Demott, who was from Oswego, in 1894 operated a Steam powered saw mill in Jayville.THE BOSTON HISTORY COMPANY =Mecca Lumber Company= In 1903 Nellis, Ames & Swift who ran an old and substantial lumber concern in Utica, NY purchased a timber tract of 7,000 acres around Jayville. The actual location of the Mill was Kalurah, NY. They immediately begin the erection of a large steam saw mill at a convenient point near the center of the purchase, building a railroad switch from the track of the Carthage and Adirondack Railroad at Jayville to the plant. The mill was said to have been built using modern construction equipment and large capacity and was operated wholly in the manufacture of hardwood lumber. This mill was touted to have been equipped band saws.The Paper mill and wood pulp news, Volume 26 , pg. 6 The mill was built on a settlement known as Little Mill. The company renamed the settlement Kalurah, named after a Masonic Lodge in Binghamton. The sawmill was relatively small, producing about 30,000 board feet of logs daily. However, in 1907, the mill was the 7th largest producing mill in New York State.Documents of the Senate of the State of New York, Volume 23 , pg. 136 The Mecca Lumber company produced a large quantity of railroad ties using the hardwood on the land. The Mecca Lumber Company ceased operation in 1910. On May 24, 1910, The New York Central Railroad company petitioned New York State to discontinued freight and ticketing service at the Kalurah station, thus ending the majority of mill functions.Documents of the Assembly of New York State, Volume 4 , pg. 306 The sawmill was operated by Alfred Kilbourne up until 1920 when the land was sold to the State of New York for $45,000.Logging Railroads of the Adirondacks Education right In 1887 school district No 10 was formed in Pitcairn for Jayville students by George A Lewis, School Commissioner. He wrote to NYS in a letter, \\"In August last, I issued an order forming school district No 10, in the town of Pitcairn, to meet the educational wants of the mining village known as Jayville.\\"Annual report of the State Superintendent for the school year , Volume 34 , pg. 495 Later in the 1890s, this school was known as Jayville School No 1. During this time George W. Backus was a trustee of the Jayville school. Mr. Backus eventually married Miss Pina Mae Seelya who was a teacher at the local school.Central Headlight Railroad News , pg. 1 After the closing of the Jayville mines, the one-room school building was moved down the tracks to Kalurah, where it remained there until 1940. Religion In the early 1880s the St. Francis Solanus parish was formed in Harrisville, Ny by Rev. E. C. Laramee. Under Jeremiah Manning, Jayville was a mission. In 1907 Harrisville, Kalurah, Natural Bridge and Lewisburg formed a parish. The parish territory included the mission at Fine and Taleville, each of which had a church, and the stations at Jayville, Edwards and Fullerville.The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to ..., Volume 3 Hunting Hunting was a way of life for local residents of Jayville. In 1902, NYS conducted a deer population study in the growing response for information on large animals of the Adirondack Region. In 1902 deer shipments were measured using carcase shipments with the aide of the American and National express Companies. During this time 30% more deer were secured by hunters in the area. A general rule was used that 4 deer were killed in the woods for every one that shipped out by rail. In 1902, a total of two deer carcases were shipped out of Jayville, while neighboring Harrisville shipped 35. Note that in Harrisville that year, a 253 lb deer was taken from the region. It was noted that the Adirondack deer, when properly protected, will develop a size and weight fully equal to or surpassing that of species in any other locality in North America.Forest and stream, Volume 60 Jayville Tar and Feathering Unfortunately, Jayville's most nationally acclaimed moment was the result of an lustrous affair that resulted in a public tar and feathering of a female resident, Mrs Hattie Covey. The story was so sensational that it was published in the New York Times on July 31, 1895. As the story goes, Mrs Covey who was married jumped a train out of town with Saw Mill Superintendent John Kirch, who was married and had children. It was rumored that the two ran off to Ohio. After two months Hattie Covey returned to Carthage to visit her parents. Coincidence would have it that Mrs. Kirch was also on this train. Later that evening two men showed up at Hattie's mothers house and threatened to tar and feather Hattie Covey if she did not leave town immediately. That next morning, Mrs. Covey, her mother and brothers went to Pircairn to a judge to swear out a warrant for arrest of the two men who had threatened her the night before. The family then returned to Jayville that night. The Daily Journal of July 31, 1895 then explains what happened next: When the train stopped at the station, the mother and daughter got off of the rear platform and walked to the front of the train, where they were suddenly surrounded by a crowd of men who seized the daughter and took her into the railroad freight house, where they stripped her. There was a crowd of women there, dressed in men's clothes and with blackened faces. The men held the women down on the floor, while the women applied the tar and feathers with a paint brush, completely covering her with the stuff, after which they left her. She was taken to her mother's house, where a physician was called. It was found that one arm and a number of ribs were broken. It is said to be doubtful if she lives. Within a few days the attackers of Mrs Covey were arrested and a trial was held for the five known attackers.Wicked Northern New York , pg 71 The story was so popular that it reached news papers as far away as Utah.The Deseret Weekly, Volume 51 , pg 246 Notable residents *Colonel Zebulon H.

Alternatively referred to as a monument, the piece was originally created as a statement demanding the liberation of the imprisoned South African activist, Nelson Mandela. The official title is Nelson Mandela Must Be Free to Lead His People and South Africa to Peace and Prosperity.\\"Arts Notes Mayor to present David Hammons sculpture dedicated to Mandela\\" Atlanta Journal and Constitution (Archives, 2 June 1987, C/2) (URL accessed 5 August 2012) However, it is most frequently called just Free Nelson Mandela, because those words are carved in the face of the granite rock that is the bottom portion of the sculpture. The top portion is a 12 feet high fence of iron bars radiating from the rock and topped with barbed wire. In the fence is a working gate, which was padlocked shut while Mandela was imprisoned. After Mandela's release in 1990, the padlock was unlocked with the key which had been left with Atlanta city officials by the artist. The gate has remained in an open position ever since, and the rock proclaims that there is now a \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\". There are also small segments of chain attached to the bottom corners of the rock, adjacent to the base. At some point after the gate was opened, three bars to the right of the gate were painted, respectively, green, black, and yellow, the colors of the South African flag. The entire sculpture weighs 7 tons.Naipaul, V.S., (Dec 14, 2011) A Turn in the South, Random House Digital, Inc.,  Creation  Hammons created the sculpture while an artist in residence for Atlanta's Arts Festival. Faculty and students at Georgia State University assisted in the construction at GSU's sculpture studio. Atlanta's Office of Cultural Affairs is responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the piece.\\"\\"Free Nelson Mandela\\" Sculpture Restoration\\" City of Atlanta Press Release (no date stated) (URL checked 5 August 2012) In addition to the intrinsic value of the sculpture and the historical statement, this piece is significant because it is one of the few, if only, public art works by Hammons.

The boldness and harshness of the statement is softened considerably by the vegetation, which was not part of the artist's fixture. In addition, the description on the Smithsonian Institution's Art Inventories Catalog states that the gate is left of center.\\"Free Nelson Mandela, (sculpture).\\" Smithsonian Institution's Art Inventories Catalog (URL accessed 5 August 2012) It is implied that this information was gathered in the \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture, Georgia, Atlanta survey, 1994.\\" If this is true, then the current setting has viewers looking at the back of the piece and the front is covered with shrubbery.

For 1994, he gained a series of one-off privateer rides in the 250cc class, starting with an Aprilia at the 1994 Australian motorcycle Grand Prix, and finishing the season on a Honda, placing him 30th in the championship. Moving to the 500cc class for 1995, he rode out the season placing twelfth on the ROC-Yamaha. He then spent two seasons on the ELF 500 ROC sponsored by Pepsi and then Shell, placing 14th in 1996 and 17th in 1997 on an under-developed and hence unreliable bike. For 1998 he moved to the well backed Movistar Honda Pons riding the Honda NSR500, but unreliability meant he finished the season in 32nd. Improved factory support in 1999 meant that he finished 12th. Without a ride for the 2000 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, after the crash of Carl Fogarty which ended his racing career, from race six onwards in 2000 he moved to World Superbikes, replacing Ben Bostrom in the works Ducati-Infostrada, finishing the season in 12th. Replaced by younger compatriate Rubén Xaus for the 2001 season, Borja moved to Spanish privateer team Panavto Yamaha riding the Yamaha YZF-R7, but a lack of funds and unreliability meant that he finished the season 32nd. For 2002 season he returned to riding a Ducati 998RS for Spanish privateer team Spaziotel Racing, finishing 12th. With the same team but now under the DFX Racing banner, he finished 13th in the 2003 season. In light of their sponsorship from Sterilgarda for the 2004 season, the DFX team choose Italian rider Marco Borciani. Unable to find a team or sponsorship, Borja was forced to retire at the age of 34.

Dekle Sr. in 1983. The game is played on a modified chessboard whereby even-numbered are indented to the right--resembling masonry brickwork. The moves of the pieces are adapted to the new geometry; in other respects the game is the same as chess. Masonic chess was included in World Game Review No. 10 edited by Michael Keller. Board characteristics The Masonic board cells are slightly rectangular, and indentation of alternating ranks results in cants (oblique files) 30° from the vertical and diagonals 30° from the horizontal, the same as hexagon-based chessboards when cell vertices face the players. (For example, rooks have six directions of movement, and Masonic pawns move and capture the same as pawns in De Vasa's hexagonal chess. Masonic bishops, however, are limited to the four diagonal directions to the sides.) As with hex-based boards, three colors are used, so no two adjacent cells are the same color, and gameboard diagonals are highlighted. Game rules The diagram shows the starting setup. All normal chess rules apply, including conventions for castling either or , a pawn's initial two-step option, en passant captures, promotion, and so on. But the pieces have specially defined moves. =Piece moves= * A rook moves along the rank (two directions) and cants (four directions). * A bishop moves on diagonals to the sides (four directions), or one step as a rook (six directions). * The queen moves as a rook and bishop. (Ten directions.) * The king moves one step as a queen. * A knight moves in the pattern: one step as a rook, then one step as a bishop in the same (forward, backward, or sideways) direction. A knight leaps any intervening men. * A pawn moves one step forward as a rook; on its first move it may optionally move two steps forward in the same direction. A pawn captures one step diagonally forward; en passant captures are permitted.

Life Ratschiller, an ethnic German, was born in South Tyrol three years after the province had become Italian territory as a result of World War I. His parents were Ludwig-Andreas, an Austrian local-bank manager, jailed in 1944 on political grounds, and Marja Iwanicka, a Polish woman from Austro-Hungarian Galitia. The family spoke Polish at home, but the everyday language in the city of Brixen was dialectal German. Italian Fascism implemented an aggressive policy of de-nationalization in the former Austro- Hungarian territories that had come under its sway. As a reaction, Ratschiller developed nationalistic German opinions, with a sympathy for Nazi Germany. In 1939, when South Tyroleans were given the opportunity to opt for the German nationality, his father chose to keep the Italian citizenship. Being under- age, Ratschiller was supposed to follow the same destiny, but instead he fled to Berlin. There he got his high-school diploma before he moved to Innsbruck to study geology at the local university. He volunteered for the SS corps but was not accepted. In the spring of 1941 he was in Alsace as a worker-student, then moved to Poland, where he witnessed the treatment of the Poles, visited the Warsaw ghetto and started developing his opposition to Nazism. In 1942, as soon as he was naturalized as a German, he was drafted into the Luftwaffe and destined to Pruniers, in France, for a training course. From there he moved to Kirkenes, near Petsamo, in Finland, where the Wehrmacht faced the Red Army. By now disgusted with the war, he took advantage of a leave to go back to his family and home city and desert (March 1943). His efforts to hide, however, were unsuccessful, for the Italian Army, unaware of his new citizenship, had issued an arrest warrant for his failure to report for military service. Ratschiller was sent to Fiume as a Black Shirt, i.e. a member of the Italian National Fascist Party's Militia. The Black Shirts in Fiume carried out tasks of border patrolling. In view of his Slavic background, Ratschiller understood some Croatian, so he soon had some contacts with the Yugoslav Resistance movement. When Fascism fell on 24 July 1943, Ratschiller went AWOL and fled to Florence, where he had some family and could conceivably get their help. Realizing that the political situation had changed irreversibly, however, he decided to turn himself in to the military authorities. He was not indicted but had to enroll in the Military Corps of Engineers. After a few days, the armistice brought about the virtual dissolution of the Italian Army and Ratschiller went underground, getting himself a false identity. He could not go back to Brixen, because South Tyrol had been annexed by the Third Reich. Instead, he took refuge in nearby Cadore. On 1 May 1944, he joined the Italian Resistance and enrolled in the Brigata d'Assalto Garibaldi «Calvi», where he was put in charge of a camp for German POWs. On 22 November he was taken prisoner by the Germans and tortured, but he escaped further consequences because the appointed new commander was a German officer that had been in his power as a POW before being released in a barter for a partisan. That officer had been treated fairly, so he released Ratschiller on condition that he enrolled in the Organisation Todt, the German entity that provided slave labor to the war effort. It was as a Todt slave laborer that the end of the war found him in South Tyrol, very close to his home in Brixen. In the post-war period Ratschiller was a well-respected geologist.

He is an emeritus professor of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering at Iowa State University and an entrepreneur in ethanol co-product development. His research and innovations have worked to solve various problems including, new water purification methods, a way of creating food and animal feed from waste, and a process in making the purest alcohol ever made. Early life and education van Leeuwen was born in 1946 in Gouda, South Holland, Netherlands. He grew up in South Africa. His experience growing up in South Africa helped him emotionally connect with the underprivileged living in developing countries and inspired his later work. He studied at University of Pretoria in South Africa and received all his degrees from the same school, including his B.S. in 1975 in Chemical Engineering, his M.S. in 1979 in Engineering and Water Utilization, a Graduate Diploma of Tertiary Education in 1983 and a Doctorate in Environmental Engineering in 1988. Research van Leeuwen's early research was focused on water reclamation from wastewater. His research included the recovery of byproducts from liquid wastes and sediments, fungal treatment of food processing wastewater, and reuse applications of residues from water softening. He has several patents to his name. He was able to extend the life of activated carbon at least 7 times by using a microbial process. As of 2009, this process was being used at the Goreangab Walter Reclamation Plant in Windhoek, Khomas Region, Namibia and at the South Caboolture Water Reclamation plant in Caboolture, Queensland, Australia. He worked on a ships ballast water treatment project with Darren Oemcke, Jake Perrins and Bill Cooper of the University of California, Irvine; and Russ Herwig of the University of Washington, Seattle. They were attempting to keeping exotic species (such as zebra mussels) out of coastal waters through the disinfestation of ballast water with bromine production through rapid ozonation to avoid spreading feral species. As of 2009, this innovation is now being used on international tankers. Van Leeuwen's MycoMax process works by cultivating microbial filamentous fungi on leftovers from ethanol fermentation and distillation in order to create a high quality animal feed. Growing fungus on the leftover corn found in ethanol production, provides for good energy feed for livestock animals (such as pigs and chickens), but can also reduce energy costs. More importantly, the fungal biomass can serve as a source of valuable biochemicals, such as chitin, amino acids and bio-oils. Chitin, in turn, can be converted to chitosan and glucosamine, both valuable chemicals used in medicine, agriculture and water treatment. Van Leeuwen's Mycofuel process is a two-stage bioconversion process in order to create bio-oil or biofuel from various scrapped plant matter. This process could be a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative process to making ethanol from various plant materials, This was work done in collaboration at Iowa State University with various colleagues and graduate students. His physical- chemical alcohol purification process has found application in the production of an impurity-free vodka in Iowa, IngeniOz.  Teaching  He is an emeritus professor in the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU) in Ames, Iowa. He started as a professor at ISU in 2000. Together with professor Balaji Narasimhan, he was given a Vlasta Klima Balloun Professorship at Iowa State University in 2010. Previously he had been a professor at the University of New England, Australia, Griffith University, Australia, and the University of Pretoria.

If data is found that might be compressed, a decompression algorithm is invoked to perform a trial decompression. If the decompressor does not produce an error, the decompressed data is processed.

The town is located along the Ofotfjorden in the Ofoten region. The town lies on a peninsula located between the Rombaken fjord and the Beisfjorden. The European route E06 highway runs through the Beisfjord Bridge and Hålogaland Bridge crossing the two small fjords surrounding the town. The town has a population (2018) of 14,141 which gives the town a population density of . Narvik Church is the main church for the town. Narvik is a commercial centre for the region. Narvik University College has approximately 1,200 students. There are some high-tech businesses in Narvik (among them Natech). Etymology Narvik is named after the old Narvik farm (\\"Narduigh\\" – 1567), since the town is built on its ground. The Old Norse form of the port was probably *Knarravík. The first element is the genitive pluralis of knarr which means 'merchant ship' and the last element is vík meaning 'inlet'. The name Knarravík (modern forms Knarvik or Narvik) is found in several places along the Norwegian coast (and three places in the old Norwegian province of Bohuslän), and it tends to refer to good, natural ports. The port was once called Victoriahavn after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, however Sweden’s Crown Princess Victoria was also honoured. History Map of Narvik in 1907 Near Narvik city centre; Ankenes is seen across the bay View of Narvik at night from the highest point accessible to cars The history of Narvik as a settlement began in the Bronze Age. Not very much is known about these people, but the Vikings lived in this area. Narvik was developed as an all-year ice free port for the Swedish Kiruna and Gällivare iron mines. The history of modern Narvik begins in the 1870s, when the Swedish government began to understand the potential of the iron ore mines in Kiruna, Sweden. Obtaining iron ore from Kiruna had one significant problem in that there was no suitable Swedish port. The nearest Swedish port, Luleå, had limitations. It was covered with ice all winter, it is far from Kiruna, and it allows only medium-sized bulk freight vessels. Narvik offered a port which is ice-free thanks to the warm Gulf Stream, and is naturally large, allowing boats of virtually any size to anchor, up to long and deep. The Swedish company (Gällivare Aktiebolag) built the Iron Ore Line (Malmbanan) to Riksgränsen on the Norway–Sweden border. The Norwegian Ofotbanen railway line connects Narvik to the Swedish border. Swedish mining corporation LKAB still ships the majority of its ore from Narvik (a total 25 million tons a year). The corporation is still important in the area, both as an employer and landowner, although its influence is not as prominent now as it has been in previous years. The town of Narvik was established on 1 January 1902 when the village of Narvik received status as a proper town and was separated from the large municipality of Ankenes so it could have its own municipal government. Initially, the town-municipality of Narvik had 3,705 residents. On 1 January 1974, the municipality of Ankenes was merged with the town-municipality of Narvik, forming a new, larger municipality of Narvik. =World War II= Iron ore is extracted in Kiruna and Malmberget, and brought by rail to the harbours of Luleå and Narvik. (Borders as of 1920–1940.) Narvik burning after German bombing, 2. June 1940 Narvik 1928 with the fjord Rombaken as backdrop The port of Narvik proved to be strategically valuable in the early years of World War II and the town became a focal point of the Norwegian Campaign. In 1939, Germany's war industry depended upon iron ore mined in Kiruna and Malmberget in Sweden. During the summer season, this ore could be sent by cargo ship to Germany through the Baltic Sea via the Swedish port of Luleå on the Gulf of Bothnia. However, when the Gulf of Bothnia froze during the winter, more shipments of the ore needed to be transported through Narvik and, from there, down the west coast of Norway to Germany. The town of Narvik is linked by rail to Sweden, but not to any other towns in Norway. As a result, Narvik serves as a gateway to the ore fields of Sweden that cannot be easily reached from southern Norway via land. Winston Churchill realised that the control of Narvik meant stopping most German imports of iron ore during the winter of 1940. This would be advantageous to the Allies, and it might help shorten the war. Equally as important, later in the war, German submarines and warships based there threatened the allied supply line to the Soviet Union. Churchill proposed laying a naval minefield in Norwegian territorial waters around Narvik (referred to as \\"the Leads\\"), or else occupying the town with Allied troops. The Allies hoped that they might be able to use an occupied Narvik as a base from which to secure the Swedish ore fields and/or to send supplies and reinforcements to Finland, then fighting the Finnish Winter War with the Soviet Union. Plans to lay a minefield around Narvik or to seize the town met with debate within the British government – since both plans would mean a violation of Norway's neutrality and sovereignty. Finally, on 8 April 1940, the British Admiralty launched Operation Wilfred, an attempt to lay anti- shipping minefields around Narvik in Norwegian territorial waters. Coincidentally, Germany launched its invasion of Norway (Operation Weserübung) on the next day. During this invasion, ten German destroyers, each carrying 200 mountain infantry soldiers, were sent to Narvik. The outdated Norwegian coastal defence ships and attempted to resist the invasion, but both Norwegian warships were sunk after a short and uneven battle. The Royal Navy quickly dispatched several ships to Narvik, including the battleship , and during the Battles of Narvik, the British took control of the coast, destroying the German destroyers that had brought the invasion force to Narvik, as well as other German ships in the area. On 12 April 1940, the first convoys of Allied soldiers were sent under Major-General Pierse Joseph Mackesy to Narvik. The Admiralty urged Mackesy to conduct an assault on Narvik from the sea as soon as possible. However, Mackesy believed that the German harbour defences were too strong for such an invasion to take place. The Admiralty argued that a naval bombardment of Norway would enable the troops to land safely, but General Mackesy refused to subject Norwegian citizens to such a bombardment, and instead he chose to land his troops near Narvik and wait until the snow melted to take over the town. Coordinated by the Norwegian General Carl Gustav Fleischer, Norwegian, French, Polish, and British forces recaptured Narvik on 28 May 1940. This is also considered the first Allied infantry victory in World War II. However, by that time, the Allies were losing the Battle of France and the evacuation from Dunkirk was underway. Since the Nazi German invasion of France had made Scandinavia largely irrelevant, and since the valuable troops assigned to Narvik were badly needed elsewhere, the Allies withdrew from Narvik on 8 June 1940 in Operation Alphabet. The same day, while operating in the Narvik area, the German battleships and sank the British aircraft carrier during the withdrawal from this battle. Without support from the Allied naval task force, the Norwegians were outnumbered, and they had to lay down their arms in Norway on 10 June 1940. This was not a complete capitulation, since the Norwegians kept on fighting guerrilla operations inland. Possession of the Ofotfjord was also important to the German Kriegsmarine (navy) since it provided a refuge for warships like the \\"pocket battleship\\" and the battleship outside the range (at the time) of air attacks from Scotland. Also, possibly U-boats could be based at Narvik.

Born to a nobleman and his wife in Temanggung, Central Java, Djajakusuma became interested in the arts at a young age, choosing to pursue a career in theatre. During the Japanese occupation from 1943 to 1945 he was a translator and actor, and in the four- year national revolution which followed he worked for the military's educational division, several news agencies, and in drama. In 1951, Djajakusuma joined the National Film Corporation (Perfini) at the invitation of Usmar Ismail. After making his directorial debut with Embun, Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964. He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre, including wayang. Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini, most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography. After over a decade of poor health and high blood pressure, Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery. The dedicated but easily angered Djajakusuma was influenced by Usmar Ismail's realist views, although he focused more on traditional aspects of life. His theatrical performances attempted to modernize traditional forms so that they could be better received in a modern world. He is credited with revitalising the Betawi theatre form lenong and received numerous awards for his filmmaking, including a lifetime achievement award at the Indonesian Film Festival. Biography =Early life= Djajakusuma was born on 1 August 1918 in Parakan, Temanggung, Central Java, Dutch East Indies,; to a priyayi father, Raden Mas Aryo Djojokoesomo, and his wife Kasimah. Djajakusuma was the fifth child of six born to the couple, who lived comfortably off Djojokoesomo's salary as a government official. While young he enjoyed watching stage performances, such as wayang puppetry and the traditional dance form tayuban; at times he would furtively leave his home after bedtime to watch the productions. With his friends, he would act out the bedtime stories his mother told him. When imported Hollywood films began to be screened, he was an avid viewer, watching Westerns and works starring Charlie Chaplin. Owing to his position as the son of a nobleman, Djajakusuma was able to receive an education. He completed his studies in Semarang, Central Java, graduating from the natural sciences programme at a senior high school there in 1941. Although his family hoped that he would become a government employee like his father, Djajakusuma decided to go into the performing arts. He returned to his hometown for a short time before realising that he would have little opportunity in Parakan. Accordingly, in early 1943 - almost a year after the Indies were occupied by the Empire of Japan - Djajakusuma moved to the colony's political centre, Jakarta, to find work. Djajakusuma became employed at the Cultural Centre as a translator and actor under Armijn Pane.; Among the works he translated were several pieces by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, as well as a history of Japan and several kabuki stage plays. While with the Centre, Djajakusuma wrote several of his own stage plays. In his free time, Djajakusuma helped establish the amateur theatre company Maya, together with artists such as HB Jassin, Rosihan Anwar, and Usmar Ismail. The troupe, formed in response to a desire for greater artistic freedom, performed translations of European works and original works by Ismail and El Hakim. To promote a sense of Indonesian nationalism while still conforming with the Japanese censorship bureau's rules, several of Maya's plays did not explicitly promote Japan, but rather the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Themes supporting the Indonesian nationalist movement, meanwhile, remained implicit in the works. With Maya, Djajakusuma travelled from village to village, putting on performances. =Indonesian National Revolution= President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's independence on 17 August 1945, days after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) as a form of resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him impervious to bullets. In early 1946, with the Dutch colonial forces in control of Jakarta, Djajakusuma fled to the new national capital at Yogyakarta. There, he spent a time with the national news agency Antara before joining the military's educational division, rising to the rank of captain. For the military Djajakusuma edited the weekly Tentara; he also contributed articles to Ismail's cultural magazine Arena. Despite his involvement in the press, he did not abandon the theatre; with Surjo Sumanto, he established a troupe which performed for soldiers and raised morale, sometimes travelling to the frontlines. Djajakusuma was hired by the Ministry of Information in 1947 to teach at a school for the performance arts, the Mataram Entertainment Foundation (). Through Mataram, he and Ismail were introduced to filmmakers Andjar Asmara, Huyung, and Sutarto; the two studied under these more established individuals. Meanwhile, Djajakusuma was put in charge of censoring radio broadcasts in Republican-held areas, a duty he held until the Dutch captured Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948. Djajakusuma fled the city, then met up with Republican forces. Using an old radio and a bicycle-powered generator, Djajakusuma listened to international news broadcasts and wrote them down; the information from these broadcasts was then printed in underground newspapers. Usmar Ismail, who drew Djajakusuma to Perfini in 1951 After the Indonesian National Revolution ended with Dutch recognition of Indonesia's independence in 1949, Djajakusuma continued to work as a journalist for Patriot (a rebranding of Tentara) and the magazine Kebudajaan Nusantara; Mataram was reopened, and Djajakusuma began teaching there again while managing the Soboharsono cinema and writing several stage plays. Ismail, meanwhile, went back to Jakarta and established the National Film Corporation (, or Perfini); its first production, Darah dan Doa (The Long March), which gave a fictionalised version of the Siliwangi Division's trek from Yogyakarta to West Java in 1948, was directed by Ismail and released in 1950. =Career with Perfini= In preparation for his second film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, about a man who leaves his family after he is transfixed by the smile of a waitress.; ; While Ismail, who remained head of Perfini, went abroad to study cinematography at the School of Theater, Film and Television at the University of California, Los Angeles, Djajakusuma began taking a larger role in Perfini. He made his directorial debut in 1952 with Embun (Dewdrop), which showed the psychological troubles faced by soldiers upon returning to their village after the revolution.; The film was shot in Wonosari, at the time in the middle of a drought, to provide a visual metaphor for the barren souls of the warriors. Because of its depiction of traditional superstitions, the film had trouble with both the censorship bureau and critics; superstition was considered incompatible with the new republic's need for modernisation. The release of Embun made Djajakusuma one of four directors to work for Perfini; the others were Ismail, Nya Abas Akup, and Wahyu Sihombing. Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was a musical about an old, impoverished musician who sells his saxophone to help his former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, when he returned to Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success. Djajakusuma boarding a ship to go to Sumatra for the filming of Arni, 1955 In 1954 Djajakusuma directed two comedies, Putri dari Medan (Daughter of Medan) and Mertua Sinting (Insane Parents-in-Law). The first dealt with three young men who resolve to never marry, only for their strength to waver after meeting some women from Medan, while the second followed a man who rejects his son's choice of spouse owing to her lack of noble descent, then unknowingly chooses the same woman to be his son's wife. The following year Djajakusuma helped establish the Indonesian Screen Actors Guild (; PARFI). His only film that year, the drama Arni, told of a man who married another woman while his sick wife went to Padang, Sumatra, for treatment. Djajakusuma studied cinematography in the United States, first at the University of Washington in Seattle, then at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, from 1956 to 1957. When he returned to Indonesia, he worked with Ismail and fellow Perfini employee Asrul Sani to establish the National Theatre Academy of Indonesia (), which promoted realism; the Indonesian dramatist Putu Wijaya described the realism promoted by the Academy as more Indonesian than Western, while Djajakusuma considered inspired by the Italian neorealist movement. Djajakusuma remained a lecturer with the academy until 1970, and his students considered him humorous and easy to approach. Upon his return to Indonesia, Djajakusuma began work on Tjambuk Api (Whips of Fire; 1958), a critique of the widespread corruption in Indonesia; this theme led to the film being held by the censorship bureau for almost a year. The director followed this with the drama Pak Prawiro (Mr. Prawiro), which was sponsored by the Post Savings Bank () and meant to convey the importance of having savings. During this period he studied the traditional theatre of India, travelling to Calcutta, Madras, and New Delhi; he hoped that this first-hand experience would inspire him in the filming of traditional Indonesian stories.; In 1960 Djajakusuma released his first film based on traditional wayang stories, Lahirnja Gatotkatja;; the traditional puppetry had fascinated him as a child, and he greatly enjoyed the character Gatotkaca. Shot in Yogyakarta, the film featured a cast of stars from Jakarta and local talent in backing roles. It was, however, controversial: dhalang and others versed in wayang argued that the director had ignored too many traditional aspects of the puppetry. That year Djajakusuma also served as production manager for Ismail's Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom) and directed Mak Tjomblang (Mrs. Tjomblang), a comedy adapted from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 drama Marriage. Djajakusuma released another comedy, Masa Topan dan Badai (Time of Cyclones and Storms), in 1963; the film centres around the family dynamics of a conservative father, liberal mother, and their two teenaged daughters who are in the throes of adolescence. The following year Djajakusuma directed his last film with Perfini, Rimba Bergema (Echoing Jungles), which was meant to promote the nation's rubber industry. That year he helped establish the Film and TV Employee's Union (), a response to the Lekra- sponsored Indonesian Film League. As with Ismail and most Perfini employees, Djajakusuma was staunchly against the communist-affiliated Lekra; the cultural group was likewise hostile towards those affiliated with Perfini. =Later career= Towards the end of his time with Perfini, Djajakusuma again became active in traditional arts. He devoted considerable time towards the promotion of wayang. In 1967 he organised the National Wayang Festival, which collapsed shortly afterwards owing to a lack of funds. In 1967 he directed the wayang- inspired film Bimo Kroda for Pantja Murti Film, which used the destruction of the Pandawa – brothers in the Hindu epic Mahābhārata – to represent the kidnappings and subsequent murders of five army generals during the 30 September Movement in 1965. Djajakusuma's involvement with wayang continued into the early 1970s; he organised two Wayang Weeks, in 1970 and 1974, as well as a national wayang festival in 1977. Furthermore, he established two wayang orang troupes, Jaya Budaya (1971) and Bharata (1973), hoping to save the ailing medium by modernising it. Meanwhile, Djajakusuma helped promote art forms such as the Betawi lenong and Javanese ludruk over a period of several years.; He is particularly recognised for his revitalising lenong. Beginning in 1968, Djajakusuma appeared on television as an advocate of lenong, which was then limited to rural villages and on the verge of dying out. He increased popular knowledge of the form while arguing for proper remuneration for performers. Through the 1970s lenong was performed at Ismail Marzuki Hall, drawing considerable audiences,; and several lenong performers found mainstream acclaim in the film industry. Djajakusuma also promoted non- traditional cultural activities, both modern and foreign. In 1968 he became the head of the Jakarta Art Council, a position he held until 1977, and in 1970 he held a kroncong music festival. Beginning with the school's establishment in 1970, he became a lecturer at the Jakarta Institute for Arts Education (, later the Jakarta Art Institute [, or IKJ]), teaching cinematography. To better understand the world's theatre, in 1977 he went to Japan and China to study their traditions. He later led the students in various stage performances, including adaptations of Japanese noh and Chinese opera; several of these performances were held at Ismail Marzuki Hall. In the 1970s Djajakusuma held a variety of positions in film organisations, including as a member of the Film Council (1974–76), a member of the Board of Trustees for Radio and TV Broadcasts (1976), and a member of the Bureau for the Development of National Film (1977–78). Djajakusuma's productivity in the film industry, however, declined. In 1971 he directed his final films, Api di Bukit Menoreh (Fire on Mount Menoreh) and Malin Kundang (Anak Durhaka) (Malin Kundang [Faithless Child]). The first, released for Penas Film Studio and based on a novel by Singgih Hadi Mintardja, followed soldiers from the Kingdom of Pajang in their efforts to subdue soldiers from the rival kingdom of Jipang. The second film was an adaptation of the Malay folktale of the same name. Starring Rano Karno and Putu Wijaya as the title character, the film follows a young boy who forgets his roots after spending much of his childhood at sea. His last role as a filmmaker was in 1977, when he helped produce Fritz G. Schadt's comedy Bang Kojak (Brother Kojak; 1977). =Final years and death= In 1977 Djajakusuma served on the jury of the Indonesian Film Festival (, or FFI). While reading the decision, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, while Rosihan Anwar completed the reading. Djajakusuma's neighbour and frequent collaborator Taufiq Ismail told reporters that it was not the first time Djajakusuma had collapsed. Djajakusuma continued to suffer from bouts of sudden weakness for the rest of his life, caused by high blood pressure. Despite his rapidly failing health, Djajakusuma remained active in the arts. In 1980 he made his last film appearance, and his only role on the big screen, acting in Ismail Soebardjo's Perempuan dalam Pasungan (Woman in Stocks).; He and Sofia WD portrayed parents who regularly put their daughter in stocks to punish her for being disobedient; in an interview with Suara Karya, Soebardjo recalled that, from the time he had written it, he had only considered Djajakusuma for the role. Perempuan dalam Pasungan won the Citra Award for Best Film at the 1981 Indonesian Film Festival, and Djajakusuma expressed an interest in making several further films; this was, however, never realised. In 1983 Djajakusuma served as dean of the Faculty of Arts at IKJ,; and in 1984 he went to the Three Continents Festival in Nantes, France, where two of his films were shown to critical acclaim. In early 1987 Djajakusuma's doctor diagnosed him with heart disease, which led Djajakusuma to begin dieting and stop smoking. He continued to be highly respected in Indonesian film circles, but was displeased with the condition of the country's film industry, which he considered to be on the verge of collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesian identity.; Djajakusuma collapsed on 28 October 1987 while giving a speech in commemoration of the Youth Pledge at the IKJ, striking his head on a stone step. After being rushed to Cikini General Hospital, he was declared dead at 10:05 a.m. local time (UTC+7). He was buried at Karet Bivak Cemetery that evening, after ceremonies at the IKJ led by the author Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana and prayers at the Amir Hamzah Mosque in Ismail Marzuki Hall led by the poet Taufiq Ismail.; Among the mourners were the former Minister of Information Boediardjo, the Minister of Education and Culture Fuad Hassan, and the Deputy Governor of Jakarta Anwar Umar. Djajakusuma had never married, but left behind several nieces and nephews whom he had raised as his own children.; After his death, newspapers throughout Jakarta carried obituaries by such cultural and film figures as Alisjahbana, the producer Misbach Yusa Biran, and the Perfini cameraman Soemardjono. These obituaries emphasised Djajakusuma's role in the development of the Indonesian film industry and the preservation of traditional culture. In a ceremony commemorating the fifth anniversary of Djajakusuma's death, all his documents and books were donated to the IKJ library. Style On the set of Djajakusuma's 1960 film Lahirnja Gatotkatja; the film was one of two he directed that was heavily influenced by wayang stories. Like Usmar Ismail, Djajakusuma was influenced by realism. However, while Ismail preferred to focus on national-level themes, Djajakusuma was more drawn to simple, locally relevant storylines with educational messages. This realism carried over into Djajakusuma's work in wayang. The settings, traditionally drawn, were instead created as three-dimensional sets, including representations of trees, rocks, and water. According to Soemardjono, who often edited Djajakusuma's films, the director enjoyed experimenting with new techniques to better convey his intentions. Djajakusuma often included traditional arts in his films, and two of them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) were based on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos.; This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical. The Indonesian sociologist Umar Kayam, who had served on the Jakarta Art Council with Djajakusuma, described the director as highly disciplined. Biran described him as having a fiery temper which could be triggered suddenly, yet quick to calm when the trigger was removed; this sentiment was echoed by several people who had worked with Djajakusuma. Coverage in the film magazine Djaja described him as hardworking and highly dedicated to his craft, to the point of forsaking romantic relationships. Reception Djajakusuma (left) shaking hands with Minister of Education Mashuri Saleh after receiving an award for his films Djajakusuma's film Harimau Tjampa garnered him the Best Screenplay Award at the 1954 Asian Film Festival. His later film Bimo Kroda was recognised by the Indonesian Department of Information for promoting traditional culture. In 1970 he received an Art Award from the Indonesian government for \\"his service to the State as the Main Promoter of the Development of Modern Drama\\". At the 1987 Indonesian Film Festival, he received a special award for his contributions to the film industry, and in November 2003 he was posthumously granted a Budaya Parama Dharma Award by President Megawati Sukarnoputri for his contributions to the development of Indonesian culture. Critical reception has been positive. The award-winning director Teguh Karya cited the works of Djajakusuma, Usmar Ismail, and Asrul Sani as \\"legendary\\" and among his greatest influences. Choreographer Bagong Kussudiardjo reportedly so respected Djajakusuma that he had named his son Djadoeg after the director. According to a memorial in the newspaper Kompas, Djajakusuma was also dubbed a \\"living legend\\" during his visit to Nantes. A later Kompas article records Djajakusuma's best-remembered works are Harimau Tjampa and Tjambuk Api. Those two works are those most often shown, owing to the fact that ready-to-use copies are stored at Sinematek Indonesia; his other surviving films are kept as negatives.

The FCR gives a simultaneous coverage at a (1 − α)×100% level for all of the parameters considered in the problem. The FCR has a strong connection to the false discovery rate (FDR). Both methods address the problem of multiple comparisons, FCR from confidence intervals (CIs) and FDR from P-value's point of view. FCR was needed because of dangers caused by selective inference. Researchers and scientists tend to report or highlight only the portion of data that is considered significant without clearly indicating the various hypothesis that were considered. It is therefore necessary to understand how the data is falsely covered. There are many FCR procedures which can be used depending on the length of the CI – Bonferroni-selected–Bonferroni-adjusted, Adjusted BH-Selected CIs (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2005 ). The incentive of choosing one procedure over another is to ensure that the CI is as narrow as possible and to keep the FCR. For microarray experiments and other modern applications, there are a huge number of parameters, often tens of thousands or more and it is very important to choose the most powerful procedure. The FCR was first introduced by Daniel Yekutieli in his PhD thesis in 2001Theoretical Results Needed for Applying the False Discovery Rate in Statistical Problems. April, 2001 (Section 3.2, Page 51). Definitions Not keeping the FCR means \\\\text{FCR}>q when q= \\\\frac{V}{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha m_0}{R} , where m_0 is the number of true null hypotheses, R is the number of rejected hypothesis, V is the number of false positives, and \\\\alpha is the significance level. Intervals with simultaneous coverage probability 1-q can control the FCR to be bounded by q. =Classification of multiple hypothesis tests= The problems addressed by FCR =Selection= Selection causes reduced average coverage. Selection can be presented as conditioning on an event defined by the data and may affect the coverage probability of a CI for a single parameter. Equivalently, the problem of selection changes the basic sense of P-values. FCR procedures consider that the goal of conditional coverage following any selection rule for any set of (unknown) values for the parameters is impossible to achieve. A weaker property when it comes to selective CIs is possible and will avoid false coverage statements. FCR is a measure of interval coverage following selection. Therefore, even though a 1 − α CI does not offer selective (conditional) coverage, the probability of constructing a no covering CI is at most α, where : \\\\Pr[\\\\theta ot\\\\in \\\\mathrm{CI},\\\\ \\\\text{CI constructed}] \\\\leq \\\\Pr[\\\\theta ot\\\\in \\\\mathrm{CI}] \\\\leq \\\\alpha =Selection and multiplicity= When facing both multiplicity (inference about multiple parameters) and selection, not only is the expected proportion of coverage over selected parameters at 1−α not equivalent to the expected proportion of no coverage at α, but also the latter can no longer be ensured by constructing marginal CIs for each selected parameter. FCR procedures solve this by taking the expected proportion of parameters not covered by their CIs among the selected parameters, where the proportion is 0 if no parameter is selected. This false coverage-statement rate (FCR) is a property of any procedure that is defined by the way in which parameters are selected and the way in which the multiple intervals are constructed. Controlling procedures =Bonferroni procedure (Bonferroni- selected–Bonferroni-adjusted) for simultaneous CI= Simultaneous CIs with Bonferroni procedure when we have m parameters, each marginal CI constructed at the 1 − α/m level. Without selection, these CIs offer simultaneous coverage, in the sense that the probability that all CIs cover their respective parameters is at least 1 − α. unfortunately, even such a strong property does not ensure the conditional confidence property following selection. =FCR for Bonferroni-selected–Bonferroni-adjusted simultaneous CI= The Bonferroni–Bonferroni procedure cannot offer conditional coverage, however it does control the FCR at <α In fact it does so too well, in the sense that the FCR is much too close to 0 for large values of θ. Intervals selection is based on Bonferroni testing, and Bonferroni CIs are then constructed. The FCR is estimated as, the proportion of intervals failing to cover their respective parameters among the constructed CIs is calculated (setting the proportion to 0 when none are selected). Where selection is based on unadjusted individual testing and unadjusted CIs are constructed. =FCR- adjusted BH-selected CIs= In BH procedure for FDR after sorting the p values P(1) ≤ • • • ≤ P(m) and calculating R = max{ j : P( j) ≤ j • q/m}, the R null hypotheses for which P(i) ≤ R • q/m are rejected. If testing is done using the Bonferroni procedure, then the lower bound of the FCR may drop well below the desired level q, implying that the intervals are too long. In contrast, applying the following procedure, which combines the general procedure with the FDR controlling testing in the BH procedure, also yields a lower bound for the FCR, q/2 ≤ FCR. This procedure is sharp in the sense that for some configurations, the FCR approaches q. 1\\\\. Sort the p values used for testing the m hypotheses regarding the parameters, P(1) ≤ • • • ≤P(m). 2\\\\. Calculate R = max{i : P(i) ≤ i • q/m}. 3\\\\.

The location of Kooman's presentation was Waldschmidt's home church. Kooman mentioned She Has a Name, a play that he had written about human trafficking, and Waldschmidt soon asked Kooman for permission to read the script. Waldschmidt felt drawn to address the issue of human trafficking even before discovering She Has a Name and had gotten involved with some fair trade initiatives. Waldschmidt attested to his feet sweating after having first read the script and said that it was one of only two scripts that he had ever read that he could not put down before finishing. Nonetheless, he initially backed off from the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issue. Eventually, however, he and Kooman worked together on the script, expanding it to a full-length play with an extra hour's worth of material by the end of 2010, resulting in a play that can be performed in ninety minutes but may last up to two hours. Kooman and Waldschmidt were moved to continue working on the play because of worldwide human trafficking statistics; namely, that 800000 people are trafficked across international borders each year, that there are 10 million children forced to work in the sex industry, that 1 million of these are child prostitutes, and that sex traffickers have an average annual income of $280000 per victim.

After seeing one of his paintings, Secretary of Education José Vasconcelos invited Leal to paint at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. The resulting work is Los danzantes de Chalma. Leal also painted a mural dedicated to Simón Bolívar at the Anfiteatro Bolivar, as well as religious murals such as those at the chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe at the Basilica Villa in Tepeyac. Life Fernando Leal was born in Mexico City on February 26, 1896. He first studied art at the Academy of San Carlos, then switched to the Escuela al Aire Libre de Coyoacán, studying under Alfredo Ramos Martinez.dead link He was classmates with Gabriel Fernández Ledesma, Rafael Vera de Córdoba, Ramón Alva de la Canal and Fermín Revueltas. Leal died on October 7, 1964. He is survived by his son, Fernando Leal Audirac, who also became a noted Mexican painter. Career Depiction of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe at the Tepeyac chapel Leal was one of the first muralists in Mexico, in a movement that began in the 1920s. In 1921 Vasconcelos, Secretary of Education, visited Leal’s school in Coyoacán. An easel painting by the artist called Zapatistas at Rest, painted that same year, caught his eye. Leal said that the imagery of the indigenous persons with realistic detail, done in European painting techniques, fit Vasconcelos’ needs. He asked Leal to do a mural on the walls of the preparatory school. Leal was recruited by Vasconcelos along with a number of other artists such as Diego Rivera, Xavier Guerrero, Amado de la Cueva, Jean Charlot, David Alfaro Siqueiros and others to paint for the post-Revolutionary government, to create a “new sense of Mexican identity.” The first mural he painted was Los danzantes de Chalma at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, today the San Ildefonso College. Leal chose the theme when offered his choice by Vasconcelos. The encaustic mural shows a ritual performed in the sanctuary town of Chalma, with its fusion of Catholic and indigenous rites. It is naturalist in style with simplification of forms in a Post-Impressionist manner. Opposite this mural is La conquista de Tenochtitlán (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot, who was invited to paint by Leal. The other of his best-known works is a fresco at the Anfiteatro Bolívar, painted from 1930 to 1933. It is notable for its depiction of the life of Simon Bolivar. In the Bolivar mural, Leal combined history with fantasy in the main scene with Bolivar on horseback. The bottom shows the violence of the struggle for liberty, and features indigenous people who appear as Muses or inspiration for the hero. He also painted works which have not survived. In 1927, he painted murals at the Departamento de Salubridad, but these were destroyed. Also destroyed was a mural for the Instituto Nacional de Panamá, with the title of Neptuno encandenado (Neptune chained), a criticism of imperialism. In 1943, he painted two panels in the train station of San Luis Potosí called El triunfo de la locomotora (The triumph of the locomotive) and La edad de la máquina (The age of the machine). The first of these contrasts the old and new ways to travel. The old way, by foot and horse/donkey, shows robbery and other violent scenes, while the train is shown as traversing great distances. In San Luis Potosí he painted the vault of the San Juan de Díos Church, entitled La protección de la Virgen a Santo Domingo (The protection of the Virgin of Santo Domingo). In 1949, he painted seven murals at the Tepeyac chapel at the Villa de Guadalupe, frescos that narrate the story of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. He taught painting at the Academy of San Carlos, and in 1927 was appointed director of the Centro Popular de Pintura in Nonoalco. Its mission was to make art accessible to the working classes. In 1952 he was appointed Ministry of Culture, where he campaigned for artists´ rights in 1959. He also served director of the Escuela al Aire Libre de Coyoacán. Leal was founder of the group ¡30-30!, which published a review in opposition to academic ideology in art, taking part in the group’s exhibitions starting in 1929. He occasionally wrote art criticism. In 1952, he published El derecho de la cultura (The right of culture). He also wrote an unfinished history of the Academy of San Carlos. His paintings can be found in the Museo de Arte Moderno, including El hombre de la tuna (The man of the prickly pear) and Campesinos con sarape (Farm workers with sarape). (encmex) He was also a successful wood engraver. Artistry Leal is best known for his mural work, but he also did engraving, lithography and painting on canvas. He was one of the first Mexican muralists using a number of different techniques. He was one of the first to create small trial versions of a work in order to find the best means of executing monumental works. His murals usually used encaustic painting producing rich transparent colors, subtly graduated and free from heavy chiaroscuro . He was notable for his use of color and his early use of images from Mexican rural and popular culture. His themes were mostly popular traditions and Biblical personages, one of the first to use indigenous themes for monumental work. His work features a synthesis of shapes in the styles of Saturnino Herrán, avoiding allegory, trademarks of the Mexican realist school of paintings. His artistic style was somewhere between Baroque and Classic but with use of bright colors. The base of the work was Classic but the repetition of forms is Baroque. However, his canvas works tends to be stylized with a simplification of forms in a post Impressionist style.

History Sterilgarda was formed in 1969 by a group of local dairy farming entrepreneurs to take advantage of two new technology innovations in milk production: the development of UHT milk, and the invention of the Tetrapak container. When combined, this would allow dairies to stabilise production, allowing long-term storage of quantities of milk for when they were need to be purchased by consumers, and also extend the possible distribution chain even to where there was no daily door-step delivery. Formed and still based in Castiglione delle Stiviere, the company started out by supplying just milk delivery companies. It quickly expanded in the 1970s to forming partnerships with retailers, and later into the foods market supplying milk and whey for the production of mascarpone cheese. Later in the decade, the company started centralised production of tomato paste, being close to the \\"hot-break\\" tomato production centres of the Casalasco farmers co-operative, located in Rivarolo del Re ed Uniti, Parma and Piacenza along the River Po valley. With increased production in the 1980s, the company fully automated its production lines. This also allowed the company to extend into the production and packaging of fruit juices initially in consumable cellophane-wrapped packs for school children, and later family-sized litre-scale Tetrapak varieties. By the mid-1980s, the company had experimenting with the production of desserts, especially a type of yogurt without milk-protein, but that was only initially available locally to the dairy due to its needs of being produced in glass jars. Fruit juice production was also expanded, with specific lines for the mixing industry aimed at cocktails, particularly a refined tomato juice for creating a Bloody Mary. Cheese production had also expanded with the introduction of gorgonzola and mascarpone, and the introduction of cream cheese and cottage cheese production. In the early 1990s, the company develops new portion-sized deserts based around a mix of UHT derived pannacotta and fruit mix, which mainly replace the dwindling requirements from consumers for yogurt-based products. At the start of 2000, the company introduced lactose-free milk, flavored milk and deserts with added Omega 3. With new packaging available from Tetrapak, from 2000 Sterilgarda milk is marketed as \\"milk with cap\\", which brings a large growth in UHT milk sales. In 2010, using a patented-process, Sterilgarda launched micro-filtered UHT milk, providing a product with a long ambient- temperature storage life before being used. Present The main plant covers an indoor enclosed area of and employs 263 people, on a site capable of doubling plant size. It currently produces of product per day, through eight product-line plants and 27 packaging lines. The separate but enclosed cheese dairy plant produces of mascarpone and of ricotta per day. The company currently produces: *20 lines of milk and liquid product, covering: milk, juice, cream, whip cream, béchamel, sorbet base, chocolate milk, banana milk *20 lines for desserts, covering: yogurt, milk pudding, panna cotta *20 lines for cheese, covering: mascarpone, ricotta and spreadable cheese *Tomato paste They currently have under development new lines for the drinks market, covering cocktail mixers, energy drinks and herbal teas.

This continued until 2010, when they became main-sponsor of the Yamaha factory teams YZF-R1's. After Yamaha decided to pull out of WSB at the end of the 2011 season, Sterilgarda also confirmed that they would stop sponsoring teams in WSB.

Discovered in 1954, the mineral was described in 1961 and named after Orlando J. Benston (1901–1966). Description and occurrence Benstonite is translucent and white, pale yellow, or pale yellow-brown in color. The mineral occurs as cleavable masses; cleavage fragments are nearly perfectly rhombohedral in shape. Cleavage faces are up to across and slightly curved. On large specimens, the faces exhibit a mosaic structure similar to that in some specimens of dolomite and siderite. Benstonite fluoresces red or yellow under x-rays and longwave and shortwave ultraviolet. The mineral also exhibits strong red phosphorescence. Benstonite is known to occur in Canada, China, India, Italy, Namibia, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. It occurs in association with alstonite, barite, barytocalcite, calcite, daqingshanite, fluorite, huntite, monazite, phlogopite, pyrite, sphalerite, strontianite, and quartz. Synthesis The mineral was first synthesized in 1973 during a study of the Ba-Mg-Ca-CO3 system in aqueous solution. At room temperature, a solution containing proportional quantities of magnesium chloride, barium chloride, and calcium chloride was prepared, to which sodium carbonate was added. The solution immediately precipitated, and after sitting for two weeks, the precipitate was identified as nearly pure benstonite. History Orlando J. Benston of Malvern, Arkansas, visited a barite mine near the Magnet Cove igneous complex on New Year's Eve, 1954. He collected samples of a mineral that he guessed might be alstonite or barytocalcite on the basis of qualitative tests. Friedrich Lippmann identified it as a new mineral and described it in the journal Naturwissenschaften in 1961. He named it Benstonite in honor of Benston. Type specimens are held at Victor Goldschmidt University in Germany and the National Museum of Natural History in the United States.

The mineral is white to colorless and occurs as groupings of acicular (needle-shaped) crystals. It was discovered in 1983 in northern Yukon, Canada, and described in 1986. Rapidcreekite is structurally and compositionally similar to gypsum. Description White crystals of rapidcreekite with quartz from the Rapid Creek area Rapidcreekite is transparent and white to colorless. The mineral occurs as isolated clusters or pervasive crusts of radiating sprays of acicular crystals up to in length. Structure In the structure of rapidcreekite, there are two distinct calcium sites coordinated by six oxygen anions and two H2O groups arranged as a square antiprism. The sulfur site is tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen anions and the carbon site is coordinated by a triangle of oxygen anions. The structural unit of rapidcreekite is a sheet that consists of edge-sharing CaΦ8 polyhedra (Φ, unspecified species: O or OH) cross-linked by carbonate and sulfate groups. Sheets are held together by weakening hydrogen bonds, accounting for the perfect cleavage along {100}. The structure and composition of rapidcreekite is similar to that of gypsum. If half of the sulfate groups in gypsum were replaced by carbonate, the formula of rapidcreekite is obtained. If gypsum were transformed by twinning along alternate rows of sulfate groups and the resultant triangles of oxygen along the boundary occupied by carbon, the structure of rapidcreekite would result. History Rapidcreekite was first encountered in 1983 in a tributary of Rapid Creek unofficially known as Crosscut Creek at in northern Yukon. The mineral was named rapidcreekite for the general area in which it was found. The mineral and name were approved by the IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA1984-035). Rapidcreekite was described in 1986 in the journal Canadian Mineralogist. The holotype specimen, which consists of a few grams of rapidcreekite on a matrix, is held in the National Mineral Collection of the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa. Other specimens are held there and in the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Ottawa. Occurrence Rapidcreekite occurs in association with aragonite, gypsum, and kulanite. It has been found in Canada, Germany, Norway, and Romania. The rare mineral occurs as a secondary phase that formed along the surfaces of joints and bedding planes in a quartz-rich sideritic formation. In the Rapid Creek area, the formation occurred in Albian ironstones and shales.

The report was expanded and republished with a survey in CoEvolution Quarterly in 1977, which was used as the basis the 1981 book Voluntary Simplicity. =VALS= Mitchell created the Values, Attitudes and Lifestyles (VALS) psychographic methodology at SRI International in the late 1970s. VALS helps companies tailor their products and services to appeal to the people most likely to purchase them, and explains changing U.S. values and lifestyles. It was formally inaugurated as an SRI product in 1978. VALS was subsequently called \\"one of the ten top market research breakthroughs of the 1980s\\" by Advertising Age magazine. In the VALS study, Mitchell identified three major values groups in society: the Traditionalists, the Modernists and the Cultural Creatives. The Traditionalists, as he saw them, were those who wanted to return to the 1950s, with mom in the kitchen and the white picket fence around the house. The Modernists were those who thought technology would solve all our problems. And the Cultural Creatives, consisting of two subgroups of \\"Greens\\" and \\"Spiritual Seekers,\\" were people who were self-directed and interested both in developing themselves in fulfilling ways and in being of service to the larger community. According to Mitchell, this group comprised 24 percent of the American population by late 1980, and was the fastest growing values group in America. To the best of our knowledge, Mitchell was the first to coin the term \\"Cultural Creatives\\", a term subsequently popularized by Paul Ray and Sherrie Anderson in their book, Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing The World (published in 2000).

Emperor Napoleon I formed it in 1805 by borrowing divisions from other corps and assigned it to Marshal Édouard Mortier. Marshal André Masséna's Army of Italy was also reorganized as the VIII Corps at the end of the 1805 campaign. The corps was reformed for the 1806 campaign under Mortier and spent the rest of the year mopping up Prussian garrisons in western Germany. After General Jean-Andoche Junot's Army of Portugal was repatriated following the Convention of Cintra in 1808, it was reconstituted as the VIII Corps. However, Junot's command was broken up before the end of the year. In 1809, the soldiers from the Kingdom of Württemberg were formed into a new VIII Corps under the leadership of General Dominique Vandamme. After seeing a few battles, they were used to protect Napoleon's rear areas. By January 1810, a new VIII Corps was created in Spain and placed under Junot. This unit participated in Masséna's invasion of Portugal before being discontinued in 1811. A new VIII Corps was formed from Westphalians for the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and placed under Junot's command once more. The corps was effectively destroyed during the retreat. The following year, the corps was rebuilt with Polish units and assigned to Józef Poniatowski. The VIII Corps fought in the 1813 German campaign and ceased to exist after the Battle of Leipzig. History =1805= The Battle of Dürenstein The corps was first called into existence during the War of the Third Coalition in 1805. After destroying much of the Austrian Empire's military strength in the Ulm campaign, Napoleon ordered his generals to advance toward the Austrian capital of Vienna. The emperor formed a new VIII Corps under Mortier and assigned four divisions to the new organization. Mortier's task was to operate on the north bank of the Danube and protect the French army's strategic left flank.Chandler (1966), p. 403 The divisions were led by Generals Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau, Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière, Pierre Dupont de l'Etang, and Louis Klein. Dumonceau's division transferred from the II Corps, Gazan's from the V Corps, Dupont's from the VI Corps, and Klein's from the I Cavalry Corps.Chandler (1966), p. 1103 On 11 November 1805, Mortier with the 5,000 men of Gazan's division bumped into a greatly superior force of Russians and Austrians. In the Battle of Dürenstein, Gazan suffered 3,000 casualties but was saved from annihilation when Dupont's division arrived later in the day. Neither Klein nor Dumonceau were engaged in the action.Chandler (1966), p. 406 The VIII Corps missed the Battle of Austerlitz.Smith (1998), pp. 215–216 Even after his decisive triumph at Austerlitz, Napoleon believed Archduke Charles' large army to be a threat. Therefore, he ordered Masséna to reorganize his Army of Italy as the VIII Corps. Masséna was to march east with his main body while sending his heavy cavalry to Graz. General Auguste de Marmont assembled at Graz with the II Corps while Marshal Michel Ney arrived at Klagenfurt with the VI Corps. The emperor placed Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps at Bratislava (Pressburg) and Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult's IV Corps south of Vienna. In this way, Charles' army was totally contained. On 26 December, the Treaty of Pressburg was signed, ending the war.Schneid, pp. 42–43 =1806–1807= During the War of the Fourth Coalition, the VIII Corps was re- established at Mainz under Mortier. Together with troops from the Kingdom of Holland under King Louis Bonaparte, the corps defended against a westward thrust by Prussian forces in the former Electorate of Hanover.Petre (1993), pp. 192–193 On 17 October 1806, Napoleon ordered Mortier to seize Fulda while Louis was to capture Paderborn and Münster. From these locations they would converge on Kassel whose ruler, William I, Elector of Hesse the emperor wished to depose.Petre (1993), pp. 293–294 On 1 November, Mortier entered Kassel from the south with General Loison's 5,500-man division composed of three French light infantry regiments. Louis arrived from the north with Dutch soldiers a few hours later to complete the bloodless conquest. On 7 November, the French and their allies arrived near Hamelin (Hameln). Two days later, Louis pleaded illness and withdrew from the campaign.Petre (1993), p. 297 Mortier left Dumonceau's Dutch division to carry out the Siege of Hameln. Though Dumonceau's 6,000 soldiers outnumbered by General Karl Ludwig von Lecoq's 10,000 defenders, the operation was a success.Smith (1998), p. 233 General Anne Jean Marie René Savary showed up on 19 November 1806 with a preliminary armistice in which all Prussian fortresses were to be surrendered. Though the document was not ratified, Savary used it to bully Lecoq into capitulating.Petre (1993), p. 298 Afterward the Dutch Division marched to Nienburg where it accepted the surrender of 2,911 Prussian soldiers on 26 November. The VIII Corps was involved in the unsuccessful Siege of Kolberg from 20 March to 2 July 1807. Mortier's 14,000 men and 41 guns included the Fusilier-Chasseurs and Fusilier-Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard under Savary, Loison's French division of six infantry battalions and nine cavalry squadrons, General Charles Louis Dieudonné Grandjean's Dutch contingent with 12 battalions and two hussar regiments, six Italian battalions with supporting cavalry, two Polish battalions, and seven German battalions. The VIII Corps lost 5,000 killed, wounded, or died of illness. The defenders of the 230-gun Kolberg fortress lost 3,000 of the 6,000-man garrison killed, wounded, or died of disease.Smith (1998), p. 252 In June, however, Mortier was called to join the main army. He led 8,465 foot soldiers and 1,200 horsemen in the thick of the action at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807. General Pierre-Louis Dupas led the all-French 1st Division, General Jean Henri Dombrowski commanded the all-Polish 2nd Division, and General Maurice Ignace Fresia directed the Dutch and Polish cavalry contingent.Smith (1998), p. 249 =1808–1809= Map of the Battle of Abensberg In late 1807, Junot led a small army in the initially successful invasion of Portugal.Chandler (1966), p. 599 The French troops were isolated there when the Peninsular War broke out first in Spain, then in Portugal. After being defeated by the British at the Battle of Vimeiro, Junot's army was repatriated to France following the Convention of Cintra, signed on 22 August 1808.Chandler (1966), p. 619 Upon return, the troops became the VIII Corps under Junot with three divisions. On 10 October, there were 25,730 men on the muster rolls of whom 2,137 were detached and 3,523 were in hospital. The corps had only a brief existence before being dissolved in December 1808. Junot's cavalry units were provisional; these were dispersed to join their regular regiments. Loison's 2nd Division was entirely broken up and distributed to other corps. General Étienne Heudelet de Bierre's 3rd Division became the 4th Division of Soult's II Corps. General Henri François Delaborde's 1st DivisionOman (2010), I, pp. 643–644 became the 3rd Division of II Corps.Oman (2010), I, p. 585 During the War of the Fifth Coalition, Vandamme assumed command of the Württemberg Corps. This unit consisted of a 3-brigade infantry division under General Baron von Neubronn, a two-brigade cavalry division led by General Freiherr von Wöllwarth, a 10-gun foot artillery company, and two 6-gun horse artillery companies.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 62 Vandamme's troops were involved in the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April 1809.Chandler (1966), pp. 684–685 At the Battle of Eckmühl on 22 April, the Württembergers lost 15 killed, 98 wounded and two captured.Smith (1998), p. 292 By 17 May, when Württemberger troops were engaged in the Battle of Linz-Urfahr, they were officially called the VIII Corps.Smith (1998), p. 305 The corps missed the Battle of Wagram because it was serving as a garrison for Vienna.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 156 On 5 July 1809, the unit counted 10,793 soldiers including 7,560 infantry, 2,130 cavalry, and 34 guns.Bowden & Tarbox (1980), p. 161 =1810–1811= In 1809, a formation known as the Reserve Corps of the Army of Germany was assembled. This later became a new VIII Corps that served in Spain in 1810.Oman (1996), III, pp. 202–203 The Reserve Corps was under the command of Marshal François Christophe de Kellermann. Its three divisions were led by Generals Olivier Rivaud de la Raffinière, Eloi Laurent Despeaux, and Joseph Lagrange. Rivaud's 1st Division was composed of three brigades under Generals Charles Malo François Lameth, Eloi Charlemagne Taupin, and Jean-André Valletaux. Each brigade was made up of three 4th Battalions. Despeaux's 2nd Division and Lagrange's 3rd Division were formed from provisional units.Bowden & Tarbox, p. 159 This corps was ordered to march to Spain and its first units reached Burgos around 1 January 1810.Oman (1996), III, p. 203 On 15 January, the new corps was massed at Burgos under the command of Junot and consisted of three divisions under Generals Bertrand Clausel, Lagrange, and Jean Baptiste Solignac. Clausel's 1st Division numbered 10,777 men in 12 battalions, Lagrange's 2nd Division numbered 10,343 soldiers in 13 battalions, and Solignac's 3rd Division numbered 8,074 troops in 12 battalions. General Charles Marie Robert Escorches de Saint-Croix led 5,479 dragoons in 32 squadrons. There were 1,710 gunners, sappers, and wagon drivers, 866 men detached to the Burgos garrison, and 88 members of the staff. The grand total was 37,337 soldiers of whom 956 officers and 32,239 men were present under arms.Oman (1996), III, p. 537 The VIII Corps moved into the Province of León in February. Clausel scouted the region and sent a summons of surrender to the city of Astorga on 26 February 1810. This was refused by its governor, General José María Santocildes even though the ancient walls mounted only 14 guns, the heaviest of which were two 12-pound pieces.Oman (1996), III, pp. 220–221 No siege guns were immediately available, but a large convoy with heavy artillery was plodding slowly across Spain. But Junot was too impatient to wait for it. Anxious to erase the stain of his defeat at Vimeiro, Junot obtained Spanish fortress guns from Burgos and Segovia to form his own siege train. On 15 March, he directed his troops to march on Astorga. Clausel's division began the Siege of Astorga on 21 March while Saint-Croix's dragoons covered the siege from La Bañeza and Solignac supported the operation from León and Benavente. Because the guns had not arrived, Clausel's men occupied themselves by digging the first parallel and preparing artillery positions.Oman (1996), III, p. 223 When General Nicolás de Mahy assembled 5,000 troops, Junot ordered Clausel's division to oppose them, while sending Solignac's division and one of Lagrange's brigades into the trenches. Saint-Croix routed a Spanish detachment on 10 April near Alcañizas. On 15 April the small siege train finally arrived and the guns were mounted in batteries. By noon on the 21st a breach was battered in the wall at the northwest corner. The evening, 700 men from the elite companies of the 47th Line Infantry and Irish Regiments seized the breach and a house just inside the wall. Though they were blocked from advancing any farther,Oman (1996), III, pp. 224–225 Santocildes capitulated the next morning because his men had shot away most of their ammunition. The siege cost the French 160 killed and 400 wounded of whom 112 were killed and 294 were wounded in the assault. The Spanish suffered only 51 killed and 109 wounded, but 2,500 were captured.Oman (1996), III, p. 226 Clausel's and Solignac's divisions of Junot's corps joined the II Corps and the VI Corps in Masséna's invasion of Portugal in 1810. VIII Corps was not engaged during the Battle of Bussaco.Smith (1998), pp. 346–347 When Masséna's army arrived before the Lines of Torres Vedras, Clausel's men clashed with the defenders in the Battle of Sobral in mid-October.Smith (1998), p. 348 Checked before the Lines, the French army starvedOman (1996), III, p. 481 and the unsuccessful invasion caused serious losses in VIII Corps. Clausel's division shrank from 6,794 men on 15 September 1810, to 3,610 men on 15 March 1811. By the latter date, the 4th Battalions of the division were so weak that the cadres had to be sent home and the survivors distributed to units of II Corps. Solignac's division shrank from 7,226 men on 15 September 1810, to 4,553 men on 15 March 1811.Oman (1996), III, p. 542 Solignac's division was present at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro on 3–5 May 1811. It was not engaged and suffered only two wounded.Smith (1998), p. 359 After Marmont replaced Masséna in command, the army's three corps were suppressed and the troops reorganized into independent divisions. The new 5th and 6th Divisions under Generals Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune and Antoine François Brenier de Montmorand were created from units of VIII Corps and of Loison's VI Corps division.Oman (1996), IV, pp. 360–361 =1812–1813= Jean Henri Dombrowski The corps was reconstituted for the invasion of Russia and leadership was given to Vandamme. Together with the V Corps (Poles), VII Corps (Saxons), and IV Cavalry Corps, it was assigned to the 2nd Support Army under Jérôme Bonaparte. All the corps troops belonged to Jérôme's Kingdom of Westphalia. General Jean Victor Tharreau commanded the 1st Division and General von Ochs led the 2nd Division. On 24 June 1812, the corps consisted of 15,885 infantry in 18 battalions, 2,050 cavalry in 12 squadrons, and 34 artillery pieces. Later, command of the corps passed to Junot.Chandler (1966), p. 1112 Jérôme's inexperience as a general was mitigated by the appointment of General Jean Gabriel Marchand as his chief of staff.Chandler (1966), p. 755 Nevertheless, after being harshly criticized in a letter by his brother, Jérôme resigned his command on 14 July and went home.Chandler (1966), p. 776 At the Battle of Valutino on 18 August 1812, the VIII Corps was ordered to cross the Dnieper River and block the retreat of the Russian Army toward Moscow. After taking a long time to cross the river, Junot failed to advance any farther, allowing the Russians to escape.Chandler (1966), p. 788–789 At the Battle of Borodino on 7 September, the corps started out in reserve along with the Imperial Guard and the reserve cavalry.Chandler (1966), p. 799 By 8:30 AM, Junot's men were sent into action. At 10:00 AM they joined the I Corps and III Corps in a massed attack on the flèches which was successful.Chandler (1966), p. 801 Tharreau was among Borodino's many fatalities.Smith (1998), p. 391 That autumn, the Grande Armée withdrew from Moscow. By the time they reached Smolensk, the combined V and VIII Corps counted no more than 1,500 men.Chandler (1966), p. 828 In the following year, Prince Józef Poniatowski was appointed to command the VIII Corps, which was rebuilt as an all-Polish unit. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16-19 October 1813 the corps consisted of the 26th Infantry Division under General Kaminiecki, the 27th Infantry Division led by General of Jean Henri Dombrowski (Jan Henryk Dąbrowski), the 27th Light Cavalry Brigade under General Jan Nepomucen Umiński, and the 44 guns of the corps artillery under Colonel Redel.OSG, Napoleon at Leipzig, p. 4 Marshal Joachim Murat assumed command of a wing that included the II, V, and VIII Corps plus cavalry. His orders were to delay the advance of the Army of Bohemia from the south.Chandler (1966), p. 917 On 16 October, the 26th Division fought near the villages of Markkleeberg and Dölitz in the southern part of the battlefield.Chandler (1966), pp. 926–927 Meanwhile, Dombrowski's division became involved in the fighting to the north.Chandler (1966), p. 931 During the rear guard fighting on the 19th, a panicky sapper prematurely blew up the bridge over the White Elster River, trapping the VII, VIII, and XI Corps in Leipzig. The wounded Poniatowski drowned trying to cross the river and the encircled troops surrendered.Chandler (1966), pp. 935–936 Order of battle =Dürenstein: November 1805= Édouard Mortier Marshal Édouard

Currently, a state agency, The Agency for Quality of Education, is in charge of administrating the tests to students in 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th grade (basic education) and 10th and 11th grade (2nd and 3rd years of secondary education). Political History SIMCE is a product of neo-liberal policies in education put forth by civilian reformers working for the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). In 1980, a new constitution was adopted that changed the way in which the state was organized, making it more of a \\"subsidiary state\\" and promoting a technocratic and market-driven society. In education at the primary and secondary level, the constitutional push made by Pinochet's dictatorship was installed under the rhetoric of \\"modernization\\". The main elements of this modernization were underfunding public education, allocating funding through student vouchers, and allowing the entry of private entrepreneurs to compete with public schools for student enrollment. Under this ideology, the creation of a market-driven education allowed parents, families, and policymakers to have information to make decisions as consumers in an education market. In this sense, civilians opted for developing a battery of tests of academic achievement that measured the \\"quality\\" of education, and pushed the cultural shift needed to conceive the new state.

The attackers broke through the Kerem Shalom border crossing to Israel, where one of the vehicles exploded. They then engaged in a firefight with soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, during which six of the attackers were killed. No Israelis were injured. The attack led to sharp condemnations from Israeli and Egyptian authorities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences for the Egyptian soldiers killed, and praised IDF troops for their preparedness and handling of the attack. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned that the incident should be a \\"wake up call\\" for Egypt in dealing with terrorists in the Sinai Peninsula, while Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi vowed to retake the Sinai Peninsula and declared three days of mourning. The Egyptian government also closed the Rafah Border Crossing to the Gaza Strip. Background =Post-Egyptian revolution= Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula, and some al-Qaeda-linked groups were established as well. These militants have been frequently attacking and bombing gas pipelines in the Sinai running between Egypt and Israel. , there have been 15 bombings on these gas pipelines since the 2011 uprising. The charred remains of an Egged bus destroyed by a suicide bomber during the August 2011 attacks In August 2011, a series of cross-border attacks were carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border via the Sinai Peninsula. The terrorists opened fire on an Egged No. 392 bus near Eilat, and soon thereafter, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along the Egypt–Israel border. A third attack occurred when an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam Special Unit police officer, and one Golani Brigade soldier – were killed during the multi-pronged attack. The Israeli security forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. In July 2012, IDF intelligence chief Aviv Kochavi told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the IDF has stopped approximately a dozen attacks against Israel from the Sinai Peninsula. On 31 July 2012, the United States Department of State's Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism warned in a report, \\"The smuggling of humans, weapons, cash, and other contraband through the Sinai into Israel and Gaza created criminal networks with possible ties to terrorist groups in the region. The smuggling of weapons from Libya through Egypt has increased since the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime.\\" Haaretz reported that forces from al-Qaeda, supported by the local Bedouin, have been stationed in the Sinai. It also reported that several other terrorist groups in Gaza have been assisting these forces, and were also smuggling weapons and goods into Gaza. =August 2012= In early August 2012, Israel's National Security Council's counter-terrorism bureau renewed its travel advisory against visiting the Sinai Peninsula, due to information on potential terrorist attacks against tourists, including kidnappings. The warning may have been due to Hamas' release of Abu Walid al-Maqdisi, a Salafi leader of an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group, responsible for three bombings in Dahab in 2006, and which is believed to have close ties with terror cells operating in the Sinai Peninsula. The following day, the United States also issued a travel warning to Americans to \\"take precautions in travel to the Sinai\\" and warned that \\"overland travel from Israel to the Sinai in particular is strongly discouraged.\\" Over the weekend prior to the attack on the border, various intelligence reports reaching the IDF's Southern Command warned of an impending attack. Specific information regarding the time, target, and location of the attack could not be ascertained. Still, Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Tal Russo prepared his troops in case of an attack. Armored, Engineering, and Infantry soldiers were placed on high alert while the Israeli Air Force was deployed in the area as reinforcement. Russo evacuated troops from the Kerem Shalom border crossing, where the militants would later break through, in anticipation of them coming under attack. Egyptian intelligence chief Morad Mowafi said that Egypt had also received comprehensive intelligence warnings before the attack took place. However, the Egyptian authorities never imagined that this type of attack would happen, in which \\"a Muslim would kill a Muslim on the hour of breaking the fast in Ramadan.\\"  Attack  The attackers approached an Egyptian military base in the Sinai Peninsula in three Land Rovers at sundown, during the iftar meal, which breaks the day's fast during the Muslim month of Ramadan, and succeeded in taking control of the base while the soldiers were sitting down in the dining hall for the iftar meal. The attackers were dressed as Bedouins and attacked with guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Thirty-five attackers took part in this attack on the Egyptian base. The APC used by the gunmen after being struck by the Israeli Air Force After firing on the police, the gunmen commandeered two Fahd wheeled armored personnel carriers and attempted to break through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint into Israel. A few minutes before the gunmen infiltrated across the border, IDF troops received an alert regarding a possible breach of the Egyptian–Israeli border. This followed intelligence informing the IDF that an Egyptian border patrol post had recently been surrounded. One of the APCs was driven into the checkpoint, where it exploded, apparently booby-trapped. The other vehicle crossed into Israel and drove for approximately 100 meters on the highway before encountering troops from the IDF Bedouin Reconnaissance Battalion, which opened fire on the vehicle but failed to stop its advance. The IDF then sent three tanks onto the highway, but the vehicle accelerated away. After driving about 2 km into Israel, and heading towards Kibbutz Kerem Shalom at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour (43.5 miles per hour), the APC was destroyed by the Israeli Air Force with a missile. This bombing was unprecedented, as it took place inside Israeli territory. Some of the gunmen managed to escape the wreckage and were then killed by Israeli troops after a short exchange of fire. Israeli soldiers had been previously warned of an impending attack and had recently increased patrols to the area. Arab Bedouin troops of the Israel Defense Forces were instrumental in reconnaissance and thwarting the attack. The remaining attackers tried to escape to the Gaza Strip, but were prevented from doing so by Egyptian army forces. Sixteen Egyptian police officers were killed in the raid, as well as an unspecified number of the attackers. Seven more police officers were wounded. The Israeli Army later reported it had found the bodies of five gunmen from the raid, while Egyptian authorities reported that they had the bodies of at least three gunmen. Following the attack, Israel transferred the bodies on its side of the border to the Egyptian authorities.  Reactions  No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Israeli and Egyptian authorities believe that the perpetrators belonged to a global jihad network, and were assisted by Bedouin tribes in the Sinai in return for money. The New York Times and BBC described the attack as a sign that armed groups were continuing to grow in power in the Sinai region, which was \\"slipping from [Egypt]'s control\\". Haaretz stated that the incident showed that Islamists had begun to target Egyptians along with Israelis. =Egypt= Following the attack, state television reported that foreign Islamist militants were responsible for perpetrating the attack. In addition, the Egyptian government indefinitely closed the Rafah border crossing to the Gaza Strip. Weapons that were used during the attack President Mohamed Morsi labelled the attack as \\"vicious,\\" and said that the perpetrators, along with those cooperating with the perpetrators, would \\"pay a high price,\\" regardless of whether they're inside or outside Egyptian territory. Morsi ordered security forces to take complete control over the Sinai, and declared three days of mourning to honor the 16 Egyptian soldiers who were killed. The army said that \\"elements\\" in the Gaza Strip helped the perpetrators by firing mortars during the attack. The daily al-Youm al-Saba'a quoted a senior Egyptian security official, who said that Islamic Jihad militants from Gaza and global jihad (Jihad al-Alami) fighters from Egypt perpetrated the attack. CNN cited an anonymous 'Egyptian general' who said the Hamas breakaway group 'Al-Galgala Army' is behind the border attack . The MENA news agency said that the attackers were jihadists who had \\"infiltrated from Gaza through tunnels,\\" and had collaborated with \\"jihadist elements.\\" The Muslim Brotherhood released a statement calling on the government to \\"confront this serious challenge to the Egyptian sovereignty\\" as well as to \\"protect Sinai from all armed groups.\\" The party also claimed on its website that the attack \\"can be attributed to the Mossad\\", Israel's intelligence service, in an effort to destabilize the government, which the Israeli foreign ministry denied as \\"nonsense.\\" On 6 August, the military deployed at least two helicopter gunships to the Sinai in search of members of the group that perpetrated the attack. The army also arrested several suspects in the Sinai, and confiscated vehicles which did not contain license plates. On 7 August, at a funeral for the soldiers who were killed, Prime Minister Hesham Qandil was assaulted and attacked by angry mourners, who also vandalized his car. In addition, Kandil was pelted with shoes, while some angry mourners chanted, \\"The Brotherhood and Hamas are one dirty hand.\\" Minister of Tourism Hisham Zazou denied that the attack caused a decrease in tourism, and said that tourism agencies had not cancelled reservations and that Zazou was personally calling them to ensure this was true. Zazou stressed that tourists should feel secure in Egypt. On 8 August, Egyptian officials told Al-Hayat that they believe that members of the Gaza-based Army of Islam, or Jaysh al-Islam, designated as a terrorist group by the United States, participated in the attack. On the same day, President Morsi fired intelligence chief Murad Mowafi and temporarily replaced him with Mohammed Raafat Shehata. Morsi also fired the governor of Northern Sinai and the presidential guard's commander, and named new chiefs for Cairo's security forces and the police's large central security. In addition, Morsi asked Defense Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi to replace the military police's commander. On 9 August, a Palestinian daily reported that Egypt’s General Intelligence demanded the extradition of three senior members of Hamas’s armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, for their involvement in the attack. One security source said that it is believed that they have delivered \\"indirect logistical support\\" to a radical group located in the Sinai, which perpetrated the attack. Palestinian Authority security forces said that the three men are Raed Attar, Ayman Nofal, and Muhammad Abu-Shamalah. Attar is the commander of the brigades in Gaza, and was involved in the abduction of Gilad Shalit in 2006. Although Hamas was willing to deliver the senior Hamas members to Egypt, the men refused, saying that they were scared of being tortured by the Egyptian authorities, but they agreed to allow Egyptian intelligence authorities question them in Gaza. That same day, an initial forensic report on the bodies of the gunmen suggested that the perpetrators were wearing military uniforms created in the Palestinian city of Nablus. The forensic report says that all the perpetrators were men in their thirties with \\"Arab features.\\" On 19 August, a North Sinai security official said that ten Yemeni militants infiltrated the country two months prior to the attack and trained local jihadi cells in the Sinai. He stated that Egypt had received intelligence that these militants were communicating with jihadist groups in Al Mukataa, south of Sheikh Zuwayed. Bedouin leader Ibrahim Al Menei said that the Yemeni militants were smuggled in from Sudan with African migrants, and that word spread among the community. Another Bedouin leader, Salem Aneizan, also said that he heard the Yemeni militants were training jihadists in North Sinai. Operations A few days after the attack, forces from the army and the police engaged in an operation against armed men who have been targeting security personnel in North Sinai. A number of clashes between armed men and security forces in the Sinai have erupted since then, and Egyptian security officials have conducted raids on militant hideouts as well. =Israel= Following the attack, Israeli residents of the Eshkol Region were instructed to stay in their homes as soldiers searched the area for remaining attackers. Officials said that the attack may have been intended to abduct an IDF soldier, or to infiltrate a nearby community to attack civilians. Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that the attack showed the need for \\"determined Egyptian action\\" against terrorism in Sinai, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and hope that that incident would be a \\"wake-up call\\" to Egyptian forces. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gantz said, \\"Even before investigations of the attack are complete, I estimate we prevented a large-scale disaster, an extremely complex attack by terrorists operating between Sinai and the Gaza Strip. This was an extremely successful joint operation of the IAF and Armored Corps.\\" He also expressed his \\"appreciation for the alertness of the forces, specifically the alertness of the intelligence, and the determination of the soldiers operating in the field.\\" Two days after the attack, Israel said that it was willing to consider any Egyptian request to deploy additional military troops in the Sinai Peninsula, in order to retake control of the Sinai and eliminate any global jihad militant infrastructure. Furthermore, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Intelligence Dan Meridor said that Israel would not object to Egypt bringing heavier military forces into the Sinai Peninsula in order to combat terror groups. Under a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, the peninsula is supposed to remain demilitarized, but Israel permitted the Egyptians to deploy about seven battalions in the peninsula to enforce control. Israel hopes that in this way, Egypt will be more able to eliminate terrorists that pose a threat to Egypt and Israel. Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that Israel and Egypt would increase security cooperation following the attack, and said that they already saw improvements on the ground. Ayalon said that it is in Egypt's interest as well to gain control of the Sinai Peninsula. =Palestinians= Hamas condemned the attack as an \\"ugly crime\\" and offered condolences to Egypt. However, a Hamas official also condemned Egypt's decision to shut the Rafah crossing, describing it as \\"collective punishment\\". Palestinian security officials stated concern that the attack could worsen relations between Egypt and the Gaza Strip government, and said that for this reason Israeli forces might have been behind the assault. They also expressed worry that Egypt might retaliate with the large military force deployed to the region. A Hamas official claimed that the attack \\"only serves the interests of the Zionist enemy.\\" On 9 August, Gazan philanthropist Abdul Dayem Abu-Midin promised to give $10,000 to each individual family related to the Egyptian soldiers who were killed during the attack, telling a Hamas-affiliated center that he is doing this out of \\"the love of a Palestinian citizen to a sister-nation.\\" On 9 August, Hamas rebuked Egypt for maintaining its closure of the Egyptian–Gazan border. Interior Minister Fathi Hammad compared the situation to that of Mubarak's era, during which Mubarak enforced a blockade on Gaza. Since the time of its closure after the 5 August attacks, Egypt has only opened the borders briefly and temporarily. On 11 August, the Palestinian Authority requested that Egypt destroy all of the smuggling tunnels located under the Egypt-Gaza border, which would enforce a stricter Egyptian blockade on Gaza. This request was the first time that the Palestinian Authority publicly demanded the destruction of these tunnels, saying that the tunnels do not contribute to the Gazan economy and were only used by a few people for personal gain. PA officials also insisted that some of the gunmen in the border attack had come from the Gaza Strip. They provided the names of several suspects from Gaza to the Egyptian authorities. One official said, \\"We have good reason to believe that terrorist groups from the Gaza Strip were involved in the attack. These groups operate under the watchful eye of the Hamas government and sometimes even receive support from it.\\" =United Nations= United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the attack as an act of terrorism, noting that it killed 16 Egyptian soldiers and put Israeli citizens at risk, and conveyed his condolences to the families of the victims. He added, \\"Such attacks are totally unacceptable. The Secretary-General hopes that the perpetrators will be swiftly identified and brought to justice.\\" Mr. Ki-moon also hoped for a swift recovery for those injured in the attack. =Other states= * — Bahrain strongly condemned and denounced the attack as a terrorist attack, saying that it was \\"a heinous act contravening Islamic precepts, religious creeds, ethical and human values.\\" Bahrain expressed complete solidarity with Egypt and expressed its full support of the measures undertaken by Egypt to create security and stability in the Sinai. Bahrain also expressed its condolences to the victims' families and wished the injured a quick recovery, and said that Bahrain condemns \\"all forms of terrorism, regardless of its sources.\\" * — France condemned the attack in the Sinai and urged Egypt to exert control over the region, saying that they were concerned with the deteriorating security situation in the Sinai. * — Jordan condemned the attack as a terrorist attack, and said that Jordan \\"supports Egypt in fighting all forms of terrorism, which has caused the suffering of many people around the world.\\" * — The Russian foreign ministry condemned the attack as a terrorist attack, and said that the attack \\"was received with grave concern and condemnation.\\" The ministry expressed its condolences to Egypt, as well as their \\"understanding and solidarity with the counter-terrorism actions taken by Egyptian and Israeli sides to ensure order and stability.\\" The ministry also said that Russia firmly believes \\"that terrorism in all its forms cannot and shall not be excused. We hope that as a result of the measures taken situation in the Sinai Peninsula will return back to normal, ensuring the proper level of security.\\" The ministry recommended Russians in Egypt to take precautions, and not to travel outside the Sinai's resort areas. * — The United States condemned the attack as a terrorist attack, and offered condolences to the victims and families, as well as President Morsi. The United States said that if asked by the Egyptian authorities, \\"we stand ready to assist the government of Egypt as it acts on President Morsi's pledge to secure the Sinai and address the threats of violent extremism.\\" =Parties and Organizations= * - In an appearance on Press TV future head of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn questioned the idea that Islamic terrorists were behind it and instead suggested that it was the \\"Hand of Israel\\". These comments resurfaced in the late 2010s and were criticized in Haaretz and by historian Dominic Green.

A member of the Communist Party, as many activists were, she was an organizer for the Cannery and Agricultural Workers’ International Union (CAWIU). Decker helped organize the massive California agricultural strikes of 1933 during the Great Depression. Background Caroline Decker was born on April 26, 1912 in Macon, Georgia. Her real name was Caroline Dwofsky, the daughter of Bernard Dwofsky and Anna Raskin. Like most Communist organizers at the time, Caroline used an alias, taking \\"Decker\\" as hers, and known as Caroline Decker throughout her organizing career. Her parents were Jewish immigrants that emigrated to the US after fleeing pogroms in Ukraine. Her family moved to Syracuse, N.Y. when she was 12, and her father Bernard is buried there in the Workman's Circle Cemetery. In Syracuse, Caroline met many leaders of left-wing organizations who frequented the family home. Influenced by her brother, who was a student at Columbia University in New York City, and her sister, who was a national officer of the left-wing Workers International Relief Organization, Decker became involved with radical politics and trade union organizing in her early teens. She joined the Young Communist League USA, helped organize cigar workers and shoe workers in Binghamton, N.Y. and became a speaker at such events as International Women's Day.Caroline Decker Gladstein Oral History, California Historical Society, North Baker Library Union activism Decker's first foray in union activism took place during the Harlan County War, the violent confrontation between miners and mine owners in Harlan County, Kentucky in 1931–1932 during the Great Depression. She and her sister worked out of Knoxville, Tennessee, helping with strike relief and organization. After the strike ended, Decker went west to California as part of the Free Tom Mooney delegation. She stopped in Carmel at the home of Lincoln Steffans, where Langston Hughes and Ellen Winter celebrated the victory by writing a pageant. They intended it to be “…a tribute to Caroline Decker” but it was unsuccessful, a “…long, artificial propaganda vehicle too complicated and too cumbersome to be performed. California Agricultural Strike 1933 California, in 1933, was in the midst of bitter labor struggles from the Central Valleys south to Imperial County, California; it was one of the most militant years in agricultural worker activism. Declining agricultural wages put pressure on workers, and the Cannery and Agricultural Worker’s International Union (CAWIU) organizers found fertile ground among discontented and struggling farm workers. Several of the CAWIU leaders, including Decker, were members of the Communist Party, and she became the union secretary. A series of strikes in 1933 against growers of cherries, pears, peaches, and sugar beets had mixed success, but by August “[s]trikes led or influenced by the union resulted in wage increases of as much as 100 percent for thousands of agricultural workers. Wages for agricultural workers prior to the August strikes had ranged from 15 to 17-1/2 cents an hour, but by the end of the month “…was firmly fixed at 25 cents” throughout most of the state. Decker moved further up the ranks of the CAWI during the strike against grape growers in the Fresno area. Decker led a rally in Fresno on September 11 where “…four thousand thronged the speaker’s platform to hear this petite blonde, barely twenty-one”. One CAWIU organizer, Patrick Chaffee, remembers her “…fiery eloquence”, and within a month, “Comrade Decker had led six thousand off the job, the largest single agricultural strike to that point in the history of California”. Grape pickers sought a wage of 25 cents an hour, but growers held firm at 20 cents. Local authorities arrested much of the leadership of the CAWIU, and forcibly broke up picket lines. The editor of the Fresno Bee believed the CAWIU was plotting the overthrow of the U. S. government and encouraged the actions of authorities. In October 1933, Decker became involved with the San Joaquin cotton strike. Cotton was the “second most lucrative crop in California”. In 1921 there were 1,500 acres in production; by 1937 there “was close to 600,00 acres”. The Great Depression had sharply reduced the prices that cotton growers got for their product, and they passed those declines on to workers in the form of lower wages, with wages declining nearly 75 percent in three years. By the time of the strike, growers had sold 75 per cent of the crop to Japan at 7 cents a pound in advance of the harvest, and had “no room whatsoever to pass on added labor costs. \\"Field workers demanded one dollar per hundred pounds; growers offered sixty cents, at which rate “even a strong, steadily working man could make no more than $1.20 a day. An entire family working all day would average $2.” The strike began on October 4, with twelve thousand workers walking off the job and a strike front extending for five hundred miles. Growers evicted families of strikers from company-owned housing, and in Pixley, California a violent clash between strikers and growers left “two Mexican strikers … dead [and] eight others…wounded. An estimated 5,000 people gathered for the funeral mass for the two murdered strikers – Delfino Davila and Dolores Hernandez. Governor James Rolph appointed a fact-finding committee to look into the violence. ” Decker led strikers to the courthouse in Visalia where, on October 19, 1933, the committee began its hearings. She questioned strikers on the stand, where she brought out the details of their lives: “a work day extending from daylight to dark, their fingers bleeding from the prickly cotton bolls, the children working alongside their parents until they collapsed on the ground in exhausted sleep” ”. After hearing testimony from another woman who said her children “had not worn shoes since 1930” the growers’ counsel charged that Decker had coached witness testimony. She “immediately offered to let him personally select all further strikers’ witnesses\\" but he declined the offer. Despite the drama of the testimony, the action of the government through NRA regional director George Creel ultimately ended the strike. Creel brought in relief supplies for striking workers, and got the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank to help finance the cotton growers so they could give a wage of 75 cents an hour. Creel's goals were to persuade growers and strikers to accept that rate, and to deny National Labor Board recognition to the CAWIU because of its Communist leadership. Eventually the Central Strike Committee agreed to the terms and workers returned to work without an officially recognized union. Arrest and trial In June 1934 Decker traveled to Contra Costa County to organize apricot pickers, working alongside members of the AFL-affiliated Cannery Workers Union. Growers objected to Decker's presence because of her Communist membership, and she was maneuvered off the team. Meanwhile, a group was formed representing growers and funded by railroads, utilities, banks, and others who hoped to defeat agricultural unionism: the Associated Farmers of California. They hired private investigators and even infiltrated the Communist Party in order to learn more about the CAWIU leadership. On July 20 the police, acting on information from the Associated Farmers, rounded up seventeen of the union's leaders, including Decker, and charged them with “criminal syndicalism, a felony”. When the trial finally went to the jury, after a six-hour defense summary by Decker, it had become the longest trial in California history, at four and a half months. Decker was found guilty on two of six counts and sentenced to a term of imprisonment at Tehachapi. She served for three years and was released in 1937. The Third District Court of Appeals eventually overturned the verdict and voided the convictions. Later years The Communist Party, meanwhile, decided to concentrate on anti-fascism, and the CAWIU was effectively dissolved as an independent union. The events in Europe and around the world, as World War II loomed, took precedence over labor organizing. Decker divorced her first husband, Jack Warnick, shortly after her release from prison. She had served time for violating California's Criminal Syndicalism laws. She married attorney Richard Gladstein. They had four children together. Decker Gladstein died in Marin, California on May 17, 1992.

He worked with the British trader and Captain John Meares, commanding the ship Iphigenia Nubiana. He was involved in the Nootka Crisis of 1789, which brought Britain and Spain to the brink of war. A few years later he was captain of the American ship Grace. In 1791 he partnered with Captain John Kendrick in an attempt to open trade with Japan. Captain of Iphigenia =Trading voyages of 1788= Douglas was an officer on Nootka during Meares's first fur trading voyage to the Pacific Northwest coast from 1786 to 1787. In 1788, in Macau, China, Meares formed a partnership of several merchants and captains, and purchased two new vessels, the snows Felice Adventurer and Iphigenia Nubiana—generally called Felice and Iphigenia. Meares took command of Felice. He made Douglas captain of Iphigenia and second in command of the expedition, noting in his later account that Douglas \\"was well acquainted with the coast of America\\". Felice Adventurer was of 230 tons burthen (bm) and Iphigenia Nubiana of 200 tons (bm). Meares described them as having bottoms sheathed with copper. Felice had a crew of 50, Iphigenia 40. In order to avoid the cost of acquiring licenses from the East India Company and South Sea Company—required for British merchant ships trading across the Pacific Ocean—and to evade the high port costs China demanded of foreign ships other than those of Portugal, Meares and his partners had Felice and Iphigenia sail under the Portuguese flag. The ships were registered in Macau under a Portuguese merchant named João Carvalho. They sailed under the titular Portuguese command of Francisco José Viana, who pretended to be the captain of Iphigenia, while Meares pretended to be the supercargo of Felice. This tactic of sailing under false colors was not uncommon at the time and was used by other British maritime fur traders such as Charles William Barkley. Felice and Iphigenia sailed from Macau on 22 January 1788. Meares intended to establish permanent fur trading posts on the Pacific Northwest coast. Felice carried materials for constructing a house and a schooner, both to be built at Nootka Sound. To assist with building and running the posts 50 Chinese men were hired and sailed with the expedition. They became the first Chinese known to have visited the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii. Also sailing with Meares and Douglas were a number of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans, including Tianna (Kaʻiana – also spelled Tyaana & Tyanna), a chief of Kauai, who Meares had brought from Hawaii to Macau, and Winee (or Wynee), a Hawaiian girl who Charles William Barkley had brought to Macau in 1787. The ships also carried two natives of Maui, a boy and a man who Douglas referred to as Tawnee. There was also a Nuu-chah-nulth—a native of Vancouver Island—called Comekela. Kaiana, Winee, and Comekela were aboard Felice. The others were on Iphigenia. Winee became ill shortly after the ships left Macau. On 5 February 1788, she died. Meares, Douglas, and their partners had planned for Meares to sail Felice to Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island, while Douglas sailed Iphigenia to the Aleutian Islands and down the coast of North America to Nootka Sound, collecting furs along the way. The ships would rendezvous in Nootka Sound or, failing that, Hawaii.Nokes, pp. 49–58 While Douglas was exploring the coast from Alaska to Nootka Sound, Meares would explore south along today's Washington and Oregon coasts. By this plan the two ships would be able to explore the whole coast from Spanish California to the Bering Sea. At the time the Pacific Northwest coast was still largely unexplored. Only its general shape and a few small harbors such as Nootka Sound had been charted. The possibility that a Northwest Passage might exist was taken seriously. Meares hoped to find it. While crossing the South China Sea Iphigenia proved to be a \\"heavy\\" sailer and much slower than Felice. Iphigenia sprang her foremast and began to leak, and also suffered an outbreak of scurvy. For these reasons the two ships sailed to the Spanish port at Zamboanga in the Philippines, where Iphigenia was repaired. Meares did not want to wait for the repairs to be finished. He transferred Kaiana and the other native Hawaiians to Iphigenia, charging Douglas with taking them to their homeland. Comekela remained on Felice, which sailed from Zamboanga soon after arriving. Douglas left with the repaired Iphigenia on 22 February 1788. Because of the delay he decided to sail first to the Pacific Northwest coast, instead of Hawaii, in order to arrive in time for the fur trading season. Douglas sailed Iphigenia from the Philippines north through the Celebes Sea and the Philippine Sea, then crossed the Pacific directly to the northwest coast. Felice reached America first, anchoring in Nootka Sound near the native village of Yuquot on 13 May 1788. Comekela returned to his people. A few days later Meares was visited by the chiefs Maquinna and Callicum. According to Meares, on 25 May 1788 Maquinna sold or granted a tract of land to Meares as a site for the construction of a trading post house. Whether Maquinna actually did this became a point of contention between Britain and Spain, and in 1792 Maquinna denied in an affidavit that he had. This was one of the key issues of the Nootka Crisis. Another issue was what kind of \\"house\\", if any, Meares built. By Meares' account it was finished on 28 May 1788 and boasted two floors, an attached blacksmith shop, a surrounding breastwork and a cannon emplacement. Work was begun on a schooner, which was finished, named North West America, and launched in September. Douglas and Iphigenia had not arrived at Nootka Sound by June and Meares decided to sail south to collect furs, leaving a group of men and officers at Nootka Sound under the command of Robert Funter. Meares left on 11 June 1788 and returned on 26 July. Douglas had still not yet arrived with Iphigenia.Nokes, pp. 61–63, 80, 87 In August Meares took Felice on another fur trading cruise, this time to Clayoquot Sound. He returned to Nootka Sound on 24 August. On August 26 Iphigenia was spotted. Captain Douglas anchored in Nootka Sound on the 27th.Nokes, pp. 89-94 As planned, Douglas had crossed the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands. He entered Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound in Alaska, then cruised south, trading for furs along the way. Meares wrote that Douglas's voyage had confirmed that there was a \\"Great Northern Archipelago\\"—today's Alexander Archipelago and British Columbia Coast—and that earlier voyages had been exploring offshore islands rather than the mainland. Between the two of them Douglas and Meares had collected a valuable cargo of hundreds of furs. Meares decided that as soon as the new schooner, North West America, was launched he would sail Felice to Macau, China, with the combined cargo of furs. Douglas and Iphigenia would remain at Nootka Sound until North West America was ready for sea, then the two vessels would sail to Hawaii and spend the winter there. The following spring they would return to the Northwest Coast. On 17 September 1788, before North West America was finished, the American maritime fur trader Robert Gray arrived at Nootka Sound with Lady Washington. The British and American captains were suspicious of each other from the start. North West America was launched on 20 September 1788. Robert Funter was given command of the schooner and a crew was selected from Felice and Iphigenia. The combined cargo of 750 furs was loaded into Felice, which left Nootka Sound on 24 September 1788. In October, Meares stopped at a few places in the Hawaiian Islands, communicating and trading with the Hawaiians but not going ashore. He discovered that the political situation on Kauai might prove dangerous for Kaiana, who was to return with Douglas on Iphigenia. Hoping to warn Douglas and Kaiana, Meares left a letter to Douglas with a Hawaiian of Niihau, who both captains had met before and called Friday (after the character Friday from the novel Robinson Crusoe). Meares left Hawaii on 27 October 1788 and arrived at Macau on 5 December.Nokes, pp. 106–108 North West America was ready for sea a few weeks after Meares had left Nootka Sound. Captain Douglas, in preparing to sail, had all the tools and supplies on shore loaded onto Iphigenia and North West America. He also had his men tear down the \\"house\\" that Meares had built, not knowing, or not caring that Meares had promised to give it to the natives. Douglas gave some of the planks to John Kendrick, the American captain of Columbia Rediviva, which had arrived at Nootka Sound shortly after Lady Washington.Nokes, pp. 113-121 Douglas traded some cannons to Kendrick in exchange for additional provisions. Kendrick's longboats towed Douglas's ships out of Nootka Sound. After the British ships left, the local natives who had been very skittish since the Americans arrived, suddenly came in great numbers and soon a friendly trading relationship was established. According to the journals and logs of the Americans, Douglas and his men had treated the local natives very poorly—repeatedly taking food and provisions from them under the threat of force. =Wintering in the Hawaiian Islands= On 27 October 1788 Iphigenia and North West America, under Douglas and Funter, left Nootka Sound for the Hawaiian Islands, where they spent the winter. The purpose was to avoid the unpleasant winter storms of the Pacific Northwest coast and for \\"refreshment\\". They arrived off the Hawaiian island of Maui on December 6. From there they sailed to the island of Hawaii. News of the return of Kaiana spread and many of his friends and relatives came to the ships to visit with him. Douglas anchored the ships in Kealakekua Bay. Other than Queen Charlotte, under Captain George Dixon, and King George, under Nathaniel Portlock, Iphigenia and North West America were the first European ships to visit Kealakekua Bay since James Cook was killed there. Kamehameha I came to Iphigenia on December 10. In 1795 Kamehameha established the Kingdom of Hawaii over most of the islands, but in 1788 was still struggling to gain control over the island of Hawaii. Kamehameha gave Douglas a large fan and two full- length cloaks made from the feathers of mamo and ʻŌʻō birds (both now extinct). Later, Douglas gave these cloaks to Captain Robert Gray, who in turn gave them to Esteban José Martínez. On December 19 Douglas, wanting to find an anchorage more protected from squally weather, order Iphigenia's anchor raised only to discover that the line had been cut. Kamehameha and his chiefs, who were on board, immediately left and paddled quickly to the shore, making it clear they were to blame for the sabotage. Douglas sent Kaiana to tell Kamehameha if the anchor was not returned the Hawaiian village on the bay would be \\"blown about his ears\\". Kaiana returned with several swimmers who dived to a depth of 20 fathoms and attached a rope to the loose anchor. Before Douglas set sail the next day Kamehameha and several chiefs came aboard unabashedly to say farewell. Kaiana decided to stay on Hawaii with Kamehameha, who promised him a rich life of honor and security, instead of returning to his native Kauai. Kaiana correctly feared that the political situation on Kauai would make his return dangerous. He became an important lieutenant of Kamehameha, leading troops into battles in support of Kamehameha, but the two had a falling out. Kaiana and his warriors eventually changed sided and fought against Kamehameha in the 1795 climactic Battle of Nuʻuanu. Kaiana was killed in that battle. Douglas sailed to Maui, where Hawaiians again tried to cut Iphigenia's cable, then to Oahu, where yet again anchors were cut. They were recovered after Douglas threatened the local chief that \\"his town should be laid in ashes\\". Douglas and Funter sailed Iphigenia and North West America from island to island over the winter, visiting Kauai and returning to Oahu and Hawaii. In Hawaii they visited Kaiana and Kamehameha who asked to be supplied with firearms. They said that rival chiefs, including the king Kaeo of Kauai, had formed an alliance against Kamehameha and that Kaeo had been given arms and ammunition by George Dixon and Nathaniel Portlock, who were rivals with Meares and Douglas in the maritime fur trade business. Hearing this, Douglas gave Kamehameha and Kaiana firearms and ammunition, and had a swivel gun mounted on one of Kamehameha's largest canoes. When Meares published an account of his adventures in 1790 he included Douglas's statement about Dixon and Portlock supplying weapons to the Hawaiians. Dixon denied the allegation, along with numerous others in a \\"pamphleteer war\\" between Dixon and Meares in London. Douglas returned to Oahu and Kauai near the end of winter. Mutiny broke out among the crew. One sailor, named Jones, attempted to get a loaded blunderbuss from the fore-top. Douglas fired a pistol over his head and threatened to fire again unless he surrendered. Jones was given the choice of punishment or immediate banishment ashore. He chose banishment. Douglas sailed for Niihau while other mutinous plans were made by crew members. On March 15 the quartermaster and two sailors escaped in native canoes. They were apparently planning to set fire to Iphigenia but were stopped by Friday, the friendly native of Niihau. Friday arranged for the two sailors to be returned, but the quartermaster escaped and was left behind. In March Douglas was ready to sail back to the Pacific Northwest coast. The plan had been to sail to Alaska and cruise south, like he had done the year before. But the two ships lacked some necessary supplies and North West America had no anchor. Therefore, Douglas decided to sail directly to Nootka Sound where he hoped to meet Meares and another ship from China. On 17 March 1789 Douglas and Funter left the Hawaiian Islands for Nootka Sound. =Trading voyage of 1789= Douglas arrived at Nootka Sound on 20 April 1789 and anchored near the Nuu-chah-nulth village of Yuquot. He discovered that the Americans Kendrick and Gray had spent the winter on the coast of Vancouver Island. Captain Kendrick visited Douglas and told him that Columbia Redivivia was anchored a few miles away in what is now called Kendrick Inlet. Captain Gray had taken Lady Washington on a cruise to the south but returned to Nootka Sound within a few days of Douglas's arrival.Nokes, pp. 123-137 Douglas found that over the winter Kendrick had built a trading outpost, which he called Fort Washington. It had a house, a gun battery, a blacksmith forge, and various outbuildings. Douglas also learned that the Americans had already taken the winter's furs, arranged trading commitments from the village of Nootka Sound, gathered furs to the south, and were about to head north. Douglas knew he had to send North West America trading to the north as soon as possible.Ridley, pp. 97–98 On April 21 Douglas recorded the death of Acchon Aching. His body was taken ashore for burial—the first known case of an Asian, probably Chinese, dying and being buried in the Pacific Northwest. Captain Funter arrived on April 24. North West America was hauled up on the beach for repairs while refurbishing of Iphigenia continued on aboard and ashore. Douglas expected Meares to arrive soon in Felice with supplies for establishing a trading post in Nootka Sound and possibly elsewhere. He did not know that events in China, India, and London had caused significant changes in the plan. In Macau Meares's Portuguese partner, the merchant Carvalho, had gone bankrupt, and the governor of Macau, who was supportive of Carvalho and Meares, had died. In January 1789 Meares and his remaining partners had decided to merge their business with their former rivals, the King George's Sound Company, owned by the Etches brothers of London. In the new \\"Associated Merchants\\" company Meares stayed in Macau. His ship, Felice was sold and a new ship, Argonaut was purchased and placed under the command of James Colnett. Argonaut and , under Thomas Hudson, sailed from China to the Pacific Northwest coast—but did not arrive until July 1789. Because the Etches brothers had proper licenses with the East India Company and South Sea Company, so the ships sailed with British instead of Portuguese flags. Captain Colnett was given overall command of both ships as well as Douglas's Iphigenia and Funter's North West America, which were now owned by the Associated Merchants company. Until they learned about the new situation, Douglas and Funter continued to fly Portuguese flags in Nootka Sound. When North West America was ready for sea again Funter set out on a trading voyage to the north, departing on 28 April 1789. Two days later Gray left with Lady Washington. Thus the only ships in Nootka Sound were Douglas's Iphigenia and Kendrick's Columbia when on May 6 the Spanish warship Princesa, under Esteban José Martínez, entered the harbor. Martínez had been sent by the viceroy of New Spain, Manuel Antonio Flórez, to take control of Nootka Sound and assert Spain's claim to the Northwest Coast. At first Martínez, Douglas, and Kendrick established cordial relations. But with the arrival of the 16 gun San Carlos under Gonzalo López de Haro on May 12 Martínez's attitude changed. He arrested Douglas and his Portuguese \\"capitan de ruse\\" Viana. Iphigenia was seized and Spanish colors hoisted. The crew was taken to the two Spanish warships and the ship was emptied of supplies, cannons, trade goods, charts, and essentially all removable objects. Martínez charged that the ship was violating Spanish sovereignty and had illegally entered Spanish territory. He claimed that the ship's papers directed Iphigenia to seize any English, Russian, or Spanish ships found on the Northwest Coast and take them to Macau for piracy. Douglas responded by saying the papers had been misinterpreted. They were in Portuguese, which neither Douglas nor Martínez could read. But Martínez said his interpreters, Spanish-speaking padres, had translated the papers correctly. Held captive on Princesa, Douglas managed to send a message to the native chief Maquinna, asking that he warn Meares's Felice and Funter's North West America should either appear. Maquinna offered to help Douglas escape in a canoe, but the captain decided not to attempt it. Martínez put his men to work building Fort San Miguel at the entrance to Nootka Sound. He ceremonially claimed Nootka Sound for the Spanish Empire while the British and American crews watched. Preparations were made for taking the captive British and Iphigenia to San Blas, Mexico, New Spain's Pacific naval headquarters. Iphigenia was careened and the Spaniards spent considerable time and effort repairing and refitting the ship in preparation for the voyage to San Blas. Martínez did not have enough men of his own to spare and had planned to have Douglas's crew, under Spanish officers, sail Iphigenia to San Blas. However, Douglas's British and Asian crew refused to cooperate with the Spanish. On May 22, the day when they were supposed to depart, Martínez suddenly changed course, saying his interpreters had read the papers again and found them quite acceptable. Martínez dropped the charges against Douglas and released Iphigenia and its crew. He did, however, make Douglas sign a paper stating that the British had been well treated. He also said that if the Viceroy Flores later ruled that it had been valid to seize Iphigenia, then the firm of the Portuguese merchant Carvalho would have to pay a proper forfeit. Although Martínez was suspicious, Douglas convinced him that his only desire was to sail to China. Martínez supplied Douglas with what he thought was a minimal amount of equipment, food, and other supplies for a direct voyage to Macau via Hawaii. Douglas promised both the Spanish and the Americans that he had no intention of remaining on the Northwest Coast to collect furs. On June 1 he was allowed to depart. By the late afternoon Iphigenia, flying Portuguese colors, was sailing southwest from Nootka Sound, as though headed for Hawaii. At midnight, however, Douglas ordered the ship to change course and head north. He knew that Martínez was not ready to send San Carlos north to patrol the coast, and he did not think Kendrick would be allowed to leave until San Carlos was ready. Douglas wrote \\"the interval was therefore mine\\". He did not have enough furs to turn a profit in China and \\"my people had been accustomed to short allowances\\". So he went north to collect more sea otter furs. Douglas hoped he might encounter Funter and North West America, but they missed each other. On June 8 Funter entered Nootka Sound and found it occupied by Martínez. In a series of events similar to what had happened to Douglas and Iphigenia, Funter and his crew were soon arrested and North West America seized. Martínez wanted to hold North West America as security for payments for the repairs and supplies he had given to Iphigenia.Ridley, p. 112 North West America was never returned to the British, it became a Spanish ship, renamed Santa Gertrudis la Magna and, later, Santa Saturnina. The small vessel was used by the Spanish for several exploration voyages, including José María Narváez's discovery and exploration of the Strait of Georgia in 1791. After changing course on June 2 Douglas took Iphigenia north to the area he had traded in the year before—Hecate Strait, Dixon Entrance, the Alexander Archipelago, and Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands), trading with the natives for sea otter furs. On the north coast of Graham Island Douglas stopped at Kiusta , the village of the Haida chief Cuneah (or \\"Blakow- Coneehaw\\"). Upon arrival the chief, who had met Douglas the year before, came aboard while 200 villagers sang songs. Cuneah honored Douglas by \\"exchanging names\\". Despite some tension and dangerous incidents between the Haida and the crew of Iphigenia, Douglas and Cuneah departed on very friendly terms. On June 23 Douglas took Iphigenia to \\"Tartanee\\", which Douglas described as a populous Haida village of \\"great wooden images\\". For several days the crew traded with the Haida, during which time Douglas noted a garden that had probably been planted by the American Robert Gray. Douglas assisted by planting beans. By late June Iphigenia was completely out of trade goods and all other items desired by the Haida, such as clothes, pots, kettles, and metal items in general. Most of Douglas's trade goods had been seized by Martínez at Nootka Sound. Nonetheless when Iphigenia reached the open ocean on 28 June 1789 Douglas had 760 prime sea otter skins in the hold—far more than the 60-70 he had when leaving Nootka Sound a month before. Douglas set sail for Hawaii, unaware that during the month since he left Nootka Sound two other ships of the Associated Merchants, North West America and Princess Royal, had been detained by Martínez at Nootka Sound, and within a week James Colnett and Argonaut would also be seized, triggering the international incident known as the Nootka Crisis. Iphigenia arrived at Kealakekua Bay in Hawaii on July 20, where the Hawaiians attempted to capture the ship, probably with Kamehameha's approval. By July 28 Iphigenia was anchored at Waikiki on Oahu. Completely out of articles of trade the crew began cutting up rudder chains to exchange for provisions. After cruising to other islands and stocking up on fresh water and yams, Douglas had Iphigenia set sail for China on August 10. The voyage to Macau was uneventful and Iphigenia arrived on 5 October 1789. In Macau Douglas met with Meares and gave him his first report about the clash with the Spaniards in Nootka Sound. It was an incomplete report because Iphigenia had left before the other British ships had arrived and been seized. Nonetheless, Douglas's report helped set Britain on the course toward an international crisis. Not long after Douglas reached Macau the American ship Columbia arrived, under Robert Gray, who brought an account of the later events of the Nootka Crisis. Captain of Grace The Nootka Crisis effectively ended Meares's and the Associated Merchants fur trading ventures. Meares returned to England. Douglas, however, continued to work in the maritime fur trade but with American rather than British partners. In the spring of 1790, in Macau, Douglas left Meares's Associated Merchants company and joined with an American venture. He was given command of Grace, a schooner from New York. The American fur trader John Kendrick was having some difficulties in Macau and was unable to leave. He approached Douglas for assistance and the two captains arranged to work with each other. Kendrick's first mate, Davis Coolidge, joined Douglas as first officer of Grace, and Douglas agreed to pick up some men Kendrick had left in Hawaii to gather sandalwood.Ridley, pp. 190–191 During the summer of 1790 Douglas took Grace to the Pacific Northwest Coast to trade for furs. On the way back to Macau he stopped in Hawaii and picked up Kendrick's cargo of sandalwood and the two men who had been left to collect it. Douglas found that warfare was intensifying in Hawaii and the islands were becoming more dangerous. The maritime fur trader Simon Metcalfe had massacred hundreds of Native Hawaiians at Olowalu. In a separate event his son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe had been killed along with all but one of his crew, and his schooner, , had been captured.Ridley, pp. 218–220 When Douglas reached China he took Grace up the Pearl River to Guangzhou (Canton) and sold a rich cargo of furs. Then he sailed back down the river to join up with Kendrick, who had been working on Lady Washington in Dirty Butter Bay near Macau. Kendrick had remade Washington into a heavily armed two-masted brig or brigantine. The work had drained Kendrick's funds. The sandalwood shipment Douglas brought turned out to be a type low in aromatic oils and therefore not worth very much. To help Kendrick with provisioning and buying trade goods Douglas lent him $2,320. Kendrick was planning to return to the Pacific Northwest Coast by way of Japan. At the time Japan's policy of sakoku strictly limited foreign trade. Meares and company had intended to attempt to open British trade with Japan, but the Nootka Crisis had put an end to that. Douglas agreed to join Kendrick in the venture, but he leaked word of the plan to the British. An officer of the Royal Navy who was in Macau sent word to London and the British court launched new efforts toward opening trade with Japan, but not before Kendrick and Douglas made their attempt. Just before Douglas and Kendrick left Macau, in the spring of 1791, China declared a complete embargo on the trade in sea otter furs, due to a war between China and Russia. This further justified the risk of trying to open the sea otter fur trade with Japan.Ridley, pp. 221–226 As the two ships approached Japan they were caught in a storm and swept toward the Kii Peninsula by the Kuroshio Current. Seeking shelter they entered the channel between the village of Koza on the mainland and the island Kii Ōshima, then moved into a protected bay behind the island, near the fishing village of Kushimoto. The village headman, Kichigo, sent a message to the daimyō at Wakayama Castle, as did the headman of Koza village. After the storm passed a few villagers approached the ships, despite the law forbidding contact with foreigners. Kendrick invited them on board Washington and a few did. Some of the Chinese crewmen were able to communicate via written notes. They said they had been driven to port by the storm and would not stay more than three to five days, but also that they carried trade goods, especially sea otter furs. Kendrick and Douglas soon discovered that the Japanese had no interest in sea otter fur and regarding the wearing of fur as barbaric. The persistent rumor that there was a rich, untapped fur market in Japan proved false. The villagers dissuaded Kendrick and Douglas from visiting Osaka, saying they would be arrested and their ships confiscated. When the daimyo at Wakayama Castle received the messages about the ships, a few days after they arrived, he mobilized his troops. Kendrick and Douglas, perhaps having heard about the troops, left on May 17, about ten days after they had arrived. The troops arrived two days later. In the aftermath Japan established a new system of alarms and patrols for coastal villages. A few days after leaving the Kii Peninsula Douglas and Kendrick found a group of islands they named the Water Islands. They decided to separate at that point. Both ships made for the Pacific Northwest Coast. Douglas sailed Grace to Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands) and apparently secured a fair number of sea otter skins. At the end of the 1791 trading season Douglas returned to China but died during the voyage. R.D. Coolidge replaced him as captain of Grace. Legacy Iphigenia Bay, in Alaska, is named for Douglas's ship, as is Iphigenia Point in British Columbia. In Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands), Coneehaw Rock is named for a Haida chief with whom Douglas traded and exchanged names. Douglas Rock is located nearby. Dixon Entrance, between British Columbia and Alaska, was given the name Douglass Entrance by Meares.

Hans Weinreich (1480/1490 – 1566) was a publisher and printer of German and Polish language books in the first half of the sixteenth century. Weinreich was originally from Danzig (Gdańsk) in Royal Prussia, Kingdom of Poland, and then moved to Königsberg (Królewiec) in Ducal Prussia at the invitation of Albert of Prussia. Biography Weinreich was most likely born in Danzig sometime between 1480 and 1490, to a well-to-do family. His grandfather shared his name and had four sons, of whom one was Hans' father. Weinreich's printshop in Königsberg was supposedly located by the castle steps in the city's Old Town. Printing activity Weinreich issued his first works in either 1512 or 1513 and moved to Königsberg in 1524. In 1524 he began issuing works in Polish. In 1530 Weinreich published the first translation of Luther's Small Catechism made by an anonymous author. However, the language of the translation was poor, and in 1533 Weinreich printed a second edition made by the Polish philologist Liboriusz Schadlika. Weinreich also issued several works by the Polish Lutheran theologian and translator Jan Seklucjan, although some of these were actually translations done by Stanisław Murzynowski. The published works were translations into Polish of the New Testament and the Catechism, as well as literature and song books. Seklucjan's works printed by Weinreich included the first Polish language hymnal. Weinreich also printed the first Lithuanian language and Old Prussian language books while in Königsberg, with the former being a translation of Martin Luther's Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas. The first print run of Mažvydas' work numbered between 200 and 300, although only one known copy has survived. Between 1524 and 1553 Weinreich printed 103 works, of which 59 were in German, 27 in Latin, 13 in Polish and four in either Prussian or Lithuanian.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Dolenjske Toplice municipal site Its territory is now part of the village of Dobindol. Name The name Pajkež is believed to derive from the surname Pajek.Simonič, Ivan. 1935. \\"Kočevarji v luči krajevnih in ledinskih imen.\\" Glasnik Muzejskega društva za Slovenijo 16: 61–81 and 106–123, p. 75. The alternative Slovene name of the settlement, Zgornja Blaževica, semantically corresponds to the German name Oberblaschowitz, both literally meaning 'upper Blaževica/Blaschowitz'. The epithet 'upper' distinguished the village from neighboring (Spodnja) Blaževica (), literally 'lower Blaževica/Blaschowitz'. History Pajkež was a Gottschee German village. It was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 and presumably had not yet been founded by that date.Ferenc, Mitja, & Gojko Zupan. 2012. Izgubljene kočevske vasi, vol. 2 (K–P). Ljubljana: Znanstvena založba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani, pp. 198–199. In the cadastral survey carried out under Emperor Francis I from 1818 to 1827, the village had three families living in two houses. It reached its peak of population in 1890, when there were 27 people living in five houses. There was a sharp decrease in the population between 1921 and 1931, when the number of residents fell from 26 to only nine. The village had an exclusively German-speaking population before the Second World War. The population was evicted on 22 December 1941, departing via the train station in Semič. The village was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and was never rebuilt.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije, p. 521. A hunting lodge was built at the site of the former village in 1962. In more recent times, archery competitions have been organized at the site. Cultural heritage Old maps of the village mark two shrines: one stood 200 m to the north of the settlement, on the road to the hamlet of Pleš in Dobindol, and the other stood 700 m to the southeast, along the road to the hamlet of Seč in Travni Dol. A plantation of 88 trees was planted at the site in 1982 to mark the 88 years of the life of Josip Broz Tito and a commemorative plaque installed. A plaque was also installed on the hunting lodge in 1982, commemorating a Partisan radio station that operated at the site in 1943.

Taxonomy It was first described as a species in 1898 by the British zoologist William Edward de Winton using specimens from Corsica.Randi, Ettore (2007) \\"Phylogeography of South European Mammals\\", in Weiss, Steven & Nuno Ferrand (2007) Phylogeography of Southern European Refugia, Springer. It was later regarded as a subspecies of the European hare (L. europaeus) or both were treated as subspecies of the Cape hare (L. capensis). It is now often treated as a full species as it does not appear to hybridize with the European hare where their ranges overlap and studies of mitochondrial DNA suggest that it belongs to a distinct lineage which differentiated in isolated refuges during the last glacial period. Description It is similar to the European hare in appearance, being largely brown with a cream-coloured belly. It differs in having grey rather than white bases to the hairs of the underfur. It is smaller on average than the European Hare with a head and body length of 44.1—61.2 cm, a tail length of 6.6—11.2 cm and a weight of 1.8—3.8 kg.Aulagnier S.; P. Haffner, A. J. Mitchell-Jones, F. Moutou & J. Zima (2009) Mammals of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, A&C; Black, London. The ears and hind legs are relatively longer, 9—12.6 cm and 11.4—13.5 cm respectively. Distribution and habitat It is found in maquis shrubland, grassland, cultivated areas and dunes. It is common and widespread on Sicily where it occurs from sea-level up to 2400 metres on Mount Etna. On mainland Italy, its range is more fragmented, extending patchily north to Tuscany on the west coast and Foggia on the east coast. It was introduced to Corsica by man, probably between the 14th and 17th centuries, and is currently rare there with only a few recent records. Status and conservation Its population appears to be declining and it is classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is threatened by habitat loss, hunting and competition with European rabbits and introduced populations of European hares. It is now protected from hunting but the similarity between this species and the European hare makes protection difficult to enforce.

The Bradbury Landing site was less than from the center of the rover's touchdown target after a journey. The rover's goals include an investigation of the Martian climate and geology; assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, including investigation of the role of water; and planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration. In December 2012, Curiosity two-year mission was extended indefinitely, and on August 5th, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity rover landing. The rover is still operational, and as of , , Curiosity has been on the planet Mars for sols ( total days) since landing on August 6th, 2012. (See current status.)

Mission = Goals and objectives = Animation of the Curiosity rover, showing its capabilities As established by the Mars Exploration Program, the main scientific goals of the MSL mission are to help determine whether Mars could ever have supported life, as well as determining the role of water, and to study the climate and geology of Mars. The mission results will also help prepare for human exploration. To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives: ;Biological: 1. Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds 2. Investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur) 3. Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures and biomolecules) ;Geological and geochemical: 4. Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials 5. Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils ;Planetary process: 6. Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Martian atmospheric evolution processes 7. Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide ;Surface radiation: 8. Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic and cosmic radiation, solar proton events and secondary neutrons. As part of its exploration, it also measured the radiation exposure in the interior of the spacecraft as it traveled to Mars, and it is continuing radiation measurements as it explores the surface of Mars. This data would be important for a future crewed mission. About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of organic compounds and biomolecules; a branch of paleontology called taphonomy. The region it is set to explore has been compared to the Four Corners region of the North American west. =Name= A NASA panel selected the name Curiosity following a nationwide student contest that attracted more than 9,000 proposals via the Internet and mail. A sixth-grade student from Kansas, 12-year-old Clara Ma from Sunflower Elementary School in Lenexa, Kansas, submitted the winning entry. As her prize, Ma won a trip to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, where she signed her name directly onto the rover as it was being assembled. Ma wrote in her winning essay: = Rover and lander specifications = Two Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers.

Curiosity has an advanced payload of scientific equipment on Mars. It is the fourth NASA robotic rover sent to Mars since 1996. Previous successful Mars rovers are Sojourner from the Mars Pathfinder mission (1997), and Spirit (2004–2010) and Opportunity (2004–2019) rovers from the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Curiosity comprised 23% of the mass of the spacecraft at launch. The remaining mass was discarded in the process of transport and landing. * Dimensions: Curiosity has a mass of including of scientific instruments. The rover is long by wide by in height. Radioisotope pellet within a graphite shell that fuels the generator * Power source: Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), like the successful Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers in 1976. :Radioisotope power systems (RPSs) are generators that produce electricity from the decay of radioactive isotopes, such as plutonium-238, which is a non-fissile isotope of plutonium. Heat given off by the decay of this isotope is converted into electric voltage by thermocouples, providing constant power during all seasons and through the day and night. Waste heat is also used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments. Curiosity RTG is fueled by of plutonium-238 dioxide supplied by the U.S. Department of Energy. :Curiosity's RTG is the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), designed and built by Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, and assembled and tested by the Idaho National Laboratory. Based on legacy RTG technology, it represents a more flexible and compact development step, and is designed to produce 110 watts of electrical power and about 2,000 watts of thermal power at the start of the mission. The MMRTG produces less power over time as its plutonium fuel decays: at its minimum lifetime of 14 years, electrical power output is down to 100 watts. The power source generates of electrical energy each day, much more than the solar panels of the now retired Mars Exploration Rovers, which generated about each day. The electrical output from the MMRTG charges two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. This enables the power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the generator's steady output level. Each battery has a capacity of about 42 ampere hours. * Heat rejection system: The temperatures at the landing site can vary from ; therefore, the thermal system warms the rover for most of the Martian year. The thermal system does so in several ways: passively, through the dissipation to internal components; by electrical heaters strategically placed on key components; and by using the rover heat rejection system (HRS). It uses fluid pumped through of tubing in the rover body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures. The fluid loop serves the additional purpose of rejecting heat when the rover has become too warm, and it can also gather waste heat from the power source by pumping fluid through two heat exchangers that are mounted alongside the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary. * Computers: The two identical on- board rover computers, called Rover Compute Element (RCE) contain radiation hardened memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. The computers run the VxWorks real-time operating system (RTOS). Each computer's memory includes 256 kB of EEPROM, 256 MB of DRAM, and 2 GB of flash memory. For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rovers used 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory. :The RCE computers use the RAD750 CPU, which is a successor to the RAD6000 CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers. The RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC 750, can execute up to 400 MIPS, while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35 MIPS. Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer. On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to a problem with the active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was turned on in safe mode and subsequently returned to active status on March 4. The same problem happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013. :The rover has an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation. The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover. The rover installed its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software. :The rover has four processors. One of them is a SPARC processor that runs the rover's thrusters and descent-stage motors as it descended through the Martian atmosphere. Two others are PowerPC processors: the main processor, which handles nearly all of the rover's ground functions, and that processor's backup. The fourth one, another SPARC processor, commands the rover's movement and is part of its motor controller box. All four processors are single core. Curiosity transmits to Earth directly or via three relay satellites in Mars orbit. *Communications: Curiosity is equipped with significant telecommunication redundancy by several means: an X band transmitter and receiver that can communicate directly with Earth, and a UHF Electra-Lite software-defined radio for communicating with Mars orbiters. Communication with orbiters is the main path for data return to Earth, since the orbiters have both more power and larger antennas than the lander, allowing for faster transmission speeds. Telecommunication included a small deep space transponder on the descent stage and a solid-state power amplifier on the rover for X band. The rover also has two UHF radios, the signals of which orbiting relay satellites are capable of relaying back to Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take an average of 14 minutes, 6 seconds. Curiosity can communicate with Earth directly at speeds up to 32 kbit/s, but the bulk of the data transfer is being relayed through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Odyssey orbiter. Data transfer speeds between Curiosity and each orbiter may reach 2000 kbit/s and 256 kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is able to communicate with Curiosity for only about eight minutes per day (0.56% of the time). Communication from and to Curiosity relies on internationally agreed space data communications protocols as defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems. :JPL is the central data distribution hub where selected data products are provided to remote science operations sites as needed. JPL is also the central hub for the uplink process, though participants are distributed at their respective home institutions. At landing, telemetry was monitored by three orbiters, depending on their dynamic location: the 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's Mars Express satellite. As of February 2019, the MAVEN orbiter is being positioned to serve as a relay orbiter while continuing its science mission. * Mobility systems: Curiosity is equipped with six diameter wheels in a rocker-bogie suspension. The suspension system also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors. Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. Each front and rear wheel can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns. Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction but also leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to estimate the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for \\"JPL\\" (·--- ·--· ·-··). The rover is capable of climbing sand dunes with slopes up to 12.5°. Based on the center of mass, the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50° in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors limit the rover from exceeding 30° tilts. After six years of use, the wheels are visibly worn with punctures and tears. :Curiosity can roll over obstacles approaching in height, and it has a ground clearance of . Based on variables including power levels, terrain difficulty, slippage and visibility, the maximum terrain-traverse speed is estimated to be per day by automatic navigation. The rover landed about from the base of Mount Sharp, (officially named Aeolis Mons) and it is expected to traverse a minimum of during its primary two-year mission. It can travel up to per hour but average speed is about per hour. The vehicle is 'driven' by several operators led by Vandi Verma, group leader of Autonomous Systems, Mobility and Robotic Systems at JPL, who also cowrote the PLEXIL language used to operate the rover. = Landing = Curiosity landed in Quad 51 (nicknamed Yellowknife) of Aeolis Palus in the crater Gale. The landing site coordinates are: . The location was named Bradbury Landing on August 22, 2012, in honor of science fiction author Ray Bradbury. Gale, an estimated 3.5 to 3.8 billion-year-old impact crater, is hypothesized to have first been gradually filled in by sediments; first water- deposited, and then wind-deposited, possibly until it was completely covered. Wind erosion then scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated mountain, Aeolis Mons (\\"Mount Sharp\\"), at the center of the wide crater. Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain. Additionally, its landing site is near an alluvial fan, which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history. According to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant bacterial spores were on Curiosity at launch, and as much as 1,000 times that number may not have been counted. = Rover's landing system = NASA video describing the landing procedure. NASA dubbed the landing as \\"Seven Minutes of Terror\\". Previous NASA Mars rovers became active only after the successful entry, descent and landing on the Martian surface. Curiosity, on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down. Curiosity transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while the MSL spacecraft simultaneously lowered it beneath the spacecraft descent stage with a tether from the \\"sky crane\\" system to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. After the rover touched down it waited 2 seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground then fired several pyrotechnic fasteners activating cable cutters on the bridle to free itself from the spacecraft descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing, and the rover prepared itself to begin the science portion of the mission.  Travel status  As of April 16, 2020, the rover is 13.66 miles away from its landing site. As of April 17, 2020, the rover has been driven on less than 800 out of 2736 sols (Martian days).  Scientific instruments  Instrument location diagram The general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature is intriguing, the rover uses its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover. The MastCam, Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), and Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras were developed by Malin Space Science Systems and they all share common design components, such as on-board electronic imaging processing boxes, 1600×1200 CCDs, and an RGB Bayer pattern filter. In total, the rover carries 17 cameras: HazCams (8), NavCams (4), MastCams (2), MAHLI (1), MARDI (1), and ChemCam (1). = Mast Camera (MastCam) = The turret at the end of the robotic arm holds five devices. The MastCam system provides multiple spectra and true-color imaging with two cameras. The cameras can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels and up to 10 frames per second hardware-compressed video at 720p (1280×720). One MastCam camera is the Medium Angle Camera (MAC), which has a focal length, a 15° field of view, and can yield 22 cm/pixel (8.7 in/pixel) scale at . The other camera in the MastCam is the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), which has a focal length, a 5.1° field of view, and can yield 7.4 cm/pixel (2.9 in/pixel) scale at . Malin also developed a pair of MastCams with zoom lenses, but these were not included in the rover because of the time required to test the new hardware and the looming November 2011 launch date. However, the improved zoom version was selected to be incorporated on the upcoming Mars 2020 mission as Mastcam-Z. Each camera has eight gigabytes of flash memory, which is capable of storing over 5,500 raw images, and can apply real time lossless data compression. The cameras have an autofocus capability that allows them to focus on objects from to infinity. In addition to the fixed RGBG Bayer pattern filter, each camera has an eight-position filter wheel. While the Bayer filter reduces visible light throughput, all three colors are mostly transparent at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, and have minimal effect on such infrared observations. = Chemistry and Camera complex (ChemCam) = The internal spectrometer (left) and the laser telescope (right) for the mast ChemCam is a suite of two remote sensing instruments combined as one: a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a Remote Micro Imager (RMI) telescope. The ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the French CESR laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The flight model of the mast unit was delivered from the French CNES to Los Alamos National Laboratory. The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and soil, while the RMI gives ChemCam scientists high-resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and soil that LIBS targets. The LIBS instrument can target a rock or soil sample up to away, vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067 nm infrared laser and then observes the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock. laser spectrum of chemical elements from ChemCam on Curiosity (\\"Coronation\\" rock, August 19, 2012) ChemCam has the ability to record up to 6,144 different wavelengths of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light. Detection of the ball of luminous plasma is done in the visible, near-UV and near-infrared ranges, between 240 nm and 800 nm. The first initial laser testing of the ChemCam by Curiosity on Mars was performed on a rock, N165 (\\"Coronation\\" rock), near Bradbury Landing on August 19, 2012. The ChemCam team expects to take approximately one dozen compositional measurements of rocks per day. Using the same collection optics, the RMI provides context images of the LIBS analysis spots. The RMI resolves objects at distance, and has a field of view covering at that distance. = Navigation cameras (navcams) = First full-resolution Navcam images The rover has two pairs of black and white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to support ground navigation. The cameras have a 45° angle of view and use visible light to capture stereoscopic 3-D imagery. = Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) = REMS comprises instruments to measure the Mars environment: humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation. It is a meteorological package that includes an ultraviolet sensor provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. The investigative team is led by Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Spanish Astrobiology Center and includes the Finnish Meteorological Institute as a partner. All sensors are located around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, the Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) assembly located on the rover top deck, and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) inside the rover body. REMS provides new clues about the Martian general circulation, micro scale weather systems, local hydrological cycle, destructive potential of UV radiation, and subsurface habitability based on ground-atmosphere interaction. = Hazard avoidance cameras (hazcams) = The rover has four pairs of black and white navigation cameras called hazcams, two pairs in the front and two pairs in the back. They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and soils. Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time. The cameras use visible light to capture stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) imagery. The cameras have a 120° field of view and map the terrain at up to in front of the rover. This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices. = Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) = MAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and soil. MAHLI can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 14.5 micrometers per pixel. MAHLI has an focal length and a 33.8–38.5° field of view. MAHLI has both white and ultraviolet LED illumination for imaging in darkness or fluorescence imaging. MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimeter distances. This system can make some images with focus stacking processing. MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real time lossless predictive or JPEG compression. The calibration target for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration. = Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) = The APXS instrument irradiates samples with alpha particles and maps the spectra of X-rays that are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples. Curiosity APXS was developed by the Canadian Space Agency. MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA), the Canadian aerospace company that built the Canadarm and RADARSAT, were responsible for the engineering design and building of the APXS. The APXS science team includes members from the University of Guelph, the University of New Brunswick, the University of Western Ontario, NASA, the University of California, San Diego and Cornell University. The APXS instrument takes advantage of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and X-ray fluorescence, previously exploited by the Mars Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers. = Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) = X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil (Curiosity at Rocknest, October 17, 2012). CheMin is the Chemistry and Mineralogy X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence instrument. CheMin is one of four spectrometers. It can identify and quantify the abundance of the minerals on Mars. It was developed by David Blake at NASA Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award. The rover can drill samples from rocks and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument via a sample inlet tube on the top of the vehicle. A beam of X-rays is then directed at the powder and the crystal structure of the minerals deflects it at characteristic angles, allowing scientists to identify the minerals being analyzed. On October 17, 2012, at \\"Rocknest\\", the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the \\"weathered basaltic soils\\" of Hawaiian volcanoes. The paragonetic tephra from a Hawaiian cinder cone has been mined to create Martian regolith simulant for researchers to use since 1998. = Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) = The SAM instrument suite analyzes organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples. It consists of instruments developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA) (jointly operated by France's CNRS and Parisian universities), and Honeybee Robotics, along with many additional external partners. The three main instruments are a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), a gas chromatograph (GC) and a tunable laser spectrometer (TLS). These instruments perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin. = Dust Removal Tool (DRT) = The Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end of Curiosity arm. The DRT was first used on a rock target named Ekwir_1 on January 6, 2013. Honeybee Robotics built the DRT. = Radiation assessment detector (RAD) = The role of the RAD instrument is to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase and while on Mars. These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space. Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human explorers, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012. Funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and Germany's Space Agency (DLR), RAD was developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany. = Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) = The DAN instrument employs a neutron source and detector for measuring the quantity and depth of hydrogen or ice and water at or near the Martian surface. The instrument consists of the detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsing neutron generator (PNG). The die-away time of neutrons is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG. DAN was provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency and funded by Russia. = Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) = MARDI camera MARDI was fixed to the lower front left corner of the body of Curiosity. During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about to near from the ground, at a rate of four frames per second for about two minutes. MARDI has a pixel scale of at to at and has a 90° circular field of view. MARDI has eight gigabytes of internal buffer memory that is capable of storing over 4,000 raw images. MARDI imaging allowed the mapping of surrounding terrain and the location of landing. JunoCam, built for the Juno spacecraft, is based on MARDI. = Robotic arm = First drill tests (John Klein rock, Yellowknife Bay, February 2, 2013). The rover has a long robotic arm with a cross-shaped turret holding five devices that can spin through a 350° turning range. The arm makes use of three joints to extend it forward and to stow it again while driving. It has a mass of and its diameter, including the tools mounted on it, is about . It was designed, built, and tested by MDA US Systems, building upon their prior robotic arm work on the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander, the Phoenix lander, and the two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. Two of the five devices are in-situ or contact instruments known as the X-ray spectrometer (APXS), and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI camera). The remaining three are associated with sample acquisition and sample preparation functions: a percussion drill; a brush; and mechanisms for scooping, sieving, and portioning samples of powdered rock and soil. The diameter of the hole in a rock after drilling is and up to deep. The drill carries two spare bits. The rover's arm and turret system can place the APXS and MAHLI on their respective targets, and also obtain powdered sample from rock interiors, and deliver them to the SAM and CheMin analyzers inside the rover. Since early 2015 the percussive mechanism in the drill that helps chisel into rock has had an intermittent electrical short. On December 1, 2016, the motor inside the drill caused a malfunction that prevented the rover from moving its robotic arm and driving to another location. The fault was isolated to the drill feed brake, and internal debris is suspected of causing the problem. By December 9, driving and robotic arm operations were cleared to continue, but drilling remained suspended indefinitely. The Curiosity team continued to perform diagnostics and testing on the drill mechanism throughout 2017, and resumed drilling operations on May 22, 2018.  Media, cultural impact and legacy  Celebration erupts at NASA with the rover's successful landing on Mars (August 6, 2012). President Barack Obama congratulates NASA's Curiosity team (August 13, 2012). Live video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at NASA TV, during the late hours of August 6, 2012 PDT, including interviews with the mission team. The NASA website momentarily became unavailable from the overwhelming number of people visiting it, and a 13-minute NASA excerpt of the landings on its YouTube channel was halted an hour after the landing by an automated DMCA takedown notice from Scripps Local News, which prevented access for several hours. Around 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Times Square, to watch NASA's live broadcast of Curiosity landing, as footage was being shown on the giant screen. Bobak Ferdowsi, Flight Director for the landing, became an Internet meme and attained Twitter celebrity status, with 45,000 new followers subscribing to his Twitter account, due to his Mohawk hairstyle with yellow stars that he wore during the televised broadcast. On August 13, 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama, calling from aboard Air Force One to congratulate the Curiosity team, said, \\"You guys are examples of American know-how and ingenuity. It's really an amazing accomplishment.\\" (Video (07:20)) Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, California, viewed the CheMin instrument aboard Curiosity as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. CheMin directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of the artifact in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy. Prior to the landing, NASA and Microsoft released Mars Rover Landing, a free downloadable game on Xbox Live that uses Kinect to capture body motions, which allows users to simulate the landing sequence. NASA gave the general public the opportunity from 2009 until 2011 to submit their names to be sent to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into silicon using an electron-beam machine used for fabricating micro devices at JPL, and this plaque is now installed on the deck of Curiosity. In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden was also installed. Elsewhere on the rover is the autograph of Clara Ma, the 12-year-old girl from Kansas who gave Curiosity its name in an essay contest, writing in part that \\"curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives.\\" On August 6, 2013, Curiosity audibly played \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" in honor of the one Earth year mark of its Martian landing, the first time for a song to be played on another planet. This was also the first time music was transmitted between two planets. On June 24, 2014, Curiosity completed a Martian year—687 Earth days—after finding that Mars once had environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. Curiosity served as the basis for the design of the Perseverance rover for the Mars 2020 rover mission. Some spare parts from the build and ground test of Curiosity are being used in the new vehicle, but it will carry a different instrument payload. On August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity rover mission landing, and related exploratory accomplishments, on the planet Mars. (Videos: Curiosity First Five Years (02:07); Curiosity POV: Five Years Driving (05:49); Curiosity Discoveries About Gale Crater (02:54)) As reported in 2018, drill samples taken in 2015 uncovered organic molecules of benzene and propane in 3 billion year old rock samples in Gale.

He was \\"the leading patron of German theatre\\" in his lifetime,Wilhelm Kosch, \\"Seyler, Abel\\", in Dictionary of German Biography, eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, , p. 308 and is credited with introducing Shakespeare to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the Sturm und Drang playwrights, and German opera. Already in his lifetime, he was described as \\"one of German art's most meritorious men.\\" The son of a Basel Reformed priest, Seyler moved to London and then to Hamburg as a young adult, and established himself as a merchant banker in the 1750s. During the Seven Years' War and its immediate aftermath his bank Seyler & Tillemann engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with financial instruments and went spectacularly bankrupt with enormous debts in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763. A flamboyant bon vivant who was regarded with suspicion in Hamburg, Seyler symbolized a new and more aggressive form of capitalism. Seyler's admiration for the tragic actress Sophie Hensel (Seyler), who later became his second wife, led him to devote himself entirely to theatre from 1767 onwards. He used his remaining funds to become the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the idealistic Hamburg National Theatre, employing Lessing as the world's first dramaturg. In 1769, he founded the travelling Seyler Theatre Company, which became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and regarded as \\"the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\\"\\"Herzogin Anna Amalie von Weimar und ihr Theater,\\" in Robert Keil (ed.), Goethe's Tagebuch aus den Jahren 1776–1782, Veit, 1875, p. 69 He initially held the Hanoverian privilege as theatre director and his company later stayed for three years at the court of Duchess Anna Amalia in Weimar and for a year at the ducal court in Gotha. From 1779 to 1781 he was the founding artistic director of the Mannheim National Theatre. He commissioned works such as Sturm und Drang by Klinger (which gave its name to the era), Ariadne auf Naxos by Benda and Alceste by Schweitzer, considered \\"the first serious German opera.\\"Francien Markx, E. T. A. Hoffmann, Cosmopolitanism, and the Struggle for German Opera, p. 32, BRILL, 2015, Seyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, his patrician family and his former profession as a banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era in a profession that was just starting to gain respectability. Background and childhood His birthplace Liestal in Switzerland (1780) Abel Seyler was born in 1730 in Liestal outside Basel in Switzerland. He was the son of the Reformed clergyman, Dr.theol. Abel Seyler (Seiler) (the elder) (1684–1767), who was parish priest of Frenkendorf-Munzach in Liestal from 1714 to 1763, and Anna Katharina Burckhardt (1694–1773). He grew up in a learned and pious Reformed family and was descended on both his parents' sides from some of the most prominent patrician families of Basel. His mother belonged to the noted Burckhardt family.Johann Jakob Brodbeck, Geschichte der Stadt Liestal, A. Brodbeck, 1865 He was a paternal grandson of the theologian Friedrich Seyler and Elisabeth Socin, a member of an Italian-origined noble family, and he was named for his great-grandfather, the Basel judge and envoy to the French court Abel Socin (1632–1695). On his mother's side he was also descended from the Merian and Faesch families. He was also a matrilineal descendant of Justina Froben, daughter of the humanist Johann Froben. He had a sister, Elisabeth Seiler (1715–1798), married to parish priest Daniel Merian.Auszug Stamm Seiler in / aus Liestal, 2014 He was distantly related to Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Napoleon's uncle; they were both descended from the Basel silk merchant, politician and diplomat Johann Rudolf Faesch (died 1659), who was Burgomaster of Basel and led the city's pro-French faction. Seyler as a merchant banker Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann, Seyler's business associate who became a Danish statesman As a young man, Seyler left Basel first for London and then for Hamburg, where he was active as a merchant banker until 1766. With his business partners Johann Martin Tillemann and Edwin Müller, he founded the related companies Seyler & Tillemann and Müller & Seyler, which engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with financial instruments during the Seven Years' War in the 1750s and early 1760s. Seyler & Tillemann had close ties to the bank of the brothers De Neufville in Amsterdam, and has been considered one of the most speculative and immoral banks of the era. In 1761 Seyler & Tillemann, acting as agents for their close business associate Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann, leased the mint factory in Rethwisch from the impoverished Frederick Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Plön, a member of a cadet branch of the Danish royal family, to produce debased coins in the final years of the Seven Years' War. Seyler & Tillemann went bankrupt in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763 with 3–4 million Mark Banco in debts, an enormous sum. Mary Lindemann notes, citing the memoirs of John Parish: :When the Amsterdam house of De Neufville collapsed, so, too, tumbled Seyler & Tillemann. The common cause of the bankruptcies, from the giant De Neufville to less-famed partnerships like Seyler & Tillemann, lay, it was argued, in \\"an exaggerated trade in bills of exchange, in bill-jobbing, and—particularly—in the criminal \\"windy trade\\" that [such like] Seyler & Tillemann had engaged in.\\" The \\"wind trade\\" of these years—and the bankruptcies that resulted—shook the major commercial centers to the core, \\"and many a capitalist who sought to profit from the high discount rate and who changed his money into paper, was plucked bare.\\" Civil litigation relating to the bankruptcy was initiated in 1763, and the case reached the Imperial Cameral Tribunal two years later. Much criticism was directed at Seyler and Tillemann's business ethics and extravagant lifestyle. Lindemann argues: :[An] important case against several business partners reached the Imperial Cameral Tribunal (Reichskammergericht) in 1765. It offers an excellent perspective on \\"deceitful schemes\\" and especially on the bill- jobbing of two companies: Müller & Seyler and Seyler & Tillemann. Although the voices presented here are those of their creditors, the documents nonetheless reveal how contemporaries viewed the business practices of \\"malicious bankrupts\\" and how these practices assumed particularly baleful shapes in their minds. The creditors’ lawyers laid out the background to the case in considerable detail. Müller and Seyler were new men; Edwin Müller had come from Hanover several years before and Abel Seyler had been born in one of the Swiss cantons. Both had, however, \\"learned their business\\" and married in Hamburg.Seyler had in fact married in Hanover, although he either already lived in Hamburg or settled there shortly afterwards \\"If one could trust their books,\\" their actual starting capital amounted to no more than thirty-eight thousand Mk. Bco., \\"of which, however, well over half had been frittered away through the acquisition of furniture for two households, [for the purchase of] clothes, jewels, silver plate, and other needs for themselves, their wives, and their children, [and also for] carriages, horses, and so on.\\" Their business was undercapitalized from the beginning. In the 1750s, this seemed a minor problem because credit was easy to obtain. When the cash flow failed, they tried to acquire money quickly through bill-jobbing. Because their ready funds could not cover their expenses and debts, theirs became \\"the most audacious [form of] Windhandel.\\" As their business increased—as they took on ever more commissions in goods for import and export, invested in a sugar refinery, and lent money to several people—they simultaneously pursued their bill-jobbing and expanded it markedly. In 1757, they acquired a new partner, named Tillemann, who, however, contributed \\"not one Creutzer\\" to their capital, but that did not stop them from vigorously extending their business. Although their enterprises seemed to prosper in the late 1750s, they did so only \\"at the expense of others.\\"Mary Lindemann, \\"The Anxious Merchant, the Bold Speculator, and the Malicious Bankrupt: Doing Business in Eighteenth- Century Hamburg,\\" in Margaret C. Jacob and Catherine Secretan (eds.), The Self-Perception of Early Modern Capitalists, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009 Seyler was described as \\"a handsome bon vivant.\\"Robert Prölss, Kurzgefasste Geschichte der deutschen Schauspielkunst: von den Anfängen bis 1850 nach den Ergebnissen der heutigen Forschung, p. 194, F. A. Berger, 1900 Despite suffering \\"a sensational bankruptcy for an enormous sum [...] neither of them [Seyler and Tillemann] had lost his good humour or his taste for light living.\\"Karl Mantzius, A History of Theatrical Art in Ancient and Modern Times: The great actors of the eighteenth century, P. Smith, 1970, p. 112 Although they were wealthy bankers, Seyler and Tillemann were \\"in no way representatives of the Hamburg bourgeoisie, but were rather seen with suspicion for different reasons\\" by the local Hamburg elite.Michael Rüppel, \\"Nur zwei Jahre Theater, und alles ist zerrüttet\\": Bremer Theatergeschichte von den Anfängen bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts, p. 127, C. Winter, 1996 Seyler and his friends were self-made men, immigrants to Hamburg and showed little regard for the values and conventions of the conservative Hamburg bourgeoisie; they symbolized a new form of capitalism. Seyler as a theatre principal =Hamburg National Theatre (1767–1769)= His second wife Friederike Sophie Seyler, Germany's most famous actress of the late 18th century, painted by Anton Graff After the bankruptcy of his bank, Seyler devoted himself to theatre and became the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the Hamburg National Theatre,Felicia Hardison Londré, The History of World Theater: From the English Restoration to the Present, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, p. 146, an idealistic attempt to establish a national theatre based on the ideas of Ludvig Holberg. The theatre was owned by \\"a consortium of twelve businessmen of the city, with a triumvirate of Seyler, Bubbers and Johann Martin Tillemann, Seyler's business partner. But in practice, it was a one man affair, as Seyler dominated all.\\"George Freedley, John A. Reeves, A history of the theatre, p. 243, Crown Publishers, 1968 It leased the Comödienhaus building and was largely a successor institution of Konrad Ernst Ackermann's theatre company. The National Theatre employed Gotthold Ephraim Lessing as the world's first dramaturg, and attracted eminent actors such as Konrad Ekhof and Friedrich Ludwig Schröder; Germany's most famous actress of the late 18th century Friederike Sophie Hensel (Seyler), who later became Seyler's second wife, was the theatre's lead actress. She was regarded as \\"a very fine actress, as Lessing admitted, but she was a troublesome and tempestuous character,\\" always at the centre of intrigue.\\"Abel Seyler,\\" in Stanley Sadie (ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, vol. 17, p. 209, 1980 It was largely Seyler's admiration for Friederike Sophie Hensel, by then 29, that led him to devote himself to theatre; as a result of Hensel's rivalry with Karoline Schulze, she was at the centre of an intrigue that led her admirer Seyler to \\"establish a theatre for her, where she could reign undisputed without fearing any rivalry.\\"Susanne Kord: \\"Friederike Sophie Seyler. In Ein Blick hinter die Kulissen: Deutschsprachige Dramatikerinnen im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert (p. 312ff). Springer-Verlag, 2016 Karl Mantzius noted: :Seyler's admiration for the fine actress was easily transferred to the theatre in general, the theatre, that is, which formed a frame round his favourite. Thus a coalition of commerce, letters, and art was formed in which each party had his own personal interests, but which outwardly was working towards the sublime goal of abolishing the business-like leadership that was detrimental to true art.Karl Mantzius, A History of Theatrical Art in Ancient and Modern Times: The great actors of the eighteenth century, p. 112, P. Smith, 1970 Nominally Johann Friedrich Löwen served as theatre director, but he had little influence, as Seyler as main shareholder and head of a three-member \\"administrative committee\\" (Verwaltungsausschuß) took all managerial decisions while Ekhof in practice assumed the artistic leadership. The new Seyler regime suited Ekhof well, and he became a lifelong friend and collaborator of Seyler. The Hamburg National Theatre was immortalized by Lessing's influential book Hamburg Dramaturgy, a collection of essays that reflected on the Hamburg National Theatre's efforts, and which defined the field of dramaturgy and gave it its name. The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic was conceived by Löwen, and Seyler, \\"the power behind the throne,\\" at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.George Freedley, John A. Reeves, A history of the theatre, Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243 The theatre had to close after two years after Seyler had spent the rest of his fortune on it. =Seyler Theatre Company (1769–1779)= Seyler's long-time collaborator, the actor Konrad Ekhof, regarded as Germany's finest actor of the 18th century In 1769 Seyler founded the National Theatre's effective successor, the Seyler Theatre Company, together with Konrad Ekhof, Sophie Hensel and some other actors. The Seyler Company became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and was regarded as \\"the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\\" While the National Theatre had avoided musical theatre, Seyler appointed Anton Schweitzer as music director, charged with adding opera to the spoken repertory, and the Seyler Company came to play a major role both in the development of a German opera tradition and in the promotion and popularisation of the Sturm und Drang dramas. For most of its existence, the Seyler Company comprised around 60 members, and included an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. The company was one of the first theatre companies to maintain a permanent orchestra. Over the next ten years the company travelled extensively, and stayed for longer periods at several courts of Europe. Theatre companies of the era, especially travelling ones, thought of themselves as extended \\"families.\\" Hanover years (1769–1771) George III of Hanover and the United Kingdom contracted Seyler in 1769 with performing at Hanover and other cities of the Electorate of Hanover, appointing him as \\"Director of the Royal and Electoral German Court Actors,\\" a privilege he held until relinquishing it in 1772. During the Hanover years the company performed in Hanover itself and in Lüneburg, Celle, Osnabrück, Hildesheim und Wetzlar between September 1769 and October 1771. Initially the new company struggled and Seyler failed to replicate the old success of the Hamburg National Theatre. The lack of public interest in Hanover led to financial problems and when Ekhof in May 1770 also became seriously ill and unable to perform for some time, the situation worsened dramatically. Seyler's brother-in-law, the court pharmacist J.G.R. Andreae from Hanover, who also raised Seyler's children from his first marriage, saved the Seyler Company by the assumption of all debts before the impending ruin; Andreae however demanded that Ekhof replaced his brother-in-law as head of the company. At the court of Duchess Anna Amalia (1771–1774) Duchess Anna Amalia, noted patron of the arts, who invited Seyler and his company to her court in 1771 In 1771 the Seyler Company was invited to the ducal court in Weimar by Duchess Anna Amalia, the composer and noted patron of the arts, and Seyler again became the company's principal. They were warmly welcomed by Anna Amalia and her court in October 1771, and were generously paid; the company performed three times a week for select guests at the Weimar ducal court. In 1771 Anna Amalia was a 32-year old widow who reigned as regent on behalf of her young son. The Seyler Company's arrival in Weimar coincided with the infancy of the cultural era known as the Weimar Classicism, when the Duchess invited many of the most eminent men in Germany to her court in Weimar, including Herder, Goethe and Schiller. Adam Shoaff notes, :While in Weimar, the Seyler troupe established a reputation as one of the most formidable companies in Germany, thanks to its composer, Anton Schweitzer (1735–87); their leading soprano, Franziska Koch; [...] and two other talented singers, Josepha and Friedrich Hellmuth. Its production of Schweitzer’s Alceste (1773), with a libretto by Christoph Martin Wieland (1733–1813), marked a significant moment in German opera history: Alceste was the first full-length serious opera in German.Shoaff, Adam (2016), \\"Opera in Leipzig: From Strungk to Seyler,\\" in The Aesthetic Foundations of German Opera in Leipzig, 1766–1775, pp. 15–33, PhD dissertation in Musicology, University of Cincinnati In 1772 he reunited with his love interest Friederike Sophie Hensel, who had stayed at the Vienna Burgtheater for the past year, and they finally married in November 1772 in Oßmannstedt just outside Weimar. At the Gotha court (1774–1775) Seyler Company actress Esther Charlotte Brandes as Ariadne in Ariadne auf Naxos After the palace fire in Weimar in May 1774, Anna Amalia was forced to dismiss the Seyler Company, and they left with a quarter year's wages and a letter of recommendation to Duke Ernest II in Gotha. Seyler thus missed Goethe's arrival at the Weimar court a year later. The Seyler Company remained for one year at the ducal court in Gotha, where Seyler and other of the troupe's members also involved themselves in the broader cultural and social life, and in freemasonry. In Gotha Seyler met the Bohemian composer Georg Anton Benda and commissioned him to write several successful operas, including Ariadne auf Naxos, Medea and Pygmalion. At its debut in 1775, Ariadne auf Naxos received enthusiastic reviews in Germany and afterwards, in the whole of Europe, with music critics calling attention to its originality, sweetness, and ingenious execution. It is widely considered Benda's best work, and inspired Mozart. Leipzig and Dresden (1775–1777) In 1775 Seyler received the Electoral Saxon privilege as theatre director and performed in Leipzig and Dresden, and in 1776 he opened a newly built summer theatre in Dresden. In 1776 Seyler also employed Goethe's close friend Friedrich Maximilian Klinger as a playwright and secretary, and he remained with the company for two years. Klinger had followed Goethe to Weimar earlier in the same year, and at the time he joined the Seyler Company he had just broken with Goethe under unclear circumstances. He brought with him the manuscript of his recently finished play Sturm und Drang, which was first performed by the Seyler Company on 1 April 1777 in Leipzig; the play gave its name to the artistic movement Sturm und Drang. On the road again (1777–1779) In 1777 Seyler relinquished the Electoral Saxon privilege and his company took to the road again. Over the next two years the Seyler Company was primarily based in Frankfurt and Mainz and travelled extensively to Cologne, Hanau, Mannheim, Heidelberg and Bonn. He is regarded as the father of theatrical life in Frankfurt.Heinrich Leopold Wagner, Briefe die Seylerische Schauspielergesellschaft und Ihre Vorstellungen zu Frankfurt am Mayn betreffend, 1777 =Mannheim National Theatre (1779–1781)= The courtier Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg, Seyler's collaborator during the Mannheim years When Charles Theodore, the Prince-Elector of the Electoral Palatinate, additionally became the Duke of Bavaria in 1777, he moved his court from the Palatine capital of Mannheim to Munich and brought the theatre company of Theobald Marchand with him. In 1778 he instructed the courtier Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg—the brother of Prince-Elector and Grand Duke Karl Theodor von Dalberg—to establish a new theatre in Mannheim. At first Dalberg contracted Abel Seyler's theatre company with performing in Mannheim on an occasional basis from 1778 to 1779. In the autumn of 1779 Seyler moved permanently to Mannheim with the remaining members of his theatre company. Several actors who had been affiliated with the Gotha Court Theatre under Konrad Ekhof's direction in the past few years—essentially an offshoot of the Seyler Theatre Company—also joined him; Ekhof himself had died the previous year. The Mannheim National Theatre opened in October 1779 with Seyler as its first artistic directorHis formal title was Direktor, but he was also referred to as Regisseur and Dalberg as its general administrator.Intendant Some of the actors who worked under Seyler's direction at Mannheim were August Wilhelm Iffland, Johann David Beil and Heinrich Beck.Jahrbuch der deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft, vol. 9 (1874), pp. 296–297 At Mannheim Seyler directed several Shakespeare productions, and left a lasting legacy. His \\"repertoire in the early Mannheim years still shows the influence of his Hamburg period as well as the legacy of the Weimar/Gotha years.\\"Lesley Sharpe, A National Repertoire: Schiller, Iffland and the German Stage, p. 50ff, Peter Lang, 2007 In cooperation with Dalberg he developed the theatre's characteristic style, based on a belief in the need to achieve a balance between a more natural style of playing and a certain nobility and idealisation.Schiller: A Birmingham Symposium, p. 37, 2006 He was forced to leave his position as director of the Mannheim National Theatre in 1781, \\"after his wife's jealousy had provoked an unfortunate incident;\\" during a quarrel with his wife's \\"scheming\\"Alfried Wieczorek, Hansjörg Probst, Wieland Koenig, Lebenslust und Frömmigkeit, p. 407, Verlag Friedrich Pustet, 1999 student, the 20-year old actress Elisabeth Toscani, the usually level-headed Seyler lost his temper and gave her a slap in the face in response to repeated insolent remarks during theatre rehearsals. A report commissioned by Dalberg noted that Toscani belonged to \\"the weaker sex\\" and that Seyler was the director of a theatre company and should be held to a higher standard. In order to \\"restore the peace\\" of the theatre Dalberg decided to retire Seyler with a pension.Wilhelm Koffka, \\" Der Seyler-Toscani'sche Streit (1781),\\" in Iffland und Dalberg: Geschichte der classischen Theaterzeit Mannheims, p. 538ff, Weber 1865 The first performance of Friedrich Schiller's The Robbers—itself inspired by the play Julius of Taranto by Seyler's son-in-law Johann Anton Leisewitz—took place at the Mannheim National Theatre the year after Seyler left as director. =Final years (1781–1800)= Huon and Amanda (or Oberon), a primary influence on the plot and characters of The Magic Flute From 1781 to 1783 Seyler was artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre, which also performed in Flensburg, Husum and Kiel. In 1783 he established his own troupe based in Altona near Hamburg. From 1 September 1783 to Easter 1784 he was again director of the Comödienhaus theatre in Hamburg; he continued to live in Hamburg until 1787 and was at times a prompter at the theatre, where his wife performed under the direction of Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. From 1787 to 1792 he was again artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre. His wife Sophie Seyler died in 1789. Earlier in that year she had published the romantic Singspiel or opera Huon and Amanda (or Oberon), based on a poem by their friend and collaborator Christoph Martin Wieland. The play, with original music by Carl Hanke, became a success in Hamburg; Hanke had been recruited by Abel Seyler as music director at the Comödienhaus in Hamburg in 1783. A lightly adapted version of Seyler's operaPeter Branscombe, W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberflöte, Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 28 with new music by Paul Wranitzky became the first opera performed by Emanuel Schikaneder's troupe at the Theater auf der Wieden, and established a tradition within Schikaneder's company of fairy-tale operas that was to culminate two years later in Mozart's and Schikaneder's opera The Magic Flute; Sophie Seyler's Oberon is regarded as one of the primary influences on the plot and characters of The Magic Flute.Buch, David (2008) Magic flutes & enchanted forests: the supernatural in eighteenth-century musical theater (p. 293). University of Chicago Press. . In 1792 Abel Seyler retired with a pension from Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel, the royal governor of the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein. From 1798 he lived as a guest on the estate of the actor, his long-time friend and fellow prominent freemason Friedrich Ludwig Schröder in Rellingen in the Duchy of Holstein, where he died on 25 April 1800 at the age of 69. He was interred in Rellingen on 1 May 1800.Friedrich Ludwig Wilhelm Meyer, Friedrich Ludwig Schröder: Beitrag zur Kunde des Menschen und des Künstlers, vol. 2, p. 215, Hoffmann und Campe, 1819Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Kieler Stadtgeschichte, Issues 33–34, Die Gesellschaft, 1926, p. 78 =Legacy= Seyler is widely regarded as one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe and has been described as \\"the leading patron of German theatre\\" in his lifetime. He is credited with introducing Shakespeare to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the Sturm und Drang playwrights, and the development of a serious German opera tradition. Already in his lifetime, he was described as \\"one of German art's most meritorious men.\\" He was lauded by contemporaries such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Christoph Martin Wieland, who described him as a \\"man of perception and insight.\\"Der Teutsche Merkur, 1773, I, p. 269. After his death his daughter Sophie Leisewitz, the wife of the poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, wrote: \\"It was my happy fortune, out of childish duty, to worship the man whom thousands can only admire.\\"Paul Schlenther: \\"Abel Seyler.\\" In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB). Vol. 34, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1892, pp. 778–782. Seyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, his patrician family and his former profession as a merchant banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era, in a profession that was just starting to gain respectability. John Warrack noted that: :The success of Abel Seyler's company in the post-war years was rooted in his business acumen, coupled with a flair for attracting talent, but he would not have flourished without the greater respect beginning to be accorded the travelling theatre companies in the new climate of interest in drama and hence in dramatic music.John Warrack, German Opera: From the Beginnings to Wagner (p. 93), Cambridge University Press, 2001, Knud Lyne Rahbek highlighted the fact that while he had never been an actor himself, he demonstrated a great enthusiasm for and refined knowledge of the arts.Klaus Ulrich Ebmeyer, Theater in der empfindsamen Zeit: Leben und Reisen des Knud Lyne Rahbek; ein Beitrag zur Schauspielkunst des 18. Jahrhunderts (p. 35), Christian-Verlag, 1958 The actor August Wilhelm Iffland who worked under Seyler's direction said: :His experience, his knowledge guided and shaped many artists. We learned much from his directing, his fine, conscientious, honest but never bitter criticism. Unwavering was his place between the proscenium and the first coulisse. It was praise, encouragement, reward seeing him there, a warning censure when he pocketed his lorgnette, a punishment when he left his place. His theatrical legacy eventually overshadowed the dubious reputation he had earned as a banker in his younger years. Freemasonry Like many of his collaborators, Seyler was a freemason. He joined freemasonry in London in 1753,Weiblichkeitsentwürfe und Frauen im Werk Lessings: Aufklärung und Gegenaufklärung bis 1800 : 35. und 36. Kamenzer Lessing-Tage 1996 und 1997, Lessing-Museum, 1997 became a member of the Absalom lodge in Hamburg in May 1755,Manfred Steffens, Freimaurer in Deutschland: Bilanz eines Vierteljahrtausends, p. 582, C. Wolff, 1964 and was involved with freemasonry until his death. Abel Seyler and Konrad Ekhof, along with other members of the Seyler Company, founded the first masonic lodge in Gotha. The founding took place on 25 June 1774 in the Gasthof Zum Mohren, on the occasion of the Nativity of St John the Baptist, and Ekhof became the first Worshipful Master and Seyler the First Warden. The lodge was originally named Cosmopolit, but was renamed Zum Rautenkranz in honour of the ducal family shortly after. Its members included several members of the Seyler Company, such as Seyler, Ekhof and the composer Georg Anton Benda; the reigning Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha- Altenburg and the Duke's brother, Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg joined shortly after its establishment, as did many members of the nobility and local elite of Gotha. The lodge became a centre of the spiritual and cultural life of Gotha, and a stronghold of enlightenment and philanthropy. Many members of Seyler's lodge, notably the Duke and his brother, also became members of the Illuminati, and the Duke later offered that society's founder Adam Weishaupt asylum in Gotha. Personal life L.E. Seyler; in contrast to his father he became a highly respected banker Abel Seyler was married in his first marriage from 1754 to Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730–1764), the daughter of the wealthy Hanoverian court pharmacist Leopold Andreae (1686–1730) and Katharina Elisabeth Rosenhagen (died 1752). Her parents were already deceased and her only close relative was her older brother and only sibling, the court pharmacist J.G.R. Andreae, who became a noted Enlightenment natural scientist. The wedding took place in Hanover and Abel and Sophie Elisabeth had two sons and a daughter: Abel Seyler (the Younger), who became court pharmacist in Celle and who was a member of the Illuminati; L.E. Seyler, a prominent Hamburg banker and politician; and Sophie Seyler, who married the Sturm und Drang poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, the author of Julius of Taranto. After the death of his first wife in 1764, their children were raised in Hanover by their maternal uncle. By several accounts J.G.R. Andreae was a highly erudite, generous and kind man who became a loving father figure to his sister's children; he had no children of his own.

The Telegraph described him as \\"one of the most influential naval strategic thinkers of the last half-century\\". During the Second World War he served as an officer in the British Army.  Career  Born in November 1920, Cable was the son of a member of the Consular Service. He was educated at Stowe School in Stowe, Buckinghamshire. After Stowe, Cable went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge to read modern languages. After graduating he was called up to the British Army in 1941 to serve in the Second World War. Following officer training he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals on 18 October 1942, and rose to the rank of major before joining the Diplomatic Service in 1947, his appointment was confirmed with effect from 18 November 1948, although he did not relinquish his army commission until 28 October 1953, when he was granted the honorary rank of major. His position took him to Indonesia during the Independence War. Then, Cable went to Helsinki where he met his wife Viveca Hollmerus (1920 – 2004). After that, he left Helsinki for Budapest, he was expelled in 1959, as a reprisal for the expulsion of a Hungarian diplomat from London. Cable was then appointed Consul in Quito, Ecuador, on 28 July 1959. He subsequently served in the Middle-East and as head of the Foreign Office South-East Asia Department for two years. In the 1967 New Year Honours he was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for his work as Counsellor at the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. In late 1960s, he published his maiden work, British foreign policy and international relations. Then Cable took a year's sabbatical, during which he finished his second work, Gunboat Diplomacy. He also received a doctorate that year. Cable became the head of the FCO's Planning Staff from 1971 to 1975, and was then briefly Assistant Under- Secretary of State, before returning to Helsinki as Ambassador from 1 October 1975 until his retirement in 1980. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 28 May 1976. He continued to write after quitting the FCO, and published several works, including The Political Influence of Naval Force in History (1998), The Royal Navy and the Siege of Bilbao (1979), Britain's Naval Future (1983), Diplomacy at Sea (1985) and Navies in Violent Peace (1989). Cable died on 27 September 2001, aged 80. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. Cable and his wife, Viveca had a son, Charles.  Gunboat diplomacy  Cable defined gunboat diplomacy as \\"the use or threat of limited naval force, otherwise than as an act of war, in order to secure advantage or to avert loss, either in the furtherance of an international dispute or else against foreign nationals within the territory or the jurisdiction of their own state\\". He divided the examples of gunboat diplomacy into four categories: definitive, purposeful, catalytic and expressive. All of them are tools of diplomacy. Cable start a revival of naval strategic thought, and had a great influence on Post-Cold War naval thinking, especially in United Kingdom and United States.

Definition Especially dangerous industrial object (EIO) – is the industry where different kinds of emergency situations (incidents) are possible. Different incidents and disasters at industry may have significant consequences and multiple aspects of harm: * For health and life of humans (the system of labor protection is responsible for this sphere); * For property of organizations engaged into EIO; * For the environment that relates to the sphere of ecological safety. In Russia the sphere of industrial safety deals with the issues of technological security, safety engineering and control of using dangerous materials. According to the Russian legislation EIO may be presented by an enterprise, its separate department, a ground. The peculiarities of EIO are as follows: * Receiving or turnover (i.e. performing of different procedures and operations) with dangerous materials; * Using at an object of stationary load lifting mechanisms as well as rope roads, funiculars or escalators; * Performing mountain operations; * Performing underground operations, performing enrichment works with natural resources; * Using the equipment, having the heating temperature over 115 Celsius.; * Using the equipment under the pressure over 0.07 MPa; * Using melted color and black metals. The legislation gives the characteristics of what materials may be related to dangerous materials: * * toxic; * flammable; * explosive; * combustible; * highly toxic; * oxidizing; * materials, harmful for environment. Registration of especially dangerous objects In order that EIO could operate legally, it is mandatory to draw up a number of permissive documents. For each EIO the organization itself performs identification of a dangerous industrial object. The given procedure and its results are used by the state registration of object in the special registry and by the mandatory signing of insurance contracts for EIO. The registration bodies, i.e. territorial branches of the Rostechnadzor keep the State Registry. Besides, each EIO must have drawn up license of the Rostechnadzor. The EIO license proves that the exploited object conforms to the requirements of industrial safety. Only having of the License of the Rostechnadzor for EIO may give the right to the owner to introduce into exploitation a dangerous industrial object. It is the next step after registration of EIO in the State Registry. By this different kinds of licenses depending on the characteristics of the EIO may be considered: The license of chemical dangerous objects; The license of explosive and fire dangerous objects; The license for performing expertise of industrial safety The Rostechnadzor Permit The permit for constructing and using the technical devices for the EIOs registered in the State Registry are drawn up by the Federal Service of technological and atomic control and such kind of a document is called the Rostechndazor Permit for application. The spheres of powers for drawing up the Rostechnadzor Permits are divided among the territorial bodies and the central apparatus of the Federal Service by Act 632 on 17 September 2007. The Central Apparatus issues the Permit of the Rostechnadzor for the serial production and imported equipment. The territorial bodies of the Service draw up the Permits for the party or the separate bit of equipment. The Rostechnadzor Permit is regulated by the Administrative Reglament of the Service introduced by Act 112 on 29 February 2008. Appendix 2 of the given Reglament provides the certain kinds of technical devices for which it is necessary to have the Rostechnadzor Permit drawn up in the Central Apparatus and the equipment for construction of which at EIO it is possible to draw up the permissive document in local bodies of the Rostechnadzor. Act 112 provides the signs according to which an industrial object is related to a dangerous industrial object. When drawing up the Rostechnadzor Permit for Application of an imported device, much attention is paid to the fact that the imported equipment meets the requirements of industrial safety of the RF. In the case of non-conformity, the applicant must additionally present recommendations for measurements that will provide the normative level of safety. Such measurements including the program of tests may contain additional tests of samples of imported production, alterations introduced into technical documentation, additional obligatory calculations and other measures. There is a number of certain requirements to the package of documents that the applicant must present for drawing up the Rostechnadzor Permit. The mandatory things are industrial expertise and its conclusion. It presents the process of evaluating the conformity of the object to the requirements of industrial safety which are set depending on the type of the object. The industrial expertise is performed in the authorized laboratory in accordance with the kind of control listed in the Attestation of Authorization. These may be the following directions: * Systems of gas consumption and distribution; * Cox-chemical and metallurgic productions and objects; * Object of oil-processing and oil-chemic industry ; * Chemically dangerous objects; * Objects of oil and gas extracting; * Explosive objects used for plant raw materials; * Objects of non-mine and mine industry; * Heating devices and networks; * Objects of transporting of dangerous materials; * Objects of boiler control; * Lifting constructions; * Objects of highway pipe transport; * Explosive and flammable objects, * Equipment operating under pressure. The term of the Rostechnadzor Permit by serial production of technical devices is 5 years. If a manufacturer acts as an applicant so the Rostechnadzor Permit is valid for any quantity of production correspondingly manufactured on the territory of Russia If the applicant for receiving the Rostechnadzor Permit is the exploiting organization, i.e. it draws up the document for the party or one-time technical device, the term of the Permit is set equal to the resource of exploitation. When the Permit is drawn up, it must be introduced into exploitation within 3 years.

He started scientific research on yoga in 1920, and published the first scientific journal specifically devoted to studying yoga, Yoga Mimamsa, in 1924. Most of his research took place at the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center at Lonavla which he founded in 1924. His influence on the development of yoga as exercise has been \\"profound\\".  Early life  Swami Kuvalayananda was born Jagannatha Ganesa Gune in a traditional Karhade Brahmin family in the village Dhaboi in Gujarat state, India. Kuvalayananda’s father, Sri Ganesa Gune, was a teacher and his mother, Srimati Saraswati, a housewife. The family was not rich and had to depend for some time on public and private charity. Being from a poor family, Kuvalayananda had to struggle hard for his education. Nevertheless, at his matriculation in 1903, he was awarded the Jagannath Shankarsheth Sanskrit Scholarship to study at Baroda College where he graduated in 1910. During his student days, he was influenced by political leaders like Sri Aurobindo, who was working as a young lecturer at the university, and Lokmanya Tilak's Indian Home Rule Movement. His national idealism and patriotic fervor prompted him to devote his life to the service of humanity. During this time, he took up a vow of lifelong celibacy. Coming into contact with the Indian masses, many of whom were illiterate and superstitious, he realized the value of education, and this influenced him to help organize the Khandesh Education Society at Amalner, where ultimately he became the Principal of the National College, in 1916. The National College was closed down by the British Government in 1920 due to the spirit of Indian nationalism prevalent at the institution. From 1916 to 1923, he taught Indian culture studies to high school and college students.  Yoga education  Paramahamsa Madhavdas Kuvalayananda's first guru was Rajaratna Manikrao, a professor at the Jummadada Vyayamshala in Baroda. From 1907 to 1910, Manikrao trained Kuvalayananda in the Indian System of Physical Education which Kuvalayananda advocated throughout his life. As early as the 1930s, Kuvalayananda trained large groups of yoga teachers as a way to spread physical education in India. In 1919, he met the Bengali yogin, Paramahamsa Madhavdas, who had settled at Malsar, near Baroda, on the banks of the Narmada river. The insight into Yogic discipline, under Madhavdasji's guidance, greatly affected Kuvalayananda's career. He became a pioneer of a new style of yoga influenced by physical culture. Though Kuvalayananda was spiritually inclined and idealistic, he was, at the same time, a strict rationalist. So, he sought scientific explanations for the various psychophysical effects of Yoga he experienced. In 1920–21, he investigated the effects of the Yogic practices of uddiyana bandha and nauli on the human body with the help of some of his students in a laboratory at the State Hospital, Baroda. His subjective experience, coupled with the results of these scientific experiments, convinced him that the ancient system of Yoga, if understood through the modern scientific experimental system, could help society. The idea of discovering the scientific basis behind these yogic processes became his life's work.  Medical research on yoga at Kaivalyadhama  \\"Pure, objective science .. deployed as the handmaiden of spirituality\\": Kuvalayananda watching an experiment on oxygen consumption in yogic practice at his Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center, Lonavla In 1924, Kuvalayananda founded the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center in Lonavla, Maharashtra, to provide a laboratory for his scientific study of Yoga. In the anthropologist Joseph Alter's words, \\"what he himself had to prove was that this truth [of classical yoga] was based on natural laws and universal principles. In some sense, pure, objective science was to be deployed as the handmaiden of spirituality and orthodox philosophy so as to establish what came to be the theme of his life's work\\". His research agenda, although covering a variety of yogic practices (which he divided into asana (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), and other practices, namely kriyas, mudras, and bandhas), resulted in a detailed study of the physiology involved during each such practice. So, for example, Kaivalyadhama measured the consumption of oxygen of yogins seated cross-legged and practising pranayama; Kuvalayananda explained that while \\"the westerner\\" saw deep breathing as useful for providing oxygen, \\"With us the oxygen value of pranayama is subordinate. We prize it more for its usefulness in nerve culture.\\" Alter notes that although these experiments ranged over a wide variety of types of measurement—including oxygen consumption, systolic pressure, heart rate, adrenocortical activity, cardiovascular endurance, fibrinolytic activity of the blood, psycho-motor performance, dexterity, serum cholesterol, asthma, obesity, cancer, diabetes, sinusitis, anxiety, urinary pH, lymphocytes and stomach acidity—all of these were \\"regarded as epiphenomenal in their relationship to the real object of study—the phenomenal meta-material power inherent in Yoga.\\" These experiments impressed some Western researchers who came to the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center to learn more. Dr. Josephine Rathbone, a professor of health and physical education, visited from Columbia University in 1937 to 1938. K.T. Behanan, a doctoral candidate from Yale University, wrote his dissertation on yoga after visiting in the late 1931, and staying for a year. In 1957, the physicians Wenger, from the University of California, and Bagchi, from the University of Michigan, spent a month and a half working there. Research and collaboration continues to this day.  Yoga Mimamsa  At the same time as founding his research institute at Lonavla, Kuvalayananda started the first journal devoted to scientific investigation into yoga, Yoga Mimamsa. The journal has been published quarterly every year since its founding and was scheduled to be indexed by EBSCO in 2012. It has covered experiments on the effects of asanas, kriyas, bandhas, and pranayama on humans. Later years Swami Kuvalayananda on a 2019 stamp of India Besides his yoga research, Swami Kuvalayananda was a tireless promoter of his causes, and he spent much of his later years opening up new branches of Kaivalyadhama and enhancing the main Kaivalyadhama campus in Lonavla. In 1932, he opened the Mumbai branch of Kaivalyadhama at Santacruz. It was relocated to Marine Drive (Chowpatty) in 1936, and named the Ishvardas Chunnilal Yogic Health Center. Its mandate is the prevention and cure of various diseases through Yoga. In this same period, at Kanakesvara near Alibaug, a Kaivalyadhama Spiritual Center in Colaba was opened. In 1943, he opened another branch of Kaivalyadhama in Rajkot, Saurashtra, with spiritual practices as its main focus. The Gordhandas Seksaria College of Yoga and Cultural Synthesis was established in 1951 at Lonavla to prepare young people spiritually and intellectually for selfless service to humanity. In 1961, he opened the Srimati Amolak Devi Tirathram Gupta Yogic Hospital for the treatment of chronic functional disorders with the help of Yogic techniques. Some of his pupils, like Krishnamacharya and the Padma Shri awardee, S. P. Nimbalkar, became known yoga teachers in their own rights.

The phrase \\"palad khik\\" means \\"honorable surrogate penis\\". These amulets range from a few inches to several feet long in length. The smaller versions are usually worn on the body while the larger versions are displayed in shops and other establishments. Origin Palad Khik originated in India and relate to the Hindu god Shiva, who is usually represented by Shiva Linga. They were brought to Southeast Asia via the Cham people and remained in the region ever since. The Chinese concept called Yang is similar, where Shiva is represented abstractly in the form of Linga (male genitalia). Sometimes the linga are accompanied by Yoni (female genitalia). Together, the linga and yoni symbolize unity and the powers of creation and destruction. The Palad Khik, as a phallic representation of Shiva, is also an animistic symbol of fertility. It is not uncommon in Thailand to see a penis amulet hanging on a convenience store or a restaurant, or even being sold by old women on the street. Although outsiders may regard these as offensive, ordinary Thais are deeply superstitious and lucky charms and talismans are still regarded as important. Palad Khik can be made from wood, metal, bone, horn or ivory, and they are created by monks who specialize in them. Engraving the sacred inscriptions is an important ritual and can take many days to complete. Cast metal palad khiks do not always have these inscriptions, but they may have animal symbols. Palad khik amulets must be empowered by the repetition of incantations, which Thais call 'Kata Bucha', derived from the Devanagari 'ghata pooja'. The incantations depend on the creator's lineage in each school of traditional non-Buddhist animist magic. Kata Bucha Palad Khik would commonly be a four syllable heart Mantra (Kata Hua Jai), such as 'Ganha Neha' and 'Na Ma Pa Ta', or, 'Ja Pa Ga Sa' Variations of use and purpose Palad Khiks are usually worn by males on a cord around their waist under the clothes and off-center from the real penis. It is not unusual for a male to wear many palad khiks at the same time, in the hope to attract women, increase gambling luck and protection from dangerous objects such as bullets and knives. At times, women in Thailand also carry it in their purses to protect them from rape and mugging. Shop owners display them in their shops or in the cash register area to protect their business and also bring good luck and sales. A notable feature of this type of amulet is it can be worn in places considered as lowly or unclean such as bars, gambling casinos and brothels. Normally, you cannot bring a Buddhist amulet inside such establishments.

The North Mole, with the rest of harbour, is just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The breakwater was formerly known as the Commercial Mole, and is the site of the commercial port in the harbour. It was the consequence of a late nineteenth century plan by the British Admiralty to create a modern dockyard and large defensive harbour in Gibraltar. Infrastructure The North Mole at Gibraltar Harbour (pictured), in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, is one of a trio of breakwaters (shown on map) that provides protection to the harbour, in addition to that which results from the presence of the Rock of Gibraltar on its east side. The North Mole is positioned at the northern and western aspects of the northern section of the harbour, which is located just north of the east entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The L-shaped breakwater includes a Western Arm which runs south toward the Detached Mole, and measures in length. The northern section of the harbour features the commercial port, which has a total length of almost of quay on the North Mole (including its Western Arm) for cruise ships, cargo handling, and bunkering. Fifteen berths are available, including six on the Western Arm and two on an extension jetty. The south end of the Western Arm of the North Mole, its \\"D\\" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar North Mole Lighthouse (location shown on map). The black, octagonal, latticework tower is constructed of cast-iron. Its light characteristic is a quick, flashing red light, and it has a range of five nautical miles. The Elbow of the North Mole, its \\"E\\" Head, is the site of the Gibraltar North Mole Elbow Lighthouse. The gray, square, skeletal tower includes a round harbour control room. The light characteristic is a fixed red light, with a range of five nautical miles. Both lighthouses are operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. Early history Bay of Gibraltar 1750 includes Gibraltar Harbour with Old Mole and short New Mole. The North Mole was formerly known as the Commercial Mole. It was a late nineteenth and early twentieth century extension of the Old Mole (shown on map), which was begun in 1618, and its extension, Devil's Tongue Battery, which was constructed between 1779 and 1783. By 1895, the government had drawn up plans to modernize Gibraltar Harbour. They included construction of a dry dock at the New Mole Parade, which had been built in 1620. The 1895 plan also included enclosing Gibraltar Harbour by extending the New Mole (shown on map) and constructing a Detached Mole. At that time, the method of enclosing the northern end of the harbour had not yet been decided and was a matter of some controversy. The extensive changes to Gibraltar Harbour were largely financed through Britain's Naval Works Loan Act of 1895 and following years. The plan that met with final approval of the Admiralty included construction of a dockyard and a modern defensive harbour, safe from torpedo attack. The Commercial Mole was an integral component of that defensive harbour as it formed its northern boundary, and was also planned to serve the commercial needs of Gibraltar. Some of the cost of that breakwater was shouldered by the colony of Gibraltar. The Commercial Mole was constructed of rubble stone and extended west from the area of the Waterport Wharf, Old Mole, and Devil's Tongue. The breakwater included five jetties which extended north and south; it ended in the Western Arm which paralleled the jetties. The jetties and Western Arm were lined with a concrete wharf wall. By 1902, much of the construction of the new Gibraltar Harbour had been completed, although portions were still under construction, including the extension of the New Mole. While the Commercial Mole was intended to facilitate Gibraltar commerce, by 1911 it was primarily utilised by the navy as a quay for destroyers. Recent history Oil Sullage Tank continues burning through the night On the afternoon of 31 May 2011, the North Mole at Gibraltar Harbour was the site of an explosion involving an oil storage tank. Two workers had been welding on top of the tank. In addition to injuries sustained by the workers, one of whom was extensively burned, there were also injuries suffered by twelve passengers on the cruise ship MS Independence of the Seas, which had been berthed at the North Mole. An adjacent tank caught fire that evening, which required evacuation of the land- based fire fighters, limiting access to the fire from the sea. Following the fire, concern was expressed about the availability of adequate supplies of fire-fighting foam prior to the blaze at the North Mole. On 8 June 2012, a bunkering accident off the North Mole resulted in an oil spill, with the release of three tons of fuel into the sea. The refueling operation had involved the ship Frio Dolphin and the bunker tanker Vemaoil XX. The Gibraltar Oil Spill Contingency Plan was activated and, by the following day, most of the spilled oil had been contained.

Early life Malvasia was born in 1603 to an aristocratic family of Bologna and was the cousin of Carlo Cesare Malvasia.Malvasia's Life of the Caracci by Carlo Cesare Malvasia (conte) & Anne Summerscale (Reprint - Penn State Press, 2000) Military career During the Wars of Castro he led papal army cavalry against the Dukes of Parma. He became close to the nephews of Pope Urban VIII and his later correspondence and publications carried the Barberini crest; three bees. His cousin Carlo later received assistance, in Rome, from Barberini loyalist, Cardinal Marzio Ginetti. Despite the Duchy of Modena having sided with the Dukes of Parma during the Wars of Castro, Malvasia later became a military advisor to Alfonso IV d'Este, Duke of Modena. He was later named Marechal of the French army in Italy while Francesco II d'Este (later Duke of Modena after his father) was General of that army. In 1656 he visited Paris and received honours from King Louis XIV of France - a 400 doppie annual pension for his position of Marechal and a gift of a diamond bottoniera from Cardinal Mazarin. Patron of astronomy Throughout his military career, Malvasia maintained a strong general interest in astronomy, optics and scientific engineering. He is credited with having contributed to the invention of the reticle or \\"cross-hairs\\" during the 1620s; final credit is usually ascribed to Robert Hooke.Note: Accounts of Malvasia's work include a description of an early reticle - silver strands crossed at right-angles to separated fields of view when looking through a telescope. Malvasia was elected a Senator of Bologna and began construction of the privately owned Panzano Observatory in the early 1640s.Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers by Virginia Trimble, Thomas Williams, Katherine Bracher, Richard Jarrell, Jordan D. Marché and F. Jamil Ragep (Springer Reference, 20/11/2007) In 1645 Malvasia invited Giovanni Domenico Cassini to Bologna and offered him a position in his observatory, which was close to completion. Most of their time was spent calculating newer, better, and more accurate ephemerides for astrological purposes using the rapidly advancing astronomical methods and tools of the day.Rodolfo Calanca: L'astronomia nel ducato estense tra il XVII ed il XIX secolo (Astronomy in the duchy of Este between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century) 17 years later, in 1662, their collaborative work, Ephemerides novissimae motuum coelestium, was published by Malvasia. It was dedicated to Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti - twice nominated by Antonio Barberini as the French candidate for popeNote: at the papal conclave, 1644 and the papal conclave, 1655. \\\\- and included a rather laudatory dedication in which Malvasia claimed he could trace Sacchetti's ancestry back to Ancient Roman gods.Ave Papa/Ave Papabile: the Sacchetti family, their art patronage, and political aspirations by Lilian H.

He worked on several flight projects including Galileo, Cassini, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). He was the lead engineer of the Mars Science Laboratory EDL phase (Entry, Descent and Landing), and helped design, build and test the sky crane landing system. The media has portrayed Steltzner as a \\"rock and roll\\" engineer. NPR's Morning Edition said \\"he has pierced ears, wears snakeskin boots and sports an Elvis haircut,\\" while the EE Times called him \\"a bit of a hipster\\" and a \\"new breed of engineer\\" who is media savvy. Personal life Steltzner, born 1963, is a native of the San Francisco Bay Area and came from a family that was financially well off, his father being the heir to the Schilling spice fortune. He struggled in classes in high school, earned a failing grade in geometry, and was told by his father he would never amount to anything but a ditch digger. \\"I was sort of studying sex, drugs and rock and roll in high school,\\" says Steltzner. After high school he played bass and drums in new wave bands. He studied jazz at Berklee College of Music in Boston, for less than a year. As The New Yorker put it, \\"He was a college dropout and small- town playboy (he briefly dated the model Carré Otis), an assistant manager at an organic market and an occasional grower of weed. He had few skills and fewer prospects.\\" Around 1984, while driving home from music gigs at night, he noticed how the position of the constellation Orion was in a different place than before. This fascinated him, so he decided to take an astronomy class at College of Marin, but he was required to complete a class in physics first, and it was there he had a revelation: nature could be understood and predicted. As Steltzner put it, \\"I had found religion.\\" By 1985 he quit music and devoted himself full-time to the challenge of school. His education included Tamalpais High School (1981) and College of Marin ; a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering at University of California, Davis (1990); a Master of Science degree in applied mechanics at California Institute of Technology (1991); and a PhD in engineering mechanics at University of Wisconsin–Madison (1999). Steltzner is married with three children; his wife once worked at JPL as well. His second daughter was born three weeks after the Mars landing in 2012. Steltzner published an autobiographical book in 2016 titled The Right Kind of Crazy: A True Story of Teamwork, Leadership, and High-Stakes Innovation, a memoir of his time at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the building of the Mars Science Laboratory. In October 2016, he was admitted into the National Academy of Engineering. Steltzner speaks publicly on the topics of leadership, innovation, team building, and the power of curiosity and exploration. Steltzner demonstrates the Curiosity sky crane landing system Career Steltzner is employed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he has worked for about ten years designing, testing and building the sky crane landing system for the Curiosity rover. Steltzner was phase lead and development manager for EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) of the lander, which successfully landed on Mars on August 5, 2012. The sky crane is an entirely new technology system, Steltzner said of it \\"When people look at it...it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing. Sometimes when we look at it, it looks crazy. It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought. But it still looks crazy.\\" The sky crane allows for a precise landing ellipse opening up many areas of Mars for exploration that were previously inaccessible due to uneven terrain. Adam Steltzner speaking at UC Davis, May 2013 Steltzner joined JPL in 1991, in the Spacecraft Structures and Dynamics group. He worked on several flight projects including the Shuttle–Mir Program, Galileo, Cassini, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Mars Science Laboratory as well as several mission proposals, pre-Phase A projects and technology development efforts. Initially employed as a structures and mechanics personnel, he gravitated towards landing events and Mars Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) systems. He was the landing systems engineer on the cancelled comet mission Champollion and the mechanical systems lead for EDL on MER. When asked what he would like to do next, Steltzner says, \\"I'd like to see a Mars sample return. I'd like to land on the surface of Europa – the most likely place in the solar system for life. And third, I'd like to float a boat on the methane lakes of Titan.\\" Steltzner is the chief engineer of the Mars 2020 project, which launched the Perseverance rover to Mars in July 2020. The mission will take Martian surface samples and rock cores for potential return to Earth by a later mission.

Steltzner is often profiled by the press in human interest stories with a focus on a \\"rock and roll\\" engineer image; for example he was called \\"the face of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory mission\\" by the EE Times, who also called him \\"a bit of a hipster\\"; he was interviewed on National Public Radio which noted his \\"Elvis haircut\\", and profiled again on NPR in a piece called \\"Red Planet, Green Thumb: How A NASA Scientist Engineers His Garden\\". Steltzner also participated on the NPR radio quiz program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 2012.Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! from NPR He has been profiled similarly in other sources. A chapter-length biography of Steltzner in the book Going to Mars (2004) is titled \\"Elvis Lives\\" after the rock and roll star who Steltzner supposedly resembles, which Esquire said \\"calls back to NASA's halcyon days in the late 1950s and early 1960s\\". He was among the scientists and engineers featured on the NOVA episode \\"Mars Dead or Alive\\" (2004), which chronicled the process that ultimately delivered the rovers Spirit and Opportunity to Mars. The episode was nominated for an Emmy in 2004. He also appeared in the NOVA episodes \\"Welcome to Mars\\" (2005) and \\"The Great Math Mystery\\" (2015), Roadtrip Nation (2014), and other TV documentaries including Countdown to Mars (2003), Bouncing to Mars (2003), Spirit of Exploration (2005), What Went Right (2006), Mars Rising episodes \\"Journey to the Red Planet\\" and \\"Seven Minutes of Terror\\" (2007), and Horizon episodes \\"Mission to Mars: A Horizon Special\\" (2012) and \\"Man on Mars: Mission to the Red Planet\\" (2014).

The play was first performed in Leipzig on 1 April 1777 by Abel Seyler's theatre company, where Klinger then was employed as a playwright. The play's original title was Wirrwarr; it was changed to Sturm und Drang before premiering. Background In the autumn of 1776 Klinger wrote a comedy titled simply Wirrwarr (\\"confusion\\", \\"hubbub\\"). At that time he was already a well-known playwright; the year before, he had won a prize of 20 Louis d'or from the Ackermannschen Theatertruppe for his tragedy Die Zwillinge. Klinger had followed Goethe to Weimar. suggested the title Sturm und Drang (\\"storm and urge\\", \\"storm and stress\\") in a letter to Klinger.Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche- Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 107. The piece was created in the year that is commonly seen as the high- water-mark of the Sturm und Drang movement. Klinger brought the piece with him when he joined Abel Seyler's famed theatrical company. Klinger would be employed as a playwright by the company for two years. The company premiered Sturm und Drang in Leipzig on 1 April 1777. Neither the world premiere nor the subsequent performance in Klinger's hometown of Frankfurt were successful. The influence of Shakespeare can be seen in the feud (reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet) between the Berkley and Bushy families. Additionally, the names \\"Bushy\\" and \\"Berkley\\" are borrowed from the surnames of two minor characters in Richard II; the name \\"La Feu\\" (\\"Lafew\\") comes from All's Well That Ends Well. More important than this evidence of enthusiasm for Shakespeare and other authors, however, is the title Sturm und Drang itself, which soon became the watchword for an artistic movement. Characters * Wild (alias Karl Bushy) * La Feu and Blasius, two friends of Wild * Lord Berkley * Jenny Caroline, daughter of Lord Berkley * Lady Kathrin, sister to Lord Berkley * Louise, niece of Lord Berkley * Captain Boyet (alias Harry Berkley, Lord Berkley's long-lost son) * Lord Bushy, Wild's father * A young Moor, Boyet's slave * The landlord * Betty, a servant Synopsis The adventurous Wild has kidnapped his friends La Feu and Blasius against their will to America. There, Wild wants to participate in the American Revolutionary War (presumably on the side of the colonists). The trio stop at an inn; staying there also are the party of the aged Lord Berkley, his sister Lady Kathrin, his daughter Jenny Caroline, and their servant Louise. Berkley, ten years earlier, lost his estate through the actions of his enemies; he suspects that the mastermind is his former friend, Lord Bushy. Wild and his friends meet the ladies of the Berkley party. La Feu falls in love with Lady Kathrin at first sight; Blasius, on the other hand, is bored with Louise. For her part, Caroline instantly recognizes Wild as her childhood sweetheart, Karl Bushy, the son and heir of her father's arch-enemy! The happy couple conceal Wild's true identity from Lord Berkley, who promises to procure a job in the army for Wild. As Act 3 opens, Blasius and La Feu talk about Wild and the ladies. La Feu is still very enthusiastic about Lady Kathrin, which Blasius cannot understand because of her age. Blasius, sleepy and uninterested as usual, goes to bed. Now the sea- captain Boyet arrives at the inn. Lord Berkley recognizes Captain Boyet as his long-lost son Harry, who has been missing since the raid on the Berkley estate ten years ago. Meanwhile, Boyet (alias Harry Berkley) has a history with Wild (alias Karl Bushy), for whom he feels a spontaneous aversion. The pair met and duelled once in Holland; now Boyet demands revenge for the wound he then received. In Wild's presence, Boyet triumphantly reports to his father that he has abandoned the old Lord Bushy in a small boat on the high seas, dooming Bushy to almost certain death. Wild angrily challenges Captain Boyet to a duel. Shortly thereafter, Lady Kathrin reveals to the Berkleys Wild's true identity, which she has learned from La Feu. In Act 5, Wild and Boyet (that is, Karl and Harry) fight. Boyet is wounded in the calf and reluctantly recognizes Wild's bravery. Then, Wild receives word from the captain's slave- boy that, with the help of the ship's lieutenant, he had secretly brought old Bushy back on board Boyet's ship and not abandoned him at sea at all. In fact, the \\"dead\\" man suddenly appears, forgives his adversaries, and insists that he did not participate in the conspiracy against Berkley! Bushy does not reveal the real mastermind, as that man died long ago. The old and the young Berkley hesitantly accept the offer of reconciliation, so deeply sits the hatred of long years. Nevertheless, the two reconcile and the feud is settled. Wild and Caroline can now devote themselves completely to their love. La Feu and Lady Kathrin also pair off to choose a romantic Arcadian existence herding sheep. Blasius, whose grumpiness permanently deterred Louise, goes off to become a hermit. Analysis The names of impetuous Wild, romantic La Feu (\\"the fire\\"), and indifferent Blasius (whose name evokes the word \\"blasé\\") reflect their individual temperaments.Vgl.: Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche- Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 108. The play is nominally set in the midst of the American Revolutionary War, but the war plays no part in the drama, which takes place entirely at an inn and is concerned entirely with the fortunes of the Bushy and Berkley families. However, as a backdrop, the colonists' violent rebellion is reminiscent of the kind of passionate individual expression celebrated by the Sturm und Drang movement.Vgl.: Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang.

The character first appeared in Fables #1 (July 2002) and was created by Bill Willingham and Lan Medina . He frequently serves as the lead character among the ensemble cast of Fables and is the central protagonist of Fables: Werewolves Of The Heartland as well as Fables: The Wolf Among Us, the comic book adaptation of the 2013 video game The Wolf Among Us. Within the series, Bigby Wolf is a member of the \\"Fable\\" community – fantastical characters from fairy tales and folklore who formed a clandestine society centuries ago within New York City known as Fabletown, after their Homelands have been conquered by a mysterious and deadly enemy known as \\"The Adversary\\". Bigby is the embodiment of the Big Bad Wolf, a villainous wolf character appearing in several cautionary tales that include Grimms' Fairy Tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Peter and the Wolf, and The Three Little Pigs, as well as some of Aesop's Fables. Effectively immortal like most other Fables, Bigby is capable of shapeshifting between human form, a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature form, and a giant wolf form. After gaining the ability to shapeshift and pardoned for his past deeds, Bigby assumed the role of Fabletown's sheriff, and in the following centuries he has mostly remained in his human form and tries to put his dark past as a menacing predator behind him. Bigby Wolf has received a positive reception for his complex characterization as an anti-heroic figure, and is considered to be the closest character the Fable series has to a protagonist. Creation and conception Bigby Wolf first appeared in Chapter One of the first story arc of Fables, titled \\"Old Tales Revisited\\", which has been collected in the trade paperback Fables: Legends in Exile. The story arc involves the mystery around Rose Red's apparent murder, where her boyfriend Jack Horner informs Bigby that she has been killed. Bigby informs Rose's sister, Snow White, and then proceeds to investigate the crime scene as the sheriff of Fabletown. In these early appearances, Bigby's well-muscled body, shaggy hair and habitual scowl on his face is similar to Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the Marvel Comics character Wolverine. Bigby's visual design evokes a film noir feel,McKay and Miller, 266.Kannenberg, 121. and invited comparisons to Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry character,Bobby, 182 and to Humphrey Bogart's various private detective characters: he has a constant five o'clock shadow over his face, who chain-smokes and wears a beige trench coat and loosened tie over his dress shirt, which is itself rolled into sleeves. Though Bigby resists the typical binary representation of man and animal, the series begins following a fairly typical transformative man/animal trajectory for his character arc.McKay and Miller, 266. The creative team of the comic book series, Mark Buckingham and Bill Willingham, confirmed that Bigby started off with a malevolent personality as part of his origin story, but his fascination with Snow White and his desire to protect her was a turning point for his character arc. Bigby's ongoing personal journey to redemption, as depicted in the series, is constantly interspersed with multiple opportunities to revert to his bestial, violent nature, which is never completely absent according to Buckingham and Willingham. His constant internal struggle to keep his true nature in check is deemed necessary for him to coexist peacefully with other beings in a community, and that it is the only way for a creature like him to find redemption and forgiveness. While he serves an instrumental role to protect Fabletown from various threats, he often terrifies the very people he works to protect due to their knowledge of his dark past. Bigby is featured as the central protagonist of a graphic novel spin-off, Fables: Werewolves Of The Heartland, which follows the character as he searches for a new home on behalf of Fabletown. Characterization As a character patterned after the outlaw cultural hero archetype, Bigby has more in common with the likes of Jesse James or Robin Hood then traditional fairy-tale oriented ones.Hill, 183. Bigby is depicted as primarily a champion of what he believes is right, who has never taken the law too strictly as he has shown a willingness to bend his own rules. In his essay \\"Negotiating Wartime Masculinity in Bill Willingham's Fables\\", Mark C. Hill described Bigby's characterization as \\"part hard-nosed detective, part soldier, part anti-hero\\", and that his role as the protector of Fabletown involved an eclectic cross between \\"small town sheriff and clandestine spy-master\\". He noted that Bigby's stereotypical Hollywood police detective persona is only one aspect of the disparate narratives and centuries of cultural ideologies that makes up the character's personal history.Hill, 182. Hill linked Bigby to Joseph Campbell's hero myth pattern studies as an outsider marked with supernatural powers from birth, to the Beowulf legend with his ability to assume the alternate form of a werewolf-like creature, and to the politics of conflict and war that surround the creation of the Fables series with the character's service history and involvement in a counter-insurgency storyline. Hill argued that the character serves as a \\"liminal margin\\", a concept originally developed by Homi K. Bhabha, \\"where pedogogical, nationalistic and resistant narrative discourses construct, maneuver and negotiate identity.\\"Hill, 182. Claudia Schwabe agreed with Hill's observation that while Bigby's masculinity and heroism are further emphasized through his involvement with military conflict, she called to question his argument that the \\"War Stories\\" story arc does not question or challenge the courage, duty or righteousness of America's war effort but instead glorified the cultural memory of the masculine hero-soldier in a war worth fighting for, and drew attention to what she perceived as the subversive nature of Part 2 of the story arc which presents the question of monstrosity or \\"otherness\\" versus evil. She pointed out that Bigby, a supernatural werewolf creature based in America, eventually befriends his \\"enemy\\", a Nazi-created version of the classic Frankenstein's monster who in fact harbors no hostile intentions towards Bigby, after he was tricked into beheading the creature, claiming that the outcome of the story arc demonstrates the series' willingness to challenge readers' imagination of classic monsters and fairy-tale creatures as evil beings. To her view, the Fable series indicates that all evil acts may be forgiven and that any villainous character could find redemption if they are willing and able to make the attempt. In her book A Tour of Fabletown: Patterns and Plots in Bill Willingham's Fables, Neta Gordon observed that new elements of Bigby's character were introduced in the series' later story arcs, where he is often depicted an interested, caring and protective father.Gordon, 34. Gordon opined that Bigby's fatherly persona augments his function as a \\"purveyor of wartime masculinity\\", and that it is \\"unusually rich\\" when compared to conventional fairy tale and folklore fathers.Gordon, 34. By the final volume of Fables, Bigby's importance in the series' narrative is greatly reduced, operating mostly as Snow White's domestic partner. Fictional character biography Having reformed from his violent ways, Bigby became the cigarette-smoking, trench coat-clad sheriff of Fabletown. He is extremely cunning and resourceful, in addition to being an excellent detective. Due to Snow White's possession of a lycanthropy-stained knife, he is now a werewolf and can change between wolf form, human form and an intermediate \\"wolfman\\" stage at will. In \\"The Great Fables Crossover\\", it is revealed that Bigby's nature as one of the North Wind's sons allows him to change forms at will. He is the son of the North Wind, and, as such, has control over the lower-tier winds, plus the \\"huff and puff\\" of legend. Despite his reformation, he can still be vicious if he believes the situation calls for it. He develops feelings for Snow White and the two have a litter of seven children together. He quits his position as the Sheriff due to the election of Prince Charming as Mayor, whom he despises, and leaves Fabletown. He has since returned and married Snow, and now lives with her and their cubs on a specially set-aside area of land up at the Farm. In \\"The Destiny Game\\", Bigby forces The Lady Of The Lake to change his fate: he will never grow old, but he will continue to grow in strength and power; fall in love with Snow White; father seven children who will become gods and monsters who will lay waste to worlds; and he will die seven times, outliving all of his cubs. So far, it is unknown how often Bigby has died - nor is it known if being shot by Goldilocks and gravely wounded, along with Little Boy Blue, during the war count as deaths. Bigby eventually meets his end at the hands of Prince Brandish, who turns him into a glass statue and then destroys it. While the 13th-floor residents try to piece him together in hopes of reviving him, Mrs Sprat removes a part of his glass body. Bigby is seen in his personal heaven, where he meets Boy Blue and his son. Boy Blue tells him that while he can return to the living world, it would be a daunting task. Blue states that Bigby was meant to be one of the great destroyers but that his fate was altered due to his love for Snow White. Bigby eventually is revived but in a feral state. In the final arc he kills several mundy officers, along with Ozma, Beast, and Thrushbread. It is unclear if this state is due to Mrs. Sprat's actions or the challenge Boy Blue spoke of, but Winter's narration suggests the former. He is restored when Conner stands up to him. He and Snow live happily ever after and have many descendants. In other media Bigby Wolf appears as the protagonist of The Wolf Among Us, a graphic adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Bigby is voiced by Adam Harrington, who also voices the Woodsman from Little Red Riding Hood, Bigby's longtime rival. Players control Bigby as he investigates the brutal murders of fairytale characters and slowly unwinds the mystery of the Fabletown killer. When exploring an environment, Bigby can interact with objects and talk with non-player characters, many of whom are established series characters including Snow White, the Woodsman, and Sleeping Beauty. Dialogue options chosen during conversations may have a positive or negative effect on how other characters view Bigby, and their perceptions have far-reaching consequences which influence future events in the narrative. Some scenes are more action-oriented, which subjects Bigby to a series of quick time event (QTE) prompts for players to respond to. The video game's branching narrative is adapted and streamlined into a single canon plotline as Fables: The Wolf Among Us, with its first issue released on December 10, 2014 and published by Vertigo Comics. It was written by Matthew Sturges and Dave Justus, and serves as a canon prequel story to the comic book series. The series concluded on November 3, 2015 and collected as Fables: The Wolf Among Us Vol. 1. Bigby is set to appear in the sequel to The Wolf Among Us, which will continue events after the first game, though it still serve as a prequel to the comic series, with Harrington set to reprise his role. The game is being developed by LCG Entertainment, doing business as Telltale Games, in association with AdHoc Studio which is composed of former Telltale Games staff. Reception Bigby Wolf has been positively received by critics. Some sources consider Bigby to be the closest the Fable series, known for its large ensemble cast of characters, has to a leading man due to the central role he plays throughout much of the narrative.Bobby, 181. Kannenberg (2008) found that Bigby's initial depiction as a trenchcoat-wearing cynical detective with a chainsmoking habit in his early appearances adds a convincing touch of noir to the story.Kannenberg, 121. IGN picked Bigby as one of their favorite Fables characters, describing him as \\"Wolverine and Cyclops of the Fables team rolled into one\\", and \\"probably the most unlikely family man in all of Fabledom\\" which adds to his appeal as a main character. The video game iteration of Bigby in The Wolf Among Us has also been well received. Justin Clark from Gamespot described Bigby as a \\"brusque, cold, and brooding\\" Wolverine who wears Sam Spade's trench coat, noting his physical resemblance to the Lost series character James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford and that his \\"past misdeeds weigh on him constantly\\". While ultimately a malleable character by nature, he felt that the video game iteration of Bigby is a \\"different, lighter, more human character\\" even in light of any cruel decisions the player could make as Bigby. David Hinkle from Engadget praised the game's \\"intoxicating\\" mingling of mature themes like penance and redemption with fairy tale magic and superstitions as part of Bigby's character arc. He noted that Bigby is neither truly benevolent or malevolent and that he exists somewhere in the middle in terms of morality, showing empathy one moment yet purposefully provocative in another moment. Josiah Harrist from Killscreen found that Bigby \\"steals the spotlight as the seemingly irredeemable anti-hero craving redemption\\" and that it is ironic that \\"Fabletown’s biggest, baddest monster happens to be the one keeping the peace\\". Ozzie Mejia from Shacknews called Bigby \\"an interesting, multi-dimensional character\\" who can be moulded into \\"a heartless pursuer of vengeance\\" or an individual with \\"a heart of gold underneath his gruff exterior\\" depending on player choice. The potential for Bigby to unleash his anger and rage at other characters in The Wolf Among Us has been subject to discussion and analysis. Brian Albert from IGN compared Bigby to Lee Everett from The Walking Dead video game and opined that unlike Lee, Bigby's reputation dominates his conversations, his work, and his relationships and never has the chance to be seen as a new person. Albert felt uncomfortable projecting his personal views onto what he believes to be a defined character during his playthrough, and as a result he came to appreciate the power of the game's narrative. Within this context, he felt that Bigby's circumstances justify the moments where he is allowed to embrace his dark nature and bring harm to other characters. G. Christopher Williams from Pop Matters was amused by the possibility of Bigby (at the player's discretion) retaliating against non-player characters over their misogynistic misuse of the word \\"bitch\\", which literally means a female dog, as a form of insult. Williams argued that Bigby has the potential to become an \\"instructional tool for those who are concerned with casual misogyny\\" as well as \\"the kind of numbing effect that overused language has on its meanings and implications\\". Following the initial announcement of a sequel to the Wolf Among Us in July 2017, Alex Walker from Kotaku expressed a preference for a story that revolves more around Bigby’s desires, as opposed to Snow White or the political machinations of Fabletown which dominated the first game's narrative.

Andreae or I.G.R. Andreae, was a Hanoverian natural scientist, chemist, geologist, court pharmacist (Hofapotheker) and alchemist in the Age of Enlightenment. Internationally noted as a polymath, he was known throughout Europe particularly for his extensive natural history collections and for his pioneering and influential scientific work on soil and their uses for modern agriculture. He was a friend of many of the great scientists of the day, such as Benjamin Franklin, Pieter van Musschenbroek and George Shaw. The genus Andreaea, the type genus of the family Andreaeaceae of mosses, was named in his honour by his friend, the botanist Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart.Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, Volume 10, p. 381, Linnean Society of London, 1811 Andreae was also noted as one of the major benefactors in Hanover in his lifetime.Rudolf Vierhaus (eds.), \\"Andreae, Johann Gerhard Reinhart\\", in Deutsche Biographische Enzyklopädie, 2nd ed., Walter de Gruyter, 2005, Vol. 1, p. 165, Biography A silhouette of J.G.R. Andreae He was the son and one of two children of the wealthy court pharmacist Leopold Andreae (1686–1730), owner of the Andreae Pharmacy (Andreae & Co.) in Hanover, and Katharina Elisabeth Rosenhagen (died 1752). His grandfather was the pharmacist Ernst Leopold Andreae (born ca. 1640). The Andreae pharmacy had been founded in 1639 with a ducal privilege from Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and taken over by his great- grandfather Johann Andreae in 1645. It quickly came to serve the ducal court and became the official court pharmacy.Quellen und Darstellungen zur Geschichte Niedersachsens, 1907, Historischer Verein für Niedersachsen, pp. 118–119 Engraving of J.G.R. Andreae The book Briefe aus der Schweiz nach Hannover geschrieben His father died early and he was raised by his mother, \\"a very active, intelligent and righteous woman,\\" who arranged for him to receive an extraordinarily good education for his era. He studied all the sciences and learned all the important languages of 18th century Europe. Andreae learned the art of pharmacy in his family pharmacy, which at that time was managed by the court pharmacist Ruge from Celle. Urged by the court physician P.G. Werlhof (1699–1767) to study natural sciences, he studied geology and chemistry under Johann Heinrich Pott in Berlin, chemistry, mineralogy and metallurgy under Johann Andreas Cramer in Blankenburg, and chemistry under Hieronymus David Gaubius in Leyden. In 1747 he became head of his family's pharmacy in Hanover, at the time still owned by his mother. His mother formally ceded the ownership to him in 1751, shortly before her death. In November 1751, he married Ilse Sophie Müller (1728–1795). The marriage was a happy one, but they had no children of their own.Obituary by Friedrich Schlichtegroll in Nekrolog; auf das Jahr 1793; enthaltend Nachrichten von dem Leben merkwürdiger in diesem Jahre verstorbener Deutscher, Vol 4, No 1, pp. 164–181, Justus Perthes, 1794. In 1763, he undertook a scientific expedition across Switzerland, to study herbaria, fossil and crystal collections, salt evaporation ponds, hot springs and glaciers. His letters from Switzerland were published 1764–65 in the Hannoversche Magazin, and were published as an elaborate book in Zurich in 1776. He was highly regarded by the Hanover government and often asked for advice. On behalf of the Prince Elector of Hanover, he studied a great number of types of soil and their uses for agriculture. In 1767, he published his Alchemistische Briefe, with many pharmaceutical insights. Between 1778 and 1781, he employed Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart (a pupil of Carl Linnaeus) to organise his natural history collections, including an herbarium and a collection of seeds. He also wrote poetry and was a music lover. He was a friend of many famous contemporaries he had met on his travels—among them Pieter van Musschenbroek, Jean-André Deluc, Benjamin Franklin, George Shaw and Philipp Friedrich Gmelin—and corresponded regularly with them. His natural history collections were known throughout Europe. He was also a great admirer of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.Zeitschrift der Verein für Hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde, 1926, Vol. 55, p. 290 His only sister Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730–1764) was married to the banker turned theatre director Abel Seyler, who became \\"the leading patron of German theatre\\" in his lifetime.Wilhelm Kosch, \\"Seyler, Abel\\", in Dictionary of German Biography, eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter editor, 2005, , p. 308 Andreae viewed his brother-in-law with some scepticism. As his sister died in 1764 and her husband devoted himself completely to the theatre, their three children—Abel Seyler the Younger, Ludwig Erdwin Seyler and Sophie Seyler, later married to the poet Johann Anton Leisewitz—were raised by J.G.R. Andreae and his wife from 1764, and they were described as loving parents for his sister's children. When the Seyler theatrical company was on the verge of bankruptcy around 1770, Andreae also paid off its substantial debts to save the company, after the famous actor Konrad Ekhof had pleaded for help, but demanded that his brother-in-law should have no say in economic affairs from that point. Andreae was related, although not closely, to his niece's husband Johann Anton Leisewitz. :\\"In his youth Leisewitz had been a frequent visitor in the Andreae home with its large library and he was later to purport that he had long held Andreae, whom he regarded as an uncle, in the highest esteem.\\"Paul Warren Noble, The life and works of Johann Anton Leisewitz, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1976, p. 107 Andreae declined memberships of several scientific societies, as he regarded such honours as \\"learned charlatanry.\\"Karl Hufbauer, The Formation of the German Chemical Community (1720–1795), University of California Press, 1982, p. 187 The Andreae family were one of the most highly regarded families in Hanover.

He was, at the age of 15, the \\"youngest licensed aviator in the world\\". Still youngest licensed aviator at age 18. Biography =Early flying career= He was born in Los Angeles, California on October 5, 1896 to a wealthy physician. Fish enrolled in the Wright Flying School near Dayton, Ohio in 1911 at the age of 15. He stated in a 1971 newspaper article that he received four hours of lessons from Orville Wright. Includes contemporary photo of him. On January 12, 1912, the Aero Club of America issued him Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Airplane Pilot's Certificate #85. Fish immediately bought a Wright Model B biplane and had it shipped to California, where he flew it in an air meet at Dominguez Field in Los Angeles which ran from January 20 to 26, 1912. On January 21, he had a close call when \\"he plunged earthward from a height of 1000 feet [300 m], his biplane righting itself when less than 200 feet [61 m] from the ground\\". \\"The young flier ... stated that his machine dropped through a 'hole' in the air, and that he managed by desperate clinging to keep his seat until he encountered another current that bore him up.\\" Undeterred, he then participated in another meet at Emeryville Race Track, also in California, which lasted from February 17 to 21 of the same year. During this meet, he carried the first airmail to Oakland. Next came a small meet in April at the Coronado Polo Grounds in San Diego, where he again carried airmail. According to one source, it was here that Fish angered Glenn Curtiss when he landed without invitation on Curtiss's airfield. On May 17, 1912, Fish was arrested \\"after landing his Wright Model B (with a woman passenger) in Grant Park\\" in Chicago. He avoided a fine by claiming engine trouble. The Milwaukee Journal sponsored his non-stop, flight from Cicero Field, Chicago along Lake Michigan to Milwaukee on May 25, carrying Journal newspapers, mail and or of silk consigned to a department store. He made the trip in record time, either 2 hours 18 minutes or 2 hours 20 minutes. On May 29, The New York Times reported he had \\"made a fifty-mile [80 km] flight from Milwaukee to Watertown, Wis., carrying newspapers to the cities en route. It was the first use of an aeroplane in the circulating of newspapers.\\" The Journal stated that he had set a distance record for carrying a passenger, his mechanic Herbert Hazzard, on the return trip to Milwaukee. On July 9, Fish wrecked his airplane while performing stunts at Revere Beach in Revere, Massachusetts. He lost control after a wing touched the water. Fish and his student Jack McGee were thrown , landing in water deep enough to break their fall. On July 31, Fish and a student survived a crash at Atwood Park in Saugus, Massachusetts after Fish's aircraft hit an air pocket, dropped , crashed into a pole, turned upside-down and fell to the ground. Fish suffered only minor injuries, while Morris Shoemanhorne had a bruised head and a badly twisted right ankle. Fred Wagner took photographs of the 1912 American Grand Prize race from Fish's airplane, seen here, on October 5. On October 6, the Milwaukee Journal reported that the \\"young birdman\\" had taken aloft photographer Fred Wagner to take aerial pictures of automobile races for \\"a large part of the six hours that the races lasted.\\" The Boston Evening Transcript noted on November 15, 1912 that the Aero Club of America had suspended Fish's license until July 1, 1913 for \\"violation of the rule prohibiting flying over sporting events, games and other public assemblies. Both Beachey and Fish have been frequently reported as performing difficult and dangerous feats above crowds of spectators\\". Fish was apparently something of a juvenile delinquent. The November 4, 1914 Oakland Tribune reported that he had been charged with trying to steal an automobile as a \\"Halloween joke\\", also noting that he had previously been involved \\"in several bizarre episodes which brought him to the notice of the Los Angeles juvenile court\\". =Wounded for Pancho Villa= On May 15, 1915, Fish was flying reconnaissance for Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. While over a large body of soldiers, he was shot at; one bullet entered his calf, passed through his thigh and ended up in his shoulder. He managed to return to his base before crashing in his bullet-ridden aircraft, making him, according to Dr. John H. Lienhard, Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering and History at the University of Houston, \\"the first airplane casualty in the history of aerial warfare.\\" Fish went home to recuperate, and was soon flying again. On September 16, 1915, Wisconsin state fair visitors watched as Fish crashed into a pond. Fortunately, while his airplane was \\"badly damaged\\", the pilot escaped with cuts and bruises. A special booklet for the 1916 reunion of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni listed among its program of activities \\"Flight by Farnum Fish in a Wright Biplane\\". =Military service= With America's entry into World War I, he enlisted in the United States Army in February 1918 and was commissioned a lieutenant in July. In September, he was sent overseas as a test pilot for the Signal Corps, before being discharged in April 1919. He was a member of the Air Service Officers Reserve Corps from June 1919 to 1934, and returned briefly to active duty in 1942. =Later life= After his military service, he became a businessman in Los Angeles. At the age of 74, he and his wife ran a statuary shop and lived in San Pablo, California. He died on July 30, 1978.

Their father, Caliph Harun al-Rashid, had named al-Amin as the first successor, but had also named al-Ma'mun as the second, with Khurasan granted to him as an appanage. Later a third son, al-Qasim, had been designated as third successor. After Harun died in 809, al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad. Encouraged by the Baghdad court, al-Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan, and al-Qasim was quickly sidelined. In response, al-Ma'mun sought the support of the provincial élites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy. As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened, al-Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army. In 811, al-Amin's troops marched against Khurasan, but al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy, and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself. The city fell after a year, al-Amin was executed, and al-Ma'mun became Caliph. Al- Ma'mun chose to remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt. In addition, the pro-Khurasani policies followed by al- Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's espousal of an Alid succession in the person of Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional Baghdad élites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival caliph at Baghdad in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene in person. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad, which he entered in 819. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827. Some local rebellions, notably that of the Khurramites, dragged on for far longer, into the 830s. Historians have interpreted the conflict variously; in the words of the Iranologist Elton L. Daniel, it has been regard as \\"a conflict over the succession between a rather incompetent, besotted al-Amin and his shrewdly competent brother al-Ma'mun; as the product of harem intrigues; as an extension of the personal rivalry between the ministers al-Fadl b. Rabi and al-Fadl b. Sahl; or as a struggle between Arabs and Persians for the control of the government\\". Background Map of the Muslim expansion and the Muslim world under the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates The origins of the civil war lie in the succession arrangements of Harun al-Rashid () as well as the internal political dynamics of the Abbasid Caliphate. The two main contenders, Muhammad al-Amin and Abdallah al-Ma'mun, were born six months apart in AH 170 (786/7) with al- Ma'mun being the elder. It was al-Amin however who was named first heir in 792, while al-Ma'mun followed in 799, a sequence which was influenced by their lines of descent and their political implications: al-Amin had a solidly Abbasid lineage, being Harun's son by Zubayda, herself descended from the second Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (), while al-Ma'mun's mother was Marajil, a Persian concubine from Badhgis in Khurasan. While al-Ma'mun's origin was less prestigious than the purely Arab al-Amin, his ties to Khurasan and the Iranian-dominated eastern provinces were an important factor in his choice as heir. In contrast to the exclusively Arab-ruled Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid state was under heavy Iranian, and particularly Khurasani, influence. The Abbasid Revolution, which brought the Abbasids to power, originated in Khurasan, and the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abnaʾ al-dawla (\\"sons of the state/dynasty\\"). Khurasan retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces, and Harun al-Rashid in particular was careful to cultivate his ties with the Iranian element of the Caliphate, not least through his promotion of the Khurasani Barmakid family to positions of power. Both al-Amin and al-Ma'mun had been tutored in their youth by the Barmakids, al-Amin by al-Fadl ibn Yahya and al-Ma'mun by Ja'far ibn Yahya. While al-Amin would distance himself from the Barmakids and become closely associated with the abnaʾ aristocracy of Baghdad, al-Ma'mun remained influenced by Ja'far and his associates. In 802, Harun and the most powerful officials of the Abbasid government made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards the extent of the autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty. Almost immediately after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt fall of the Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may reflect the fact that the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al- Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was to have a chance to succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad. This led to unrest in the provinces, especially Khurasan, where, according to Elton L. Daniel, \\"Abbasid policies [fluctuated] between two extremes. One governor would attempt to extract as much wealth as he could from the province for the benefit of Iraq, the central government, and, not infrequently, himself. When the people protested loudly enough, such governors would be temporarily replaced by ones who would attend to local interests\\". The Khurasani elites had a long-standing rivalry with the abnaʾ. Although the latter now resided chiefly in what is now Iraq, they insisted on retaining control of Khurasani affairs and demanded that the province's revenues be sent west to supply their salaries, something strongly resisted by the local Arab and Iranian elites. The resulting tension was eased when al- Fadl ibn Yahya, universally praised as a model governor, was appointed to Khurasan in 793, but was re-fanned in 796, when a member of the abnaʾ, Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, was placed in charge of the province. His harsh taxation measures provoked increasing unrest, which expressed itself in Kharijite uprisings and, finally, a rebellion by the governor of Samarkand, Rafi ibn al- Layth. This uprising forced Harun himself, accompanied by al-Ma'mun and the powerful chamberlain (hajib) and chief minister al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, to travel to the province in 808. Al-Ma'mun was sent ahead with part of the army to Marv, while Harun stayed at Tus, where he died on 24 March 809. Civil war between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, 809–813 Upon Harun's death, al-Amin ascended the throne in Baghdad, where his popularity was great, while al-Ma'mun remained at Marv, from where he planned to campaign against the remaining rebels. However, al-Amin recalled the army and treasury from the east, leaving al-Ma'mun with little in the way of military forces. It was in this time that al-Ma'mun came to rely upon his wazir, the former Barmakid protégé al-Fadl ibn Sahl, who began to implement a policy of conciliation and cooperation with the local elites, whose autonomy and privileges were guaranteed. The covenant of 802 however soon began to fall apart over Baghdad's centralizing ambitions and the dispute over the status of Khurasan: the abnaʾ, led by Ali ibn Isa, whom Harun had imprisoned but who was now set free and appointed head of the Caliph's bodyguard, were joined by other influential officials, chief amongst them al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi, in demanding that Khurasan and its revenue return to the direct control of the central government, even if that meant breaking the stipulations of the Mecca agreement. Some modern scholars have tried to interpret the conflict between the two brothers as a confrontation between the Arab and Iranian elements of the caliphate, represented by the two contenders' mothers. It is true that the Iranian-dominated East generally backed al- Ma'mun, but neither was al-Amin a conscious champion of \\"Arabism\\", nor was the support for al-Ma'mun the result of his Iranian origin, although his supporters did make propaganda among the local population for the \\"son of their sister\\". Al-Ma'mun enjoyed the support of the local elites of Khurasan mainly because they saw in him a champion of their newly won autonomy, and because he himself assiduously cultivated that support. Later, during the war, the prospect of his victory also offered the Khurasanis the promise of a yet more privileged position in the new regime. However, the conflict was first and foremost a dynastic dispute, with al-Amin attempting to institute a direct patrilineal succession. In this he did nothing but follow the footsteps of his predecessors since al-Mansur, all of whom struggled against the claims of brothers or cousins. Harun al-Rashid himself was imprisoned during the brief reign of his elder brother al-Hadi (). Given to indolence and lacking any political ability himself, al-Amin entrusted this project to al-Fadl ibn al- Rabi, who is generally portrayed as the \\"evil genius\\" behind al-Amin, and one of the main instigators of the conflict. Very quickly, al-Amin moved to sideline the youngest brother, Qasim. Initially, Qasim was removed from his governorship of the Jazira, but soon after he was stripped altogether of his place in the succession and placed under guard at Baghdad. It was only because al-Ma'mun resided far from the Caliph's immediate area of control that he escaped sharing this fate. The rift between the two camps manifested in 810, when al-Amin added his own son, Musa, to the line of succession. Al-Amin then sent a delegation to Marv, asking al-Ma'mun to return to Baghdad. After al- Ma'mun, fearing for his safety, refused, al-Amin began to interfere with his brother's domain: he protested al-Ma'mun's pardon to Ibn al-Layth after his surrender and asked for tribute from the governors of the western provinces of Khurasan as a sign of submission. He then demanded of his brother the cession of the western regions of Khurasan, the admission of caliphal tax and postal agents into the province, and the forwarding of the Khurasan's revenue to Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun, who could not rely on large military forces and whose position was consequently weak, was at first inclined to accede to his brother's demands, but al-Fadl ibn Sahl dissuaded him from this course and encouraged him to seek support among the native population of Khurasan, who also opposed control by the caliphal court. Al-Ma'mun, who was already favourably regarded after the excesses of Ali ibn Isa, consciously set about to cultivate the support of the local population, reducing taxes, dispensing justice in person, conceding privileges to the native princes, and demonstratively evoking episodes from the beginnings of the Abbasid movement in the province. He now became a \\"political magnet for Iranian sympathisers\\" (El-Hibri) refused to cede his province or return to Baghdad, and began to gather around him those dissatisfied with Baghdad's centralizing policies or who had simply been left out of the share of spoils and power after the Abbasid Revolution. Under the influence of their respective chief ministers, al-Amin and al-Ma'mun took steps that further polarized the political climate and made the breach irreparable. After al-Ma'mun symbolically removed al- Amin's name from his coins and from the Friday prayer, in November 810 al-Amin removed al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tamin from the succession and nominated his own sons Musa and Abdallah instead. Al-Ma'mun replied by declaring himself imam, a religious title which shied of directly challenging the Caliph but nevertheless implied independent authority, as well as hearkening back to the early days of the Hashimiyya movement which had carried the Abbasids to power. Despite the reservations of some of his senior ministers and governors, two months later, in January 811, al-Amin formally began the civil war when he appointed Ali ibn Isa governor of Khurasan, placed him at the head of an unusually large army of 40,000 men, drawn from the abnaʾ, and sent him to depose al-Ma'mun. When Ali ibn Isa set out for Khurasan, he reportedly took along a set of silver chains with which to bind al-Ma'mun and carry him back to Baghdad. The news of Ali's approach threw Khurasan into panic, and even al- Ma'mun considered fleeing. The only military force available to him was a small army of some 4,000–5,000 men, under Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Tahir was sent to confront Ali's advance, but it was widely regarded as almost a suicide mission, even by Tahir's own father. The two armies met at Rayy, on the western borders of Khurasan, and the ensuing battle on 3 July 811 resulted in a crushing victory for the Khurasanis, in which Ali was killed and his army disintegrated on its flight west. Tahir's unexpected victory was decisive: al- Ma'mun's position was secured, while his main opponents, the abnaʾ, lost men, prestige and their most dynamic leader. Tahir now advanced westwards, defeated another abnaʾ army of 20,000 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala after a series of hard-fought engagements near Hamadan, and reached Hulwan by winter. Al-Amin now desperately tried to bolster his forces by alliances with Arab tribes, notably the Banu Shayban of Jazira and the Qays of Syria. The veteran Abd al- Malik ibn Salih was sent to Syria to mobilize its troops along with Ali ibn Isa's son, Husayn. However, al-Amin's efforts failed due to the long-standing intertribal divisions between Qaysis and Kalbis, the Syrians' reluctance to get involved in the civil war, as well as the unwillingness of the abnaʾ to cooperate with the Arab tribes and to make political concessions to them. These failed efforts to secure Arab tribal support backfired on al-Amin, as the abnaʾ began to doubt whether their interests were best served by him. In March 812, Husayn ibn Ali led a short-lived coup against al-Amin in Baghdad, proclaiming al-Ma'mun as the rightful Caliph, until a counter-coup, led by other factions within the abnaʾ, restored al-Amin to the throne. Fadl ibn al- Rabi, however, one of the main instigators of the war, concluded that al- Amin's case was lost and resigned from his court offices. At about the same time, al-Ma'mun was officially proclaimed caliph, while Fadl ibn Sahl acquired the unique title of Dhu 'l-Ri'asatayn (\\"he of the two headships\\"), signifying his control over both civil and military administration. Map of Iraq and surrounding regions in the early ninth century In spring 812, Tahir, reinforced with more troops under Harthama ibn A'yan, resumed his offensive. He invaded Khuzistan, where he defeated and killed the Muhallabid governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, whereupon the Muhallabids of Basra surrendered to him. Tahir also took Kufa and al-Mada'in, advancing on Baghdad from the west while Harthama closed in from the east.At the same time, al-Amin's authority crumbled as supporters of al-Ma'mun took control of Mosul, Egypt and the Hejaz, while most of Syria, Armenia and Adharbayjan fell under the control of local Arab tribal leaders. As Tahir's army closed on Baghdad, the rift between al-Amin and the abnaʾ was solidified when the desperate Caliph turned to the common people of the city for help and gave them arms. The abnaʾ began deserting to Tahir in droves, and in August 812, when Tahir's army appeared before the city, he established his quarters in the suburb of Harbiyya, traditionally an abnaʾ stronghold. The historian Hugh N. Kennedy characterized the subsequent siege of the city as \\"an episode almost without parallel in the history of early Islamic society\\" and \\"the nearest early Islamic history saw to an attempt at social revolution\\", as Baghdad's urban proletariat defended their city for over a year in a vicious urban guerrilla war. Indeed, it was this \\"revolutionary\\" situation in the city as much as famine and the besiegers' professional expertise, that brought about its fall: in September 813, Tahir convinced some of the richer citizens to cut the pontoon bridges over the Tigris that connected the city to the outside world, allowing al- Ma'mun's men to occupy the city's eastern suburbs. Al-Ma'mun's troops then launched a final assault, in which al-Amin was captured and executed at Tahir's orders while trying to seek refuge with his old family friend Harthama. While al-Ma'mun was probably not implicated in the act, it was politically convenient, as it left him both de jure and de facto the legitimate caliph. Sahlid dominance and reaction, 813–819 Nevertheless, the regicide soured al-Ma'mun's victory. Tahir was soon transferred out of the public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa, but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty. According to Elton Daniel, \\"It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs; For the first time, an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects\\". As al-Ma'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital, a wave of Arab antipathy towards al- Ma'mun and his \\"Persian\\" supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad and surroundings, which feared being degraded to a mere province. This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl, who intended to permanently move the Muslim world's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan, where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups. Fadl was also responsible for side-lining many other supporters of al-Ma'mun; thus, when Harthama ibn A'yan went to Marv to inform al-Ma'mun of the real situation in the west, the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816. In response, Harthama's son Hatim led a short- lived revolt in Armenia. The result of these policies was that revolts and local power struggles erupted across the Caliphate, with only Khurasan and the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire exempt from this turmoil. Iraq in particular descended into near-anarchy. The new governor of Iraq, Fadl's brother al-Hasan ibn Sahl, soon lost the support of the abnaʾ. The local population's alienation from his regime was exploited by the Zaydi Alids, who on 26 January 815 rose in revolt at Kufa, led by former general Abu 'l-Saraya al-Sirri. The revolt spread quickly through Iraq region as various groups with old grievances against the Abbasids used the opportunity to exact revenge. Thus at Basra, the revolt was led by the Alid Zayd, a son of the imam Musa al- Kadhim who had been executed in 799 on Harun al-Rashid's orders. The uprising came close to threatening Baghdad itself, and it was only through the intervention of the capable Harthama that it was quelled, with Abu 'l-Saraya being captured and executed in October. Secondary pro-Alid movements also seized control of Yemen (under Ibrahim al-Jazzar, another son of Musa al- Kadhim) and the Tihamah, including Mecca, where Muhammad al-Dibaj, a grandson of the Alid imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, was proclaimed Caliph in November 815. The suppression of these revolts was entrusted to Ali ibn Isa's son Hamdawayh, with an army of abnaʾ. Hamdawayh was successful in subduing these provinces, but then attempted, unsuccessfully, to secede from the Caliphate himself. In 816, to bolster his flagging prestige, al-Ma'mun assumed the title \\"God's Caliph\\". Taking note of the widespread Alid support in his western provinces, al-Ma'mun not only spared the lives of the various Alid anti-caliphs, but on 24 March 817 also named the Alid Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, a third son of Musa al-Kadhim, as his heir apparent, and even changed the official dynastic colour from Abbasid black to Alid green. Although the seriousness of al-Ma'mun's commitment to the Alid succession is uncertain—there are suggestions that Ali al-Ridha was so old that he could hardly be expected to actually succeed al- Ma'mun—its impact was disastrous: not only did it fail to produce any tangible popular support, but also provoked an uproar among the members of the Abbasid dynasty in Baghdad. Hasan ibn Sahl had already been forced to abandon the city, where various factional leaders now shared power, and the news of the Alid succession ruined his attempts at conciliation. Instead, on 17 July 817 the members of the Abbasid family in Baghdad nominated a new Caliph of their own, Harun al-Rashid's younger brother Ibrahim. Ibrahim received broad backing from the Baghdad elites, from Abbasid princes like al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq (the future Caliph al-Mu'tasim, ) to old-established members of the bureaucracy like Fadl ibn al-Rabi (who returned to his office as hajib), and leaders of the abnaʾ. As the scholar Mohamed Rekaya commented, \\"in other words, it was a revival of the war between the two camps [Baghdad and Khurasan], dormant since 813\\". The Imam Reza shrine, erected over the grave of Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha Ibrahim moved to secure control of Iraq, but although he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, who had made Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al- Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Ridha succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it to be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although the rest of his family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Ridha also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad (\\"the place of martyrdom\\"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site. In the meantime, back in Baghdad, Ibrahim faced desertions, rebellions and conspiracies, one of which involved his half-brother al-Mansur. Hasan ibn Sahl was able to use this turmoil and advance north, capturing Mada'in. As the months passed, discontent in Baghdad grew. Ibrahim's supporters, including Fadl ibn al-Rabi, began abandoning him, and in April and July 819 there was a plot to take Ibrahim captive and surrender him to al-Ma'mun's forces. Narrowly escaping from this conspiracy, Ibrahim abandoned the throne and went into hiding, opening the path for al-Ma'mun to reclaim Baghdad. On 17 August 819, al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad without resistance, and the political turmoil quickly subsided. Al-Ma'mun now set about to reconcile himself with the opposition: he rescinded the Alid succession, restored black as the dynastic colour, sent Hasan ibn Sahl into retirement, and recalled Tahir from his exile in Raqqa. Al-Ma'mun did however retain the title of imam, which became part of the standard caliphal titulature. During the 812–813 siege of Baghdad, Tahir had established close ties with the abnaʾ, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, and when he died in October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra. Reunification and pacification of the Caliphate, 820–837 At the time al- Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from effective Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming various degrees of autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled the north of the country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was in the hands of a group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al- Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Adharbayjan and Armenia. To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun turned to another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, to whom he entrusted the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so that he had to be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824–825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain the status quo, and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations. Elsewhere, however, the process of consolidation was harder, or failed completely: Aghlabid-controlled Ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status, effectively slipping entirely from Abbasid control, while in Adharbayjan, al- Ma'mun's general Isa ibn Abi Khalid re-established control over the various local Muslim lords in the cities, but was unable to suppress the Khurramite revolt. Expeditions were sent against the Khurramites under Sadaka ibn Ali al- Azdi in 824 and Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Ta'i in 827–829, but both failed before the mountainous terrain and the Khurramites' guerrilla tactics, with Ibn Humayd losing his life as well. It was not until the accession of al-Mu'tasim, who employed his new military corps composed of Turkish slave-soldiers (mawali or ghilman) against the Khurramites, that their rebellion was suppressed in 837, after years of hard campaigning. Despite the restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces, the Caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions: the rest of al-Ma'mun's reign saw a series of uprisings by the Zutt in lower Iraq, a three-year revolt against oppressive taxation in Egypt in 829, in which both the Christian Copts and the Muslims participated, as well as the unsuccessful revolt of Ali ibn Hisham, Ibn Humayd's successor as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan. Aftermath and impact The Caliph al- Ma'mun (left) as depicted in the 13th-century Madrid Skylitzes manuscript, seen receiving the embassy of John the Grammarian in 829, sent by the Byzantine emperor Theophilos (depicted right) The long civil war shattered the social and political order of the early Abbasid state, and a new system began to emerge under al-Ma'mun, which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime: the abnaʾ, the old Arab families and the members of the Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units, often controlled by a hereditary dynasty, like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana, usually of Iranian descent. At the same time, however, al-Ma'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire, and counterbalanced them through the creation of two new military corps: his brother Abu Ishaq's Turkish slaves, and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier, which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq (al-Mu'tasim), who created a tightly controlled, centralized state, and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike. The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors, while the old Arab and Iranian elites were completely sidelined. Al-Ma'mun's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine: in 829, al-Ma'mun adopted Mu'tazilism, in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities. At the same time, the willingness of al-Ma'mun and his successors to embrace the non-Arab populations of the Caliphate, especially in the Iranian East, as well as to entrust the governance of these provinces to local dynasties with considerable autonomy, helped to end a long series of religiously-motivated rebellions and reconciled these populations to Islam: the rate of conversion during al- Ma'mun's reign increased markedly, and that was the time when most of the local princely families of the Iranian lands finally became Muslims. As El- Hibri comments, \\"in time this development represented a prelude to the emergence of autonomous provincial dynasties in the east, which would relate to the caliphal centre in nominal terms of loyalty only\\".

The college moved from the site in 1999 and the buildings are now occupied by the Chelsea College of Arts. History Ordnance Survey maps of London extract for 1916. This shows clearly the octagonal outline of the former penitentiary surrounding the small site. At the centre is the National Gallery of British Art, afterwards known as the Tate Gallery, and now as Tate Britain, with the college in the south of the site and hospital in the north. Most of the streets remain as at 2012 apart from Bulinga Street, most of which has been built over, and Dundonald Street which has been renamed 'John Islip Street'. There is a 'Census Office' at the rear of the gallery, long since gone. The site, including that of the Tate Gallery (which opened in 1897), was previously occupied by the Millbank Prison from 1821 to the late 19th century. The college was built by John Henry Townsend and Wilfred Ainslie in Imperial Baroque style. They also designed the adjoining Regimental Officers’ Mess and Commandant's House, in French Renaissance style. The buildings were opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 15 May 1907. A statue of Sir James McGrigor, the father of army medicine, originally at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea was moved to the grounds in 1907 and then moved again to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2000. Queen Alexandra Military Hospital was built to the north of the Tate Gallery and opened in 1905. Sir Cooper Perry was knighted in 1903 for helping set up the college. During the First World War the college was used to prepare vaccines, including a vaccine against typhoid which was developed at the college. The college also researched into protection against chemical warfare including the development of gas masks here. In the second World War, the college provided courses in tropical medicine. The college was seriously damaged in 1941 by bombs and the walls of the Tate Gallery nearby still show signs of the damage.

Between 1957 and 1960, he was a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the second- highest ranking official within the party after Nikita Khrushchev. Biography Kirichenko was born in the village Chornobayivka of Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire in a family of Ukrainian factory workers. From the age of 11 he started earning for living by working in the fields and then at railways. After graduating from a mechanical school he worked in Kazakhstan as an engineer in a sovkhoz. He then returned to Ukraine to receive a university degree (1936) and teach agricultural engineering. In 1938, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and in 1941 its Secretary of Industry (later in 1949 he was promoted to the 2nd Secretary and in June 1953 to the 1st Secretary). During World War II, serving as a party functionary, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1953, he became a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and in 1957 one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. During 1957–1960, Kirichenko was effectively the second-highest ranking person in the Communist Party after Khrushchev, who was his patron since the 1930s. However, Khrushchev gradually became disappointed with Kirichenko whom he saw as a somewhat arrogant bureaucrat, not capable or willing to understand and solve the management problems, either on the national or international scale. As a result, in 1960 Kirichenko was demoted to the position of the first secretary of the Party Committee of Rostov Oblast and retired in 1962. He died in 1975 and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. According to Enver Hoxha, in the midst of the Soviet-Albanian split an Albanian military student studying in the Soviet Union had met Kirichenko during a train ride.

He started working at the end of the fifties, and was pretty active as a composer of film scores, signing about 120 sound-tracks especially for spaghetti westerns and commedie sexy all'italiana films. His piece \\"One Silver Dollar\\", the main theme to Giorgio Ferroni's Blood for a Silver Dollar (1965), was later included in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Gianni Ferrio (2008) He was also well known for his work in pop music, particularly for his collaboration with Mina, for whom he composed, among others, the hit song \\"Parole parole\\", and wrote arrangements and orchestrations for numerous of her songs and albums. The last collaboration with Mina was for her 2012 album 12 (American Song Book), for which Ferrio traditionally provided the string arrangements. He was the official conductor for Sanremo Music Festival in 1959 and 1962 and for the Eurovision Song Contest 1965. He also took part, as conductor, in several important Italian TV-shows.

Scientific career Sommer studied biology at the RWTH Aachen University, at the University of Tübingen and at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he obtained his Diplom degree in 1989 and earned his Ph.D. in the lab of Diethard Tautz on a study of the evolution of segmentation genes in insects in 1992. His work was one of the first molecular studies in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo in short), a discipline that started its revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s. From 1993-1995 he was a Research Fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Since 1999, he has been Director of the department Evolutionary Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany and was appointed Adjunct Professor (Honorarprofessor) at the University of Tübingen in 2002. He is awardee of the FALCON Prize of the German Society for Cell Biology and was head co-organizer of the 19th International C. elegans Conference, UCLA, USA in 2013. In 2015 he was elected as an EMBO member. Professional contributions Ralf Sommer works in the field of evolutionary developmental biology on nematodes. He has developed and established the nematode Pristionchus pacificus as a model system for integrative studies in evolutionary biology. Described in 1996 as a new species by Sommer and co-workers, P. pacificus has grown as an important model system, in which laboratory studies that aim for a mechanistic understanding of evolution can be combined with fieldwork. The latter allows ecological and population genetic studies to complement the gene-centered and development-centered perspectives of evo-devo. The original work of Sommer´s research focused on the evolution of developmental processes showing that homologous structures can be generated by distinct molecular mechanisms, a phenomenon now known as developmental systems drift. More recent work incorporates many additional areas of evolutionary biology. The nematode P. pacificus is associated with scarab beetles, an observation that provides an ecological framework and represents one of the cornerstones of his current research. Similarly, a population genetic framework for P. pacificus research has been established with the identification and exploration of La Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean, where this nematode shows an extraordinary genetic diversity. P. pacificus work on La Réunion Island is supported by a field station at the local Insectarium in Le Port. The integrative research program on P. pacificus represents a major paradigm shift for studying phenotypic evolution, by simultaneously investigating in one organism, the same patterns and processes from independent evolutionary perspectives. Consequently, the most recent studies investigate the evolution of novelty, focusing on developmental (phenotypic) plasticity as a facilitator of biological diversity. Specifically, the combination of laboratory studies with fieldwork allows new insight into the molecular mechanisms of developmental plasticity.

For over twenty years he has exhibiting internationally. Education/Programs * 2002-2003: Artist at the MoMA PS1 Studio Program, New York * 1998-1999: Participant at the Rijksakademie, Amsterdam (post-MA) * 1996-1997: Participant at The Higher Institute for Fine Arts-Flanders, Antwerp (post-MA) * 1992-1996: Master's degree in Visual Arts, Higher Institute Sint- Lukas, Brussels Oeuvre Hans Op de Beeck has developed his career through international exhibitions over the past ten years. His work consists of sculptures, installations, video work, photography, animated films, drawings, watercolours and writing (short stories). It is his quest for the most effective way of presenting the concrete contents of each work that determines the medium that the artist ultimately selects. The scale can vary from the size of a small watercolour to a large, three-dimensional installation of 600m2. The artist not only uses a very wide variety of media, but also deliberately employs a diversity of aesthetic forms, ranging from an economical, minimalist visual language to overloaded, exaggerated designs, always with the aim of articulating the content of the work as precisely as possible. Biography The Quiet View (2015) Interior of the Installation in Herkenrode, Hasselt. Hans Op de Beeck attended the Vrije Kunsten program at the Kunsthogeschool Sint-Lukas in Brussels. Afterwards he studied for a year at the Higher Institute of Fine Arts, and then for two years at the Rijksakademie (Amsterdam). In 2002-2003 he was artist in residence for one year at the MoMA PS1 in New York. From 2001, when he became the winner of the Young Belgian Painting Prize, he became widely known for his artistic work in the form of large-scale installations, some of which can be seen in public places, such as Lily Pond (2017) in Tongeren or The Quiet View (2015) on the Herkenrode site in Hasselt, on the site of Abdij van Herkenrode. The work aims to evoke the silence that once prevailed in the church.Bedrieglijk kunstwerk op abdij Herkenrode Themes Thematically, the work concentrates on our laborious and problematic relationship with time, space and each other. Op de Beeck shows the viewer non-existent, but identifiable places, moments and characters that appear to have been taken from contemporary everyday life, aiming thereby to capture in his images the tragicomic absurdity of our postmodern existence. Key themes are the disappearance of distances, the disembodiment of the individual and the abstraction of time that have resulted from globalisation and the changes to our living environment that developments in media, automation and technology have brought about. The Amusement Park (2015) In several of Hans Op de Beecks's works time seems to freeze, as in The Amusement Park (2015), which shows a night scene in an indefinable suburb where an abandoned amusement park is set up. The soft, grey plaster of which the work is constructed seems to abstract the attractions in dark stone, like a kind of contemporary Pompei, covered with the dust of the layered, silent time. This theme of a stationary or manipulated time dimension can also be found in his films, such as Night Time (2015), in which watercolours come to life. Although many of Hans Op de Beeck's works are very large in size, we still find the small, poetic detail in his oeuvre. In 2009, the artist presented a new video entitled Staging Silence, in which two pairs of anonymous hands continually transform a world on scale into a new image in front of the spectator's eyes. In doing so, you can follow how the artist repeatedly shapes a completely fictional, but still very recognisable, environment with the most everyday elements such as cotton wool, cardboard or sugar, which are as perishable as life itself. The deceptive self-evidence, with which the different scenes of the film are guided, is at odds with the fragile and uncertain form from which they arise. In a very subtle way, Hans Op de Beeck presents universal themes that are recognisable to everyone, young and old. In 2013 he created a sequel to this film, Staging Silence (2). Staging Silence 1 (2009) Hans Op de Beeck sometimes calls his works \\"proposals\\" - they are irrefutably fictional, constructed and staged, leaving it up to the viewer whether to take the work seriously, as a sort of parallel reality, or immediately to put it into perspective, as no more than a visual construct. The artist also questions the difficult relationship between reality and representation, between what we see and what we want to believe, between what is and what we create for ourselves in order to make it easier to deal with our own insignificance and lack of identity. The visual output of that investigation often produces slumbering, insidious, melancholy and astonishing images.

The Conservatives' and Liberal Democrats' vote dropped significantly and UKIP came third with their highest-ever vote in a parliamentary by-election to that date. Background Formed in 1983, the Corby constituency had been held by the Labour Party since 1997, but was captured by the Conservative candidate, author Louise Mensch (elected under her maiden name, Louise Bagshawe), at the 2010 general election. In an email to the Prime Minister David Cameron on 6 August 2012, Mrs Mensch confirmed her intention to move to New York City to spend time with her new husband, Peter Mensch, whose work is there, and their family. Louise Mensch was appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, thereby resigning her seat in the House of Commons, on 29 August 2012. All registered Parliamentary electors (i.e. British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK and British citizens living overseas) who were aged 18 or over on 15 November 2012 and were on the electoral register for the constituency, were entitled to vote in the by- election. The deadline for voters to register to vote in the by-election was midnight on Wednesday 31 October 2012. However, those who qualified as an anonymous elector had until midnight on Thursday 8 November 2012 to register to vote. Election campaign Ed Miliband launched the Labour campaign in the East Northamptonshire town of Thrapston rather than the traditional Labour stronghold of Corby. In an interview with the Northamptonshire Telegraph at the campaign launch in Corby, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: \\"We intend to put together a serious campaign here.\\"Margot and Jim make a bid to impress voters Northamptonshire Telegraph A poll conducted 12–18 October by Lord Ashcroft in the constituency found 54% for Labour, 32% for the Conservatives, 10% for the Liberal Democrats and 8% for other candidates.Corby By-Election: Tories Face Major Defeat, Sky News, 23 October 2012 James Delingpole, a Daily Telegraph journalist who is sceptical of anthropogenic global warming, stated his intention to run as an independent, on a platform opposing wind farms. Delingpole stated this ambition on 17 September 2012 and met with prospective local voters. However, he never formally applied, pulling out after support from the Conservative energy minister, John Hayes, opposing onshore wind farms, which caused a minor rift between Conservative and Liberal Democrat ministers. Chris Heaton-Harris, (Con, Daventry) and campaign manager for the party at the by-election, was secretly filmed saying he had encouraged Delingpole to run as a \\"plan\\" whereby Delingpole would say he would stand, though he would never actually do so, in order to \\"cause some hassle\\" and thus promote opposition to wind farms. Lewes councillor, Donna Edmonds (Con) set up Delingpole's wind-farm campaign website. Both Heaton-Harris and Edmonds argued they had not broken any party rules on supporting an opposition candidate on the grounds that Delingpole never formally became a candidate. The news of the secret footage broke before the election in the national press.Tory MP running Corby campaign 'backed rival in anti-windfarm plot', by Paul Lewis and Rob Evans, The Guardian, Tuesday 13 November 2012Metro: Tory MP denies plot to back anti-wind farm candidate in Corby by-election Result The total ballots issued were 35,775, and there were 110 spoilt ballots. The result was the second largest numerical majority ever in the Corby constituency (for any party) since its creation in 1983 (only 1997 was higher). In percentage terms, the Labour majority is only slightly lower than that in 1997 (21.8% compared to 22.0%). The result also represented the highest ever vote and share for UKIP at a parliamentary by-election at the time (the highest share record was broken at Rotherham two weeks later, and the record for largest number of UKIP votes polled in a by-election was broken at Eastleigh in February 2013). Corby was also the fourth by-election (out of nine in Great Britain up to that time) of the 2010 parliament at which the Liberal Democrats lost their deposit. This was the first seat gained by Labour in a by-election since the Wirral South by-election in 1997, and it is the most recent by-election which resulted in a Labour gain. A recount delayed the declaration of the result, called by the agent of the Liberal Democrat candidate, Jill Hope, who came 13 votes short of holding her deposit. *The Labour Party candidate Andy Sawford was chosen in 2011.

A professional photo-reporter working free lance for major international news agencies, his life changed dramatically when he was badly wounded in 1983 during the ASALA attack on the Turkish Airlines counter at the Orly airport outside of Paris. His later growing interest in Central Asia led to his publishing Turkic-Speaking Peoples: 1500 Years of Art And Culture from Inner Asia to the Balkans in 2006.  Early life  Çağatay was born in İzmir on 15 January 1937 to Nazif Çağatay, a lawyer and later senator from the Republican People's Party and his wife Kamran, a housewife. He studied at Robert College in Istanbul from the age of eleven onwards, and upon graduation entered the Faculty of Law at Istanbul University at the instigation of his father, although he himself wished to study painting. Nevertheless, deciding he did not wish to practice law, he got a job in an advertising firm in 1964, working as a \\"copywriter\\"; and, a short time later, in response to an advertisement, found himself embarked on what would be a lifetime career for him: journalism. From 1968 onwards, he complemented his reporting with photography, and worked as a photo-journalist for the Associated Press, and later, from 1974 onwards, for the Gamma Agency in Paris. His articles and photographs started being published in major international magazines. In 1981 and 1982, he worked for the Time/Life magazine group in New York City. His photograph of a liver transplant made the Life cover. Back in Istanbul after that, he worked free lance for the Turkish press as well international news agencies, and his busy schedule required frequent traveling.  Near-fatal bomb  It was during what he thought was just another international trip, as he waited at Paris's Orly Airport on 15 July 1983 with the other 100 and more passengers to board a Turkish Airlines plane, that he became the near-fatal victim of a terrorist bomb, thrown by the Marxist–Leninist ASALA (Armée Secrète Arménienne de Libération de l'Arménie) group. Eight people died as a result, and fifty-six were wounded, among them Çağatay. Having survived but badly burned, he spent the next five years under treatment, frequently visiting burn centers, operated on often, and remaining hospitalized for long periods of time, first in France then in his native Turkey. His first photography project, even before he could return to professional life, was a photo essay he made in 1984 on burned patients in the very same hospital in Paris where he was treated for his wounds.  Change of direction in career  His career changed scope and direction, as he moved from current news to a different kind of photo-reporting: he photographed an extensive selection of old manuscripts found in the Topkapı Museum Library in Istanbul. The photo- essay, the first of its kind on the topic, appeared in leading magazines in France, the United States, Spain, and Japan. In 1990-1991 he started a widespread study of second-generation immigrants in Europe, but due to lack of funds he failed to complete it.  Work in Central Asia  Çağatay began working in Central Asia in 1993. He has traveled so far more than 150,000 kilometers in the region, and taken more than 40,000 photographs. He also did research in the photo archives of the countries of the region and compiled a sampling of these as an extensive photo exhibition entitled “Once Upon a Time in Central Asia” which was on display in the following countries: *Union of Painters, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, May 1966 *State Fine Arts Museum, Almaty, Kazakhstan, June 1996 *Memorial Museum, Austin, Texas, February/March 1997 *Kashiwazaki/Nigata, Japan, October 1997 - January 1998 *Gustavianum Museum, Uppsala, Sweden, November 1999 He has founded the company Tetragon, which published in 1996 a large-format book under the same title as the exhibition. He moreover co-produced a documentary film on the ecological disaster of the Aral Sea. An abbreviated (thirty minutes) version of the two-hour documentary won first prize in 2000 in the \\"short film\\" category at the Antalya Film Festival.  Turkic-Speaking Peoples  Çağatay's long-cherished project was a book that would comprise a selection of photographs he took on Turks living in various parts of the world and scholarly essays by experts to go with the photographs. He asked Doğan Kuban, the renowned professor of architectural history, to be the co-editor in charge of the essays, while he himself was the book's project manager as well as the author of the photographs, some of them of stunning artistic beauty. The book, financed by the Prince Claus Fund of the Netherlands, came out in the fall of 2006 from the German publisher Prestel Verlag in Munich. Distributed in Europe and the US, it quickly sold out and a second printing followed. It was also translated into Turkish and published by Tetragon in 2008. The book includes essays by, besides Kuban, thirty-three other scholars such as Peter Golden, Omeljan Pritsak and İsenbike Togan.  Personal life  One assignment the young journalist Çağatay was given in Istanbul when he started in the late 1960s was to report on a state- operated kindergarten where European advisors worked. Çağatay and Käri Wulff, the Norwegian expert in pre-school education he met there that day, were married in 1972. They have two children, and two grandchildren by their daughter. His younger sister İlgün died on March 3, 1974 whilst a passenger on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 that crashed near Ermenonville in France, shortly after leaving Paris. Çağatay now lives in Istanbul with his wife.  Bibliography  *Çağatay, Ergun. Once Upon a Time in Central Asia. İstanbul: Tetragon, 1996. *Çağatay, Ergun and Doğan Kuban, eds.

They are transcription factors which bind to single stranded DNA in order to regulate gene expression. When a pathogen enters, salicylic acid is released as a signalling molecule which affects Whirly, allowing the expression of defence genes to occur.

The film was a major commercial success and generated a film series consisting of eleven entries starring Tomas Milian as Inspector Nico Giraldi.

Dulaney as Ballarin Production The Cop in Blue Jeans was the first film where Tomas Milian would portray Marshall Nico Grialdi, nicknamed Il Pirata (). The character would go on to be portrayed in 11 films between 1976 and 1984. The producer Galliano Juso recalled that the idea for the character came when Bruno Corbucci and him were making a film titled Il trafficone. While filming, Juso had his purse stolen by thieves on Kawasaki motorcycles. This even led to Corbucci and him to develop a film about an \\"anti-snatch\\" squad. The sequels to the film, Assassinio sul Tevere, Delitto a Porta Romana, Delitto al ristorante cinese, Delitto sull'autostrada, Crime in Formula One and Cop in Drag had little to do with the crime genre, and grew more comedic with each film. Release The Cop in Blue Jeans was distributed theatrically in Italy on 11 March 1976. It grossed a total of 2,013,807,160 Italian lire. Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti stated that it was among the most profitable domestic productions of the year. The film was released on DVD by Raro Video in Italy. Reception From contemporary reviews, Scott Meek of the Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed a 75-minute edit of the film. Meek stated that the film had a fractured plot which \\"maybe largely due to the twenty minutes missing from this version, but it is doubtful if, even in its complete form the story would have been at all coherenet\\" stating the film \\"is aimed, to an almost fetishistic degree, at the lowest common denominator of the young, male, Italian audience.\\" and that film was far too full of \\"sexism, anti-gay jokes and dubbed American dialogue, mostly consisting of unimaginative terms of abuse.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1976 References =Sources= * * External links * Category:1976 films Category:Italian films Category:Films directed by Bruno Corbucci Category:Italian comedy films Category:1970s crime comedy films Category:Films set in Rome Category:Films scored by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis Category:1976 comedy films ","title":"The Cop in Blue Jeans"},{"id":"36646925","text":"Barbey may refer to:  Places  * Barbey, Seine-et-Marne, a commune in France  People  * Aron K.

Along with the films about Angélique it is considered one of the most successful works of this director. Synopsis The film consists of 5 parts. The first part introduces Sylvain, Marquis of Bois-Doré, a companion- in-arms of late king Henry IV of France. Following his sovereign the marquis had to abjure his Calvinist faith and adopt Catholicism though he secretly sympathizes with Protestants. After the king's death he retired and went to his castle of Bois-Doré. The marquis feels deep love for Lauriane de Beuvre, a daughter of his friend and neighbour, 30 years younger than him. Guillaume d'Ars, Sylvain's cousin, introduces to him a certain Villaréal, a Spanish nobleman. The second part concentrates on relations between Bois-Doré, Lauriane, and Villaréal. The latter has found out that the marquis hides in the castle treasures of Protestants and begins to search for them. Besides Villareal pays his addresses to Lauriane. Bois-Doré challenges him to a duel and kills him. The third part tells about Mario, an 18 old youth whom the marquis saved from mercenaries. Mario has striking resemblance to marquis's brother who was lost 18 years ago. Bois-Doré finds evidence of Mario being his nephew and proclaims him an heir to his title and estate. The handsome boy wins Lauriane's affection. The fourth part focuses on relations between Bois- Doré, Lauriane, and Mario. The latter falls in love with Lauriane whose heart is torn by sincere respect for noble, generous but elderly Sylvain and affection to young Mario. The fifth part tells about hostilities between France and Spain, in which Sylvain and Mario take an active part. Mario has been severely wounded in action and Lauriane realizes that she cannot live without him. Reviews The film is distinguished by an entertaining plot, superb acting of G.Marchal (Sylvain) and Y. Folliot (Lauriane), picturesque scenery, and accurate representation of historical background. > “This is an eventful yarn, involving many subplots, it is par excellence the > perfect swashbuckler, which after being popular in the first part of the > sixties in the French theaters became mini-series in the seventies..”Reviews > and ratings.

He is known for his extensive work on copepods, minute crustaceans. Early life and education Charles Branch Wilson was born in Exeter, Maine on October 20, 1861. He received his bachelor's and master's degree from Colby College of Waterville, Maine. He completed his doctorate from the Johns Hopkins University in 1910.Smithsonian Institution Archives, Record Unit 7235, Wilson, Charles Branch, 1861-1941, Charles Branch Wilson Papers Career While completing his master's degree, Wilson worked in Colby as a tutor in botany. In 1891, he was appointed a professor of science at the Gorham Normal School of Gorham, Maine (now the University of Southern Maine). In 1896, he became a professor of natural science at the Westfield Teachers College of Westfield, Massachusetts (now the Westfield State University). A year later he became a professor of biology and the head of the Science Department in Westfield, a position he held until his retirement in 1932. During the summer of the same year, he worked at the Johns Hopkins University marine laboratory in Port Antonio, Jamaica; the first of several such field trips during his career. In the summer of 1899, he worked at the United States Fish Commission's Marine Biological Laboratory, investigating parasitic copepods of food fish. This was the first of a lifelong association with the Commission, which became the United States Bureau of Fisheries in 1902. Among his collaborations with the Bureau were economic surveys of the Lake Maxinkuckee (1906), Mississippi River (1907), Maumee River (1908), Kankakee River (1909), Cumberland River (1911), and the lakes of northern Minnesota (1912). He officially served under the capacity of an economic investigator for the Fairport, Iowa Bureau of Fisheries from 1913 to 1923. From 1928 to 1929, he also assisted in the economic survey of Lake Erie. Wilson's association with the United States National Museum (now the National Museum of Natural History) of the Smithsonian Institution began in February 1901. The museum's entire collection of copepods was entrusted to him for identification and study. Wilson published the results in the museum's publications, the Proceedings of the United States National Museum and the Bulletin of the United States National Museum (both journals have now been discontinued). He was encouraged in his work by the American biologist Waldo L. Schmitt, who joined the staff of the United States National Museum in 1915. Schmitt's work also primarily dealt with crustaceans. Wilson was named an Honorary Collaborator by the museum in recognition of his work in 1933. His greatest works are three monographs on copepods. The first monograph, published in 1928 to 1929, was the most important in Wilson's opinion. It involved a collaboration of the United States National Museum and the Carnegie Institution for Science. It dealt with the copepods in marine samples taken by the ill-fated research vessel Carnegie. The second monograph dealt with the description of six new genera and fifteen new species of parasitic copepods from the museum's collections. The third and the last monograph was on the copepods collected during the voyages of the United States Fish Commission's marine research vessel USS Albatross, from her long voyage into the Pacific Ocean beginning in 1887 to the three-year Philippine Expedition in 1907 to 1910. He described a total of 32 new species and identified the previously unknown opposite sex of 28 other species. Aside from studying copepods and teaching, Wilson also wrote papers on the embryology of amphibians, sipunculid, and nemertean worms; the biology and economic importance of dragonflies, damselflies, freshwater mussels, and aquatic hemipterans and coleopterans; as well as the results of the various surveys of the Bureau of Fisheries.

He is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Education He received a B.S. degree in physics at Seoul National University in 1990, and joined the physics department at University of California, Berkeley where he began to study atomic physics in the lab of Raymond Jeanloz in Berkeley's geophysics department. He worked on a project to place nitrogen and carbon under very high pressures, with the goal to create a material harder than diamonds. During this time, he had to take a temporary leave of absence from Berkeley to South Korea for a year to fulfill South Korea's military service requirements. Upon his return, Ha changed his research interests and joined the lab of Daniel Chemla, a prominent scientist known for his studies of quantum optics of semiconductors. Soon after joining Chemla's group, Ha began working closely with scientist Shimon Weiss to build a near-field scanning optical microscope, a machine equipped with a small aperture and a short-pulse laser able to measure a material's properties with high time and spatial resolution.

The United States, Russia, Taiwan, India, France, Israel, Italy, United Kingdom and China have all developed missile defense systems. Definitions * The term \\"Missile defense system\\" broadly means a system that provides any defense against any missile type (conventional or nuclear) by any country. * Any mechanism which can detect and then destroy a missile before it can cause any harm is called a missile defence system (MDS). The role of defense against nuclear missiles has been a heated military and political topic for several decades. However, missile defense is no longer limited to interception of strategic nuclear weapons. The gradual development and proliferation of missile technology has blurred the line between the technologies for the interception of tactical missiles (usually short to intermediate range with non-nuclear payloads) and the interception of strategic missiles (usually long ranged with nuclear payloads). High-performance tactical ballistic missiles carrying non-nuclear payloads now have the ability to affect strategic balance in conflict zones. Likewise, high-performance tactical missile defense systems can now influence force deployment strategies. France, Italy, and UK HMS Diamond (D34) a Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer equipped with the Sylver A-50 VLS and Aster 15 and 30 missiles. Diamond fired her missiles for the first time during May 2012 successfully intercepting a Mirach drone. The UK, France and Italy developed a programme called PAAMS (Sea Viper in UK). It was developed to arm the Horizon-class frigate (which was a joint programme by the UK, France and Italy) with the best anti-aircraft missile system in the world. Then the UK dropped out of the frigate programme and instead decided to design and build its own Type 45 destroyer which would still use the PAAMS missile system. France and Italy then decided they wanted to extend the programme to include a ground-launched anti-ballistic missile system. France and Italy then developed SAMPT – a truck-launched anti-ballistic missile system which used PAAMS technology. India Two systems are in planning and Testing stages. Air defence network has two principal components – the ‘Air Defence Ground Environment System’ (ADGES) and the ‘Base Air Defence Zones’ (BADZ). The ADGES network provides for wide area radar coverage and permits the detection and interception of most aerial incursions into Indian airspace. The BADZ system is far more concentrated with radars, interceptors, SAMs and AAA units working in conjunction to provide an intense and highly effective defensive barrier to attacks on vital targets. =Ballistic missile defence= Launching of Advanced Air Defense (AAD) missile The Ballistic Missile Defence Program is an initiative to develop and deploy a multi-layered ballistic missile defense system to protect India from ballistic missile attacks. Introduced in light of the ballistic missile threat from Pakistan,The New Guardian India unveils an all new anti-ballistic missile expected to be the fore-runner of a sophisticated air defence system to thwart, among other threats, a Pakistani nuclear weapons attack it is a double-tiered system consisting of two interceptor missiles, namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high- altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception. The two-tiered shield should be able to intercept an incoming missile having a range of up to 5,000 kilometers. PAD was tested in November 2006, followed by AAD in December 2007. With the test of the PAD missile, India became the fourth country to have successfully developed an Anti-ballistic missile system, after United States, Russia and Israel. On 6 March 2009, India again successfully tested its missile defense shield, during which a test \\"enemy\\" missile was intercepted at an altitude of 75 km. On 6 May 2012, it was announced that Phase-I is complete and can be deployed to protect two Indian cities at a short notice. New Delhi, the national capital, and Mumbai, have been selected for the ballistic missile defence shield. After successful implementation in Delhi and Mumbai, the system will be used to cover other major cities in the country. This shield can destroy incoming ballistic missiles with range up to 2,000 km. When the Phase II is completed and PDV is developed, the two anti-ballistic missiles can intercept targets up to range 5,000 km both at exo and endo-atmospheric (inside the atmosphere) regions. Apart from DRDO's endeavour to develop a potent missile defense, India is reportedly examining the Israeli Arrow, the Almaz design bureau's S-300 PMU-1/-2 and S-400 and the Antey design bureau's Antey 2500/S-300VM. India has procured a squadron of S-300V systems which are in use as an 'anti- tactical ballistic missile screen'. India also purchased S-400 system from Russia for 5.4 Billion dollars in 2018. =Cruise missile defence= Defending against an attack by a cruise missile on the other hand is similar to tackling low-flying manned aircraft and hence most methods of aircraft defence can be used for a cruise missile defence system. In order to ward off the threats of nuke-tipped cruise missile attack India has a new missile defence programme which will be focused solely on intercepting cruise missiles. The technological breakthrough has been created with an Advanced Air Defence missile (AAD). DRDO Chief, Dr V K Saraswat stated in an Interview \\"Our studies have indicated that this AAD will be able to handle a cruise missile intercept,\\" Furthermore, India is acquiring airborne radars like AWACS to ensure detection of cruise missiles in order to stay on top of the threat. Barak-8 is a long-range anti-air and anti-missile naval defence system being developed jointly by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India. The Indian Army is considering induction of a variant of Barak 8 missile to meet its requirement for a medium-range surface-to-air air defence missile. The naval version of this missile will have the capability to intercept incoming enemy cruise missiles and combat jets targeting its warships at sea. India has a joint venture for this missile with Israel. On 17 November 2010, in an interview Rafael's Vice President Mr. Lova Drori confirmed that the David's Sling system has been offered to the Indian Armed Forces. Israel An Arrow anti- ballistic missile interceptor. Israel has a national missile defense against short- to long-range missiles using their Arrow missile system. The Arrow or Hetz (, ) is a family of anti-ballistic missiles designed to fulfill an Israeli requirement for a theater missile defense system. Jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States,Dr. Uzi Rubin: \\"The Arrow program used practically no U.S. technology, just U.S. money. It was almost entirely based on Israeli technology, though we bought some components in the U.S. because they were cheaper.\\" (2003) —source development of the system began in 1986 and has continued since, drawing some contested criticism. Undertaken by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Boeing, it is overseen by the Israeli Ministry of Defense's \\"Homa\\" (, , \\"rampart\\") administration and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The Arrow system consists of the joint production hypersonic Arrow anti-missile interceptor, the Elta EL/M-2080 \\"Green Pine\\" early-warning AESA radar, the Tadiran Telecom \\"Golden Citron\\" (\\"Citron Tree\\") C3I center, and the Israel Aerospace Industries \\"Brown Hazelnut\\" (\\"Hazelnut Tree\\") launch control center. The system is transportable, as it can be moved to other prepared sites. Following the construction and testing of the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator, production and deployment began with the Arrow 2 version of the missile. The Arrow is considered one of the most advanced missile defense programs currently in existence. It is the first operational missile defense system specifically designed and built to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles. The first Arrow battery was declared fully operational in October 2000. Although several of its components have been exported, the Israeli Air Defense Command within the Israeli Air Force (IAF) of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is currently the sole user of the complete Arrow system. Arrow 3 was declared operational on Wednesday, 18 January 2017.Israel deploys 'Star Wars' missile killer system Apart from Arrow missile, Israel has Iron dome which is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells fired from distances of 4 to 70 kilometers awaySharp, Jeremy M.

The Russian A-135 anti-ballistic missile system is currently operational only around the city of Moscow, the national capital, and is being augmented to protect major cities in Russia. The A-135 anti-ballistic missile system is a Russian military complex deployed around Moscow to counter enemy missiles targeting the city or its surrounding areas. It became operational during 1995. It is a successor to the previous A-35, and compliant with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2002. The A-135 system attained \\"alert\\" (operational) status on 17 February 1995. It is currently operational although its 53T6 (NATO:SH-11) component is deactivated (as of February 2007). A newer missile is expected to replace it. There is an operational test version of the system at the test site in Sary Shagan, Kazakhstan. The S-300PMU1 and PMU2 can intercept SRBMs, and the S-300V and S-400 Triumf systems are capable of intercepting a multiple IRBM attack by all DF-21 model IRBMs. These air-defense systems have been purchased by Turkey, India, China, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. Other countries which have also expressed interest include Iran and Belarus. The enhanced S-300VM/VMK is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles with a range of 2,500 km re-entry speeds of 4.5 km/s, whereas the S-400 is claimed to be capable of intercepting ballistic missiles with a range of 3,500 km which equates to re-entry speeds of 4.8 to 5 km/s. A system designed to intercept warheads at 5 km/s has the ability to act as a point system against simple ICBM warheads which have a typical re-entry speed of 7 km/s. Apart from the main Moscow deployment, Russia has striven actively for intrinsic ABM capabilities of its late model SAM systems. Russian ground based theatre defence against ballistic and cruise missiles are centered on the in-service *S-300P (SA-10) *S-300V (SA-12A/B Giant/Gladiator) *S-300PMU-1/2 (SA-20A/B Gargoyle) *S-400 (SA-21) *S-500 (In development) United States A Payload Launch Vehicle (PLV) carrying a prototype exo-atmospheric kill vehicle is launched from Meck Island at the Kwajalein Missile Range on 3 December 2001, for an intercept of a ballistic missile target over the central Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Sentinel program was a planned national missile defense during the 1970s, but was never deployed. Elements of Sentinel were actually deployed briefly as the Safeguard Program, although it was not national in scope. United States has had in development a nationwide antimissile program since the 1990s. After the renaming in 2002, the term now refers to the entire program, not just the ground-based interceptors and associated facilities. Other elements yet to be integrated into NMD (National Missile Defense) may include anti-ballistic missiles, or sea-based, space-based, laser, and high-altitude missile systems. The NMD program is limited in scope and designed to counter a relatively small ICBM attack from a less sophisticated adversary. Unlike the earlier Strategic Defense Initiative program, it is not designed to be a robust shield against a large attack from a technically sophisticated adversary. As of 2012, this system is operational with limited capability. In early April 2013, the Pentagon announced plans to deploy 14 more missile interceptors (GBIs) to Alaska in response to the North Korean threats to deliver nuclear weapons to the United States. A THAAD battery was deployed to Guam as well.  China  China tested the FJ ABM in the Cold War but they were ultimately cancelled. The PLA has currently developed the KT series of anti ballistic missiles and also have adopted limited anti ballistic capabilities on the HQ-9, KS series, and HQ-16. China successfully tested its exoatmospheric interception capabilities in a test in 2010 and also in a test in 2013, being the second of two countries able to do so. The anti missile technology is successful to this day. The BMD system was again tested on 8 September 2017 and was deemed successful. Four versions of the S-300 are in service, the PMU, PMU1 and PMU2 and the navalised S-300FM Rif. Based on the S-300PMU1, the Rif equips the PLAN’s two Type 51C Luzhou air-defence destroyers enabling them to contribute to the protection of a coastal site against SRBM attack. The S-300PMU2 has the best chance of intercepting an SRBM missile as it employs the 48N6E2 missile which has a warhead optimised for destroying ballistic missiles, and better kinematics compared to earlier 48N6 missiles. HQ-9 may have some ABM capability.However, it is kinematically inferior to the imported Russian S-300PMU2 Favorit according to this source However, it might be noted that on 11 January 2007 the Chinese successfully performed an anti-satellite missile test using a KT-1described by the director of United States Defense Intelligence Agency as a SC-19 missile missile with a Kinetic Kill Vehicle mounted. New missiles, the HQ-19, HQ-26, and HQ-29, are being built.http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/hq-19.htm  Taiwan  Taiwan operates the Sky Bow family of BMD systems. Development of Sky Bow I began in 1981 with deployment beginning in 1993. The Sky Bow II is an improved version of the Sky Bow I. Both the Sky Bow I and Sky Bow II use a common silo launch system. In 2001 development of the completely new Sky Bow III system began with flight testing commencing in 2009 and deployment soon after. The Sky Bow III has a top speed of Mach 7. A naval variant of the Sky Bow III has also been developed. In addition to the BMD force the Army operates the Antelope air defence system which has a significant anti-cruise missile capability. The ROCAF also operates imported Patriot PAC-3 batteries.

Every JASDF Patriot team participated in the annual exercise, which takes several months.Fort Bliss Bugle (16 Oct 2014) p.12A JASDF 50th year of live-fire missile exercises Since 1998, when North Korea launched a Taepodong-1 missile over northern Japan, the Japanese have been jointly developing a new surface-to-air interceptor known as the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) with the US. So far tests have been successful, and there are planned 11 locations that the PAC-3 will be installed. A military spokesman said that tests had been done on two sites, one of them a business park in central Tokyo, and Ichigaya – a site not far from the Imperial Palace. Along with the PAC-3, Japan has installed the US- developed Aegis ship-based anti-ballistic missile system, which was tested successfully on 18 December 2007. The missile was launched from a Japanese warship, in partnership with the US Missile Defense Agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast. In the 2010s, Japan consulted with the United States to possibly deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and a ground-based version of the Standard Missile-3 interceptors mounted on Aegis destroyers. In a joint US-Japan test of Standard Missile-3 Block IIa, a medium-range ballistic missile was successfully intercepted on 3 February 2017.US-Japan military successfully intercept a ballistic missile target with SM-3 Block IIA Japan's intention is to create a four-stage anti-missile shield.As N.

The agreement came after a North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile launch in June 2016; China has rebuked the actions of the involved parties,S.Korea, U.S. to deploy THAAD missile defence, drawing China rebuke (7 July 2016) as destabilizing. South Korean military sources responded that a 12 February 2017 launch by North Korea represented a new technology, a 'cold launch' using compressed gas before the solid-fuel rocket ignition.

KAMD (Korea Air and Missile Defense) is a multi-platform, short-range air and missile defense concept that South Korea has been developing since 2006 to enhance its protection against DPRK SRBMs, cruise missiles, and light aircraft. South Korea is developed the Cheongung Korean medium-range surface-to-air missile (KM-SAM), intended to intercept DPRK SRBMs and MRBMs at a relatively low altitude, similar to PAC-3. The Korean long-range surface-to-air missile (L-SAM), under development until 2023, will reportedly be similar to THAAD, operating in a high-altitude, terminal-phase intercept role against SRBMs and MRBMs.https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/us-allied-ballistic-missile- defenses-asia-pacific-region =United Arab Emirates= United Arab Emirates (UAE) has graduated its first two American Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) unit classes at Fort Bliss in 2015, and in 2016.UAE graduates second class of THAAD air defenders Its first live-fire exercises with Patriot missiles took place in 2014.

Missile defense would become a reality and that systems would eventually be deployed. Paris realized that it needed to adjust policy to these realities to avoid risking the credibility of the French nuclear deterrent. \\" Nonetheless, Gruselle concedes in the same work that \\"Paris realized that it needed to adjust policy to these realities to avoid risking the credibility of the French nuclear deterrent.\\", as well as the fact that \\"France recognized the necessity of missile defense to protect deployed French troops.\\" That is to say, French policy makers realized that the increasing performance and reliability of missile defense systems could reduce its own nuclear deterrence, and was also necessary to maintain its foreign military deployment Bruno Gruselle (Nov 2010) \\"Missile Defense in NATO: a French Perspective\\" Lisbon NATO Summit, Nov 2010 Some French analysts, notably Camille Grand,Camille Grand, Director, FRS; Chair, EU Non-Proliferation Consortium view missile defense as jeopardizing both the doctrine and the treaty, as well as risking a new arms race, which is reflected in the development of advanced missile defense counter measures and decoys as well as a higher number of and more maneuverable independently targetable reentry vehicles—as well as the intercept systems designed to defeat them. Additionally, experts such as L. David Montague, retired U.S. Air Force General Eugene E. Habiger and Harvey L. Lynch question the reliability of these systems.The Pentagon’s $10-billion bet gone bad, Los Angeles Times Beyond the technical difficulties, which have been described as more challenging than hitting one bullet with another, all performance data is derived from experiments and scripted tests. Their effectiveness in an actual all-out war situation is uncertain. However, non-nuclear ballistic and conventional missiles have been used in recent limited regional conflicts to strategic effect. Several Houthi-fired ballistic missiles in Yemen have been intercepted by Saudi MIM-104 Patriot batteries, and Russian cruise missiles have been notably used in the Syrian Civil War. Gruselle noted most French security experts doubted the technological feasibility of intercontinental ballistic missile defense. Some thought it foolish to spend huge amounts of money on unproven technologies that lacked operational or political usefulness. Instead, the French defense policy community viewed missile defense merely as an American \\"economic weapon\\" used to defeat the Soviet Union and win the Cold War.Bruno Gruselle (2010) \\"Missile Defense in NATO: A French Perspective\\" The extant missile defenses are currently vulnerable to maneuverable hypersonic vehicles, which can maneuver at speeds high enough to defeat missile defenses. China is among the countries pursuing hypersonic vehicles as warhead delivery systems.

He is a left-handed batsman who can play as a wicket- keeper. Cricketing career =County cricket= Duckett made his debut for Northamptonshire in the 2012 Friends Life t20 against Gloucestershire on 8 July 2012, whilst in his first year of A-Levels at Stowe School. During the 2015 season, he scored four centuries in the County Championship, just managing to break the barrier of a thousand first-class runs in the season, with 1002 at an average of 52.73. The 2016 season was one of conspicuous success for Duckett. He began the season with a new highest score of 282 not out against Sussex. He scored three other first-class hundreds during the season, scoring 185, 189 and 205, with a total of 1338 runs at 58.17 and played in the semi-final and final of the Twenty20 Blast for Northants. He finished on the winning side in the final, and had particular success in the semi-final, scoring 84 off just 47 balls, and sharing a 132 run partnership with Alex Wakely. At the end of the season, he was named as the young cricketer of the year by both the Cricket Writers' Club and the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). He was also named PCA Player of the Year, the first player to win both PCA awards in the same season. In March 2019, Duckett scored a double century for Nottinghamshire against Cambridge MCCU during the 2019 Marylebone Cricket Club University Matches from 168 balls. It was the fastest first-class double century by a Nottinghamshire batsman, in terms of balls faced. =National side= Duckett was included in the England Under-19 squad for the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup. In July 2016, he was selected for the England Lions squad for the series against Pakistan A and Sri Lanka A. In the first match, he scored 163 not out off just 104 balls. In the 6th match against Sri Lanka A, he scored 220* off just 131 balls during an unbeaten second wicket partnership of 367 with Daniel Bell-Drummond. International career =2016 Bangladesh= Duckett was selected in the squad for the Test and ODI matches in the tour of Bangladesh. He made his England debut in the first ODI against Bangladesh. He scored 60 as England made 309 to win the game by 21 runs. He was out for a duck in the second game, which England lost. He returned to form in the final game, top scoring for England with 63 to help them chase down Bangladesh's target of 278 and win the match by four wickets to win the series 2-1. Duckett made his Test debut against Bangladesh following his good performances in the ODI side. He scored 14 in the first innings as England scored 293 in their first innings, before making 15 in the second innings as England won by 22 runs. He made seven in the first innings of the second Test, and scored his maiden Test half-century in the second innings, scoring 56, although England lost by 108 runs. =2016 India= He was also selected for the tour to India this time though batting at 4 with Haseeb Hameed opening.

Example of dynamic information of handwritting.Handwritten biometric recognition is the process of identifying the author of a given text from the handwriting style. Handwritten biometric recognition belongs to behavioural biometric systems because it is based on something that the user has learned to do.  Static and dynamic recognition  Handwritten biometrics can be split into two main categories: Static: In this mode, users writes on paper, digitize it through an optical scanner or a camera, and the biometric system recognizes the text analyzing its shape. This group is also known as \\"off-line\\". Dynamic: In this mode, users writes in a digitizing tablet, which acquires the text in real time. Another possibility is the acquisition by means of stylus-operated PDAs. Dynamic recognition is also known as \\"on-line\\".Dynamic information usually consists of the following information: * spatial coordinate x(t) * spatial coordinate y(t) * pressure p(t) * azimuth az(t) * inclination in(t) Better accuracies are achieved by means of dynamic systems. Some technological approaches exist.  Difference from OCR  Handwritten biometric recognition should not be confused with optical character recognition (OCR).

His personal best to date is 68.16m which places him as the Number 2 athlete on the All Time List of Australian discus throwers. Biography Wruck was born in Brisbane, Queensland, on 6 July 1991, to Paul Anthony Wruck, a former high school teacher, and Mary Lou Watkins, a current high school teachers. He attended Our Lady of the Rosary Primary school from preschool to Year 3, followed by Nudgee Junior College until Year 7. In 2004, Wruck began his five years of high school at St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace. Always passionate about sport, Wruck represented his school in rugby, basketball, rowing, and athletics. He attended the Kenmore Little Athletics Club from the age of seven and broke numerous junior shot put records. A shattered tibia during a school basketball game at 15 years of age steered Wruck permanently away from team sports and into the individual athletic throwing events of discus and shot put. He attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock Texas for two years (mid 2009 – mid 2011). He graduated from UCLA on a sporting scholarship and completed a degree in Philosophy while training and throwing in the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12) and NCAA Championships. Achievements Wruck first realized his potential as a discus thrower at the age of 15 when he won the 2007 Australian National All Schools Track and Field Championships with a throw of 58.40m. The following year he was selected to compete in the Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune India where he beat second place-getter England by more than five metres and set a new Australian and Commonwealth Youth record (1.75 kg) with a throw of 60.88m. He concluded 2008 by winning the Pacific Schools Games 17 Years Discus by throwing the 1.5 kg discus 60.43m. This was his launching pad for a U.S. Collegiate scholarship to Texas Tech where the Chancellor, Sen. Robert Duncan, of the University remarked upon his small stature. In 2010, Wruck won bronze at the IAAF World Junior Championships in Moncton, Canada. He was then selected to compete in the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and made the finals despite being Australia’s youngest male Athletics competitor at 19 years and 89 days. He also claimed the Australian U20 Discus record. In his 2011 sophomore year, Wruck won the prestigious NCAA Division 1 Men’s Discus title with a throw of 61.81m. At a meet in Geelong in December 2011, Wruck threw a personal best of 65.78m, 2.3 metres further than his previous PB, which was also a new Queensland record and an Olympic A qualifier. It was at that time the furthest distance thrown by an Australian male discus thrower on Australian soil. Returning to Melbourne for the Olympic selection trials in March 2012, Wruck threw 61.54m in difficult conditions to win the competition, defeating reigning champion Benn Harradine (60.51m), and securing his place on the Australian Olympic team to compete in London that year. Of the 41 competitors in the Men’s Discus at the Olympics, Wruck was third youngest at just 21 years of age. His preparation for the games was greatly hampered by a serious bout of Glandular Fever (Infectious Mononucleosis) which stripped 30 kg from his frame and left him severely weakened. He finished 28th overall. Wruck’s most successful year came in 2013, where in the US College Division 1 system he claimed John Godina’s UCLA and Pac-12 Records, and Hannes Hopley’s all time NCAA record. A big highlight was \\"...his performance at the exhibition Claremont Throws meet the week prior, where he uncorked the best throw ever by a collegian with a 223-7 (68.16m) mark, and won his second NCAA discus title. He finished the season not only undefeated but nearly untouchable in eight collegiate events in 2013, registering the top 27 throws by any collegian in 2013.\\" Finally, after being nominated for the Bowerman Award for the best male Track and Field Athlete of the Year in the US Collegiate system, Wruck was selected as a finalist (final 3) and was voted number one in the Bowerman Fan Vote. In Australia, he claimed his first Open Australian Discus Title with a World Championship A Qualifying distance over 66m, gaining an automatic qualification to the World Athletics Championships in Moscow. At the 2013 IAAF World Athletics Championships Wruck finished in 11th position. In 2013, Julian Wruck ranked 4th on the IAAF world list of Men's Discus Throwers. Julian Edward Wruck's personal best to date (January 2015) is 68.16m (223′ 7″) which places him as the Number 2 athlete on the All Time List of Australian discus throwers.

Antiochis was a daughter of the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great and his wife Laodice. Some time before the war of her father against the Romans she married king Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia,Appian, Syrian War 5 who therefore supported his father-in-law in the battle of Magnesia (190 BC).Livy, Ab urbe condita 37.31.4; Appian, Syric War 32 However, Antiochus III lost the battle. Antiochis bore her husband a son, who was called Mithridates before his accession to the throne and succeeded his father as Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, and two daughters, among them Stratonice, who first married king Eumenes II of Pergamon and afterwards his brother and successor Attalus II Philadelphus. According to the questionable report of the ancient Greek- Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus Antiochis, allegedly an unscrupulous woman, is supposed to have been barren and therefore to have foisted two sons called Ariarathes and Orophernes. Later she is said to have given birth to the above-mentioned three children and to have told the truth to her husband. Thereupon she should have provided her foisted sons with sufficient money and sent the older one to Rome and the younger one to Ionia to make it possible for her legitimate son to succeed his father without difficulties.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 31.19.7; compare Livy (Ab urbe condita 42.19.3), who mentions the arrival of the young Ariarathes in 172 BC in Rome, but does not doubt his legitimacy.

On May 21, 2015 the agency remained as part of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus but changed its name to National Agency for Space Researches. History of Belarusian Space Travel The only two Belarusians in space were Pyotr Klimuk and Vladimir Kovalyonok. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union they worked in Russia. Belarus together with Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are making joint efforts to adapt their existing geoinformation systems to particular applications. However, no formal agreements on cooperation in the development of common Geographic information system are in place. Belarus commenced the construction of a mission control station (MCC) as part of its longterm space programme aimed at expanding cooperation with Roscosmos. This MCC will enable the country to make fuller use of a prospective group of Russian-Belarusian ERS satellites. Belarus, in partnership with Roscosmos, is developing a new high-resolution ERS satellite, the so-called “flying telescope”, which will be placed into orbit in 2015. Having ample infrastructure and qualified personnel at its disposal, Russia remains the main provider of ERS services to other CIS countries like Belarus. A Belarusian ERS satellite is being designed in partnership with Russian companies. It will be launched by Cosmotrans from Baikonur using Dnepr boosters. Negotiations were held between the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus and Roscosmos over Belarus joining GLONASS. In Belarus, space activities were the domain of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. The main space activities of the academy were: * development of ERS spacecraft and advanced space technology and equipment; * development of ground infrastructure for receiving, processing and distributing satellite data and spacecraft control; * development and introduction of space information technology; * development of a satellite communications system; * development of a single geodetic, navigation and time system based on the national ERS system; * space industry personnel training.

On the track he became national champion three times, in addition to nine titles in cross-country. After his active career he became a professor of medicine. Athletic career He was born in Verdal as an older brother of historian Edgeir Benum. He moved to Oslo and represented the club IL i BUL. His personal best times were 8:09.6 in the 3000 metres (1964), 9:19.2 in the 3000 metre steeplechase (1963), 14:06.6 in the 5000 metres (1964) and 29:13.6 in the 10,000 metres (1964).

His only international outing came at the 1964 Summer Olympics, where he placed nineteenth in the 10,000 metres. On the track he became Norwegian champion in the 5000 metres in 1962 and 1964. He also won a bronze medal in 1959 and silver in 1961. He won the 10,000 metres in 1963 ahead of reigning champion Magnar Lundemo, and then took a bronze medal in 1964. By 1964/1965, his teammate and competitor Thor Helland had established himself as dominant in the 5000 and 10,000 metres in Norway. Benum also co-held the Norwegian club record in the 4 x 1500 metres relay. With his club IL i BUL he broke IK Tjalve's record in September 1958 at Bislett stadion with the time of 15:53.4 minutes. Benum and BUL later smashed their own record, clocking in 15:40.0 in July 1959 at the same track. Tjalve later reclaimed it with the time 15:28.4 in 1965. Benum dominated Norwegian cross-country running in the early 1960s. He won the 3 kilometre cross-country championship in 1959, 1962, 1963 and 1964 and took the silver in 1961. In the now-defunct 8 kilometre event he won Norwegian titles in 1962, 1963 and 1964. He also won the road relay Holmenkollstafetten with IL i BUL. As a teenager, Benum was also a decent speed skater with personal bests of 49.1 in the 500 metres (1954), 2.38.8 in the 1500 metres (1952). Medical career Unlike his brother who became a professor of history, Benum studied medicine in Oslo and Bergen. He took the doctorate, the dr.med. degree, in 1974 and specialized in orthopedics. From 1982 he was a professor of medicine at the St. Olav Hospital, connected to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Here he headed the Orthopedics Department for many years, and for his achievements he was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 2006.

Between 1957 and 1961 he was a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, significantly contributing to its relations with the Soviet republics and foreign countries in Asia. He was also the Soviet ambassador to Syria between 1968 and 1977. Biography Mukhitdinov was born in the village Allan near Tashkent in a family of Uzbek farmers. After finishing an Uzbek-language school, in 1934 he was sent to the University of Trade in Moscow. He graduated in 1938 and worked in the Communist Party system, first at a factory in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, and then with the Soviet Army in Ukraine. During World War II he participated in combat and was wounded at the Battle of Stalingrad. He was demobilized in 1946 to assume various party posts in Uzbekistan. In 1948 he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the next year was awarded the Order of Lenin. His party career became volatile in the 1950s. Mukhitdinov was officially reprimanded three times in 1951 by Joseph Stalin for poor management of cotton collection in Uzbekistan; nevertheless, in 1953, Stalin recommended him for election to the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Later in the same year, after the death of Stalin, Mukhitdinov was demoted under pressure from Lavrentiy Beria from the post of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Uzbekistan. His career rose after the removal of Beria in December 1953. Mukhitdinov was reinstated as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Uzbekistan and was First Secretary of the Uzbek Central Committee of the Communist Party from 1955 to 1957. He opposed the attempted demotion of Nikita Khrushchev in 1957, and in return, Khrushchev recommended him to the Presidium, where he was the Secretary responsible for Central Asia. However, by the end of the 1950s, Mukhitdinov developed strong disagreements on planning policies with leading party members such as Mikhail Suslov, Anastas Mikoyan, Frol Kozlov, and later with Khrushchev himself. For example, Mukhitdinov opposed the proposal by Khrushchev to remove the remains of Stalin from the Mausoleum. As a consequence, in 1961 he was demoted from the Presidium and was on the verge of expulsion from the Central Committee, and only his popularity in the native Uzbekistan spared his Party career. He retained his international activities and in 1968-1977 served as the ambassador to Syria, eventually receiving the Order of Friendship. After retirement in 1985 he returned to native Tashkent, where he worked as a government adviser, wrote several books, and died in 2008.

Prime World revolves around a battle between two nations, the Dokht Imperium and the Keepers of Adornia, for control of Prime, a critical resource. Prime is a source of energy; an alien substance that alters the world and gives its users power over it. By controlling heroes, players support their armies, capture new territories and attempt to destroy the enemy's base. Each Prime World player is the lord of his or her own castle, which is both their main base of operations and home to the player’s heroes. At the castle, players can build various buildings, from mining facilities to decorative structures. Players can also create new talents and skills which can be chosen later, enhancing the selected hero's assets for upcoming battles.  Gameplay  Prime World combines PvP and PvE session battles in MOBA style with MMORPG- style persistent character progression. The game uses a castle-building metaphor to display a player's development and a collectible card mechanic for character talents. It has persistent character development between battles and a class system with roles outside of the \\"tank, mage, and healer\\" triad.Christina Gonzalez \\"Prime World Q&A;: Taking MOBA to the Next\\" RTS Guru, 27 February 2012, Retrieved 2012-03-23Ryann Scott \\"Prime World: A Class Act\\" Gamespy, 21 March 2012, Retrieved 2012-03-23 Prime World's main game mode is \\"Borderlands\\", which is a classic MOBA map with three lanes guarded by turrets and two bases. Nival has released four additional PvP game modes: \\"Dragonwald\\", with more PvE-oriented gameplay than Borderlands; the fast-paced \\"Outpost\\" with a single lane; defense-based \\"Homeland\\"; and the zombie-ridden \\"Apocalypse\\". There is also a \\"Shuffle\\" mode, which is similar to Borderlands but with heroes randomly shuffled in a team. At E3 2013, Nival announced two PvE modes: single-player campaign and co-op \\"Challenges\\" missions. Both were available during the open beta weekend in June. There are currently 425 shared talents available in the game, each of which can be won in battle or produced in the castle. Talents can be upgraded up to four times, using other talents as a resource. There are also hero-specific talents that cannot be upgraded – up to nine per hero. This brings the total number of talents to 803. Every hero gets experience points for winning or losing a PvP battle and for winning PvE battles. Losing a PvE battle does not give the player any rewards. Getting enough experience will unlock a new level, allowing the player to permanently upgrade a hero's basic characteristics. As of January 2015, there are 42 heroes to choose from. When the game starts one will be prompted to choose a faction. Most heroes share the same gameplay mechanics for both factions, and are identical except for their appearance. Each faction has one unique hero; Ha'ka and Da'ka belonging to Kingdom of Adornia and Dokht Imperium respectively, they share similar mechanics but have one ability that is different depending on which you choose.Lucas Sullivan. \\"Prime World's heroes give new meaning to \\"red versus blue\\"\\" PC Gamer, March 28, 2012 One of the basic talents that was originally available in the game allowed players of different genders to protect each other if they were playing together, and only if they were each playing a hero of their own previously-specified gender. Another game feature was a different in-game heroes pricing policy for male and female gamers.Ben Kuchera \\"Prime World to charge women less for extra heroes, and offer gender-based bonuses\\" The Penny Arcade Report, April 2, 2012 After much controversy this feature was cancelled and prices became the same for both male and female players. All gender features were later removed from the game as well as the gender indication in the game interface. Prime World uses optional Facebook Connect to allow players to engage with their friends in the game, creating teams and using their help to improve production rates in their castle. History Promotional models at IgroMir 2011 Prime World was developed using the Unity game engine.

The heavily rusticated stone structure, originally with only two floors, was designed by Jacopo Sansovino in place of an earlier mint specifically to ensure safety from fire and to provide adequate security for the silver and gold deposits. Construction began in 1536. Giorgio Vasari considered it the finest, richest, and strongest of Sansovino's buildings (\\"...bellissimo, ricchissimo, e fortissimo edificio de' suoi è la Zecca di Venezia...\\").Vasari, Le vite..., VII (1881), p. 504\\\\. The quote does not appear in the 1568 edition of Vite but was included in an expanded biography of Sansovino written by Vasari after 1570 and republished in 1789. See Gaetano Milanesi's note on page 485. Coin production continued after the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 but ceased in 1852 during the second period of Austrian domination (1814-1866). The building was subsequently adapted and served as the seat for the Chamber of Commerce from 1872 until 1900.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 191 Since 1904, it has housed the main part of the Marciana Library whose historical building, next door, is now largely a museum. Historical background An earlier mint located in the parish of San Bartolomeo across the Grand Canal from the Rialto market was closed and the parcel of land sold by the government in 1112.The mint was located along the Canal della Fava between the churches of San Bartolomeo and San Salvatore. See Stahl, Zecca…, p. 8. The document relative to the sale indicates that the site had been occupied by the mint since 'antiquity', perhaps since the first minting of a local coin, a Carolingian silver penny issued in the name of the emperor Louis the Pious.The coin resembles issues minted throughout the empire from 819-822 in appearance and weight. See Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 3-4. Evidence suggests a subsequent cessation of minting in the mid-twelfth century during which time the coinage of Verona seems to have been used for local transactions while Byzantine coins were used for long-distance trade.Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 8-13. Local minting resumed when ducal coinage was first issued during the reign of Vitale II Michiel (1156-1172)Stahl, Zecca…, p. 13 and increased significantly when the grosso was introduced.Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 16-22 Detail from woodcut Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam by Erhard Reuwich (1486), showing the earlier mint (shaded) in Saint Mark's Square. Frontal view A new silver mint is mentioned as already present in Saint Mark's Square in a resolution of the Great Council in 1278.The deliberation of the Great Council, dated 8 October, obligated merchants to sell silver either at Rialto or in Saint Mark's Square at the Mint or the moneychangers' booths. See Stahl, Zecca…, p. 281 The location, across the Piazzetta from the Doge's Palace, facilitated oversight by the appropriate magistracy, the Council of Forty, and ensured greater security. It also followed a long-standing tradition in Italy that the mint, as a symbol of fiscal autonomy and economic prosperity, be located near the seat of the government.In their architectural treatises both Vitruvius and later Filarete recommended that the mint, or treasury, be situated near the centre of government. Elsewhere in Italy, the Vatican mint was built near the entrance to the Apostolic Palace and the Florentine Mint initially opposite the Palazzo della Signoria and subsequently behind the Loggia de' Signori. See Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 168, note 4. A separate gold mint, probably adjacent to the existing silver mint, was established in 1285 following the introduction of the ducat.Stalh, Zecca…, p. 285 It is referred to in a deliberation of the Great Council, dated that same year, as the Zecca, from the Arabic noun sikka, meaning \\"die\\". By 1290, the name was also used for the silver mint, formerly known by the term Moneta.Stahl, Zecca…, pp.33-34 Over time, these mint facilities were expanded and floors added as demand for coinage increased.Between 1319 and 1339, both the silver and gold mints were expanded. An additional floor to the gold mint was authorized in 1343 to accommodate four additional hearths, but this was eliminated in 1352. See Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 285-286. The Reuwich woodcut (Mainz, 1486) and the de' Barbari engraving (Venice, 1500) show the mint as a single, three-story building with a courtyard behind.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, pp. 182-183Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 282-283. Stahl mistakes the central meat market to the east as a part of the mint. The structure is delimited on all sides: to the west by a canal, to the north by the tenth-century hospice for pilgrims, to the east by a series of hostelries and the meat market, and to the south by a row of lean-to stalls that were rented by the procurators of Saint Mark de supra to vendors of sausage and cheese. Safety concerns within the mint were raised when fire broke out in July 1532.Sanudo, Diari, 57 (1902), col. 516, 7 July 1532 Following an inspection by Doge Andrea Gritti to verify conditions, the Council of Ten, the magistracy responsible for the defence of vital state interests, deliberated on 4 December 1535 that the entire mint was to be rebuilt with stone vaults in order to eliminate the use of wooden beams.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 39.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 182 This decision coincided with a need to add furnaces and increase production following a deliberation of the Council of Ten in 1526 that obligated the government offices dislocated in the subject cities on the mainland to accept only Venetian currency, effectively substituting local currencies for official business. In addition, it was necessary to improve security when after 1528 interest-earning private deposits began to be accepted at the mint as a means of increasing the supply of silver for minting.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 182 For the design of the new mint, three projects were reviewed, and on 28 March 1536, the Council of Ten awarded the commission to Jacopo Sansovino.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino… , p. 39\\\\. The document is in the State Archives of Venice in Consiglio di Dieci, Comuni, reg, II, c. 106.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 183 The architect, as proto (consultant architect and buildings manager) of the procurators of Saint Mark de supra, had already supervised the final stages in the construction of the Procuratie vecchie in Saint Mark's Square following the death of his predecessor Pietro Bon,Pietro Bon, chief consulting architect for the procurators of Saint Mark de supra is often confused with Bartolomeo Bon, chief consulting architect for the Salt Office. For relative documentation and the attribution of various projects, see Stefano Mariani, 'Vita e opere dei proti Bon Bartolomeo e Pietro' (unpublished doctoral thesis, Istituto Universitario di Architettura – Venezia, Dipartimento di Storia dell'Architettura, 1983). but the mint was his first major commission in Venice. Building =Construction= 1536-1548 Independently of the need to provide greater fire protection and security as well as space for increased production, the mint was intended to symbolize Venice's financial recovery from years of famine and war.The second Italian war (1499-1504) largely coincided with the conflict against the Ottomans (1499-1503). The third Italian war lasted from 1508-1516. Conflicts on the mainland began anew in 1521 with the fourth and fifth Italian wars and concluded in 1530. Famine struck in 1527-1528. It was an integral part of the renovatio urbis, the vast architectural programme begun under Doge Andrea Gritti to express Venice's renewed self-confidence and reaffirm its international prestige after the earlier defeat at Agnadello during the War of Cambrai and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian peninsula at the end of the War of the League of Cognac. The programme, which included the library (1537) and the loggia of the bell tower (1538), called for the transformation of Saint Mark’s Square from an antiquated medieval town centre with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient Roman republic and, in the aftermath of the Sack of Rome in 1527, to present Venice as Rome’s true successor.See in general Chambers, The Imperial Age of Venice..., pp. 12–31. Sansovino's understanding of Vitruvian principles and his direct knowledge of ancient Roman prototypes, garnered from his time in Rome, provided the expertise necessary to enact the programme. Tintoretto, Portrait of Jacopo Sansovino (before 1546), Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi. The architect also served as consultant architect for the construction of the Zecca to draw up contracts and to resolve all design-related matters.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 40 Construction began in 1536 and, given the importance of the mint, does not seem to have been hindered by the financial constraints at the time of the Ottoman–Venetian War (1537–1540).Contracts were already awarded in January 1537 for the vaults of a portion of the ground floor, an indication that work had progressed sufficiently. See Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 169, note 13. To raise the 5,000 ducats appropriated for construction, the Council of Ten authorized the freeing of slaves on Cyprus, then a Venetian possession, at 50 ducats a head.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 39Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 183An estimated 23,000 to 24,000 slaves existed on Cyprus. These were descendants of the earlier invaders who had later been enslaved by the Byzantines. For a discussion, see Federico Berchet, 'Contributo alla storia dell'edificio della veneta Zecca, prima della sua destinazione a sede della Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana', Atti del Regio Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, lxix (1909-1910), part II, pp. 339-367. Additional funds were similarly raised in 1539 and 1544. Ultimately, the construction of the mint exceeded initial cost estimates roughly sixfold.By 1558, 28,879 ducats had been spent to complete Sansovino's design. Additional funds in the amount of 1,790 ducats arrived later and were used to finance the additional floor. See Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, pp. 42 and 169, note 31. Since minting operations could not be interrupted, work had to proceed piecemeal, beginning with the charcoal depository on the northern side. In 1539, it was decided to incorporate the lean-to cheese and sausage shops along the embankment into the new structure in order to give greater dignity to the mint façade but also to then extend the upper floor over the shops and provide additional space for the gold mint which was located upstairs for greater security. The shops were subsequently relocated and the space annexed to the mint.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 42Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 184\\\\. The senate deliberation is in the State Archives of Venice in Senato Terra, f. 108, 15 Sept. 1588; PS, b. 33, proc. 67, c. 34-40t. Construction terminated in 1548.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 169, note 24Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, pp. 183-184. The document relative to the closing of the construction site is in the State Archives of Venice in Provveditori di Zecca, Terminazioni, reg. 22, c. 82, 3 Jan 1547 m.v. (= 1548).Sansovino received a final payment on 17 May 1549. See Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 184. 1558 addition Sansovino's original building had only two floors with a low attic above, lit by small rectangular windows. But the attic became unusable during the summer months due to the combined heat of the sun on the leaden roof above and the furnaces below. In 1558, the Council of Ten consequently authorized the construction of an additional floor to be paid for with the remaining funds.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, pp. 42-43Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 184 Although Sansovino was likely consulted for technical and structural aspects, it is improbable that he in fact designed the uppermost floor.The decision to add another floor to the mint coincided with a legal dispute between Sansovino's regular employers, the procurators of Saint Mark de supra, and the mint officials, the provveditori in Zecca, regarding the rightful recipient of the rental income from the sausage and cheese shops that had been incorporated into the mint. In 1554, the Provveditori ordered the tenets to pay the rent to the mint rather than to the procurators as in the past. In the resulting case, the provveditori objected to Sansovino's testimony on the grounds that he was an employee of the procurators and therefore biased. In such tense circumstances, it is unlikely that they would have awarded him the contract for the new floor of the mint. See Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 42, Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 184, and Tafuri, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 72, note 89. =Architecture= Layout of the ground floor with shaded area indicating location of sausage and cheese shops (relocated in 1588). Layout Due to the need to ensure ongoing minting operations during construction, the basic layout of the earlier mint was most likely maintained, activities being momentarily relocated as new sections were built.Howard, Jacopo Sansovino…, p. 40 The area on the ground floor facing the lagoon, separated from the rest of the building by a staircase and a long corridor connecting the water entry along the canal and the land entry onto the Piazzetta, was occupied by the offices of the silver officials and by the furnaces for the smelting and casting of silver. In the rear section, twenty workshops for the production of silver coins were located along the sides of a rectangular courtyard with a cistern for water.The wellhead with a statue of Apollo by Danese Cattaneo is now located in the courtyard of Ca' Pesaro. Sansovino designed these workshops as small spaces so that the closely placed walls would provide adequate support for the heavy stone vaults. Charcoal deposits were located on the far side of the courtyard. The upper floor, destined for the minting of gold coins, was similarly arranged but with larger, and hence fewer, workshops.Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 183 Detail of façade showing rustication of Doric order. Façade To convey a sense of impregnability appropriate to the function of the mint, Sansovino employed for the ground floor heavy rustication which was extended over the Doric order on the floor above. In Venice, such a combination of heavy-cut Istrian limestone and classical orders had already been used by Mauro Codussi for San Michele in Isola (begun 1469) and, in a more muted form, for Palazzo Corner Spinelli (1497-1500). However, it is likely that Sansovino was inspired by the ancient Porta Maggiore built under Claudius (52) and by Giulio Romano's designs for the portal at Villa Madama (1519) as well as for his own residence at Macel de' Corvi (1523-1524) with which Sansovino would have been familiar from his second period in Rome (1516-1527).Howard, The Architectural History of Venice, p. 145Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 189 Significantly, Sebastiano Serlio, in his seven-volume architectural treatise Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva, considered the solution of clean-cut capitals and bases with crude, rusticated columns to represent great strength and to be appropriate to a fortress.Serlio, Regole generali di architetura..., fol. XIIIv The windows on the Doric level, originally protected by heavy iron grilles, are fit tightly between the engaged columns with no exposed surface, creating the impression that they are deeply recessed in a thick wall and contributing further to the sense of impregnability. The effect is enhanced by the massive, protruding lintels above. The floor that was later added employs the Ionic order, and although it continues the rustication, the exposed walls around the windows and the delicate tympanums overhead contrast with the design of the original structure and diminish the overall massive feel. Entry The heavily rusticated entry portal, flanked by two telamons supporting a Doric entablature, was subsequently incorporated into the seventeenth arcade of the library.Giulio Lorenzetti erroneously ascribes the design of the entry to Vincenzo Scamozzi, Sansovino's pupil, in Itinerario sansoviniano in Venezia (1929), but as the entry is already mentioned by Francesco Sansovino in Tutte le cose notabili che sono in Venetia (1556), prior to Scamozzi's superintendence of the library, it should be ascribed to Sansovino. See Morresi, Jacopo Sansovino, p. 184. In the resulting passageway, two colossal statues, carved by Girolamo Campagna and Tiziano Aspetti, were placed. Mint staff and officials Production Minting activity fluctuated throughout the year according to the availability of bullion and the commercial needs of the merchants but was most intense in spring and early summer when, after the snow in the Alps had melted, German merchants brought silver and gold to the city and the departing merchant-galley fleets required large amounts of coinage for trade in the East.Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 369-370 The number of employees consequently varied, but in addition to the salaried gastaldi (foremen), fabri (blacksmiths who forged dies), intaidori (die engravers), pexadori (weighers), and fanti (unskilled workers with menial tasks), the staff routinely included skilled labourers paid at a piecework rate: afinadori (refiners), fondadori (casters who cast blank flans), mendadori (emenders who controlled the prescribed weight tolerances), and stampadori (moneyers who struck coins) for both the silver mint (lower floor) and the gold mint (upper floor).See Stahl, Zecca…, pp.320-353 for a description of mint operations. Estimates for the medieval mint place the workforce at around 225 individuals, making the mint the second largest single employer after the Arsenal, the government-operated shipyards.Stahl, Zecca…, p. 320 * Massari alla moneta e Massari all'oro e all'argento The technical operations were coordinated by the Massari alla moneta e Massari all'argento e all'oro (mintmasters, separate for silver and gold). Usually of noble status, the Massari were responsible for acquiring bullion, supervising manufacture, and distributing newly minted coins.For the duties of the mintmasters, see Stahl, Zecca…, pp. 245-255. See also Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 114. Oversight Painting of a Provveditore in Zecca escorting bullion to the Zecca by Marco Vecellio (Senate Hall, Doge's Palace) In addition, several magistracies existed to provide oversight: * Provveditori in Zecca The Council of Ten was ultimately responsible for the control of the mint in consideration of its vital interest for the security of the state. But beginning in 1522, supervisory functions were assigned to a magistrate, chosen from among the Council membership, with the title of Provveditore in Zecca. Initially charged with the acquiring and minting of gold and the refining of silver, the Provveditore quickly assumed responsibility for the general direction of the mint. In addition, the Provveditore was responsible for dispensing government funds that were deposited in the mint to the subject cities and to the army. In 1562, the number of members of the Magistracy was increased to two and in 1572 a third was added. Following the reform of the Council of Ten in 1582, the magistracy came under the jurisdiction of the Senate.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, pp. 114-115 * Depositario Created in 1543 by the Council of the Ten, the Depositario was responsible for the mint’s cash accounts. The Depositario also maintained accounts for private capital deposited in the mint and ensured that the funds were not misappropriated by the government.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, pp. 115-116 * Provveditori a ori e monete The Provveditori a ori e monete were created in 1551 to ensure that gold, whether coined or not, was not sold at a price other than the official rate fixed by the government.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 115 * Provveditori sopra ori e argenti Created in 1585, the Provveditori sopra ori e argenti intervened in cases of money exchanged at other than face value.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 116 * Conservatore dei pubblici depositi The office of the Conservatore dei pubblici depositi was made permanent in 1592 with the responsibility for the reserve funds of the state that were kept in the mint.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 116 * Provveditore alli prò Instituted in 1639, the Provveditore alli prò oversaw the payment of interest on the private funds deposited in the mint.Milan and others, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 116 Notes  References   Bibliography  * Cappelletti, Giuseppe, Storia delle magistrature venete (Venezia: Grimaldo, 1873) * Chambers, David, The Imperial Age of Venice 1380-1580 (London: Thames and Hudson, 1970) * Howard, Deborah, The Architectural History of Venice (London: B.

The program was a cross between a comedy show, a talk show, a game show and a mockumentary. Hosted by Bart De Pauw and Tom Lenaerts viewers were shown three video reports about three different topics. The people in the studio and viewers at home had to vote whether they believed each individual video to be real or staged. In between these reports hidden camera segments and comedy sketches were shown. At the time Schalkse Ruiters was notorious for their sensational reports, unpredictable atmosphere and enjoyable comedy. The final episode of the first season, when managing director of the Vlaamse Radio-en Televisieomroep (Flemish Public Radio and Television) Bert De Graeve was their guest, was watched by 2.166 million people. A ratings record that stood for decades, until it was surpassed by De Slimste Mens ter Wereld in 2012. The second season continued the high ratings. Schalkse Ruiters made Bart De Pauw, Tom Lenaerts, Michiel Devlieger, and the comedy character de Man van Melle (The Man from Melle) famous to a huge audience. Concept The show also started with images of De Pauw and Lenaerts riding horses through a green field while soundtrack music from the film Flight of the Intruder by Basil Poledouris was playing. As they enter a peasant's village they are cheered as heroes. In the second season a similar intro was used, but set at the beach. Schalkse Ruiters worked from the principle that viewers shouldn't always believe everything they see on television to be real. That's why each episode showed three reports about which their special guest, the studio audience and the viewers at home had to guess whether they were real or fake. The studio audience (named Klein Vlaanderen (Small Flanders) by them always received a few seconds time to vote. When the time was up the hosts instantly checked how many of them had voted \\"true\\" or \\"not true\\". The show was broadcast every Sunday evening and had a different special guest each episode. His or her identity was kept a secret until the broadcast itself. In between the reports De Pauw and Lenaerts made jokes and showed sketch movies starring themselves. They often poked fun at the central host by showing archiving footage or hidden camera footage. Once again real footage was mixed in with staged footage. Whether the reports were real or not was only announced in the second part of the show. The first part was broadcast between 20.30 h and 21.30 h. Afterwards an episode of the police TV series Heterdaad was broadcast. When this was over, usually around 22.30h, the second part followed in which the correct answers were announced and which viewer at home won the full-screen television set that episode. Sometimes viewers at home where asked to contribute something for the next episode. Usually these actions were part of a segment called Red Michiel (Save Michiel), named after Michiel Devlieger, the man whom De Pauw and Lenaerts usually used for these viewers' requests. The segment made its debut in the third episode of the first season. History Schalkse Ruiters started in December 1996 on TV1 (nowadays Eén) and starred Bart De Pauw and Tom Lenaerts as hosts. Originally Mark Uytterhoeven was set out to be one of the co-hosts, but he backed off again at the last moment.https://www.hln.be/nieuws/binnenland/vijf-dingen-die-je-nog- niet-wist-over-de-schalkse-ruiters~a5568434/ De Pauw was a well known media star to certain audiences as actor and scriptwriter of the comedy series Buiten De Zone (1994-1996), while Lenaerts was well known since Uytterhoeven's improvisation show Onvoorziene Omstandigheden (1994). Since both men were relatively unknown TV stars Schalkse Ruiters only reached a small number of viewers. It wasn't until after the second episode when the show grew out to be a hype. During the third report both hosts had managed to illegally get across all security controls of the Belgian airport Zaventem by using fake uniforms, forged badges and even sat in the cockpit of a Boeing before eventually sneaking out the airport again without anyone noticing something strange.Bart and Tom breaks into Zaventem. The next day this broadcast was a huge media event and even made the news. It generated a huge discussion about the safety of the national airport.Sécurité à l'aéroport de Zaventemhttps://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20161207_02613729/schalkse-ruiters-20-jaar- geleden-schreven-tom-lenaerts-en-bart-de-pauw-tv- geschiedenishttp://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/cultuur%2Ben%2Bmedia/media/1.2831306 All this publicity caused their viewership to skyrocket, never to leave them again. By the time the first season ended, in March 1997, a second season became much-requested. It eventually was broadcast between 7 December 1997 until February 1998 to the same high ratings. Running gags The show had numerous running gags, of which the Man van Melle was the most well known. This was a character played by De Pauw who wore a curly wig, fake moustache and a raincoat. He always appeared at least once in one sketch of every episode, where he always tried to get attention and begged attractive women to write him since he was \\"so lonely\\". He always concluded by naming his address, the Koekoekstraat nr. 70 in Melle. Melle is a real Flemish village, but there was no street of that name when the series was broadcast. At a certain point the city council decided to name one of their new streets Koekoekstraat and painted a door with house number 70 on the wall.https://www.hln.be/regio/melle/meer-volk-bij-barbier-dan-in-kerk-waarom- geen-barbierstraat~a56ec2ca/https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blabr_20110221_001 In the 10th episode of the first season the Man van Melle interviewed Pamela Anderson. Stunts * Lenaerts and De Pauw tried to convince Bert De Graeve, then Vice-President of VRT, to appear as guest in their show. This was a running gag from the very first episode. In the penultimate episode of the first season they asked their viewers to hang banners, signs, logos and all kinds of other ways to get De Graeve's attention and convince him to appear in their show. Within that very week the slogan could be read anywhere, even on streetcars and buses. Eventually De Graeve did turn up in the final episode of that season, broadcast on 2 March 1997, breaking TV ratings records.http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/20-jaar-schalkse-ruiters- hoe-twee-twintigers-tv-geschiedenis-schreven/article-longread-821091.html * Association football player Franky Van der Elst won the Belgian Golden Shoe in 1996. But it the object was stolen from his house and in an interview he insinuated that Schalkse Ruiters may have stolen it. At first De Pauw and Lenaerts denied this, but during the seventh episode of the first season the camera zoomed behind their desk and revealed that the award was indeed stolen by them, but with Van der Elst being in on the stunt. * During the tenth episode of the first season De Pauw and Lenaerts alluded that they might have won the TV award Gouden Oog, which had been organized on rival channel vtm the evening before, but was only broadcast one day later, during their TV show. During one of the voting rounds the camera zoomed behind their desk to reveal that both awards were indeed there. This was all minutes before this was announced during the Gouden Oog broadcast on vtm. * During the final episode of the first season it was revealed that De Pauw and Lenaerts had sung the lyrics to the pop song \\"Ogen Zo Groen\\" by the band B-Boys, while the artists themselves merely playbacked. This made audiences far more interested in the song than they had been before. * A few months before the second season De Pauw and Lenaerts once again made news headlines. They had been caught making a TV commercial for the Belgian beer brand Stella Artois which was broadcast on vtm. The commercial showed two Russian sailors leaving their ship and being brought to a pub where they are greeted with two pints of beer. The sailors were in fact De Pauw and Lenaerts in disguise and their \\"Russian\\" was in fact Dutch, but played in reverse. When played in normal conditions their entire dialogue was in fact a hidden message where they revealed who they really were and asked viewers to watch Schalkse Ruiters. VTM had no idea of this stunt and when they found out it was a hoax the commercial was instantly pulled from the air again. De Pauw and Lenaerts had intended this commercial to be broadcast during the first episode of their next season, when the head of vtm, Mike Verdrengh, would be their special guest. Months later during that episode Verdrengh was indeed their guest and they admitted that they had been caught. After showing the clip to the viewers again, De Pauw joked that they had other hidden commercials too, but this was merely a parody of a popular Coca-Cola commercial starring the Man Van Melle instead of an attractive Coca-Cola delivery boy. * In the third episode of the second season an unknown Flemish man was invited as their co-host, instead of a famous one: Luc Vande Walle. He was selected through a broadcast of the radio show Hallo Hautekiet. Awards Schalkse Ruiters won Humo's Prijs van de Kijker both in 1996 and 1997. In 1997 it was also awarded De HA! van Humo, along with Terug naar Oosterdonk.http://www.humo.be/humo-archief/316981/lofrede-van-de-redactie-de- ha-van-humo-2014-gaat-naar-de-ideale-wereld-2013 Dutch remake In 1998 Dutch TV channel RTL 4 created a Dutch TV remake starring Bas van Werven and Romel van Tiel, but was no huge success. De Pauw and Lenaerts claimed it copied their format too closely, down to the colour of their sweaters. Another remake, De Firma List & Bedrog, was hosted by Irene Moors a few years later. Sequel In the spring of 2001 De Pauw and Lenaerts returned with a new comedic talk show named Mannen op de Rand van een Zenuwinzinking. The show had a different concept and talked about how men could please women nowadays. Although it wasn't announced as a sequel to Schalkse Ruiters many viewers still regarded it as such, merely because it was hosted on Sunday evenings again and hosted by De Pauw and Lenaerts again in a somewhat similar TV studio with sketches and hidden camera reports. Archive footage from this show is still often confused with that from Schalkse Ruiters.

There are ongoing patent wars between the world's largest technology and software corporations. Contemporary patent wars are a global phenomenon, fought by multinational corporations based in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Patent wars have occurred in a wide range of technologies, both in the past and in the present. History Patent wars are not a new phenomenon. In the Wright brothers patent war, the Wright brothers, attributed with the invention of the airplane, sought to prevent competitors from manufacturing airplanes through litigation, stifling the development of the American airline industry. Alexander Graham Bell, credited with inventing the telephone, was dragged into a patent war against his rivals, which involved, in just 11 years, 600 lawsuits. One notable case was Bell's lawsuit against Western Union. Western Union was backed by Elisha Gray, also credited with inventing the telephone. The occurrence of patent wars has been shaped by the digital age, as the rapid pace of innovation makes much of the patent system obsolete. In the 1980s, technology corporations in the United States and Japan engaged in a patent war, creating a scenario where companies were forced to \\"fight patent with patent.\\" This bilateral patent war, partly exaggerated by the media, subsided by the mid 1990s. Exacerbating the frequency of patent wars was the advent of patent trolling. The term \\"patent troll\\" was coined in the 1990s by the employees of Intel and popularized by Intel's Peter Detkin. According to Detkin, Intel was \\"sued for libel for the use of the term 'patent extortionists' so I came up with 'patent trolls...a patent troll is somebody who tries to make a lot of money off a patent that they are not practicing and have no intention of practicing and in most cases never practiced.\\" During the 1990s, federal courts began reversing earlier decisions made by the patent office that restricted the patenting of software. In 1997, software companies Trend Micro, Integralis, McAffee and Symantec fought a patent war over antivirus software. In 1999, a patent for \\"one-click ordering technology\\" led to a patent war between Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble. In 2004, Sony and Kodak engaged in a patent war over digital cameras, a dispute which lasted until 2007. The current smartphone wars started in the late 2000s. According to PC Magazine, Apple brought the patent wars to the smartphone market by its desire to \\"go thermonuclear\\" on Google's competing Android operating system for mobile devices. This triggered a \\"war\\" between major technology companies in the mobile market. Apple has been accused of having links to the company Digitude Innovations, which has been labeled as a patent troll. Following this warfare, Apple itself has also been called a patent-troll. Alexander Graham Bell was involved in a patent war over the invention of the telephone. Effects and response Patents are intended to protect intellectual property and encourage innovation, granting innovative companies a temporary competitive advantage over their rivals; however, patents have been used offensively through threats of litigation. This forces companies to allocate time and money that could have been better spent on research and development. Businessweek has written that \\"only lawyers win in patent wars.\\" There are numerous proposals aimed at reducing the risk of patent wars. Twitter announced in 2012 an \\"Innovator's Patent Agreement\\" promising not to use its patents opportunistically and without the consent of the company's employees. There have been commentators favoring abolishing patents entirely, outside of the industries that require them.

It was initiated by waste collectors seeking higher wages and better conditions. They were joined by sewer workers, zookeepers, prison guards, highway workers, recreation & parks workers, animal control workers, abandoned vehicles workers, and eventually by police officers. Trash piled up during the strike, and, especially with diminished police enforcement, many trash piles were set on fire. City jails were also a major site for unrest. The Baltimore strike was prominent within a wave of public sector strikes across the United States. All of the striking workers were members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a relatively radical and expanding national union. AFSCME President Jerry Wurf attained national notoriety for allegedly urging workers to \\"let Baltimore burn\\" if their demands were not met. Background In the 1960s, a combination of civil rights struggles, white flight, and the loss of manufacturing jobs led Baltimore's African American population to gain an increasing share of the city's public sector jobs. However, many of these jobs did not pay a living wage, and the workers were not allowed to unionize until after the turbulent events of spring 1968 (see Memphis Sanitation Strike and Baltimore riot of 1968). The city itself, losing many tax-paying residents to the suburbs, was already suffering from budget shortfalls and beginning to shift toward privatization of services. The 1971 election of Mayor William Donald Schaefer consolidated this trend and signaled the erosion of what small gains in black control had already been won. The 1960s and early 1970s saw radicalization among public sector workers across the United States. In many cities, following a pattern similar to Baltimore's, these workers became politicized and began to demand collective bargaining rights. Many joined AFSCME, under the new leadership of Jerome Wurf. Blue-collar city employees were paid about $3.00 an hour, with the prospect of a 20 cent raise in the 1975 budget. Workers also complained about a strict policy on absences, according to which a worker could be fired after missing eight days. 1974 had already seen a strike from sanitation workers in nearby Baltimore County. And a February teachers' strike had made striking seem like a real possibility. Tension rose when the city offered a new contract in June 1974. A snowballing strike On Sunday, June 30, 700 workers voted to accept the city's planned raise at a union meeting. On Monday, July 1, 1974, about 1000 sanitation workers, unsatisfied with the contract, walked off their jobs. The strikers demanded raises of 50 cents instead of 20 cents (from $3.00 an hour to $3.50 an hour), and a new policy on absences. They were soon joined by some sewer workers and by 200 highway workers. On July 3, highway workers voted unanimously to join the strike, bringing their contribution to 600 and the total number of striking workers to nearly 2,500. On July 9 the strikers were joined by 350 guards from the Baltimore City Jail, who walked off their jobs at 7AM, leaving control to 25 high-ranking officers. At this point the strikers numbered 3,000. =Strike activities= Striking workers set up picket lines at city dumps and sewer yards. As more workers joined the strike picket lines were established at other workplaces, including the city jail and the zoo. Not all work during the strike was completely stopped. Striking zookeepers continued to feed their animals, even as they refused to clean up the resulting fecal matter. Slogans included \\"No cash, no trash\\". Strikers held signs reading \\"I Am Somebody\\" and \\"I Am a Man,\\" reminiscent of the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike. At the War Memorial Plaza demonstration, the crowd chanted \\"They say landfill, we say no: City Hall's where garbage goes.\\" =Police strike= Baltimore police also disputed the new contract, and, encouraged by the other striking workers, they began \\"job actions\\" on July 7. These included the writing of detailed reports of miscellaneous objects on the street, as well as an unusually high number of traffic stops. On July 11, Police Local 1195 (also affiliated with AFSCME) voted to strike, and most officers on the night shift walked off. The walkout added urgency to the strike and the magnified national attention directed towards it. =Prison disturbances= After the prison guards went on strike, inmates were left with little supervision. They were confined to their cells for long stretches of time and all criminal trials were postponed. A council of 16 inmates argued that their right to due process was being violated. They accused the striking guards of wishing to provoke mayhem (to demonstrate the chaos that would occur in their absence). Finally, the council asked for certain supervisors to be kept away from prisoners, and demanded self-governance for inmates. On July 13, three or four replacement supervisors were taken hostage in a roomful of juvenile inmates demanding their freedom. Nonstriking policeman intervened with dogs and nightsticks, apparently rejecting an offer of assistance from the striking guards. Police said that adult inmates helped end the uprising. Two guards and two inmates were injured. (When the guards ended their strike, they were met with another prison uprising, which was suppressed with tear gas and riot gear.) =Other incidents= Nine sanitation workers were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct on July 7 when they stood in the way of a bulldozer sent to move trash. On July 10, 60 supporters of the strike held a demonstration in War Memorial Plaza outside of city hall. After several people had spoken to the group, demonstrators began to disperse trash from bags they had brought. They soon met with twelve club-wielding police officers. Eleven demonstrators and The Baltimore Sun photographer Irving H. Phillips, Jr., were arrested on littering charges. Sixteen jail guards and a union organizer were arrested (also on July 10) for preventing supervisors from entering the jail. There were increased reports of fires during the strike, especially during the last few days when the police were also on strike. Before the police strike, reports of trash fires were somewhat localized to Cherry Hill. Arson was the major reported crime throughout, with a wave of looting directly after the police walkout. These troops were outfitted with riot weapons but wore soft hats instead of helmets. Government response =Mayor Schaefer= Mayor Schaefer immediately threatened to fire all of the striking workers and hire new others, saying \\"there's just no more money. No way.\\" He promised to break the strike quickly and announced the opening of dumps to the public. After about a week, Schaefer mobilized 350 of the city's white-collar workers as strikebreakers to pick up trash. These workers (\\"Schaefer's Raiders\\" ) were paid time-and-half for overtime, based on their typically higher salaries. They used small dumping areas that were changed daily so as to avoid the strikers. =Circuit Court= Judicial proceedings surrounding the strike took place mostly in the Mitchell Courthouse downtown. The Court dealt with three AFSCME leaders: Ray Clarke, president of Local 44; Ernest Crofoot, director of the regional Council 67; and P.J. Ciampa, a field director from the (inter)national union who had organized (and been maced) during the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike. On the night of Tuesday, July 2, Circuit Judge James W. Murphy declared the strike illegal and issued an injunction against the garbage collectors. On Saturday July 6, Murphy fined Local 44 $15,000 for every day the strike continued after Monday July 8. On Tuesday the 9th he issued another injunction against other departments newly on strike. On July 10, Judge Murphy announced that he was prepared to enforce the $15,000 immediately and each following afternoon. Murphy was then informed that Local 44 had only $6000, which he then confiscated. On Friday, July 12, Murphy froze the union's assets (around $5000) and threatened to increase the fines against the union and its leaders unless the workers returned to their jobs. He also threatened to jail the three union leaders if the strike did not end, giving Monday, July 15 as the deadline. Union involvement The municipal strike started out as a wildcat action, in protest of a contract that the union had just accepted. However, unions soon claimed credit and responsibility, and it was ultimately union negotiators who ended the strike. =AFSCME= AFSCME Local 44 initially asked the strikers to return to work. By the morning of Tuesday, July 2, AFSCME leadership on all levels had endorsed the strike. Many workers were upset that the union had backed the city's contract, and hung an effigy of Local 44's president, Raymond H. Clark. On July 5, President Wurf, Secretary-Treasurer Bill Lucy, and two other officials from the union were arrested for blocking cars from entering landfills. Clark and union area director Ernest Crofoot both subsequently suggested to the city and to the media that the strike might turn violent, and that the union would be unable to control this violence. Police involvement increased the stakes for AFSCME, which had the potential to unionize police locals around the country. =AFL–CIO= AFSCME is part of the AFL–CIO, which has its own regional representatives in Baltimore. The regional AFL–CIO established a welfare fund to help striking workers who missed paychecks. =CMEA= The Classified Municipal Employees Association (CMEA), a union for white-collar city workers in Baltimore, did not back the strike; indeed, its members had been paid overtime to act as strikebreakers. CMEA leadership downplayed their union's responsibility, stating that individuals had made their own decisions to pick up trash during the strike. Resolution Negotiations were fruitless for most of the strike. The police walkout quickly spurred long negotiations, with both locals, at the Lord Baltimore Hotel. These negotiations were tightly controlled by AFSCME leadership from outside Baltimore. According to The Baltimore Sun reporter Tom Horton, they were also confusing, frustrating, and substantially fueled by alcohol. By July 14, negotiators had apparently come slightly closer, with the city offering 25 cents instead of 20 and the union asking for 40 cents instead of 50. Some expressed fears that the police union would capitulate too quickly to the city's demands. In fact, Local 44 came to an agreement first, on July 15. The total negotiating time had been 43 hours. The city agreed to an incremental raise of 70 cents per hour over the next two years, starting with an immediate raise of 25 cents per hour. The city also agreed to negotiate a new system for reckoning absences. According to these terms, annual salary for a starting full-time waste collector would be about $7,800. The city also promised full medical coverage and no reprisals for the strikers. Some of the strikers returned to work late on that day. None of the union leaders were jailed. The charges against Wurf and Lucy were dropped in November. Aftermath Judge Murphy fined the union $90,000, to be paid out of workers' checks (a cost of approximately $9 per worker). Mayor Schaefer promised that \\"taxpayers are not going to pay for one red cent for this year's settlement,\\" suggesting that 300 public sector workers would be laid off to accommodate the raise. 60–70 prison guards walked off their jobs on July 18 in reaction to the suspension of 23 guards for striking. The suspension decision was reversed that night. Members of the CMEA rejected a merger with AFSCME in August, expressing dissatisfaction with the strike. Governor Marvin Mandel, in the midst of a campaign for re-election, took some flak from labor leaders for his role in the strike (backing Schaefer and Pomerleau). The Baltimore police force was understaffed for at least the rest of the year and reported substantial increases in crime. AFSCME was the major negotiator for municipal workers when their contracts were renegotiated in 1976. It negotiated a 4% raise for municipal workers; the city also agreed to impose mandatory fees for non-union workers who benefited from the negotiations. This bargain was not popular with the workers themselves, many of whom shouted and screamed at president Ray Clarke after his announcement.

It also recommended that most of the 50,000 illegally built structures in these villages should be legalized and that a committee be set up to hear and settle Bedouin claims relating to traditional land ownership. The Commissions report was regarded as progressive by advocates for Bedouin rights in Israel.

Lagenids first appear in the Upper Silurian and continue to the Recent. They are currently divided into two superfamilies, the older Robuloidacea which range from the Upper Silurian to the Lower Cretaceous (Albian) and the younger Nodosariacea, ranging from the Permian to Recent. Taxonomic history Lagenida (suborder Lagenina in Loeblich and Tappan 1988) is an emendation of the rotaliid superfamily Nodosariacea, removing it from the Rotaliina in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (Loeblich and Tappan, 1964) and combining it with the Robuloidacea, named by Reiss, 1963, to form a new order Lagenida. Robuloidacea includes families previously included in the Fusulinida and found in either of the superfamilies Parathuramminacea and Endothyracea. Provided that robuloidaceans did actually give rise to nodoceriacea in the Triassic, the ultimate ancestry of Lagenida can be found within Fusulinida, but not the better known Fusulinacea. Test morphology Shells (tests) of Lagenida are generally serial in form, with chambers in a line. They may be unilocular with chambers singularly one after the other, or in sets of twos or threes, (bilicular or trilocular). Some trochoidally coiled forms are known. Some have later chambers that are flared out like a fan, others are shaped like leaves. Lagenida differ from Rotaliida in the manner in which new septa are formed. In both, when a new chamber is formed a new layer of material is added to the outer surface of the entire shell. In the Lagenida, that layer is used to form only the last, or new, septum. All septa remain monolamellar. In the Rotaliida the outer layer not only forms the final septum, but also coats the front of the previous septum, so that only the final septum in monolamellar.

A window of vulnerability (WOV) is a time frame within which defensive measures are diminished, compromised or lacking. The understanding of social and environmental vulnerability, as a methodological approach, involves the analysis of the risks and assets of disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly. The approach of vulnerability in itself brings great expectations of social policy and gerontological planning. Common applications In relation to hazards and disasters, vulnerability is a concept that links the relationship that people have with their environment to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them. “The concept of vulnerability expresses the multi-dimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster”. It is also the extent to which changes could harm a system, or to which the community can be affected by the impact of a hazard or exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally: \\"we were in a vulnerable position\\". Research Within the body of literature related to vulnerability, major research streams include questions of methodology, such as: measuring and assessing vulnerability, including finding appropriate indicators for various aspects of vulnerability, up- and down scaling methods, and participatory methods.Villa-gran, Juan Carlos. \\"Vulnerability: A conceptual and methodological review.\\" SOURCE. No. 2/2006. Bonn, Germany. Vulnerability research covers a complex, multidisciplinary field including development and poverty studies, public health, climate studies, security studies, engineering, geography, political ecology, and disaster risk management . This research is of importance and interest for organizations trying to reduce vulnerability – especially as related to poverty and other Millennium Development Goals. Many institutions are conducting interdisciplinary research on vulnerability. A forum that brings many of the current researchers on vulnerability together is the Expert Working Group (EWG). Researchers are currently working to refine definitions of “vulnerability”, measurement and assessment methods, and effective communication of research to decision makers.Birkmann, Joern (editor). 2006. Measuring Vulnerability to Natural Hazards – Towards Disaster Resilient Societies. UNU Press.Wolters, M., Kuenzer, C., 2015: Vulnerability Assessments of Coastal River Deltas – Categorization and Review. Journal of Coastal Conservation, DOI 10.1007/s11852-015-0396-6 Types =Social= In its sense, social vulnerability is one dimension of vulnerability to multiple stressors (agent responsible for stress) and shocks, including abuse, social exclusion and natural hazards. Social vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organizations, and societies to withstand adverse impacts from multiple stressors to which they are exposed. These impacts are due in part to characteristics inherent in social interactions, institutions, and systems of cultural values.Luis Flores Ballesteros. \\"What determines a disaster?\\" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 11 Sep 2008. http://54pesos.org/2008/09/11/what- determines-a-disaster/ See also Daniel R.

It is in place before the symptoms of psychological disorders start to appear, such as high neuroticism, and after the individual encounters a stressful experience, the cognitive vulnerability shapes a maladaptive response that may lead to a psychological disorder. In psychopathology, cognitive vulnerability is constructed from schema models, hopelessness models, and attachment theory. Attentional bias is one mechanism leading to faulty cognitive bias that leads to cognitive vulnerability. Allocating a danger level to a threat depends on the urgency or intensity of the threshold. Anxiety is not associated with selective orientation. = Emotional = The definition of vulnerability, by Brene Brown, is \\"uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure\\". Brown goes on to suggest that vulnerability is our most accurate measure of courage: to be vulnerable, to allow ourselves to be seen. Vulnerability is typically thought of as the center of emotions such as: grief, shame, fear, disappointment; but it also the center and birthplace of love, belonging, authenticity, creativity, courage, and accountability. =Military= In military terminology, vulnerability is a subset of survivability, the others being susceptibility and recoverability. Vulnerability is defined in various ways depending on the nation and service arm concerned, but in general it refers to the near-instantaneous effects of a weapon attack. In aviation it is defined as the inability of an aircraft to withstand the damage caused by the man-made hostile environment. In some definitions, recoverability (damage control, firefighting, restoration of capability) is included in vulnerability. Some military services develop their own concept of vulnerability. Invulnerability Invulnerability is a common feature found in science fiction and fantasy, in particular in superhero fiction, as depicted commonly in novels, comic books and video games. In such stories, it is a quality that makes a character impervious to pain, damage or loss of health.

Generally, it does not protect the player from certain instant-death hazards, most notably \\"bottomless\\" pits from which, even if the player were to survive the fall, they would be unable to escape. As a rule, invulnerability granted by power- ups is temporary, and wears off after a set amount of time, while invulnerability cheats, once activated, remain in effect until deactivated, or the end of the level is reached. \\"Depending on the game in question, invulnerability to damage may or may not protect the player from non-damage effects, such as being immobilized or sent flying.\\" In mythology, talismans, charms, and amulets were created by magic users for the purpose of making the wearer immune to injury from both mystic and mundane weapons.

It was constructed immediately to the north of the Tate Britain (across a side- street) adjacent to the River Thames on the borders of the neighbourhoods of Millbank and Pimlico, Westminster, London. The hospital closed in 1977, but several buildings remain. History Ordnance Survey maps of London extract for 1916 showing location of the hospital, art gallery and medical college and the octagonal outline of the former penitentiary on the entire site still visible The hospital was officially opened by King Edward VII and his wife Queen Alexandra, who was the president of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps, in July 1905. In 1907 the Royal Army Medical College opened on the south side of the Tate Gallery. In the First World War it became a general hospital for the British Army. Apart from the war-wounded by munitions, it attended to cases of trench fever, frostbite, shellshock and gas gangrene. After the war it was enlarged to 200 beds and, together with the Royal Army Medical College, became the postgraduate school for medical officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and British overseas territories as well as the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. It was the only British institution teaching military surgery. There were strong ties with Westminster Hospital due to its then proximity (based in Broad Sanctuary and from 1939 in Horseferry Road) and also the Army Medical Service, and there was a joint neoplastic clinic. In the Second World War the hospital together with its college formed a large site vulnerable to bombing but only received superficial damage. After the war a vascular surgical unit was set up with St Mary's Hospital, Paddington and postgraduate training continued for Army medical officers in surgery, tropical diseases and pathology (for assistance in prevention and diagnosis), while other ranks received more technical medical training. In 1957 the hospital was extended to 300 beds with two operating theatres and 11 wards including one for children. Male nurses were from the Royal Army Medical Corps and female nurses from the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps. After services had transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital in Woolwich, the hospital closed in 1977. The Royal Army Medical College remained at Millbank until teaching transferred to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham near Portsmouth in 2005. In 2005 Westminster City Council produced an 'conservation audit' of the wider Millbank conservation area. The report described the hospital building as follows: Part of the hospital site has since be used for an extension of the Tate but most of the buildings remain. These have housed various administration departments of the Tate as well as the library, meeting rooms and the conservation science section. The chapel remains but its stained glass window, depicting the Ascension of Jesus Christ, was carefully removed to the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, Woolwich. The area around the Tate, including the former military hospital, the former Royal Army Medical College and other adjacent areas is a conservation area, although as at 2005 only the hospital buildings were not listed.

A cognitive vulnerability in cognitive psychology is an erroneous belief, cognitive bias, or pattern of thought that predisposes an individual to psychological problems. The vulnerability exists before the symptoms of a psychological disorder appear. After the individual encounters a stressful experience, the cognitive vulnerability shapes a maladaptive response that increases the likelihood of a psychological disorder. In psychopathology, there are several perspectives from which the origins of cognitive vulnerabilities can be examined, It is the path way of including cognitive schema models, hopelessness models, and attachment theory. Attentional bias is one mechanism leading to faulty cognitive bias that leads to cognitive vulnerability. Allocating a danger level to a threat depends on the urgency or intensity of the threshold. Anxiety is not associated with selective orientation. Theories =Cognitive theory= Preliminary or \\"distal\\" causes contribute to the formation of a cognitive vulnerability that ultimately, via immediate or proximal causes, leads to the individual manifesting symptoms of the disorder. Immediate cognitive and emotional responses trigger imagery and assumptions formed in the past leading to offsetting, defensive behavior and in turn reinforcing mistaken beliefs or other cognitive vulnerabilities. =Attachment theory= The contact made with caretakers determines a certain attachment process. When secure attachment is disrupted and starts to become insecure, abnormal patterns begin, increasing risk for depression. Working models build perceptions of relationships with others. Cognitive vulnerability is created with maladaptive cognitive processing when building relationships and attachments. The diathesis-stress relationship Diathesis contributes to vulnerability. The diathesis refers to the inclination to illness. In the diathesis-stress relationship, hidden vulnerability is activated through events that the individual perceives as stressful. Vulnerability in psychological terms is implied as an increased probability of emotional pain and some type of psychopathology. Vulnerability can be a combination and interaction of genetic or acquired experiences. Vulnerability leads to putting up with something unpleasant and represents symptoms of various psychological disorders. Vulnerability predisposes individuals to a disorder, but does not initiate the disorder. Depending on the individual's subjective perception of an event, the diathesis leads to a certain psychological illness. Psychological problems =Depression= Diagram of the downward spiral in the dual process model of depression Through several cognitive biases, selective mood-congruent cues become established over long intervals. Emotional stimuli matching the emotional concerns create an aggregate effect on symptoms related to depression. Depression is associated with selective orientation. It prevents attention toward emotional cues that do not fit the internalized scheme to which the individual has become vulnerable, and leads to comorbid anxiety. When individuals who are prone to depression are asked to recall a specific event, they explain the general class of events (e.g., \\"The time when I was living with my parents\\"). Dual process model Associative and reflective processing mechanisms apply when cognitive vulnerability is processed into depression. The dual process model is valid in social and personality psychology but is not adapted to clinical phenomena. Negative bias in self-assessment provides a foundation for a cognitive vulnerability to depression. Then a downward spiral forms to create forms of dysphoria. Negatively biased associative processing will maintain a dysphoric mood state. As the dysphoric mood escalates, cognitive resources necessary to combating dysphoria by reflective processing are depleted. Irrelevant tasks and intrusive thoughts come to mind when in a dysphoric mood, and cognitive resource depletion further contributes to mood escalation. =Feedback loop= The feedback loop in the dual process model is between self referent cognition and dysphoria. The feedback loop establishes an inability to apply reflective processing to correct negative biases. = Mood persistence = Postponing the reflective processes leads to mood persistence. The individual becomes accustomed to a state of dysphoria as they experience more and more negative mood states. Dysphoric moods create more associative processing for depressive vulnerable people by negative cognitive biases. When associative bias gets stronger, the bias becomes difficult to override. Ineffective reflective strategies lead to persistence of dysphoric moods. A depressive episode as a vulnerability factor for depression The likelihood of another depressive episode escalates with the number of previous episodes. A depressive episode by itself is a vulnerability factor. Each episode of depression makes it easier for the neurotransmitter system to become deregulated. A strong stressor is needed for the initializing first episode; however, subsequent episodes can be triggered by increasingly mild stressors. Contextual information develops such that small changes in mood are sufficient to activate vulnerability. Weakening and frequency of depressive episodes triggers the biological processes related to the initial episode. Depressive episodes are experienced as having no control over traumatic events. A depressive condition results in social rejection and lowered self esteem, leading to further depressive symptoms. Schema models Schemas in depression are formed in association with stressful events in childhood and condition the individual to respond in an abnormal manner to life experiences that recall those childhood traumas. During childhood and adolescence, the individual who is prone to depression begins to match life situations with prototypes of specific stressful experiences from childhood. The cognitive vulnerability thus manifests itself. =Learned helplessness= Negative events during childhood lead the child to internalize negative events. Just as repeated positive experiences lead the child to develop a positive self image and optimism regarding future events, negative events lead to the development of expectations of hopelessness or even depression when the individual faces a stressful situation in the future. =Bipolar disorder= A study of people with bipolar disorder found that, compared with non-bipolar controls, they had significantly higher levels of dysfunctional attitudes such as perfectionism and need for approval that increase their cognitive vulnerability to depression.
