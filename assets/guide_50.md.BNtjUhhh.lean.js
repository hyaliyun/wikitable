The house was named for the grove of Southern magnolias in which it stands. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973, due to its architectural and historical significance. It now serves as a historic house museum and is operated by the Alabama Historical Commission. History Magnolia Grove was built in 1840 for Isaac Croom and his wife, Sarah Pearson Croom. Croom was a lawyer and planter from Lenoir County, North Carolina and one of the contributing founders of The University of the South at Sewanee. Sarah was the sister of Richmond Mumford Pearson, a prominent pro-Union politician and Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Isaac Croom died in 1863, with Sarah following him in 1878. They left no living children, so the estate passed to Sarah C. Pearson, the daughter of Richmond Mumford Pearson. She married James M. Hobson, also of North Carolina, who eventually served as probate judge of Hale County for over twenty years. The Hobson family moved to Greensboro and raised four sons and three daughters at Magnolia Grove. The Hobsons' most famous offspring was Richmond Pearson Hobson, a naval hero of the Spanish–American War. He was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1933 for his actions aboard the USS Merrimac and in 1934, by special act of the United States Congress, he was advanced to Naval Constructor with a rank of Rear Admiral. Hobson resigned from active naval duty in 1903 to begin a career as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Alabama. He served from March 4, 1907 until March 3, 1915, and during that time proposed more than 20 constitutional amendments to ban alcohol. He was denied the Democratic nomination in 1916 to the 65th Congress. He then organized the American Alcohol Education Association in 1921, organized the International Narcotic Education Association in 1923, organized the World Conference on Narcotic Education in 1926, and founded the World Narcotic Defense Association in 1927. These activities have caused some to label him the \\"Father of American Prohibition\\". On January 22, 1942, the Gleaves-class destroyer USS Hobson, was commissioned in his honor posthumously. Magnolia Grove was dedicated as a state shrine in his honor on May 1, 1947. Architecture Magnolia Grove is a relatively rare Alabama example of a full-scale pedimented temple-form house in the Greek Revival style. It is a two-story masonry structure, built in handmade brick. The front facade is stuccoed, including the pediment. The sides and rear are left with the brick face exposed. The front facade features a monumental hexastyle portico with Doric columns. These support a plain entablature with a simple molding dividing the architrave and frieze. Above a simple cornice, the unadorned pediment is framed by horizontal and raking geisons. Behind the portico, the building is divided into a five bay facade. The central bay is occupied by doorways on both floors, with simply molded windows occupying the remaining bays to either side. Both door surrounds are Greek Revival, these are inset with double doors, surrounded by sidelights and topped by a transom. The upper doorway opens onto a cantilevered balcony. The lower windows are floor-to-ceiling and open onto the portico, while the upper windows are six-over-six. The rear of the building also has a two-story portico, but here it is supported by six slender cast-iron columns. The interior features plaster cornice moldings and Greek Revival door and window surrounds. Both floors are evenly divided by a central hall running from front to back. The first floor contains a parlor, living room, dining room, and study. A separate two-story brick building to the rear of the main house contained the original kitchen and servant's quarters. A cantilevered staircase with mahogany treads and railing climbs from the rear of the hall to the second floor. This level contains a central hall and four bedrooms.

Reception Kirkus Reviews labeled The Journal of Curious Letters science fiction for ages 10–12 and called it \\"the start of a series that will capture the imagination of young and old alike. ... though there are chunks of text that are overwritten, the telling is generally laced with a strong sense of humor and a sure hand at plot; the author is plainly in tune with today's fan base.\\" One year later, Kirkus labeled The Hunt for Dark Infinity fantasy for ages 10 and up. The story features the \\"next assignment\\" for \\"the trio\\" Tick, Paul, and Sofia. \\"Readers will be as puzzled as the characters, who tumble from one complex and outrageous situation to the next, rescued from each at the last minute—sometimes with no explanation.

All 46 seats in the South Australian House of Assembly were up for election. The incumbent Parliamentary Labor Party government led by Premier Robert Richards was defeated by the opposition Liberal and Country League led by Leader of the Opposition Richard L. Butler. Each district elected multiple members. Background After the ALP government of Premier Lionel Hill endorsed the controversial Premiers' Plan following the start of the Great Depression in Australia and the subsequent Australian Labor Party split of 1931, the ALP state executive expelled 23 of the 30 members of the ALP caucus, including the entire cabinet. The expelled MPs formed the Parliamentary Labor Party (also known as Premiers Plan Labor), with Hill as leader and Premier, and continued in office with the support of the Butler-led Liberal Federation. Amid increasing riots and protests, as well as skyrocketing unemployment, Hill left politics to become Australian Agent-General to the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by Robert Richards, who had the impossible task of leading the government into the election. In contrast to the ructions in Labor, the conservative forces in the state presented a united front at the 1931 federal election, when all anti-Labor major party candidates in the state ran under the banner of the Emergency Committee of South Australia. This grouping took an additional two seats to hold six of the state's seven seats in the federal House of Representatives and all three available seats in the bloc-voting winner-take-all Senate. In 1932, buoyed by this success, the Liberal Federation and the Country Party merged as the Liberal and Country League under Butler's leadership. With three Labor factions—the official ALP, Premiers Plan Labor and Lang Labor—splitting the combined 47.8% total Labor vote, the result was a landslide victory for the LCL. The LCL won 29 seats versus only 13 for the three Labor factions combined. Though the Labor split in South Australia would only last until 1934, this would be the start of 32 years of LCL government in South Australia—one of the longest unbroken runs for a governing party in the Commonwealth. The LCL would stay in office until the 1965 state election with the assistance of a pro-LCL electoral malapportionment known as the Playmander, which would be introduced in 1936.

The most common devices are those designed to help terminally ill people die by voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide without prolonged pain. They may be operated by a second party, such as a physician, or by the person wishing to die. There is an ongoing debate on the ethics of euthanasia and the use of euthanasia devices. Notable devicesThanatron= Invented by Jack Kevorkian, who used this device and called it a \\"Thanatron\\" or death machine after the Greek daemon, Thanatos. It worked by pushing a button to deliver the euthanizing drugs mechanically through an IV. It had three canisters mounted on a metal frame. Each bottle had a syringe that connected to a single IV line in the person's arm. One contained saline, another contained a sleep-inducing barbiturate called sodium thiopental and the third a lethal mixture of potassium chloride, which immediately stopped the heart, and pancuronium bromide, a paralytic medication to prevent spasms during the dying process. Two deaths were assisted with this method. =Mercitron= Kevorkian assisted others with a device that employed a gas mask fed by a canister of carbon monoxide which was called \\"Mercitron\\" (mercy machine). This became necessary because Kevorkian's medical license had been revoked after the first two deaths, and he could no longer have legal access to the substances required for the \\"Thanatron\\". It was a rudimentary device consisting of a canister of carbon monoxide attached to a face mask with a tube. A valve must be released to start the gas flowing. Depending on the person's disability, a makeshift handle may be attached to the valve to make it easier to turn. Or, with the valve in the \\"open\\" position, a clip or clothespin could be clamped on the tubing. Pulling it off allows the gas to flow. By Kevorkian's estimates, this method took 10 minutes or longer. Sometimes he encouraged people to take sedatives or muscle relaxants to keep them calm as they breathed deeply of the gas. =Deliverance Machine= Philip Nitschke's \\"Deliverance Machine\\" The Deliverance Machine was invented by Philip Nitschke. It consisted of software entitled Deliverance, that came on a special laptop that could be connected to an IV in a person's arm. The computer program asked a series of questions to confirm the person's intent to die. After answering affirmatively to all of the questions, a lethal injection of barbiturates was triggered. In an interview Nitschke said that, even if it had been legal for a doctor to give a lethal injection, he preferred that the patient be in control of the administration of the drugs. Reducing the role of a physician also allowed a patient to be alone with their family during the euthanasia process. The machine was used, legally, while the Australian Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 was in effect; the act was eventually nullified by legislation of the Australian Parliament. =Exit International's euthanasia device= The Exit International euthanasia device was invented by Philip Nitschke in 2008. It uses a canister of nitrogen, a plastic suicide bag, and a plastic tube with one end attached to the gas canister and the other fixed inside the bag by a tie held by adhesive tape. Nitschke said, \\"That idea of giving people access to a means of feeling that they're back in control of this issue is actually a way of prolonging life. It may seem paradoxical, but what we find is when people feel that they're back in control, they're less likely to do desperate things.\\" ;Background The basic principle of autoeuthanasia by anoxia was first described in the book Final Exit by Derek Humphry in 1991. The original methodology was devised, using helium, by the NuTech group. ;Description Nitschke described his device as a modification of the exit bag with helium method described in The Peaceful Pill Handbook. Helium was replaced by a cylinder of compressed nitrogen and a regulator to supply the nitrogen into a plastic bag. One advantage of this method was the availability of larger amounts of nitrogen and flow rates last longer. Nitschke states that nitrogen is also more physiologically inert than helium, with less chance of adverse reaction, and that loss of consciousness is quick with death following within minutes. Unlike helium cylinders, nitrogen cylinders can be refilled in the event of leakage and nitrogen gas can't be detected during an autopsy. ;Process The principle behind the device is oxygen deprivation that leads to hypoxia, asphyxia and death within minutes. Deprivation of oxygen in the presence of carbon dioxide creates panic and a sense of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response), and struggling even when unconscious, whereas anoxia in the presence of an inert gas, like nitrogen, helium or argon, does not. Close contact with an enclosed inert gas is lethal, but released into the open air, it quickly disperses, and is safe for others. It is neither flammable nor explosive. Humphry's book describes close contact with the gas achieved by enclosing the head in a strong, clear plastic bag, secured around the neck, with the inert gas fed into the bag by plastic tubing. Suicides using this method are documented in the forensic literature. In the study Asphyxial suicide with helium and a plastic bag (Ogden et al.), the authors describe a typical case history, in which an elderly cancer sufferer used a plastic bag which was secured over her head, a helium tank, and a plastic hose attached to the tank valve and plastic bag. The authors noted that a suicide bag filled with helium will cause almost immediate unconsciousness, followed within minutes by death. Time to loss of consciousness in a bag filled with nitrogen is 15 seconds, according to professors Copeland, Pappas and Parr, who campaigned for a more humane execution method in the US state of Oklahoma. =Sarco device= In 2017, Nitschke invented the 3D-printed suicide capsule, which he named \\"the Sarco\\". The Sarco would contain a touchpad and nitrogen, and once an activation code is entered, \\"the person is again asked if they wish to die\\". An affirmative answer causes nitrogen to flow into the capsule, displacing oxygen, and death follows shortly thereafter. The Sarco machine cannot be printed on small 3D printers. The Sarco offers a \\"euphoric death\\". Nitschke plans to release the open source plans for the Sarco by 2019. In fictionSuicide booth= A suicide booth is a fictional machine for committing suicide. Suicide booths appear in numerous fictional settings, including the American animated series Futurama and the manga Gunnm/Battle Angel Alita. Compulsory self-execution booths were also featured in an episode of the original Star Trek TV series entitled \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\". The concept can be found as early as 1893. When a series of suicides were vigorously discussed in United Kingdom newspapers, critic William Archer suggested that in the golden age there would be penny-in-the-slot machines by which a man could kill himself. Modern writer Martin Amis provoked a small controversy in January 2010 when he facetiously advocated \\"suicide booths\\" for the elderly, of whom he wrote: Following Archer's statement in 1893, the 1895 story \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" by Robert W. Chambers featured the Governor of New York presiding over the opening of the first \\"Government Lethal Chamber\\" in the then-future year of 1920, after the repeal of laws against suicide: However, as Chambers's protagonist who relates the story is suffering from brain damage, it remains ambiguous whether or not he is an unreliable narrator. Futurama In the world of Futurama, Stop-and-Drop suicide booths resemble phone booths and cost one quarter per use. The booths have at least three modes of death: \\"quick and painless\\", \\"slow and horrible\\", and \\"clumsy bludgeoning\\"Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs though, it is also implied that \\"electrocution, with a side order of poison\\" exists,Futurama: Bender's Big Score and that the eyes can be scooped out for an extra charge. After a mode of death is selected and executed, the machine cheerfully says, \\"You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-and-Drop, America's favorite suicide booth since 2008\\", or in Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs, \\"You are now dead, please take your receipt\\", and at this time many untaken receipts are shown. The first appearance of a suicide booth in Futurama is in \\"Space Pilot 3000\\", in which the character Bender wants to use it. Fry at first mistakes the suicide booth for a phone booth, and Bender offers to share it with him. Fry requests a collect call, which the machine interprets as a \\"slow and horrible\\" death. It then turns out that \\"slow and horrible\\" can be survived by pressing oneself against the side of the booth, leading Bender to accuse the machine of being a rip-off. In Futurama: Bender's Big Score, after failing to initially chase down Fry in the year 2000, Bender wants to kill himself, but mistakes a regular phone booth for a suicide booth.Futurama: Bender's Big Score A suicide booth reappeared in Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs where Bender once again attempts to end his life, but is saved when dropped into the League of Robots' lair. During the season 6 episode \\"Ghost in the Machines\\", Bender commits suicide in a booth named Lynn that is still angry at him over the end of their relationship six months earlier; his ghost eventually makes its way back to his body so he can continue living.Ghost in the Machines According to series co-creator Matt Groening, the suicide booth concept was inspired by a 1937 Donald Duck cartoon, Modern Inventions, in which Donald Duck visits a Museum of the Future and is nearly killed by various push button gadgets. The suicide booth was closely enough associated with Bender's character that in 2001 it was featured as the display stand for the Bender action figure. It was also one of the many features of the series which troubled the executives at Fox when Groening and David X. Cohen first pitched the series. In other media In the Star Trek episode \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\", people who were deemed war casualties by the government of Eminiar VII were required to enter suicide booths. Treaty arrangements require that everyone who is calculated as \\"dead\\" in the hypothetical thermonuclear war simulated using computers actually die, without actually damaging any infrastructure. In the end, the computers are destroyed, the war can no longer be calculated in this way, the treaty breaks down, and faced with a real threat, (presumably) peace begins. After the Heaven's Gate mass suicide event was linked by tabloids to an extreme fascination with science fiction and Star Trek in particular it was noted that multiple episodes, including \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\", actually advocated an anti- suicide standpoint as opposed to the viewpoint expressed by the Heaven's Gate group. In the seventeenth season Simpsons episode \\"Million Dollar Abie\\", a suicide machine called a \\"diePod\\" (a pun on the iPod) is featured. The diePod allows the patient to choose visual and auditory themes that present themselves as the patient is killed. It also shows three different modes, namely, \\"Quick Painless Death\\", \\"Slow and Painful Death\\", and \\"Megadeath\\" (a pun on a band of a similarly spelled name). It was a reference to the suicide building in Soylent Green. Being a direct parody of the aforementioned scene, Abraham Simpson receives the opportunity to select his final vision and musical accompaniment: 1960s-era footage of \\"cops beatin' up hippies\\" to the tune of \\"Pennsylvania 6-5000\\" by the Glenn Miller Orchestra.

Freedom House is located in an area sometimes referred to as Grove Hall that lies along Blue Hill Ave. at the border between the Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods of Boston. Although it was historically identified with Roxbury, Freedom House currently refers to itself as being located either in Dorchester or in Grove Hall.Freedom House Official Web Site Mission The mission of Freedom House is to promote economic self-sufficiency and social justice for residents in historically underserved neighborhoods through targeted educational development, increased civic and political engagement and progressive cultural advocacy. History Freedom House was founded in 1949 as a center of civil rights and advocacy for Boston's African American community. The founders were the social workers (and married couple) Otto P. Snowden and Muriel S. Snowden. The initial goal of Freedom House was to centralize community activism in the fight for neighborhood improvement, good schools, and harmony among racial, ethnic, and religious groups in Roxbury (a neighborhood of Boston), Massachusetts.Freedom House Overview \\"Freedom House Photographs: Roxbury People, Places and Events 1950-1975,\\" Northeastern University Libraries, 2008. Criticized in the 1960s by black militants for taking a \\"self-help\\" approach to racial equality, Freedom House re-examined its mission, and went on to play an increasingly critical role in the struggle for civil rights in Boston,\\"Muriel Sutherland Snowden\\" in Notable American Women, Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University Press, 2004 especially during the period of desegregation of Boston's public schools. Freedom House's original location was at 151 Humboldt Street in Roxbury. In 1952, it moved to 14 Crawford Street on the Grove Hall section of Roxbury. On the night of January 31, 1960, a fire destroyed the Crawford Street facility. A rebuilding campaign ensued, and Boston Mayor John F. Collins was the first to \\"buy a brick\\" to help in this effort. The rebuilt facility opened in 1961 and remains the current home of the organization.Finding aid for the records of Freedom House Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, Boston, MA. In 1984, Muriel and Otto Snowden retired as co- directors. A number of directors have served since then; the Executive Director is currently the Snowden's daughter, Gail Snowden. In 1996, Freedom House considered merging with other community organizations, although in the end it decided not to do so. Activities The initial focus of the organization was on urban renewal; neighborhood improvement programs designed to protect Upper Roxbury from urban blight began in 1949 when Freedom House helped to organize neighborhood clean-up projects and playground construction. Concerned over the escalating number of bars in the neighborhood, Freedom House led the community in an effort to reduce the number of new and renewed applications for liquor licenses.Freedom House: A Legacy Preserved Online exhibit. Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Boston, MA. 2003. April Hagins with Michelle Light. Early programming also focused on strengthening relations between the African American and Jewish residents of Upper Roxbury. An interracial preschool, one of few in the city, was established and Freedom House participated in a Black-Jewish Roundtable fostering business ties and friendships between black and Jewish entrepreneurs.Miller, Yawu (2000, October 26). \\"Freedom House joins Black- Jewish Roundtable effort.\\" Bay State Banner, p. 2. ( Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Ethnic NewsWatch (ENW) database (restricted to subscribers). (Document ID: 492164411). In the area of education, Freedom House administered Project Reach, supported by a private donation, which gave scholarship funds for minority students to go to college. Freedom House also provided scholarship counseling. A travel/study program provided scholarships for high school students to study in Europe for the summer. In the years before court- ordered desegregation, Freedom House also raised money to support Operation Exodus, a voluntary desegregation project that bused predominantly African American students from overcrowded schools in Roxbury and Dorchester to predominantly white, underenrolled schools in other parts of Boston.See Smock, William H. \\"Operation Exodus: Rebuff to Politicians\\" (Harvard Crimson, October 18, 1965.) for more information about Operation Exodus. In 1966, Operation Exodus discontinued busing children; the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) began busing Boston children between the city and suburban schools on a voluntary basis. Exodus bused children within the City of Boston while METCO was a separate program of urban and suburban exchange. School desegregation was court-ordered in Boston in 1974, and in that year, the Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education was established. The Institute began as a means of information dissemination to African-American families, as well as to ensure the safety of school children being bused to neighborhoods attempting to block the desegregation order. The Institute grew to become a locus of community action, offering tutoring and teacher training, and providing a forum for communication between families and city administrators.Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education, May 15, 1974(brochure) In the area of employment, Freedom House held job fairs, including Boston's first job fair for minorities, and promoted affirmative action. They raised money for college scholarships for black students and for study programs in Africa. They even established a credit union.Edgar J. Driscoll Jr., Globe Staff (1988, October 1). \\"Muriel Snowden, 72; Cofounder of Freedom House in Roxbury\\" (Obituary, third edition) Boston Globe, p. 75. Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Boston Globe database via Proquest Massachusetts Newspapers (restricted to subscribers). Freedom House has often acted as a forum and meeting place for the community, in times of grief as well as in times of celebration. The Center has held galas, fashion shows and tea parties to raise money for causes that it supported, celebrated the anniversaries and birthdays of notables like Edward Brooke, an African- American U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and held Christmas and Halloween parties for children. More than 500 residents attended a mass meeting at Freedom House after the murder of 16-year-old Daniela Saunders in 1963. Currently, Freedom House programs focus on education, technology, and leadership development. Freedom House provides tutoring for the MCAS (Mass. school achievement tests), access to a computer lab, and technology training. Freedom House also works with other organizations and the City of Boston to lower the dropout rate in Boston's high schools.

All 39 seats in the South Australian House of Assembly were up for election. The incumbent Liberal and Country League government led by Premier of South Australia Richard L. Butler defeated the opposition Australian Labor Party led by Leader of the Opposition Andrew Lacey. Background This election was the start of the electoral malapportionment which became known as the Playmander. It consisted of rural districts enjoying a 2-to-1 advantage in the state parliament, even though they contained less than half of the population, as well as a change from multi-member to single-member electorates, and the number of MPs in the lower house was reduced from 46 to 39. Labor remained out of power until the 1965 election. Tom Stott was one of 14 of 39 lower house MPs to be elected as an independent, which as a grouping won 40 percent of the primary vote, more than either of the major parties. Stott was the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament. The incumbent Butler LCL minority government only won 15 of 39 seats, which led to uncertainty over which party, if any, could form government. This confusion led Stott, as the most experienced and well known of the independent MPs, to believe that he could become Premier of South Australia. He failed to gain the support of sufficient independents and LCL members to achieve this but, as the de facto leader of the independent caucus within parliament, the LCL government were often forced to rely on his support.

While Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac is the one often mentioned in contemporary history classes, at the time Ames' Almanack enjoyed a much larger readership. Franklin's publication had a circulation of 10,000 copies, while Ames' Almanack had a circulation of 60,000. Authors Nathaniel Ames, a second generation colonial American, established and wrote Ames' Almanac.Drake, Samuel, ed., New England Historical and Genealogical Register, New England Historic Genealogical Society, p. 255. Ames was only seventeen when the first almanac was printed. The family also owned Ames Tavern and often advertised the establishment in the almanac. Upon Ames' death in 1764, his son, also Nathaniel, began writing the almanac. He continued to print the almanac until 1775.Stowell, Marion Barber, Early American Almanacs; the Colonial Weekday Bible: The Colonial Weekday Bible, Ayer Publishing, 1977, p. 72. The younger Nathaniel strongly supported the antifederalist cause, which contrasted to his brother, the prominent Federalist congressman Fisher Ames. Based on a correspondence between Ames and Roger Sherman, it appears that Sherman wrote some of the mathematical portions of the almanac in 1753. Intellectual property With no real intellectual property enforcement, readers frequently copied the almanac for others. This led to bickering among printers as to who published the genuine edition of Ames' Almanack forcing Ames to certify by card as to the original version. Legacy Ames wrote during a time of a growing national concept of 'America' and not that of the traditional political conception of 'state' (in Ames' case Massachusetts). The growing conception of a national 'American' entity was reflected and propagated by the annual almanacs. By 1775, the almanac published a manual on how to make gunpowder so that every man could supply himself \\"with a sufficiency of that commodity.\\" As the American Revolution started in 1775, there was a severe gunpowder shortage in Boston. As George Washington wrote to Congress, the Continental Army was \\"exceedingly destitute\\" of the material. Ames took a stand on the religious Great Awakening running through the colonies in the early 18th century. The Great Awakening challenged the traditional authority of the congregationalist church. George Whitefield, an English evangelist, created controversy in the colonies with his Great Awakening sermons. In 1741, Ames satirized critics of Whitefield in \\"To the Scoffers at Mr. Whitefield's Preaching.\\" Four years later, Whitefield came to Ames' hometown of Dedham to give one of his sermons. The same format used in Ames' Almanack was implemented by the Old Farmer's Almanac the popular annual publication in existence since 1792. This includes the following: page headings with the corresponding zodiac sign; left margin noting movable feasts, lines from a poem relevant to that month; phases of the moon; weather predictions; and anniversaries.Morison, Samuel Eliot and S. E. Morison, Squire Ames and Doctor Ames, The New England Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Jan., 1928), pp. 7. Some early colonists used the blank pages of the almanac to keep personal diaries. Their memories are interlaced within the annual almanacs. The American Antiquarian Society collection in Worcester, Massachusetts holds at least two of these diaries, including that of Reverend Thomas Balch (1759). Ebenezer Gay, a pastor at the Church at Hingham in Hingham, Massachusetts similarly recorded his visits to Boston and days of prayer in his copy of the Ames Almanack.

It has been the home stadium of Atlético Madrid since the 2017–18 season. It is located in Rosas neighbourhood in the San Blas-Canillejas district. The stadium was built as part of Madrid's unsuccessful bid to host the 1997 World Athletics Championships, and was opened on 6 September 1994 by the Community of Madrid. It was closed in 2004 due to the city's bid for the 2016 Olympics and in 2013 it was passed into the possession of Atlético Madrid. The stadium was renovated and the new facility was reopened to the public on 16 September 2017, when Atlético Madrid faced Málaga CF in La Liga. The stadium had a capacity of 20,000 spectators upon its closure and re-opened with a seating capacity of 68,456 after renovation. The stadium is home to Atlético Madrid's first team matches. Atlético Madrid offered Wanda Metropolitano as a permanent venue for the finals of the Spanish Copa del Rey matches. The stadium hosted the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final on 1 June 2019. Name The stadium was formerly known as Estadio de la Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid Community Stadium), Estadio Olímpico de Madrid (Madrid Olympic Stadium), and more commonly by its nickname Estadio de La Peineta (The Comb Stadium). Naming rights were acquired by the Wanda Group, a Chinese real estate company. Due to UEFA sponsorship regulations the stadium is known as Estadio Metropolitano in UEFA marketing materials. History During the early 1990s the Sports Council of the Community of Madrid promoted the city's bid to host the World Athletics Championships in 1997, and preparations began for an Olympic stadium in the east of Madrid, next to the M-40 motorway. The site was expected to be heavily urbanized. Construction of the new stadium began in 1990 and was based on a design proposed by Cruz y Ortiz. It was completed in 1993, and the inauguration took place in September 1994. The single side tier oval shaped stadium with a capacity 20,000 seats became known as La Peineta (the comb) because of its similarity with the traditional Spanish hair comb. The 1997 World Championships in Athletics were eventually awarded to Athens, and La Peineta was used for minor sports and cultural events during the first decade of its existence. New stadium In 2004, the stadium was closed for a future project upon the Madrid bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Following the defeat of Madrid's bid in 2009, many proposals were made for the future use of the stadium. Finally, on 11 September 2013, Atlético Madrid announced their plans to build a stadium on the location of La Peineta. Thus ownership was officially transferred to the club. Atlético's first European match at the stadium, 27 September 2017 The new stadium was scheduled to replace Vicente Calderón Stadium as Atletico's home since the 2017–18 season. On 9 December 2016, the club announced that the renovated stadium's official name would be Wanda Metropolitano – Wanda for sponsorship reasons and Metropolitano after the 1923–1966 arena which hosted Atlético's matches before Vicente Calderón. As of 15 April 2017, around 48,500 season tickets had been reserved by the club fans. On 17 September 2017, the Wanda Metropolitano's inaugural event was a 2017–18 La Liga match between Atlético Madrid and Málaga CF. King Felipe VI of Spain attended the match. Atlético's Antoine Griezmann would go on to score the first goal at the new stadium, in which the match ended in a 1–0 win for Atlético. On 27 September 2017, the Metropolitano hosted its first European game as Chelsea beat Atlético Madrid 2–1 and became the first English club to defeat them at home in any European club competition, as well as the first visiting team to win at the new stadium. It accommodates 68,000 spectators, with all spectator seats covered by a new roof including 7,000 VIP, 79 VIP suites known as Neptuno Premium. 4,000 car parking spaces is available; 1,000 inside the stadium building and 3,000 outside the building. Notable events La Peineta hosted the second leg of the 1996 Supercopa de España on 28 August, with Atlético beating FC Barcelona 3–1 on the night but losing 6–5 on aggregate. During the 1997–98 Segunda División season, Madrid-based club Rayo Vallecano played some home matches at La Peineta, due to renovation works on its stadium, the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas. On 21–22 September 2002, La Peineta hosted the 9th IAAF World Cup, an international track and field sporting event sponsored by the International Association of Athletics Federations. On 20 September 2017, shortly after the inauguration of the stadium, it was selected by UEFA to host the final match of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League.Exterior view of the stadium at the inauguration day The other selected nominee was the Baku National Stadium in Azerbaijan, which will hold the 2018-19 UEFA Europa League final. This is the fifth European Cup/UEFA Champions League final held in Madrid, after the 1957, 1969, 1980, and 2010 finals, all held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium of Atlético's cross-town rival Real Madrid C.F. On 27 March 2018, the stadium hosted the Spain national football team for the first time for a friendly against Argentina national football team, a 6–1 win. On 21 April 2018, it hosted the 2018 Copa del Rey Final between Sevilla and Barcelona. Barcelona won the game with a final score of 5–0. During the game Andrés Iniesta was substituted under a standing ovation by the fans since it was his last final with Barcelona. On 17 March 2019, Metropolitano hosted the Spanish women's league match between Atlético Madrid and Barcelona, with 60,739 spectators attending to the match, thus beating the worldwide record for a women's football match between clubs. On 1 June 2019, the stadium hosted the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final between Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Liverpool F.C. in which Klopp’s side Liverpool defeated Spurs 2–0.  Transport and access  Estadio Metropolitano Metro station Inauguration of the new access to Estadio Metropolitano Metro station 2017 Madrid City Council, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport and Atletico Madrid signed an agreement with the aim of building the necessary infrastructure for access to the stadium. The first phase of the works is planned to be done before the opening of the stadium, and includes the new entrance from the M-40 towards Avenida Luis Aragonés, the braiding link between the Eisenhower Knot (M-14 and M-21) and the stadium service road, the improvement of the entrance by the Arcentales Avenue, the construction of a second vestibule and access for the current existing Estadio Metropolitano Metro station. These infrastructures will be paid by the club for a figure close to 30 million euros. The second phase will take place after the inauguration. According to the announcement by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, it will consist of the opening of the O'Donnell Cercanías Madrid station. This will convert the existing stop into a new station for the neighborhood of Rejas. The station will be located at the intersection of the M-21 dual carriageway and M-40 highway, close to Ciudad Pegaso and Plenilunio Shopping Center and near the new Atletico Madrid stadium. The City Council is in talks with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Community of Madrid about improving access to the new stadium and adapting to the substantial increase of traffic to the neighborhood once the new stadium is operational. The measures proposed by the municipality of Madrid include the request to extend line 2 of Metro to the future Cercanías Madrid station of O'Donnell, as well as the connection of said line 2 to line 7 current Estadio Metropolitano Metro station, which has the largest platform of the network. There are three more Metro stations close to the stadium, within a two to 20 minutes walk: Las Rosas (line 2), Canillejas (line 5), and Las Musas (line 7), which is 10 minutes walk to the stadium. The buses' actual lines of EMT Madrid with a stop close to the stadium are: 28, 38, 48, 140, 153, E2, N5 and N6; (these last two lines are nocturnal buses). Long-distance lines: 286, 288 and 289. The EMT operates a special service the match days with one line that starts from the Canillejas exchanger to the stadium (SE721 line), Canillejas has connection to Metro line 5 and EMT bus lines 77, 101, 140, 151 and 200.

The film was written and directed by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, both of whom returned from the previous film. The story takes place immediately after the events of the first film. Several actors from the first film reprise their roles, mostly briefly appearing as infected versions of their characters. The film was followed by Rec 3: Genesis. Plot Dr. Owen (Jonathan Mellor), an official from the Ministry of Health, and a heavily armed GEO team of four (Fernandez, Martos, Rosso and Larra) equipped with video cameras are sent into a quarantined apartment building to control the situation. During the investigation, Martos is infected while encountering some of the possessed residents. Owen then uses religious mantra and a rosary to hold him off in a room. He reveals that he is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named Tristana Medeiros, the root of the infection. The GEO operators search the apartment where Medeiros was held and find the body of Father Albelda, the original priest charged with the case of Medeiros's possession. They then find a sample of Medeiros's blood taken by Albelda, but lose it to Fernandez's improper handling. Owen tells them that the only way to accomplish the mission now is to get a blood sample from Tristana herself. They are attacked by a group of infected, and Larra, separated from the others and cornered into a room, commits suicide. The father of Jennifer persuades a firefighter to help him enter the building through the sewers. They are unknowingly followed by three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori, and the police seal their exit. Jennifer's father is bitten and infected and killed by Owen and the GEO team, while the firefighter is attacked by Martos and killed accidentally by Mire, who kills Martos right after. After Tito is infected, Owen, Fernandez and Rosso find the group. They lock Mire and Ori in a room and encounter reporter Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) shocked but safe. The group questions the possessed Tito and deduce from his cryptic answers that Medeiros is in the penthouse and that certain areas are only accessible in total darkness aside from infrared light. The group finds a hidden door using the night vision on Ángela's camera. They are attacked by Medeiros, who kills Fernandez, and attacks Owen before Ángela blows her head off with a shotgun. Owen is enraged because he needed the blood sample, but the unnerved Ángela can only think to leave the building. When Owen refuses to authorize their exit, Ángela attacks him and kills Rosso when he attempts an intervention. It is revealed that the demon possessing Tristana has now possessed Ángela. Ángela kills Owen and imitates his voice to contact the authorities. She tells them that the mission has been accomplished, that Owen must stay inside due to being infected, and that the only survivor allowed to leave is Ángela. A flashback then reveals what happened right before the story's beginning: Ángela was captured by Medeiros and had a vermiform organism orally transmitted into her. As the response team arrived, Ángela went into hiding.  Cast Production Following the success of Rec, Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza signed on for a sequel.REC 2 (Film Review) Principal photography began on 10 November 2008 and wrapped in December 2008. The film reunites the directors with many of the original cast and crew members of the previous film.Talking [REC] 2 with Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza It was shot in Barcelona over six weeks.

The site's consensus states: \\"It lacks the surprising jolt of the first installment, but [REC] 2 almost maintains the original's chilling momentum – and proves not all horror sequels were made equal\\". Little White Lies gave the film 4/5 and called it \\"The greatest zombie sequel since Dawn of the Dead\\". Empire also awarded the film 4 stars, saying: \\"Here’s a horror juddering with such in-your-face malevolent energy, it’s like being caught in a first-person shooter possessed by the devil\\".

It can be done explicitly, as part of a cache coherence protocol. In such a case, a processor changes a memory location and then invalidates the cached values of that memory location across the rest of the computer system.  Explicit invalidation  Cache invalidation can be used to push new content to a client. This method functions as an alternative to other methods of displaying new content to connected clients. Invalidation is carried out by changing the application data, which in turn marks the information received by the client as out-of-date. After the cache is invalidated, if the client requests the cache, they are delivered a new version. = Methods = There are three specific methods to invalidate a cache, but not all caching proxies support these methods.  Purge  Removes content from caching proxy immediately. When the client requests the data again, it is fetched from the application and stored in the caching proxy. This method removes all variants of the cached content.  Refresh  Fetches requested content from the application, even if cached content is available. The content previously stored in the cache is replaced with a new version from the application. This method affects only one variant of the cached content.  Ban  A reference to the cached content is added to a blacklist (or ban list). Client requests are then checked against this blacklist, and if a request matches, new content is fetched from the application, returned to the client, and added to the cache. This method, unlike purge, does not immediately remove cached content from the caching proxy. Instead, the cached content is updated after a client requests that specific information. = Alternatives = There are a few alternatives to cache invalidation that still deliver updated content to the client. One alternative is to expire the cached content quickly by reducing the time-to- live (TTL) to a very low value. Another alternative is to validate the cached content at each request. A third option is to not cache volatile content requested by the client. These alternatives can cause issues, as they create high load on the application due to more frequent requests for information. = Disadvantages = Using invalidation to transfer new content can be difficult when invalidating multiple objects. Invalidating multiple representations adds a level of complexity to the application. Cache invalidation must be carried out through a caching proxy; these requests can impact performance of the caching proxy, causing information to be transferred at a slower rate to clients.

Consequently, it is rated as Least Concern by BirdLife International and the IUCN. Taxonomy and systematics Green variant - City Botanic Gardens - Brisbane, Australia Formerly, the Australasian figbird was considered as a subspecies of the green figbird and referred to as simply the figbird, a name still commonly used in Australia, where the Australasian figbird is the only figbird present. The Australasian figbird was split from the green figbird primarily based on differences in measurements and plumage, and on biogeography. Additionally, the Australasian figbird has sometimes been split into two separate species, the more northern, yellow figbird (S. flaviventris) and the green or southern figbird (S. vieilloti), but the two intergrade widely where they come into contact, supporting the view that they are part of a single biological species. =Subspecies= Five subspecies are recognized: * S. v. salvadorii – Sharpe, 1877: Originally described as a separate species. Found in south-eastern New Guinea * S. v. cucullatus – (Rosenberg, HKB, 1866): Originally described as a separate species. Found on Kai Islands (off south-western New Guinea).

It is sexually dimorphic, and the racial differences are almost entirely limited to the male. Males of all subspecies have a black tail with broad white tips to the outer rectrices, white crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), blackish primaries, a black head, distinct bright red facial skin, a black bill with a red base, and pinkish legs. In the nominate subspecies, the body is largely olive-green, and the throat, neck and chest are grey. The subspecies cucullatus, ashbyi and flaviventris are yellowish olive-green above, and bright yellow below (including the throat). The last subspecies, salvadorii, resembles previous, but with a grey throat, collar and chest similar to the nominate subspecies,Coates, B. J., & W. S. Peckover. (2001).

Females are drab-coloured, being dull brownish above, and white below with strong dark streaking. They have greyish facial skin, and a greyish-black bill. Juveniles resemble females, but the streaking below is typically not as strong. The other orioles in its range, the brown and olive-backed orioles, are superficially similar, but have entirely red bills when adult.Dickinson, E. C. (editor) (2003).

Australasian figbirds make a large number of different short calls, and are also able to mimic the voice of other birds, for example parrots and other species of orioles. The song consists of a series of simple whistles. Behaviour and ecology As suggested by their name, Australasian figbirds are largely frugivorous, but also take small insects, nectar and small seeds. While largely a resident species (although the southern population may be migratory), it is nomadic in response to the availability of food. Unlike most orioles, Australasian figbirds are gregarious, often forming flocks of 20 to 40 birds during the non-breeding season, and even breeding in small, loose colonies. The flimsy saucer-shaped nest is made from plant- material, and usually placed relatively high in a tree. The clutch of two to four eggs is incubated by both sexes, and typically hatches after 16–17 days. It has been recorded nesting near the aggressive spangled drongo and helmeted friarbird, possibly gaining an advantage as they keep potential nest-predators away. Australasian figbirds sometimes fall victim to nest parasitism by Pacific koels.

The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. A left-handed opening batsman, Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed Sid Barnes in three Tests—Barnes was injured for the other two Tests. As one of three on-tour selectors, Morris was a member of the leadership group along with Bradman and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett. Morris ended the first-class tour with 1,922 runs at a batting average of 71.18 including seven centuries, recording the second highest aggregate behind Bradman. Morris' s form peaked in the Test series; he headed the runscoring aggregates and averages for all players with 696 runs at 87.00, and was the only player to compile three Test centuries. In the Second Test at Lord's, Morris struck 105 to set up Australia's first innings of 350 and eventual win. He scored 182 on a deteriorating pitch on the final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, combining for a triple-century partnership with Bradman. Australia scored 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase in Test history. In the Fifth Test at The Oval, Morris scored 196, more than half of Australia's 389 as the tourists went on to win by an innings. Based on his performance during the tour of England, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named Morris as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1949. They described him as \\"one of the world's best left-hand batsmen\\". Background During the Australian season of 1947-48, which preceded the tour of England, Morris played in the first four Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the selectors wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 4-0. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 4-0 series win.Piesse, pp. 153-156. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team. Morris—recently appointed co-captain of New South Wales—greatly impressed Australian captain Don Bradman, to the extent that Bradman made himself, Morris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett the three on-tour selectors for the 1948 visit to England.Perry (2000), p. 188. Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle during the planning of the tour. Bradman had long harboured an ambition to tour England without losing a match;Perry (2001), pp. 84-89. his team would become the first to achieve this feat, earning themselves the sobriquet, The Invincibles. Early tour Morris marked his first-class debut on English soil in the opening match of the tour, against Worcestershire.Pollard, p. 7. After the hosts had batted first and made 233, Morris stroked with a fluent 138 (including 19 fours) from 275 minutes. He put on an opening stand of 79 with Sid Barnes, before adding 186 for the second wicket with Bradman. Australia declared at 8/462 before completing an innings victory. Morris and Bradman's scoring matched one another during their partnership and both were close to being the first Australian century-maker on the tour. The former was on 95 and took three runs to move to 98, before Bradman hit consecutive fours to progress from 91 to 99. The Australian captain failed to score for the rest of the over, so Morris took the strike in the next over and reached his century before Bradman followed suit. After reaching triple figures, Morris added his last 38 runs in 50 minutes.Fingleton, pp. 46-47. Morris’s role indicated his standing alongside Barnes as a first-choice opener, as Australia customarily selected its strongest team for the tour opener. The third opener taken on tour, Bill Brown, played out of position in the middle order. Morris was rested from the second tour match, which was against Leicestershire; Bradman’s team won by an innings. He returned against Yorkshire, and in a low-scoring match on a damp pitch favouring slower bowling, made 17 and three as Australia won by only four wickets. The match saw 324 runs scored for the loss of 35 wickets and a top-score of only 34. Morris’s 17 in the first innings was actually the fourth highest score for the entire match. The match was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour; the tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of the target of 60, with effectively only three wickets in hand because Sam Loxton was injured and unable to bat.Fingleton, pp. 53-55. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. In the first hour of play, Australia's openers played solidly and rarely missed a ball.Fingleton, p. 58. Morris scored 65 as he and Barnes put on an opening stand of 136, which laid the foundation for Australia's 632. The tourists went on to win the match by an innings. In the next fixture, Morris managed only 26 as Australia piled on 4/414 declared against Cambridge University. Morris bowled for the first time on tour, sending down five wicketless overs for 11 runs as Australia completed their second innings victory in succession. Morris was rested as Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. During the match, the Australian batsmen set a world record by scoring 721 runs on the first day, a new world record for the most runs in one day of first-class cricket.Fingleton, pp. 65-67. Morris returned for the innings victory against Oxford University, putting on an opening stand of 138 with Brown before being run out for 64. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton reported that Hubert Webb \\"brilliantly ran out Morris from the boundary with a throw over the stumps\\".Fingleton, p. 70. Australia amassed 431 and won completed their fourth consecutive innings victory. In the hosts' second innings, Morris took his first wicket of the tour, bowling Indian Test batsman Abdul Hafeez Kardar to end with 1/6 from three overs. The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. Morris and Barnes retained their positions at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. It was a chance to players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, but Morris looked uncomfortable,Fingleton, p. 72. managing only five as Australia amassed 552 and enforced the follow on to win by an innings. In the MCC’s second innings, Morris caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Colin McCool. The Lord’s fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Morris continued to struggle, making five and 22, falling twice to England Test paceman Dick Pollard, In the drawn match against Nottinghamshire, Morris continued his form slump, making 16 in the tourists' only innings. Morris found batting difficult for the first few weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.Fingleton, p. 80-81. After being rested for the eight-wicket win over Hampshire, Morris rectified his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex.Pollard, p. 9. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 in their first innings, Morris dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming the first man to fall. Morris added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342. He had struck 26 fours,Fingleton, p. 79. laying the platform for Australia's total of 5/549 declared and eventual innings victory. He was to hit five more first-class centuries before the end of the season.Perry (2000), p. 189. First Test Morris thus headed into the First Test at Trent Bridge with a century under his belt. He held his position at the top of the order along with Barnes, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. Morris bowled three overs for four runs in the first innings as England were bowled out for 165 on the first day after winning the toss and electing to bat. During the innings, Morris took a reflex catch when Godfrey Evans hit a ball strongly, directly to him at short leg to leave England at 7/74.Fingleton, p. 87. Australia survived the last 15 minutes on the first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the hesitant Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes,Fingleton, pp. 88-89. During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss.Arlott, p. 35. Morris fell when he tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps.O'Reilly, p. 37. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch.Fingleton, p. 100. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243. Australia eventually bowled England out for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine,Fingleton, p. 105. but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger.Arlott, p. 50. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch.O'Reilly, p. 53. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot. In the match immediately after the First Test, Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire, putting on 122 runs with Lindsay Hassett as Australian completed an innings win. He was then rested ahead of the Second Test as Australia drew with Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. Second Test In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia elected to bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over to leave the tourists at 1/3. England restricted the Australians in the first hour and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on.O'Reilly, p. 60. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut. At the end of the pace bowlers' opening spells, the leg spin of Doug Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no-ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four.Fingleton, p. 109. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump.O'Reilly, p. 61. At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.Fingleton, p. 108. Shortly afterwards, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time in Tests in Bedser's leg trap. Len Hutton—who took the catch—had dropped Bradman in the same position when the Australian captain was on 13. At the other end, Morris began to take control. He drove the ball through the covers and clipped it off his pads through the leg side. Morris reached his century with consecutive boundaries from Coxon. Fingleton called the innings \\"a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings\\". This ended a run of poor form for Morris, a period during which he had shuffled uncertainly on the crease without moving forward or back decisively.Fingleton, p. 110. O'Reilly called it Morris's best Test century to date, as this was the strongest English attack he had faced during his career, and because of the loss of wickets at the other end. O'Reilly said Morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them, yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity.O'Reilly, p. 65. Morris was out soon after for 105 from 166 balls, after hitting Coxon to Hutton in the gully to leave Australia at 3/166. His innings included 14 fours and one six, and was noted for powerful, well- placed cover drives. With Morris gone, Australia fell to 7/258 at stumps, before the lower order counterattacked on the second morning and took the total to 350. Bradman’s team took a 135-run lead after dismissing England for 215. The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings on the third morning. The Australian openers took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps, looking for a solid start.O'Reilly, pp. 72-73. Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a stumping opportunity when he was 18. Laker came on and induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled.Fingleton, p. 113. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers would have been able to reach the ball and attempt a catch.O'Reilly, p. 73. The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright came on and again bowled a no- ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After shuffling around with uncertainty at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently. He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 2-0 series lead.Pollard, p. 11. Morris was rested by Bradman for the second match against Surrey, which started the day after the Test and ended in a ten-wicket victory for the Australians. The following match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and in only five hours on the first day, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the first two Tests, England were contemplating changes to their team: Tom Goddard was earmarked to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner after performing strongly in county cricket, while Laker had struggled in the Second Test. The English hoped Goddard would be the strike bowler to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris's assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the length of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently advanced out of the crease when the ball was of a full length to drive and rocked onto the back foot to and cut if Goddard dropped short. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris responded by stepping down the wicket towards the leg side, charging the bowler and repeatedly lofting the ball inside out over the off side. He reached his century before lunch and his 200 by the tea interval. By the time Morris was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six.Pollard, p. 12. He put on stands of 102 with Barnes, 136 with Keith Miller and 162 with Neil Harvey before falling with the score at 4/466. Fingleton said \\"Morris flayed it [the home team's bowling] in all directions\\",Fingleton, p. 198. while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \\"Tom [Goddard] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking] to him and that gets him many wickets.\\"Fingleton, p. 199. Australia amassed 5/560 on the first day before declaring at 7/774, their largest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team on English soil. Morris took a match total of 1/35 as Australia won by an innings. Third Test Following his effort in Bristol, Morris proceeded to the Third Test at Old Trafford. England batted first and made 363. During the innings, Barnes was hit in the kidneys by a Dick Pollard pull shot while fielding at short leg. When Australia started their first innings reply, Barnes was still recuperating after being carried from the field and taken to hospital for a medical examination. Having dropped Brown for the Test, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener. Off spinner Ian Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable to make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, before Pollard trapped Bradman leg before wicket (lbw) to leave Australia at 2/13. The tourists were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming at leg stump.Fingleton, p. 138. Pollard was reinforced by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter fell. Miller joined Morris and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps, with the latter—who had been the more sedate in the partnership—on 48.Arlott, p. 88. Australia struggled against the new ball in the first hour of the day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31;Fingleton, p. 139. the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day.Fingleton, p. 140. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost. Play finally began after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. As Australia had no intention of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions.Fingleton, p. 146. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions. Morris struck 109 against Middlesex in the following tour match at Lord’s. The hosts batted first and made 203, and Australia stumbled to 3/53 before Morris combined with Sam Loxton (123) for a 172-run fourth-wicket stand. Australia recovered to reach 317 and went on to a ten-wicket win. Morris's century meant he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.Fingleton, p. 200. Fourth Test The Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England elected to bat and started strongly with 496 in the first innings, their highest score of the series. On a placid pitch, Morris was one of seven bowlers used as Bradman sought a breakthrough; each of the first three wickets put on century partnerships. Bill Edrich hit a long hop from Morris's left arm unorthodox spin to the boundary to reach his century,Fingleton, p. 157. before Bedser lifted him high over square leg for six. This prompted Bradman to replace Morris after he conceded 20 runs in five overs as England reached 2/423. Edrich was out when he attempted to pull Johnson to the on side in the large gap between mid-on and square leg, but only hit it in the air to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on to leave the score at 4/426,O'Reilly, p. 119. before England collapsed to 496. England took a 38-run lead after Australia replied with 458. Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, who had been promoted from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser in the air to Ken Cranston at mid- wicket to leave Australia at 1/13.Fingleton, p. 158. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly. At the time, 404 would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.Fingleton, p. 174. After Bedser had bowled three overs, Laker replaced him in the seventh over as Yardely attempted to exploit the turning surface, but 13 runs were taken from his first over. Hassett hit a four and took a single to rotate the strike. Later in the over, Morris hit a four, was beaten by a bouncing ball that hurried off the pitch, before striking another boundary. Despite the expensive Laker over, only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that the tourists still needed 360 runs from 285 minutes. The crowd heckled the Australian openers for their slow scoring and they applauded ironically after Morris took a single. After his poor first over, Laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs,Arlott, p. 117. and \\"was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably\\".O'Reilly, p. 138. In an attempt to exploit the worn surface, Yardley brought on the part-time left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton to partner Laker. The occasional bowler was inaccurate and Morris struck two fours in his first over to bring up Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. However, Compton's deceived Morris—who danced down the pitch and missed the ball—in the next over, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman on 32 and Australia at 0/55.Fingleton, pp. 174-175. Laker beat Morris in the following over with an off break that spun a foot, before Compton removed Hassett for 17 with the score at 57.Fingleton, p. 175. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 271 minutes. The Australian captain signalled his intentions by reaching 12 in only six minutes. Yardley then called upon the occasional leg spin of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. However, Hutton did not bowl regularly so he had trouble in maintaining his consistency. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter- attack, hitting three consecutive fours to reach 51 during Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as \\"rather terrible\\" due to the errant length. Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost hitting a catch. However, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 1/96 from 90 minutes. In the next over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once.Fingleton, pp. 175-176. At the other end, Morris continued to take advantage of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35.Pollard, p. 15. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs,Fingleton, p. 176. and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.O'Reilly, p. 139. Upon resumption, Compton continued as Yardley persisted with his policy of trying to exploit the deteriorating pitch with as much spin as possible. Compton was not a regular bowler and sent down a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called \\"indescribably bad bowling\\". This sequence included six fours in eight balls.Arlott, p. 119. As Morris continued to attack, Compton began to crack under the pressure and his accuracy worsened. Compton had generated trouble for the batsmen by tossing the ball up and beating the bat or inducing edges, but Morris counterattacked with drives. Compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven, but the Australian opener pounced on the shorter balls.O'Reilly, p. 140. Morris reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs since lunch, while Bradman had furthered his total by only three. The Australian onslaught against the spinners prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment,Fingleton, p. 177. and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper’s pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200. Morris was given another life on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he advanced two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory, and went on to win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase. Morris was rested for the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings, as well as the next match against Glamorgan, which was a rain- affected draw. He returned to score 32 and 20 not out as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Australia faced Lancashire for the second time on the tour; Morris made 49 and 16 as the match ended in a draw. Morris and Barnes put on 123 in the first innings, but their teammates were unable to build on the platform and Australia ended on 321. Morris was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw. Fifth Test Australia proceeded to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England won the toss and elected to bat on a pitch affected by heavy rain prior to the match. With the score at 2/17, Lindwall bowled a bouncer, which Compton hooked. Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch,Fingleton, p. 185. described by Fingleton as \\"one of the catches of the season\\". England collapsed to be all out for 52 as Australia’s pacemen extracted bounce and movement from the pitch. In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall blow to the shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease in less than an hour,O'Reilly, p. 151. and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47.Fingleton, p. 186. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement after the end of the series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.Fingleton, p. 187. Hassett came in at 2/117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace.Arlott, p. 129. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five,Fingleton, p. 188. before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets. Loxton came in and accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, but he was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm.Arlott, p. 130. Australia went on to finish with 389.Pollard, p. 17. Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 4-0 Test series triumph. Later tour matches Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Morris made 43 in a total of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Morris was rested for the following three matches against the Gentlemen of England, Somerset and the South of England. The first two matches were won by innings while the third was washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead. In the meantime, Morris underwent minor surgery for a split in his hand. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team.Perry (2005), pp. 253-254. After the tourists dismissed the home team for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Morris was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 112 as Australia batted first and made 236. The Scots replied with 85 and were forced to follow on. Morris led the wicket-taking in the second innings, taking 5/10 from five overs as the hosts fell for 111 to hand the Australians an innings victory. He continued his success in the second match, taking three of Scotland's first four batsmen to end with 3/17 as the hosts fell for 178. Batting at No. 7, Morris made 10 as Australia declared at 6/407 and bowled four overs for eight runs without taking a wicket as Bradman’s men ended the tour with another innings victory. Role A chart showing Morris's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. A left-handed opening batsman, Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes was injured in the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable to open in the former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened. Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened. A very occasional left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena. Morris ended the first-class matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42). He did so despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour. In recognition of his performances, Morris was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949. Wisden described him as \\"one of the world's best left-hand batsmen\\". Neville Cardus—his former critic—praised Morris's performance during The Invincibles tour as \\"masterful, stylish, imperturbable, sure in defence, quick and handsome in stroke play. His batting is true to himself, charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful.\\" Morris's form peaked in The Ashes, heading the Test averages and aggregates with 696 runs at 87.00. Bradman (502 at 72.57) and Denis Compton (562 at 62.44) were the next closest; nobody else scored more than 360 runs. He was the only player to compile three Test centuries, and added three further fifties.

Description Bird with tail fanned out showing how it got its name This fantail is mid to dark grey or grey-brown above, yellowish/orange below, with a dark band across the chest below a white throat, white markings over the eye, and (depending on the race) either white-edged or entirely white outer tail feathers. It grows to in length, of which half is the tail, which, as the name implies, is often displayed fanned out. This reveals that the outer tail feathers are light and the centre ones are dark. Some subspecies are found in a darker plumage, notably the \\"black fantail\\" morph seen in 4% of South Island birds and less than 1% of North Island birds (it is completely absent from the Chatham Islands).Boles, W.E. (2006). Family Rhipiduridae (fantails). Pp 200-244 in: del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A. & Christie, D.A. eds (2006) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 11. Old World Flycatchers to Old World Warblers. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. The black morph lacks the white areas and so is dark all over apart from a white spot behind the eye. Juveniles are similar to the adults but have a browner body and indistinct body markings. Behaviour During waking hours the bird is almost never still. It flits from perch to perch, sometimes on the ground but mostly on the twigs of a tree or any other convenient object, looking out for flying insects. The birds are not shy, and will often flit within a few metres of people, especially in forested areas and suburban gardens. In doing so, it is able to catch any small flying insects that may have been disturbed by human activities such as walking or digging. Under cold temperatures a flock of fantails will huddle to stay warm. The bird's call is an almost metallic cheek, either as a single sound or (more often) repeated as a chattering. =Breeding= The New Zealand fantail is a seasonal breeder, nesting from August to March in the North Island, September to January in the South Island and October to January on the Chatham Islands. They usually raise two or more broods per season. The birds form compact, cup- shaped nests, usually in the forks of trees, made from moss, bark and fibre, and often completed with spider's web. Both sexes build the nest. The clutch size is usually three to four cream eggs which are spotted grey and brown. The incubation period is around two weeks, and incubation and feeding duties are shared by both adults. Nest building and incubation of the second brood may occur while the fledged young of the first brood are still being fed. Young males may begin breeding two months after fledging. The nests of the New Zealand fantail are occasionallyMoon, G. & Lockley, R. (1982) New Zealand’s Birds, a photographic guide. Heinemann Publishers. Auckland, New Zealand parasitised by the two species of cuckoo in New Zealand. Approximately 45% of 81 nesting attempts that were monitored in urban Wellington successfully fledged chicks: one in four nests being abandoned or deserted and just over one in four suffering predation. Nests built on thin branches were more likely to escape predation from ship rats than those built on thick branches. In Mythology In Maori mythology, the piwakawaka is a messenger, bringing death or news of death from the gods to the people. The bulbous eyes and erratic flying behaviour of the bird is attributed to it being squeezed by M%C4%81ui_(mythology) for not revealing the whereabouts of his ancestress Mahuika, the fire deity. Tiwakawaka is also the name of one of the first Maori settlers to New Zealand.

Set in the fictionally named Black Valley in the west of Ireland (there is an actual Black Valley in Kerry) during the Great Famine of the 1840s, the novel tells the story of three generations of the Kilmartin family. The novel is scarifying about the constitutional politics of Daniel O'Connell, seen as laying the oppressed Irish of the 19th century open to the famine that would destroy their society. In a review for the Irish Times, author John Broderick said of one of the novel's characters: \\"Mary Kilmartin (the heroine) has been singled out by two generations of critics as one of the great creations of modern literature.

The manga was licensed for an English-language release by Tokyopop, which published seven volumes before shutting down in 2011. Akita Shoten completed the English translation and published the entire series digitally from 2018 to 2019. Characters * ' is a ninja and the bodyguard of Princess Beni (Red Princess). He went to the future when a bomb exploded beneath his feet and he fell into the lake with the Red Princess because of pursuers, at the beginning of the manga. There, he meets a girl who shares the same name and face of the princess he had sworn to protect. Time and time again, he proves his loyalty to the highschool girl, who has no idea why he's protecting her with such loyalty. He refused to hurt Takezaki (Beni's father's secretary), who had supposedly kidnapped Beni, only because Beni told him that she did not want to see Kagetora kill anyone. Kagetora's self-restraint shows when he is tasered by Takezaki but still does not fight back until allowed by Beni. While on a roof with Beni, where they had first met, Beni trips and falls off, he jumps over, and the next thing they know, they're back in the past. He eventually realizes that he time-warped into the time of the princess's descendant, who looks very similar to her, and that he must love and protect Beni Fujiwara. * ' is a high school girl who is a distant descendant of the Red Princess. Due to her rich family background, she gets kidnapped often. Throughout the story she mentions to Kagetora that she just wishes to die in a way that would be her father's fault—disturbing Kagetora quite a bit. Although she feels that Kagetora's loyalty is rather eccentric, she eventually falls in love with Kagetora, as he does with her. Later on, Kagetora discovers that she is not the princess, but rather her granddaughter look-alike. Beni finds out that she is betrothed to another man (Iwatsuru Rihito) whom she doesn't wish to marry. She even goes through extreme measures to try to exit the marriage. * ' is a princess of a country. While being pursued, an explosion happens and she falls into a lake, losing her right hand as well as her memory. A passerby finds her in the lake, confused and scared, so he takes her in. Soon, she marries that man and becomes pregnant with his child. When seeing Kagetora again, she remembers everything about her past. But even then, she refuses to return to her palace of riches, for she loves her husband. She tells Kagetora to leave and to tell her subjects that the princess is dead.

Such repositories can be downloaded as self-contained data sets or used online. The form in which the data is stored varies, ranging from line lists that can be graphically displayed to raw free induction decay (FID) data. Data is usually annotated in a way that correlates the spectral data with the related molecular structure.  Data format  Line list = The form in which most NMR is described in literature papers. It is common for databases to display line lists graphically in a manner that is similar to how processed spectra might appear. These line list however lack first and higher order splitting, satellites from low abundance isotopes like carbon or platinum, as well as the information concerning line width and other informative aspects of line shape. The advantage of a line list is that it requires a minimal amount of memory. = Processed image = Once an FID is processed into a spectrum it can be converted into an image that usually takes up less memory than the FID. This method requires more memory than a line list but supplies the user with considerably more information. The processed image has less information that a raw FID but it also take less memory and is easily displayed in browsers and requires no specialty data handling software. = Raw FID file = The raw free induction decay data obtained when performing the experiment are stored according to the formatting preferences of the instrument manufacturer. This data format contains the most information and requires the most storage space. A variety of commercial and free of software programs allow users to process FID data into useful spectra once FID data is downloaded.  Common search methods  Some database search methods are commonly available: *Compound name -- May include official IUPAC names and common names. *Molecular formula -- Either an exact formula or a range. *Molecular structure -- This method requires a molecular editor interface. *Registration number -- Commonly the CAS Registry Number but most databases also have their own numbering scheme. *Peak range or other spectral characteristics -- The user numerically enters data related to a spectra of an unknown compound. This data is used to for compounds which share the shifts within specified constraints. This allows users to locate the exact compound or molecules with similar functional groups. *Spectra search -- Software is used to search a database for spectra that resemble the a submitted spectra.  List of databases  The following is a partial list of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra databases: = ACD/Labs = Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/labs) is a chemoinformatics company which produces software for use in handling NMR data and predicting NMR spectra. ACD/Labs offers the Aldrich library as an add-on to their general spectrum processing software and specialized NMR software products. The NMR predictors allow improving the prediction of NMR spectra by adding data to user training databases. The content databases used to train the prediction algorithms (HNMR DB, CNMR DB, FNMR DB, NNMR DB, and PNMR DB) also include references to instruments and literature. These databases can be either purchased or leased as libraries through individual or group contracts. = Aldrich NMR Library = A portion of this database is still available in a three volume print version from Aldrich. The full electronic version includes a supplement of spectra not included in the paper version. In all, this database includes more than 15,000 compounds with the associated 300 MHz 1H and 75 MHz 13C spectra. The product includes the software necessary to view and handle the NMR data. This database can be purchased as a library through individual or group contracts. The spectra data appear to be stored as images of processed FID data. = Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank = The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BioMagResBank or BMRB) is sponsored by the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; it is dedicated to Proteins, Peptides, Nucleic Acids, and other Biomolecules. It stores a large variety of raw NMR data. = Wiley's KnowItAll NMR Spectral Library = Wiley offers a comprehensive collection of spectral data, including their Sadtler standard spectra. Their collection of NMR spectral data can be searched or used to build predictions; it includes CNMR, HNMR, and XNMR (F-19 NMR, P-31 NMR, N-15 NMR, etc.) spectra.http://www.knowitall.com/nmr = ChemGate = A database that was developed and maintained by the publisher John Wiley & Sons. This database included more than 700,000 NMR, IR and MS Spectra, statistics specific to the NMR spectra are not listed. The NMR data includes 1H,13C, 11B, 15N, 17O, 19F, 29Si, and 31P. The data were in the form of graphically displayed line lists. Access to the database could be purchased piecemeal or leased as the entire library through individual or group contracts. These data are now made available through Wiley Online Library. = ChemSpider = The ChemSpider chemical database accepts user submitted raw NMR data. The data in accepted in the JCAMP-DX format which can be actively viewed online with the JSpecView applet or the data can be downloaded for processing with other software packages. = NMRShiftDB = The NMRDShiftDB features a graphically displayed line list data. The data are hosted by Cologne University. Online access is free and user participation is encouraged. The data are available under the GNU FDL license. Contained 50479 measured spectra of, among other nuclei, 13C, 1H, 15N, 11B, 19F, 29Si, and 31P NMR as of Feb 21, 2014. = SpecInfo on the Internet = Available through Wiley Online Library (John Wiley & Sons), SpecInfo on the Internet NMR is a collection of approximately 440,000 NMR spectra (organized as 13C, 1H, 19F, 31P, and 29Si NMR databases). The data are accessed via the Internet using a Java interface and are stored in a server developed jointly with BASF. The software includes PDF report generation, spectrum prediction (database-trained and/or algorithm based), structure drawing, structure search, spectrum search, text field search, and more. Access to the databases is available to subscribers either as NMR only or combined with mass spectrometry and FT-IR data. Many of these data were also made available via ChemGate, described below. Coverage can be freely verified at Compound Search. A smaller collection of these data is still available via STN International. = Spectral Database for Organic Compounds = The Spectral Database for Organic Compounds (SDBS) is developed and maintained by Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. SDBS includes 14700 1H NMR spectra and 13000 13C NMR spectra as well as FT-IR, Raman, ESR, and MS data. The data are stored and displayed as an image of the processed data. Annotation is achieved by a list of the chemical shifts correlated to letters which are also used to label a molecular line drawing. Access to the database is available free of charge for noncommercial use. Users are requested not to download more than 50 spectra and/or compound information in one day. Between 1997 and February 2008 the database has been accessed more than 200 million times. T. Saito, K. Hayamizu, M. Yanagisawa and O. Yamamoto are attributed reproducibility for the NMR data.

Along with his teaching career, he led the modernist movement in Gujarati literature. He was prolific writer and he transformed the field of literary criticism. Life Building of Department of Gujarati, M. S. University He was born in Valod, a small town near Bardoli in South Gujarat on 30 May 1921. He did his schooling from Songadh and Gangadhara. He matriculated from Navsari in 1938. He completed his BA in 1943 and MA from Elphinstone College in 1945. In the same year, he started teaching at D. J. Singh College in Karachi and later joined Sardar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar in 1947. From 1951, he served as a lecturer, professor and later as Head of the Gujarati Department at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara till his retirement in 1981. His early life was spent at Songadh which influenced his life. At the age of eight, he secretly published his poem in Baljeevan magazine. He edited Falguni magazine in his college life. Upjati (1956) was his first published work. He had also edited Manisha, Kshitij, Etad and Uhapoh magazines. He died on 6 September 1986 due to kidney failure at Nadiad. Style Joshi at the age of 45, Vadodara A strong opponent of romantic tendencies in literature, Joshi influenced many up-and-coming writers in the 1960s and 1970s. His personal essays \\"are said to have introduced a new prose style in Gujarati literature,\\" according to Gujarati scholar Sarala Jag Mohan.Mohan, Sarala Jag, Chapter 4: \\"Twentieth-Century Gujarati Literature\\" (Google books link), in Natarajan, Nalini, and Emanuel Sampath Nelson, editors, Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , retrieved 10 December 2008 He was influenced by efforts of experimentation in western literature. He was one of the chief exponents of experimentalist poetry in Gujarati, primarily through his literary criticism, rather than his poems. Under his influence, form, technique and structure became far more important considerations within Gujarati poetry. The torments of the individual and literary craftsmanship became more highly esteemed, but intelligibility, lyricism and musicality were valued less, as were social concerns of the writer and even the contents of the work, according to Deepak B. Mehta.George, K. M., editor, Modern Indian Literature: An Anthology, published by Sahitya Akademi, 1992, , Chapter: \\"Modern Gujarati Literature\\" by Deepak B. Mehta Existentialism and phenomenology were prime interests of his. Works Suresh Joshi was a modernist author who led the modernist movement in Gujarati literature which emerged after 1955, the post-Gandhian era. He is recognized as the father of modern Gujarati literature and as the leader of avant-garde writers in Gujarati. According to Gujarati critic Bharat Mehta, the period of Gujarati literature from 1975 to 2000 was highly influenced by Suresh Joshi. Upjati (1956), Pratyancha (1961), Itara (1973) and Tathapi (1980) are his poetry collection. He withdrawn his first publication Upjati on his second publication. Through his poems, he introduced obscurity and ambiguity to Gujarati literature. His four novels are collectively published as Kathachatushtay. Two of them, Chhinnapatra (1965) and Maranottar (1973) were already published before. Vidula and Kathachakra were published before with other short stories but Joshi considered them as novels and published again with other two. Chhinnapatra was translated into English by Tridip Suhrud as Crumpled letters (1998). He was very experimental in novellas. He transformed the genre in Gujarati literature by his continued experimentation and esthetics. Grihapravesh (1957), Biji Thodik Vartao (1958), Apich (1965), Na Tatra Suryo Bhati (1967), Ekda Naimisharanye (1980) are his collection of stories which include 62 novellas.

Active since the late 1980s, Nichols has written for several country music singers, including Keith Whitley, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Jo Dee Messina, and Alan Jackson. He and songwriter Zack Turner recorded one album for BNA Entertainment (now BNA Records) in 1993 as the duo Turner Nichols, in addition to charting two singles as one half of that duo. Nichols, along with Craig Wiseman, earned a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 2004, for McGraw's Number One hit \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\". Biography Nichols was born on August 5, 1958, in Portsmouth, Virginia but his family moved between there and Springfield, Missouri. While in college, he pursued a broadcasting major, although the college soon dropped their programming. From there, he went to manufacture buckets for the fast-food chain KFC. Nichols started taking guitar lessons as well, and soon founded a band which played locally. His guitar teacher recommended him to a man who told Nichols that he could find a record deal. The man was a scam artist, however, and Nichols later went to the Attorney General's office to reclaim the money. After his experience, Nichols was featured in a 60 Minutes exposé about Nashville scam artists, and helped his local band gain exposure. Later on, Nichols and his band moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and by 1984 he had signed to a publishing contract with a company owned by Ronnie Milsap. At a songwriters' night at the Bluebird Café in Nashville, Nichols met Zack Turner through a friend. The two began writing together, and one of their collaborations, \\"I'm Over You\\", was recorded by Keith Whitley, whose rendition was a Top Five country hit shortly after his death in 1989. Both artists continued writing for other artists, with Nichols's first cut as a songwriter being \\"This Time Last Year\\", which Milsap recorded. Nichols also met Giles Godard, with whom he would later collaborate as well. By the early 1990s, Nichols had also had several more chart singles as a songwriter, including Milsap's \\"All Is Fair in Love and War\\", Billy Dean's \\"Tryin' to Hide a Fire in the Dark\\", and another posthumous release from Whitley, \\"Brotherly Love\\" (a duet with Earl Thomas Conley). =Turner Nichols= Turner and Nichols signed in 1993 to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as BNA Records), releasing an album that year as the duo Turner Nichols. This album, co-written almost entirely by the duo, included the singles \\"Moonlight Drive-In\\" and \\"She Loves to Hear Me Rock\\", both of which charted on the Billboard and RPM country charts in the US and Canada, respectively. Turner and Nichols never recorded any other material, although they co-wrote Jo Dee Messina's 1996 single \\"You're Not in Kansas Anymore\\", and Nichols also co-wrote Messina's debut single, \\"Heads Carolina, Tails California\\". =Mid-1990s-present= Since the disbanding of Turner Nichols, Nichols continued to write songs, often with Giles Godard or Mark D. Sanders. Three of Nichols's songs have become Number One hits on the country charts: \\"(This Ain't) No Thinkin' Thing\\" by Trace Adkins, \\"Girls Lie Too\\" by Terri Clark, and \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\" by Tim McGraw (which preceded \\"Girls Lie Too\\" at #1). \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\" also earned Nichols and Craig Wiseman, the song's other co-writer, the Grammy Award for Best Country Song at the 47th Grammy Awards, as well as the Song of the Year award from the Academy of Country Music. Nichols and Wiseman also wrote Faith Hill's \\"A Baby Changes Everything\\", a Number One hit on the Adult Contemporary charts in December 2008. Other artists who have recorded Nichols's material include Tracy Byrd, Alan Jackson, Patty Loveless and Lee Ann Womack.

He combined empirical research with mathematical models, and supported the declining population paradigm. Childhood Caughley was the middle of three children. He was the only son born to John Norman Caughley and Thelma Caughley. His father would take him on excursions while his mother encouraged his curiosity.Tyndale-Biscoe, C.H. 1999. Biographical Memoirs: Graeme James Caughley 1937–1994. Historical Records of Australian Science 12(3). As a young child Caughley was very inquisitive and he recalled finding a seashell on top of a hill. At the age of seven he determined that the sea must have once covered the hill and was proud to have resolved the problem.Caughley, G. The Deer Wars, Hong Kong, 1983, pp. 13–14 This event encouraged him to learn more about New Zealand's geology and as Gunn and Walker explain \\"Ecology had a close call with Graeme Caughley. He almost chose geology at the start of his career...\\" EducationBachelors= Caughley attended Victoria University College in Wellington, New Zealand from 1956 to 1959. Tyndale-Biscoe writes that \\"there is no record of any particular lecturers influencing his thinking.\\" In his last two years Caughley dropped down to part-time and went to work with his friend Thane Riney at the New Zealand Forest Service on feral goat herds. =Masters= Caughley continued his education at the University of Sydney (1960–1963) with his advisors Charles Birch (insect population ecologist) and Harry Frith (ornithologist). Frith was chief of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Caughley used the CSIRO sheep station to study the ecology of kangaroos. Caughley found that kangaroo groups are formed by a random process of members coming and leaving, which was in contrast to what he had seen in red deer. He interpreted this to mean that random grouping was density dependent with increased grouping at higher densities. An approximation of density could then be found by taking the average number of individuals per group in a given area. Continuing his research he found that red kangaroos are much more drought-tolerant than grey kangaroos, which visit water three times more often. In addition he showed that grey kangaroos prefer areas of higher ground cover than do red kangaroos and that this may be a behavioural relic from when the Tasmanian wolf and Tasmanian devil overlapped in habitat with the kangaroo. =Doctoral= While working for the New Zealand Forest Service, Graeme used his research on the Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) towards his doctoral work. He decided to work on tahr because at that time everyone claimed to be an expert on red deer and he thought that he would make a greater contribution working on the lesser known tahr. Caughley wanted to see if Thane Riney's eruption and stabilisation patterns in deer also applied to tahr. He used his studies at the Forest Service for his PhD thesis at the University of Canterbury (1962–1967) advised primarily by Bernard Stonehouse (Antarctic and penguin ecologist). Using three study populations of Himalayan tahr (judged to be in the initial increase, initial stabilisation, and decline stage) Caughley found that tahr follow the pattern that Riney had found in deer. Significant contributions During 1966 Caughley presented methods by which to determine mortality patterns in mammals. He looked at mortality rate curves (qx) among ungulates, rats, voles, sheep, and man he found that they followed a common pattern. This \\"u\\" shaped pattern had a high juvenile mortality followed by a decrease and then a steady increase in mortality punctuated by a sharp increase with maturity. With this mortality pattern it was shown that although age of mortality differs among species as well as cause of death (disease, lack of food, predation) the trend that mammal species follow is similar. This is important in wildlife management since it shows that regardless of natural mortality factors populations tend to have high juvenile and mature deaths. While working for the Forest Service and attending the University of Canterbury for his PhD, Caughley modified Lotka and Fisher's equations for birth rates in populations to ones that applied to seasonally breeding populations. He wrote that most of the animal world had a season for breeding and that if births were treated as occurring at only one point in time then these equations could be used for seasonally breeding populations. This modification now gave a more accurate estimate of the reproductive value of a population without overestimating births by assuming year around reproduction. Caughley and Birch (1971) published \\"Rate of Increase\\" to point out some of the misuses with this equation. Originally applied mainly to insects and humans they claim that the questions asked by entomologists are not necessarily those asked by mammalogists and vice versa. It is this difference in questions that caused misuse of particular equations in the realm of vertebrate studies. They point out that the rate of increase at a given density for a population of a stable age distribution (rs) is not obtainable when looking at mammals. This is because the assumptions used to make the age distributions (rs=0) when used to estimate rs cause it to be low. The second argument is that the maximum rate at which a population with a stable age distribution increases in a given environment (rm= intrinsic rate of increase) can be calculated with the correct data. It had however, been used incorrectly by mammalogists who thought that vertebrate life table and fecundity data somehow paralleled those of caged insects held at low density. The correction was to infer what the rate of increase for a given population would be at both the initial density and at a higher density. In this way they corrected a misapplication of models so that those managing populations would use the right equation for the question that they were asking. Not only did Caughley clarify methods so that they would be more applicable to population ecology, but he also condensed material that he thought was useful. In \\"Analysis of Vertebrate Populations\\" he distilled analyses that he thought were most relevant to the field and chose those that were also easy to understand.Caughley, G. (1977) Analysis of Vertebrate Populations. London: Wiley Interscience R. S. Millar stated in his review that until this book literature on analyses had been scattered and difficult to understand, but Caughley made topics more readable. Caughley also co-published a book on Wildlife Ecology, Conservation, and Management:Sinclair, A. R. E., Fryxell, J. & Caughley, G. London: Wiley-Blackwell the first portion of the book covers an overview of population ecology while the second part is on applied ecology or management. His last publication Conservation Biology in Theory and PracticeCaughley, G. & Gunn, Anne (1996) Conservation Biology in Theory and Practice. Cambridge, MA; Oxford: Blackwell Science gives a history of prehistoric and historic extinctions as well as a collection of case studies. It contains chapters that look at the different ways population dynamics, risks, and legislation are approached. Perez claims that there is such a high volume of conservation textbooks today, but this one is more of a handbook on diagnosing and treating problems with populations. This diagnostic style is in part due to it being written by two field biologists, something that Clinchy and Krebs say took sixteen years in the making. That this is the first time that field biologists have written a book on conservation biology is a breakthrough in conservation biology. Before this, textbooks written by lab ecologists were used to teach field ecologists in a more abstract theoretical way. Paradigm Caughley advocated the use of the Declining Population Paradigm in conservation biology. This paradigm seeks to discover why a population is declining and how to prevent further declines. This opposes the small population paradigm that seeks to determine how long a small population will last. The declining population paradigm is not overly theoretical and does not deal with population viability analysis, effective population size, minimum viable populations or problems related to genetics. Caughley pointed out that it did not require a model to go out and observe what was going on in a system (cause and effect), although this lack of a mathematical model hinders generalisations by requiring case by case assessments. Shortly after Caughley's death, Hedrick and colleagues argued against the declining population paradigm for what they called the inclusive population viability analysis (PVA) At a first reading it is difficult to discern what the counter argument is since they state that they agree with Caughley in that a broader understanding and synthesis of ideas is required. It is upon closer examination, however that the concept and statement that \\"one cannot always interpret the significance of deterministic factors unless a proper inclusive PVA is carried out\\". This paper was in reaction to Caughley's promotion of common sense and was written by those that encouraged the use of mathematical models. Caughley however, was not against mathematical models and used them to determine rates of increase, dispersal, fecundity, and mortality. To truly understand the controversy one must read the two articles of \\"Viva Caughley!\\". Both articles were written as a rebuttal to Hedrick and colleagues, who claim that Caughley's ideas are overly simplistic. Clinchy and Krebs explain that in fact it was not simple enough and \\"the basic distinction in conservation biology is between field biologists and lab scientists\\". It then was a heated debate against those that used expensive modelling programs and those that went out to do the same thing with inexpensive tools purchased at a hardware store such as pvc pipe and bits of string. Upon careful observation there is little disagreement found between what Caughley said and the rebuttal that Hedrick and colleagues gave.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case. In a split opinion, the Court held that the Surgeon General's warning did not preclude lawsuits by smokers against tobacco companies on the basis of several claims. The case examined whether tobacco companies could be liable for not warning the consumer \\"adequately\\" of the dangers of cigarettes as well as ultimately held the stance that smoking was in fact a free choice. The ruling also questioned the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 to determine whether the warning labels on the cigarette products by law had to be less or more alarming than the warning issued .. The warning at issue said: \\"Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.\\" 9th Surgeon General of the United States, Luther Terry The court's holding and some of Justice Stevens's reasoning enjoyed majority support, but the opinion eventually gained full majority support 16 years later in Altria Group v. Good.  Background  The relationship that the American people has had with tobacco companies can be said to be tumultuous and is documented. Tobacco has always been a staple economic resource in the fabric of the American economy, even in trade amongst Native American tribes. Tobacco crops were instrumental in the early economic development of the United States in colonial times. Following this period was a rise in the cigarette. Tobacco and smoking began to be engraved in the culture and lifestyle of the American public, associated with things such as \\"sexy, cool, masculine\\".Brandt, Allan M. \\"The Cigarette Century: the Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America.\\" New York: Basic, 2009, The popularity of tobacco was soon replaced with skepticism and many wanting to know the health risks of smoking. Research and analysis followed in order to understand these risks, with shocking conclusions and connections to diseases( coronary disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, cancer of the larynx, oral cancer, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the pancreas) that left many in shock. Public Health advocates urged for the banning of cigarette sales and the overall production of cigarettes in order to protect the public. With the battle between tobacco companies and public health advocates ensuing, litigation against tobacco companies became the next step. From the 1950s on, there began to be litigation filed against tobacco companies to be liable for injuries and/or consequences from smoking cigarettes. Cases such as Pritchard v. Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co., Fine v. Philip Morris, Inc. consisted of patients blaming cigarettes for their current health conditions and wanting tobacco companies to be held liable. Many of these cases were victories for tobacco companies, often being that litigants in the beginning of this new era of lawsuits against tobacco were not able to prove the concrete association between smoking and diseases aforementioned. By the 1970s, the cultural tide on smoking had once again changed. With medical evidence more advanced than in previous decades, the association between smoking and diseases like cancer was becoming ever more prevalent, leaving tobacco companies less options to hide from this truth. Furthermore, the Surgeon General's Warning in 1964 served as a final piece needed to close the gap between the two concepts. In addition to liability laws being changed from the time of the 1950s, plaintiffs no longer had to prove negligence on the part of the company with regards to their product but expose a defect. With the restrictions becoming more laxed, new lawsuits surged once again against tobacco companies.  Life of Rose Cipollone  Rose Cipollone began smoking at the age of sixteen. She continually smoked Chesterfield cigarettes—up to a pack and a half a pack per day. It wasn't until she was pregnant and at her husband Antonio Cipollone's request that she attempted to quit smoking. Though she cut down on her regular smoking of a pack and a half per day, she still secretly smoked during her pregnancy. In 1955, Rose switched to Liggett and Myer brand of cigarettes on the basis that their “pure white Miracle Tip” filter appeared to be a healthier alternative compared to Chesterfield Cigarettes. In 1968, Rose switched to smoking Parliament brand cigarettes, citing conditions attributed to her health as her reasoning. Parliaments were advertised to have a recessed filter and lower tar content than that of other competitive cigarette brands. Finally, Rose switched to Lorillard's True cigarettes under the recommendation of her physician. Her options at this point were to either quit smoking or switch to this brand of cigarette with its advertised plastic filter inserts. Rose chose the latter option, and continued to smoke with the suggested brand of her physician. While Rose was trying to decide which brand of cigarettes was right for her, she simultaneously was suffering the health effects of smoking. In the mid-1960s, Rose began to develop a smokers’ cough, as well as problems such as chest pain and hypertension. In 1981, doctors found a carcinomatous spot on her right lung and performed a partial lung resection. After the multitudes of consultations and operations so far in her life, Rose still continued to smoke, “though often now in secret\\", claimed Rose from an unknown source. In 1982, the cancer had spread to her lower and middle right lung, and Cipollone had surgery to remove the entire lung as well as a large adrenal mass in 1983. Rose Cipollone died on October 24, 1984, after her lung cancer had spread and become inoperable. It wasn't until the year before Rose Cipollone's death that she met Marc Edell. Recommended by her chest surgeon, Marc Edell was skilled in the art of going after companies and their negligence to protect consumer health. Edell had previously represented the Asbestos Companies in their defense in regard to the health-related claims brought against them. From that case, Edell became familiar with “pulmonary pathology and risks of smoking” and became interested in litigation against the tobacco industry. In need of a client, Edell took on Cipollone's case and filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Liggett and Myers, Philip Morris, and Lorillard composed of fourteen tort complaints on August 1, 1983, just over a year before her death. The action was brought in federal court as a Diversity of citizenship case.  Trial  First case = Edell planned to argue a case based on the cause of Cipollone's death: nicotine from her cigarettes. He gathered facts to bring a series of claims to the court that argued the following: * Tobacco companies had failed to and were negligent in putting better designs of cigarettes on the market when they had the resources to do so * They had committed fraud by failing to act on their knowledge of the harms of smoking * They had failed to fully inform the public of the true risks of smoking * The cigarette makers had breached express warranty by making health claims in their advertising and promotions, which fraudulently overshadowed the mandated health warnings * There was a conspiracy by tobacco companies to prevent other third party groups from releasing health information on the hazards of cigarettes * Pain and suffering were alleged results of her illness and under the liability rules and law should be compensated for Liggett and Myers, Philip Morris, and Lorillard all cited the 1965 Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act. The companies argued the act supported preempted independent state regulation of tobacco and therefore prevented state litigation, making the tobacco industry immune to suits. From there, they moved to dismiss the case. The trial judge, H. Lee Sarokin, ruled in favor of Cipollone, stating that while state legislatures are prohibited from requiring specific warning labels and regulation of them, Edell's tactic of calling into question the inadequacy of the ones already present under the government was acceptable. The ruling was later overturned on interlocutory appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. However, the appellate court did allow the case to be retried in district court on the condition that no claims regarding advertisement and promotion could be made. Edell accepted that condition and prepared for retrial. = Second case = In the retrial, Edell was not allowed to enter evidence claiming that Liggett & Myers had worked on the creation of a safer cigarette. He also was not allowed to bring evidence regarding the tobacco industry's “duty to warn” of the dangers of cigarette smoking. Edell strengthened his case with his access to 300,000 pages of internal documents of the tobacco companies. These documents included compelling and damaging evidence that the tobacco companies had proof, backed by research dating back to the 1940s, that nicotine was addictive and potentially carcinogenic. Before the trial could begin however, the battle over the use of these documents was carried out. The tobacco companies unsuccessfully struggled to suppress the evidence papers obtained by Edell on the grounds that it would \\"divulge trade secrets\\"; the trial court judge, Sarokin, ruled that the people and the court had the Constitutional right to know what the companies know and granted the use of the papers. The tobacco companies still made an effort to thwart the efforts of Edell to use the papers. They not only appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ruling, but also the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. It was established that the evidence would be used in trial. Alongside the tobacco industry documents, Edell argued that the powerful advertising for the brands Cipollone smoked was an unscrupulous strategy utilized by the tobacco industry to not only overshadow the warning labels mandated by the federal government, but also to promote cigarette use and nicotine addiction as a marketing strategy for company profit. Edell also claimed that Cipollone's tobacco use stemmed from her nicotine addiction, which was encouraged by the advertising of Liggett and Myers, Philip Morris, and Lorillard by the use of both health claims and advertising. Edell made sure that Cipollone was portrayed as a woman who was disparaged by her powerful addiction to the tobacco industry's product; expert testimony showed that she even displayed withdrawal symptoms, sometimes digging through “the trash for butts when she ran out of cigarettes”. Edell was heavily committed to the case. He was seen working seven days a week and spending his every waking minute on the case. He sacrificed time with both his wife and children to ensure his arguments were strong. After presenting his case that the tobacco industry's advertising of cigarettes and knowledge of risk related to Cipollone's claims, the tobacco companies' defense moved for dismissal. The motion was denied. They were going to have to answer to Edell's claims. The tobacco industry argued that Rose Cipollone was fully aware of the risks of smoking both before and during her cigarette use. \\"She was an independent woman, making an independent decision to continue smoking, and she was in control, not the nicotine\\" claimed the tobacco industries. Furthermore, even if the cigarettes had caused her death, it was in no way the responsibility of the industry. As research and the industry documents were used in trial, Edell failed to show any explicit proof that lung cancer is linked directly to smoking. Furthermore, expert testimony revealed that the type of lung cancer affecting Cipollone was not associated with smoking. Cipollone's constant switching between “healthier” brands also showed her acknowledgment of the dangers of smoking, argued by the defense.  Ruling  New Jersey District Court = District Court = The jury deliberated for 6 days, and reached the verdict on June 3, 1988—considering the conspiracy claims and the lack of expression in warranty and warning argued by Edell. The jury was composed of 3 non-smokers, 2 former smokers, and 1 smoker. The group of 6 had concluded that: * Cipollone was 80% at fault, based on their assessment of her personal choice to smoke being a factor * All claims for failure to warn were dropped against Philip Morris and Lorillard, since Cipollone began smoking their cigarettes after the 1966 federally mandated warning labels appeared on the packages * Only Liggett & Myers could be held liable, as Cipollone smoked their cigarettes before the 1966 warning labels * Court ruled that the company did in fact contribute to her death. * The jury awarded $400,000 in damages to Mr. Antonio Cipollone, who had continued to fight the case after his wife's death. * The claim regarding the tobacco industry's withholding of a production of a safer cigarette was dismissed on the grounds that it involved speculation to whether Cipollone would have in fact chosen to smoke the safer option if given the opportunity Edell was pleased that they had received some monetary reward and saw it as a victory. However, he comments on his hope that the courts would've gone further with their condemnation of big tobacco in an interview sometime after the ruling. Emblem for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit = Court of Appeals = After the District Court Ruling, the tobacco companies appealed to the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit in hopes of reversing the verdict. In 1990, the Third Circuit appellate court threw out the verdict and: * Set aside the $400,000 in damages on the grounds that there was no proof that Cipollone relied on the Liggett & Myers advertisements in question. * Allowed Edell to file suit on the basis of design and advertising. He was able to claim that prior to the 1966 Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act, tobacco companies did not inform the average unaware smoker on the dangers of smoking while they in fact knew this information. * Edell could argue the case that the tobacco industry could be held liable on a live claim that the company made Cipollone unaware of the product's dangers outweighing the benefits. Five days after the appellate ruling, Antonio Cipollone died, Rose Cipollone's son continued on with the case after her husband's death. Both the plaintiff and the defense in this case were looking for a concrete doctrine regarding the ability to litigate regarding preemption, state regulation of tobacco, and the Act cited in the first trial of the case. United States Supreme Court, Washington D.C. = Supreme Court = The Supreme Court addressed the issue of preemption of federal law in regard to state law regulating the tobacco industry and whether common law damages constitute a requirement based on smoking and health based on state law in regard to advertisements and promotion.The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1966, which excludes all manufacturers who label their packages with proper warnings from requirement or prohibition, led the majority of the court to the opinion that: * The filing of a “failure-to-warn” claim against the tobacco industry by Edell was invalid and prohibited * Cases involving the neutralization of federal warnings in advertisements on the grounds that the Act preempted, or overrode, state laws were also invalid and prohibited * Limited common law claims preempted by statute The majority ruling by the Supreme Court limited the potential litigants in lawsuits against tobacco industries to only smokers who developed diseases prior to 1969. The opinion did not exclude fraud and conspiracy or express warranty, as section 5b of the 1969 Act does not explicitly define this; The Supreme Court also stated that if the plaintiff, Edell and Cipollone's son in this case, could prove any of the following: # the industry conspired to hide evidence concerning the harms of smoking # or lied to the public about them, # or if express warranties were breached then a new case can be filed, as there is no discussion of tort litigation or damage claims in the Act. The concurring opinion of the court found that no damage claims were preempted rather than not discussed. The dissenting justices found that all state laws were preempted by the act.  Public outcry and media attention  United States Capital Building, Washington D.C. The case caught the attention of many: Congress, Wall Street, and legal communities across the country. Legal communities, those opposed to and supportive of tobacco companies, analyzed the victor in the trials and what it entailed for future liability suits against tobacco companies. Congressional leaders watched, some supporters of big tobacco and others some of its strongest critics. A new conversation in the public forum had been opened with Cipollone v Liggett Group Inc, with the public becoming more informed on the dangers of smoking. However, this can only be said for a small few, as others did know the dangers before the case and the warning of Surgeon General Terry. The smoking population stayed constant through the trial, with no substantial change occurring during the course of the trials. . Aftermath 312x312px The U.S. Supreme Court remanded Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. for a new trial. The retrial never occurred; the $400,000 verdict for Cipollone from the original trial was far eclipsed by the exorbitant costs and length of the lawsuit. Since the case was filed, almost half the ten years was spent on post-trial matters. In 1988, Phillip Morris was quoted as saying: \\"Almost 200 lawsuits have been brought in the last five and a half years and the cigarette manufacturers have not ... paid a penny to settle one.\\" As of 1992, the law firms handling Cipollone and seven other tobacco litigation cases had \\"incurred approximately $1.2 million in out-of-pocket expenses ... The firms have also spent well over $5 million in lawyer and paralegal time\\". Rose Cipollone's son filed for a voluntary withdrawal of the lawsuit on November 4, 1992. Six other tobacco liability cases were withdrawn the same month as well. The firm handling Cipollone was denied withdrawal in the last remaining case, Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc. Haines dragged on for another decade and then some, until a settlement order was approved on April 13, 2004.  Legacy  The Cipollone v Liggett Group Inc was one of the costliest liability lawsuits spanning the course of five years. Tobacco companies before the case were succeeding in the court room—no plaintiffs had ever been like Edell in previous cases. Many earlier plaintiffs were not able to make the scientific correlation between smoking cigarettes and the diseases that are linked to them. Many plaintiffs were out financed by big tobacco companies as well, with companies having what seemed to be unlimited pools of financial resources while plaintiffs struggled with countless court fees. With Cipollone v Liggett Inc, finances were not a major problem for Edell and his team. They were the first to introduce the concept of a conspiracy by tobacco companies to keep the public misinformed on the dangers of smoking and that there was a \\"safer cigarette\\" hidden in the shadows. After the case, tobacco companies viewed the ruling as a victory in their favor. However, this proclamation did not stop a wave of hundreds of lawsuits to follow in liability after Cipollone v Liggett Inc. Cipollone v Liggett Group Inc is viewed by some commentators as a monumental achievement in the anti-tobacco crusade. However, many say that even with the surge in liability lawsuits against tobacco companies, it will be hard for any more progress to ensue. The same problems are still standing in the way of future plaintiffs who decide to go after big tobacco: # The financial resources of tobacco companies surpasses that of all plaintiffs # The limitations placed by the Supreme Court on who can still litigate against tobacco companies ( those who developed diseases prior to 1969) # If the argument of smoking being free choice is still intact, there will always be blame to put on the plaintiff and cannot solely rest on tobacco companies ReferencesExternal links * * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:United States federal preemption law Category:United States tobacco case law Category:1992 in United States case law Category:Liggett Group Category:Smoking in the United States ","title":"Cipollone v.

Frank Baum. Thompson used Peter as the protagonist in three of her books: The Gnome King of Oz (1927), Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz (1929), and Pirates in Oz (1931).Snow, pp. 260-2. Peter constitutes the first time in the Oz series in which a boy from the United States serves as the protagonist in the novels, rather than a supporting character. (Contrast Zeb in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, Button-Bright in The Road to Oz and other books, and Bob Up in Thompson's earlier The Cowardly Lion of Oz.)Snow, pp. 22, 28, and 248. Peter is not only the protagonist of the three novels but the hero, in that his positive actions and traits bring about the affirmative resolution of the plot conflicts in the books. When Thompson introduces him in Gnome King, Peter is a nine-year-old boy from Philadelphia. Peter is being raised by his grandfather; he is one of the long list of orphans or apparent orphans in children's literature (they are notably frequent in the Oz books themselves).Osmond Beckwith, \\"The Oddness of Oz,\\" Children's Literature, Vol. 5 (1976), pp. 74-91. His travels to the world of Oz provide him opportunities to display courage, independence, loyalty and other traditional virtues; in this, he differs from Button-Bright and Bob Up, younger children with less effect on their plots. At the end of Gnome King, Peter has a chance to become a prince of Oz -- which he rejects, out of loyalty to his friends and fellow baseball-team members at home in Philadelphia. Peter brings bags of gold home to his grandfather. His attitude toward life is somewhat insouciant and devil- may-care; in the opening chapter of Jack Pumpkinhead he wonders idly if \\"the Gnome King has gotten into any more mischief\\" -- giving little serious consideration to the most persistent villain in the Oz universe. Pirates in Oz, the third book in which Peter appears, contains a contradiction on Peter's age. The book identifies him as eleven years old, but also states that five years have passed since the events of Gnome King, which would make Peter fourteen, however, she may be referring to four years in Oz, and not Philadelphia. Thompson herself noted her tendency to favor boy heroes,David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 76. in contrast to Baum's preference for girl protagonists (Dorothy Gale, Princess Ozma, Betsy Bobbin, and Trot).Snow, pp. 16, 58-9, 151-2, and 221.

Executed in oil on canvas, it depicts six men swimming naked in a lake, and is considered a masterpiece of American painting. According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is \\"perhaps Eakins' most accomplished rendition of the nude figure\\", and has been called \\"the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures\\". Since the Renaissance, the human body has been considered both the basis of artists' training and the most challenging subject to depict in art, and the nude was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form. In this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers). Although the theme of male bathers was familiar in Western art, having been explored by artists from Michelangelo to Daumier, Eakins' treatment was novel in American art at the time. The Swimming Hole has been \\"widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art\\". In 2008, the art critic Tom Lubbock described Eakins' work as:  Title and composition  The Dying Gaul, Capitoline Museums, Rome. This Hellenistic work of the late third century BC is believed to have been a source for the reclining figure on the far left of the painting. Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming. The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. Frédéric Bazille. Scène d'été, 1869, oil on canvas, × in (158 × 159 cm), Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Eakins may have seen this painting while studying in Paris. The composition is pyramidal. The figure reclining at left leads the viewer's eye to the seated figure, whose gesture in turn points to Godley at the apex of the compositional pyramid. The diving figure at right leads to the swimming form of Eakins, who painted himself into the scene and whose leftward movement directs attention back into the painting. Eakins enforces this pyramidal structure by manipulating the focus of the painting: the center area containing the swimmers is extremely precise, while the outer areas are diffuse, with \\"virtually no moderating zones in between\\". The lighting within the picture is unnatural—too bright in some places, and too dark in others—although the effect, which tends to accentuate the body lines of the swimmers, is generally subtle. The composition is notable for both its adherence to academic tradition (the mastery of the figure as an end in itself), and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare in the history of Western art. The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing \\"from reclining to sitting to standing to diving\\"; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible. As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a self-portrait, here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in The Gross Clinic or Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, here the artist's presence is more ambiguous—he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur. The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested; the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection. This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism. Thomas Eakins. Arcadia, 1883, × 45 in (98 × 114 cm), oil on canvas, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Like The Swimming Hole, this painting shows the influence of a classical conceit. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting. In Eakins' oeuvre, The Swimming Hole was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the Arcadian theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on Ancient Greek sculpture and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of Phidias' Pan-Athenaic procession from the Parthenon marbles. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 Arcadia, a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.  Studies  Eakins made several on-site oil sketches and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or vice versa (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day). By the early 1880s, Eakins was using photography to explore sequential movement and as a reference for painting. Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities. Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to The Swimming Hole. The swimmers are seen in the same spot and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. \\"The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may tell us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch. The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical \\"severity\\". Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.

Oil on fiberboard mounted on fiberboard, × in (22 × 27 cm), Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC. Eakins combined his studies into a final oil sketch in 1884, which became the basis for the finished painting. The basic composition remained unchanged, as all six men and the dog appeared in the sketch; however, Eakins, who usually adhered closely to his sketches when developing a final work, made several uncharacteristic alterations to the specific movements and positions of the figures. A friend and student, Charles Bregler, described the process:  Commission and reception  Thomas Eakins, c. 1882 The painting was commissioned in 1884 by Edward Hornor Coates, a Philadelphia businessman who chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught. Coates intended to pay Eakins $800 ($ in dollars), which at the time was the largest commission Eakins had been offered. Coates intended the painting for an exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and it was shown at the Academy's exhibition in the fall of 1885. However, Coates rejected it as unrepresentative of Eakins' oeuvre. In a November 27, 1885 letter to Eakins, Coates reasoned: Portrait of Edward Hornor Coates, 10th President P.A.F.A. (1912) by John McLure Hamilton, private collection. It is not known precisely why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, it seems likely that Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange The Swimming Hole for the \\"less controversial genre scene\\" of Eakins' The Pathetic Song—today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art— and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission. On February 9, 1886, Eakins was forced to resign from the Academy because of his removal of a loincloth from a male model in a class where female students were present. In a letter to Coates on February 15 in which Eakins explained his reasons for resigning, he addressed the issue of nudity in his artwork:  Provenance  Following its rejection by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference to the painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917. In 1925, The Swimming Hole was purchased from the artist's widow by the community of Fort Worth, Texas for $750 ($ in dollars). Thereafter it was in the collection of the Fort Worth Art Association, the institutional predecessor of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, and was displayed in the city's public library. In 1990, the museum announced it intended to sell the painting to build an endowment for the purchase of contemporary art. A public outcry ensued, prompting the museum to search for a local buyer. Eventually, after tumultuous negotiations, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art agreed to purchase The Swimming Hole for $10 million ($ in dollars).  Restorations  Before its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, The Swimming Hole appears to have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, The Swimming Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993. Following its purchase by the Amon Carter, in June 1993, Claire M. Barry and staff from the Amon Carter and the Kimbell Art Museums began a major restoration of the painting. According to Barry, \\"The restoration revealed relatively little significant damage or deterioration not previously visible. Several layers of discolored varnish and overpaint were removed, exposing a rich and varied surface with brushwork ranging from the controlled, almost miniaturistic strokes forming the figures to the freer treatment of the landscape elements.\\" Much effort went into distinguishing the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, was located in 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled to the painting. During the restoration, it was discovered that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 was the result of a misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a fugitive red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.  Interpretation  The Swimming Hole represented the full range of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form. Lloyd Goodrich (1897–1987) believed the work was \\"Eakins' most masterful use of the nude\\", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's \\"richest pieces of painting\\". Another biographer, William Innes Homer (1929-2012), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, \\"it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature\\". Before the mid-19th century, the subject of the nude male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting. Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art. Viewed in a broader context, The Swimming Hole has been cited as one of the few 19th- century American paintings that \\"engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition\\"—that of the male bather. Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in Summer Scene, Georges Seurat (1859–91) (Bathers at Asnières, 1884) and Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject. George Bellows. Forty-two Kids, 1907, oil on canvas, Corcoran Gallery of Art. Eakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of American realists, particularly the artists of the Ashcan School. George Bellows' (1882–1925) Forty-two Kids, painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to The Swimming Hole, although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban Hudson River of New York City rather than in a rural setting. In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting Forty-two Kids: \\"Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately.\\" Eakins' widow's retitling of the picture after his death reinforced the popular association with the nostalgic sentiment of Riley's poem. More recently, the painting's subject has been compared to the poem \\"Song of Myself\\" by Walt Whitman (1819–92), particularly the section \\"Twenty- Eight Young Men Bathe by the Shore\\", given the shared interest in the imagery of men bathing in the nude. Whitman may have provided inspiration: the celebration of nudity, which in Whitman's case was an open expression of his homosexuality, informs the art of both men. In 1895, one of Eakins' male students reminisced about \\"us Whitman fellows\\", which has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality. \\"But for their marital status, however, virtually nothing concrete is known of the private realms or sexual propensities of any of the men depicted (in The Swimming Hole), with the exception of Eakins.\\" Dove Lake Although the painting has been viewed as a platonic vision of the male nude seen unselfconsciously in a natural setting, by the 1970s some American writers were beginning to see Eakins' work, and specifically The Swimming Hole, as having homoerotic implications. Critics have paid particular attention to the compositional prominence of the standing figure's buttocks, which has been interpreted as suggestive of \\"homoerotic interests\\". According to Jonathan Weinberg, The Swimming Hole marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art. Eakins left a record simultaneously provocative and ambiguous on matters of sex. On the basis of the same visual evidence, that of the photographs, oil sketches, and the finished painting of swimmers, art historians have drawn markedly varying conclusions as to the artist's intent.

The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches during the English summer; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. Johnston was a left-arm bowler who engaged in fast bowling when the ball was new and conducive to pacemen, before reverting to orthodox spin when the ball became old. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball attack of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were regarded as one of the finest pace pairings of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short bursts against the English batsmen with the new ball. The hosts had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than usual. This allowed the Australian pacemen more frequent use of a shiny ball that swung at high pace. Johnston typically delivered pace after the Lindwall and Miller had first use of the new ball, before resorting to spin later in the innings. In order to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh, Bradman had Johnston deliver the most overs by any bowler. Johnston was the equal-leading wicket- taker in the Tests (27 along with Lindwall) and Australia's most prolific wicket-taker in the first-class matches with 102. The latter feat made him the last Australian to take a century of wickets on an Ashes tour. In recognition of his achievements, Johnston was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Wisden said \\"no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side\\".  Background  During the Australian summer of 1947-48, Johnston played in four of the five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He was a major part in Australia's 4-0 series win; the second highest wicket-taker with 16 scalps, Johnston had the best bowling average of 11.37. Ray Lindwall led the wicket-takers with 18. As a result, Johnston was selected for the 1948 tour of England. During the trip, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring who was a teammate in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg spinner, he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the playing XI.  Early tour  Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. When Johnston was omitted for the opening match, it appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Australia went on to win by an innings, setting the tone for their tour. Bradman brought Johnston into the team for the second tour match against Leicestershire. He made 12 runs and was the last man out as Australia ended on 448. After a lower order collapse of 5/38This notation means that five wickets were lost while 38 runs were scored. against the local spin attack, Johnston came in and put on 37 in partnership with Keith Miller, allowing his colleague to reach his double century.Fingleton, p. 50. Johnston bowled six wicketless overs for 15 as the hosts fell for 130. Made to follow on, Leicestershire made 147 to lose by an innings. Johnston took his first wicket of the tour, trapping Jack Walsh leg before wicket (lbw) to end with 1/42 from 27 overs. Johnston played a leading role in Australia's victory in the next match, against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling.Fingleton, pp. 53-55. In this match, Johnston resorted to bowling left arm orthodox spin. The hosts elected to bat and he bowled almost unchanged, sending down 26 of the 54.3 overs, 14 of which were maidens. He took 4/18 as Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71. His wickets included batsmen Alec Coxon and Willie Watson, who went on to become England Test cricketers. The match remained finely balanced after Australia made 101, with Johnston unbeaten on five. He was again miserly in the second innings, bowling 15.2 overs with seven maidens and taking 6/18. His victims included leading English batsman Len Hutton, and Coxon and Watson for the second time as the hosts were bowled out for 89. Johnston had ended the match with 10/40. After collapsing to 6/31--effectively seven wickets down as Sam Loxton was injured and unable to bat--Australia scraped home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia would come to defeat for the whole tour.Fingleton, pp. 54-57. The tourists travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and they amassed 632 after batting first. Johnston bowled without success in the first innings. In the second innings he claimed both openers to reduce the hosts to 2/11 after Bradman had forced them to follow on. He returned later in the innings to remove Alec Bedser and Jim Laker, ending with 4/40 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Johnston was rested for the following match against Cambridge University, which Australia won by an innings. Johnston returned as Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. After setting a world record for the most number of first-class runs in one day’s play (721), of which Johnston contributed nine, Bradman’s men bowled Essex out for 83 and 187 after enforcing the follow on. Johnston managed a match total of only 1/36. This was followed by another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. After scoring 13 in Australia's 431, Johnston bowled the most overs by an Australian in the match, taking 2/40 and 2/44 across a total of 42 overs. Johnston was the left out for the next fixture, which was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team, with Johnston omitted. It was a chance for the Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich--three of England's first four batsmen--all playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of their strength. Four county matches remained before the Tests, giving the players more chances to press their claims for selection. Johnston was recalled for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. After the first day was washed out, Johnston made 24 in a 25-run ninth-wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Ron Saggers, which took Australia from 8/170 to 9/195. The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes.Fingleton, p. 76. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five of the last six wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists. Johnston ended with 5/49 from 29 overs, the most by any of the Australians, and was not required to bat in the second innings. Johnston was rested for the subsequent match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, which was drawn. He returned against Hampshire and played a major role in Australia's eight-wicket win. The home team were put into bat on a drying pitch by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett--Bradman had rested himself for the match. Johnston bowled for almost the whole innings, sending down 38.4 of 85.4 overs. He took wickets at regular intervals to end with 6/74 as Hampshire were bowled out for 195. Johnston was unbeaten on two as Australia lost 8/47 and collapsed to 117 all out, trailing by 78 runs. It was the first time that the tourists had conceded a first innings lead for the season. In the second innings, Johnston bowled unchanged at his end for the entire innings, providing steady breakthroughs to end with 5/43 as Hampshire were bowled out for 103. This left Australia a target of 182, and they batted fluently in their second innings to win by eight wickets. Johnston ended with match figures of 11/117. He was rested in the innings win over Sussex, in the last fixture before the First Test.  First Test  Johnston was not in Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper changed his mind on the morning of the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces.Fingleton, p. 54. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew. England had reached 2/46 when Johnston was brought into the attack for his first over. He bowled Bill Edrich, knocking out the off stump while the batsman was on the front foot. Two balls later, Johnston removed Joe Hardstaff junior without scoring, caught by Miller in slips after attempting a cut shot; the catch was described by Wisden as \\"dazzling\\". Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine before catching the ball to leave England at 4/46.Fingleton, p. 86. Journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly said: \\"Johnston had trimmed and embroidered the efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung the fortunes of the game completely in Australia's favour\\".O'Reilly, p. 34. Johnston then knocked over Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned onto the front foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight;O’Reilly, p. 35. this brought Godfrey Evans--who was given two lives--to the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard in the air to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second catching opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in,Fingleton, p. 87. as England reached 8/74. However, a rearguard action took England to a total of 165, before Johnston removed Alec Bedser to end the innings. Johnston finished with 5/36, in a display characterised by his accuracy and variations in pace and swing. When Australia batted, Johnston and Ernie Toshack wagged a last- wicket partnership of 33 runs in only 18 minutes. They played in a free- wheeling manner before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the home team’s innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead and Johnston unbeaten on 17.Arlott, pp. 40-41. Johnston took the new ball with Miller and delivered 59 overs in the second innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success in the first half of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.Arlott, p. 41. On the fourth day, England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions.Arlott, p. 45. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run.Arlott, pp. 44, 47. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 1-0 lead--the Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand. After the First Test, Johnston was the leading wicket-taker as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 3/25 in the first innings, before dismissing the home side's top four batsmen in the second innings to reduce them to 4/108; they were eventually bowled out for 169. Johnston ended with 4/49. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Johnston scored an unbeaten 15, before bowling almost unchanged in the home side's first innings. Johnston bowled 41.1 out of 90.1 overs and ended with 3/101, including the wickets of Test players Alec Coxon and Watson. The match ended in a draw. Johnston bowled three overs for 15 in the second innings; Bradman chose not to push for a win and declared late in the second innings so that his bowlers would not have to exert themselves to any significant extent before the next Test.  Second Test  In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia batted first and Johnston scored his Test career best of 29 in another tail-wagging performance in the first innings. After coming to the crease with the score at 8/275 on the second morning, Johnston added 45 runs with wicket-keeper Don Tallon before the latter fell to Bedser. He was joined by last man Toshack and they put on 30 before Johnston was stumped--having overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for six--from the bowling of Doug Wright to end Australia's innings at 350.O'Reilly, p. 68. Both Johnston and Toshack threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions compared to where they had aimed their shots. Both men--not known for their batting ability--played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck.Arlott, p. 61. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers.Fingleton, p. 110. With Keith Miller injured and playing purely as a batsman,Perry, p. 239. Johnston took the new ball, sharing it with Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball.O'Reilly, p. 69. Following the tea break,O'Reilly, p. 71. he returned with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145.Fingleton, p. 112. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket. Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Fielding in the slips, Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved the ball into the right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of Hutton's bat.O'Reilly, p. 77. Hutton had trouble with both Australian pacemen, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light.Fingleton, p. 121. In a fidgety display, he played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over, before Lindwall dismissed him. Yardley’s men resumed at 3/106 on the final day. On the second ball of the final morning, bowled by Johnston, Compton aimed a square drive, but the delivery was Johnston's variation ball, which went away instead of into the batsman.O'Reilly, p. 74. The ball flew off the outside edge to a diving Miller, who knocked the ball up before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball came down.Fingleton, p. 122. Compton stood his ground and waited for the umpire to confirm whether Miller had caught the ball cleanly, and was duly given out by the unhesitating official.O'Reilly, p. 79. O'Reilly described Miller's effort as \\"perhaps the very best slips catch of the whole series and … a real match-winner.\\" Johnston then removed Bedser for nine to end with 2/62 as Australia won by 409 runs and took a 2-0 series lead. After 16 days of cricket in 20 days, from the First to the Second Test, Johnston was rested from the next two matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire, which Australia won by ten wickets and an innings respectively.  Third Test  Johnston returned for the Third Test at Old Trafford, where the home team elected to bat first. In an effective containing performance, Johnston took 3/67 from 45.5 overs in the first innings. England had looked assured in the first hour,Arlott, p. 80. before Johnston--again taking the new ball with LindwallO'Reilly, p. 87.--bowled Cyril Washbrook with a yorker to leave England at 1/22. Johnston had been bowling from over the wicket, and his left-arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into the right-handed Washbrook. However, the opening batsman did not detect Johnston’s variation ball, which was released from wide of the crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in. Washbrook played inside the line of the ball, which hit his stumps. Australia nearly had two wickets in the same over as the new batsman Edrich struggled. He played loosely outside the off stump to the first ball from Johnston but did not get an edge, and on the third delivery, Edrich survived again. Receiving a ball on middle and leg stump, he tried to defend it straight back down the pitch, rather than the conventional stroke to the leg side, and managed to edge the ball past the slips for four.O'Reilly, p. 88. Johnston repeatedly hurried Edrich with his pace, forcing the batsman to make many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot during the formative stage of his innings.Fingleton, p. 131. Johnston returned with the second new ball after lunch to remove Tom Dollery with another yorker, leaving England at 4/97. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook’s in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston’s variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none.O'Reilly, p. 92. Late in the day, Johnston took the catch as Lindwall removed Evans, who had taken a wild slash to leave England at 7/216. In the final minutes of play, Johnston extracted an edge from Compton on 64, but Tallon dropped the catch.Fingleton, pp. 133-134. On the second morning, Tallon dropped Compton--then on 73--for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston,Fingleton, p. 134. who eventually ended the England innings on 363 by removing Young. Compton had added a further 81 after being dropped from Johnston's bowling to end unbeaten on 145. Johnston had bowled the most overs of the Australians and been the most economical. In reply, Australia were in trouble at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were effectively eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily.Arlott, p. 91. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions. Johnston played in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test, which was against Middlesex. He dismissed Jack Robertson, Edrich and John Dewes to leave the hosts at 4/92 and ended with 3/43 as they were bowled out for 203. In the second innings, he took two early wicket--including Compton--to reduce the hosts to 3/27 before ending with 2/28 as Australia bowled Middlesex out for 135. Bradman’s men went on to win by ten wickets.  Fourth Test  In the Fourth Test at Headingley, England batted first on a pitch regarded as being ideal for strokeplay, and Australia's bowlers had little success on the first day. Early in the day, Johnston appeared to be having back problems. He had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues.O’Reilly, p. 112. His apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine that he should have been given more rest in the county matches. After an opening partnership of 143, England consolidated to reach 1/268 in the last over of the day before Johnston removed Washbrook for 143. Johnston did not taste further success in the first innings and ended with 1/86 from 38 overs as the home team ended on 496, their highest score of the series. In reply, Australia were still more than 100 runs behind when Johnston joined Lindwall with the score at 8/355, late on the third day. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling,Pollard, p. 14. dominating the stand of 48 with Johnston, who made only 13. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Ernie Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls.O’Reilly, p. 131. Johnston able to survive against the English pacemen with relative ease when he was batting, leading O’Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians.O’Reilly, p. 129. Lindwall was the last man out on the fourth morning with the total on 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings.Fingleton, p. 167. Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury in the first innings,Cashman et al., pp. 299-300. increasing the burden on the remaining bowlers as England sought to extend their lead on the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. After reaching 50, Washbrook hooked a short ball from Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch.Fingleton, p. 170. However, Washbrook soon repeated the shot from the bowling of Johnston with fatal results. The ball again went in the air, and Neil Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch it at feet height while on the run, removing the opener for 65. Fingleton said that Harvey’s effort \\"was the catch of the season--or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [in the match against Surrey]\\". O’Reilly doubted \\"whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it\\".O’Reilly, pp. 133-134. He further said the \\"hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic\\".O'Reilly, p. 134. England moved to 4/277 when a mini-collapse occurred. Yardley made seven before he was removed by Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a big shot.Fingleton, p. 172. Johnston then removed Ken Cranston, caught behind for a duck to leave England at 6/278. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller at cover, the hosts were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. England recovered to reach 8/362 at the close of the fourth day. The next day, Yardley declared at 8/365, leaving Johnston with the pick of the bowling figures, 4/95 from 29 overs. This left the tourists a target of 404 from 345 minutes. Australia went on to break the world record Test run-chase record by scoring 3/404 to take a 3-0 lead with 15 minutes to spare. Johnston went on to play in the match against Derbyshire immediately after the Headingley Test, taking 3/41 and 1/35 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings. He was rested for the next game against Glamorgan, which ended in a rain-affected draw without reaching the second innings. Johnston returned and took 2/41 in the first innings against Warwickshire, before taking 4/32 in the second innings, including three of the last five wickets, as the hosts fell from 5/118 to 155 all out. The left armer bowled almost unchanged during the second innings, sending down 39 of the 85.5 overs, including 16 maidens. His wickets included New Zealand Test batsman Martin Donnelly and Indian and Pakistani dual international Abdul Hafeez Kardar, as Australia went on to win by nine wickets. Johnston was then rested from two consecutive matches, against Lancashire and Durham, both of which were rain-affected draws.  Fifth Test  Johnston rounded off his Ashes series with the Fifth Test at The Oval. English skipper Norman Yardley elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, a decision many regarded as surprising. Precipitation in the past week rendered play before midday impossible. Former Australian Test batsman and leading commentator Jack Fingleton speculated that the tourists would have bowled if they had won the toss.Fingleton, p. 183. The damp conditions meant required a large amount of sawdust to be laid down to help the players keep their grip. Along with the rain, the humid conditions assisted the Australian bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights. After Miller removed John Dewes with the score at 1/2, Bradman made an early bowling change and introduced Johnston. Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around . Lindsay Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, after diving sideways and getting both hands to the ball.Fingleton, p. 184. This left England at 2/10. After the lunch break, Johnston dismissed debutant Allan Watkins without scoring after the batsman played across the line to be trapped lbw, leaving England at 6/42.Fingleton, p. 186. Johnston ended with 2/20 from 16 overs as England were skittled for 52. After being unbeaten without scoring in Australia's innings of 389, Johnston was again among the wickets when England's second innings late on the second day. England started their second innings with a deficit of 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the premature end of the second day due to bad light. The following morning, they made slow and steady progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side.O'Reilly, p. 154. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly.Arlott, p. 134. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.O'Reilly, p. 155. They reached 2/125 after lunch, when Compton--who was on 39--aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew off the edge into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a \\"freak slip catch\\".Fingleton, p. 189. This triggered a collapse late in the afternoon, which saw the hosts lose 4/25 to end the third day at 7/178. England resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in hand, still needing 159 runs to make Bradman’s men bat again. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets, Alec Bedser, Yardley and Eric Hollies to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added in the brief morning session; Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley became the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs and he was the most economical of the bowlers. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match in less than three days of playing time.Fingleton, p. 182. Overall, Johnston finished with 27 Test wickets at an average of 23.33, equal to Lindwall but at a higher average.  Later tour matches  Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and made 361. Johnston then took three wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before ending with 3/10 from six overs. Forced to follow on after being bowled out for 51 in 23 overs, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets. Johnston ended with 1/28 as the home team capitulated for 124 and lost by an innings. The victory over Kent was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Johnston was rested as Australia completed another innings victory. He returned for the match against Somerset, which resulted in a third consecutive innings win. After Australia had declared at 5/560, Johnston took the opening wicket of Harold Gimblett before returning to take the last two scalps of the first innings from consecutive balls, bowling his finger spin. He ended with 3/34 as Somerset fell for 115 and were forced to follow on. Johnston bowled the second over of the second innings. As Johnston had taken wickets with his last two balls in the first innings, his first delivery was the hat-trick ball. Gimblett negotiated the first ball safely, before being trapped lbw for a duck on the next. Johnston had thus taken three wickets in four balls. He bowled unchanged throughout the innings to end with 5/34 from 17.4 overs as Somerset were bowled out for 71. Johnston took the final wicket to fall--Horace Hazell--trapped for a duck, which brought up his 100th first-class wicket for the tour. In the match against the South of England, Johnston took 1/63--Edrich being his only wicket--after Australia declared at 7/522. Bradman’s men dismissed the hosts for 298 and rain ended the match before the second innings could start. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson- Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full- strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their players, Bradman named a full-strength team.Perry, pp. 253-254. In a rain-interrupted match, Johnston bowled Edrich for 15. He ended with 1/20 as the hosts folded for 177. Johnston made an unbeaten 26 in a partnership of 30 with Lindsay Hassett as Australia replied with 8/489 declared. Time ran out with the Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75 in the second innings. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took the last four wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 to be all out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia completed victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings to end with a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.  Role  A chart showing Johnston's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. Johnston played as a left-arm fast bowler when the ball was new and conducive to pace bowling, before reverting to finger spin when it became old and lost its shine. He was Australia's third fast bowler in the Tests, reinforcing the new ball pairing of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, who were regarded as one of the finest pace duos of all time. Bradman typically used Miller and Lindwall in short and sharp new ball bursts against the local batsmen. England had agreed that a new ball would be available every 55 overs, a milestone that usually came more frequently than the old regulation of 200 runs for every ball. This allowed Australia--who had the superior pace attack--more frequent use of a shiny ball, which swung at high pace.Perry, pp. 222-223. Johnston typically bowled pace after the first-choice pair had finished their new ball spell, before reverting to spin when the ball was worn. He took 27 wickets at 23.33 in the Tests, making him the equal- leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall, who averaged 19.62. The Australian pacemen’s tally was substantially more than the next best, recorded by England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22. In both the Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the heaviest workload, bowling nearly 200 overs more than any other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate and strike rate. He was more economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently. Johnston's performances prompted Bradman to call him \\"Australia's greatest left-hand bowler\\". As a result of his ability to bowl spin and pace, teammate Neil Harvey thought the team effectively had 13 players, saying \\"we reckoned Bradman was worth two [batsmen] and Bill Johnston was worth two [bowlers]\\". Harvey rated Johnston the best team man in the squad, and Bill Brown praised Johnston's work ethic in bowling for long periods after Lindwall and Miller had been given the best opportunities with the new ball. Spin bowling teammate Ian Johnson described him as \\"the finest team man and tourist\\" in cricket and valued his personality, while Miller described him as \\"the most popular man in cricket\\". Johnston sometimes amused his colleagues by demonstrating his double jointedness, wrapping his feet around the back of his neck. He was reputed to have nearly drowned when he attempted this in the communal bath at Lord's. After carrying a heavy workload in the early stages of the tour, Johnston was used more sparingly in the latter stages. As the tour progressed, Johnston improved his control and restrained England's batsmen between the new ball bursts of Lindwall and Miller. Johnston was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Wisden said \\"no Australian made a greater personal contribution to the playing success of the 1948 side\\".Cashman et al., pp. 152-154. Fingleton wrote that Australia had never sent a greater left-hander to England. During the tour, Johnston had few opportunities with the bat, invariably batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their first-class career,Cashman et al., pp. 152, 300. and they were the only two Australians who failed to pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career,Cashman et al., pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. Toshack and Johnston were rooted at the bottom of the batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 first-class fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest first-class score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s.

It was established in 1949 by Obafemi Awolowo and is the oldest surviving private Nigerian newspaper. In the colonial era, the newspaper served as the mouthpiece for Awolowo's populist welfare programmes. It also played an important role in defending the interests of the Yoruba people in a period when different ethnic groups were struggling for ascendancy. From independence in 1960 until the 1990s most publications were government-owned, but private papers such as the Nigerian Tribune, The Punch, Vanguard and the Guardian continued to expose public and private scandals despite government attempts at suppression. General Ibrahim Babangida once said that of all the Nigerian newspapers he would only read and take seriously the Nigerian Tribune's editorial column. The book Leadership Failure and Nigeria's Fading Hopes by Femi Okurounmu consists of excerpts from a weekly column in the Nigerian Tribune published between 2004 and 2009. The author, a patriotic Nigerian elder statesman, laments how the corruption and the selfishness of successive leaders has destroyed the hopes not just of Nigerians, but of the entire black race. In December 2008 Segun Olatunji, managing director and Editor-in-Chief of Nigerian Tribune, resigned, and a few days later the editor, Rauf Abiodun, also resigned as part of a series of staff changes. Mrs. HID Awolowo, who is chairman of the Nigerian Tribune's publisher African Newspapers of Nigeria Ltd, appointed Sam Adesua as the new managing director/editor-in-chief. Edward Dickson was appointed editor of the daily paper. The changes were said to be part of a move to modernize the paper and expand beyond narrow Yoruba partisan politics in the face of competition from The Westerner, The Nation and Nigerian Compass. In January 2011 the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) reacted angrily to an editorial in the Nigerian Tribune that accused the ACN of imposing its candidates in the party primaries for the forthcoming national elections. An ACN spokesman called the paper a front for the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Indeed since Nigeria's new democratic journey, the newspaper has engaged in running battle with some political group which styled itself as \\" progressives \\" but which curiously has consistently used the name of the newspaper's founder, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, one of Nigeria's foremost nationalists, to campaign for votes. The progressives who formed the nucleus of Alliance for Democracy (AD),and later Action Congress and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and lately All Progressives Congress (APC ) believed that, by right, the newspaper must support their actions and inaction and must not subject them to criticism in whatever form. Even when critical and objective views of Nigerians against these self-styled progressives were published by the newspaper, the reactions are usually laced with malice and not with the expected robustness of an objective mind. Such objective analyses and views are labelled anti-Yoruba sentiments by APC and its members. Their inability to control the newspaper and its management has led to naming calling and vicious attacks. In spite of these, however, Nigerian Tribune has continued to wax stronger in terms of patronage and national outreach and has remained the voice of the voiceless. It has refused to be cowed by these political elements who have continued to profit from the name of its founder but who are not following his political ideals and ideology. In September 2012, the newspaper's Board of Directors appointed Edward Dickson as Managing Director, Editor-in-Chief; Debo Abdulai as Editor Nigerian Tribune; Sina Oladeinde, Editor Sunday Tribune and Lasisi Olagunju as Saturday Tribune Editor.

McCormick, is a former correspondent for Newsweek and the current editorial page editor for the Chicago Tribune. Before joining the Tribune, he was Newsweek's Midwest correspondent for 18 years. He was the recipient of the American Society of Newspaper Editors' 2002 Distinguished Writing Award for Editorial Writing, for his editorials on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Afghanistan War, the \\"Renaissance of Black Chicago\\", and efforts to sell naming rights for the Soldier Field. In December 2008, he also drew considerable attention for his role in the Rod Blagojevich scandal.  Early life and education  A native of Manchester, Iowa, McCormick earned a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Northwestern University, majoring in political science and journalism.  Professional career  During college, McCormick worked as a night copy boy for the Chicago Daily News. He has joked that his \\"most noble responsibility at the Daily News was to fetch cheeseburgers for columnist Mike Royko.\\" He began his career as a reporter and columnist at the Dubuque, Iowa Telegraph Herald. = Work at Newsweek = Around 1982, McCormick joined Newsweek as its Midwest correspondent, where he would work for the next 18 years. For his final 13 years at Newsweek, McCormick served as the newsweekly's Chicago bureau chief. While at Newsweek, McCormick covered a variety of Midwest and national stories, including Chicago's Gangster Disciples street gang, the Tribune Company's purchase of Times Mirror Corporation, a hazing incident at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and public housing in Chicago. = Career at the Chicago Tribune = In 2000, McCormick joined the Chicago Tribune. McCormick is not to be confused with another Chicago Tribune editorial employee, reporter John D. McCormick, who covered the campaign of Barack Obama. = Awards for Editorial Writing = McCormick received the American Society of Newspaper Editors 2002 Distinguished Writing Award for Editorial Writing, for his editorials on the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Afghanistan War, the \\"Renaissance of Black Chicago\\", and plans for a new football stadium in Chicago. And in 2003, he received the Scripps Howard Foundation's Walker Stone Award for a series entitled \\"Homicide: The Chicago Crime' Also in 2003, McCormick was also featured by Poynter Online in its series on \\"Best Newspaper Writing\\".  Rod Blagojevich scandal  In tape-recorded conversations in November and December 2008, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, allegedly discussed threats to withhold $100 million or more in state money for renovations to the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field baseball stadium, which is owned by Chicago Tribune parent Tribune Company, unless McCormick was fired by the Chicago Tribune. In a first-person essay titled \\"Life on Blago's enemies list\\", McCormick expressed his bafflement at being singled out by Blagojevich. He wrote, \\"If somebody did try for more than a month to extort or otherwise muscle the Chicago Tribune—a newspaper I sold as a child—it did not work. I did not know about it. My boss did not know about it. His boss did not know about it. I hope you fathom how gratifying that is.\\" McCormick also noted that he \\"never had a personal tiff\\" with Blagojevich, who had always been cordial when he visited the Tribune for editorial board meetings. McCormick further said that he did write many editorials strongly critical of Blagovich, who he described as \\"the governor who cannot govern.\\"  Personal  McCormick and his wife, Dawn, have two sons, Michael and Conor, and live in La Grange Park, Illinois.

In the process of drilling and completing a well, cement is injected through the wellbore and rises up the annulus between the steel casing and the formation. A sonic tool is typically run on wireline by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on resonance. Casing that is not bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation. In this sense, the amplitude of the waveform received is the basic measurement that is evaluated. The data is collected by the tool and recorded on a log which is used by the oil producing company as an indicator of zonal isolation in the well.

Agni V is part of the Agni series of missiles, under the original Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). In May 2012, reports confirmed the development of another ICBM in the Agni series, a three-stage Agni VI missile. It was purposed that the missile will be developed in 2014 or so and will have an even longer range, up to 5,000 km. The Agni VI will be sleeker than the Agni-V and capable of carrying at least 10 nuclear warheads, capable of targeting multiple targets at the same time.[1][2] In January 2013, DRDO chief V K Saraswat said that after the development of Agni V, DRDO will develop Agni VI, which will have Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) capability.[3] He said that the missile design has been completed and DRDO is in the hardware realisation phase.[11][18][19] In September 2013, DRDO chief said that India can achieve a missile with a range of 10,000 km within \\"two and a half years\\", adding that increasing the range of a missile is the least challenging task.[20] Development Agni V is primarily for enhancing India's nuclear deterrence against China. Until recently, the longest range missile India had was Agni-III with a range of 3000–3500 km. This range was not sufficient to reach targets on the extreme eastern and northeastern region of China. Most of the important economic centers of China lay on its eastern seaboard. Senior defence scientist M. Natrajan disclosed in 2007 that DRDO was working on an upgraded version of the Agni III, known as the Agni-V, and that it would be ready in 4 years. The missile was to have a range of more than . It was estimated that the missile will be operational by 2014 to 2015 after four to five repeatable tests. Indian authorities believed that the solid- fuelled Agni-V is more than adequate to meet current threat perceptions and security concerns. Even with a range of only 5,000 km, the Agni-V could hit any target in China, including Beijing. The missile will allow India to strike targets across Asia and into Europe. The missile's range will allow the Indian military to target all of China from Agni-5 bases in central and southern India, further away from China. The missile is also likely to be similar to other missiles of the range of 10,000 km. The missile was designed to be easy to transport by road through the utilisation of a canister-launch missile system which is distinct from those of the earlier Agni missiles. Agni-V would also carry MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles) payloads being concurrently developed. A single MIRV equipped missile can deliver multiple warheads at different targets. With a launch mass of around and a development cost of over , Agni-V incorporated advanced technologies involving ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer for navigation and guidance. It took its first stage from Agni-III, with a modified second stage and a miniaturised third stage enabling it to fly distance of . With a canister-launch system to impart higher road mobility, the missile will give the armed forces much greater operational flexibility than the earlier-generation of Agni missiles. According to a source, the accuracy levels of Agni-V and the Agni-IV (first tested in November 2011), with their better guidance and navigation systems, are far higher than Agni-I (), Agni-II () and Agni-III (). According to the Project Director of Agni V, Tessy Thomas, the missile achieved single-digit accuracy in its second test. = Deployment = According to media reports that cite official sources, the missile was being deployed by Strategic Forces Command as of July 2018. It was reported after the sixth test of Agni-V in June 2018 that the missile will be inducted after one more test. Testing Agni-V during its first test flight. =Preparation for testing= The Former Indian defence minister A. K. Antony, addressing the annual DRDO awards ceremony, asked defence scientists to demonstrate the missile's capability at the earliest opportunity. DRDO chief V. K. Saraswat told Times of India in mid-2011 that DRDO had tested the three solid-propellant composite rocket motor stages of Agni-V independently and all ground tests had been completed. In September 2011, Saraswat confirmed that the first test flight would be conducted in 2012 from Wheeler Island off the Orissa coast.Agni-5 demo in February 2012. Ibnlive.in.com. 22 October 2011. Retrieved 20 April 2012. In February 2012, a source revealed that DRDO was almost ready for the test, but there were scheduling and logistical issues since the missile was to traverse halfway across the Indian Ocean. Countries like Indonesia and Australia as well as international air and maritime traffic in the test zone had to be alerted 7– 10 days before the test. Moreover, Indian Navy warships, with DRDO scientists and tracking and monitoring systems, were to be positioned midway and near the impact point in the southern Indian Ocean. =First test launch= On 19 April 2012 at 08.05 am, the Agni V was successfully test-fired by DRDO from Wheeler Island off the coast of Orissa.Agni-V, India's first ICBM, successfully test-fired .

Hindustantimes.com (15 November 2011). Retrieved 20 April 2012. The flight time lasted 20 minutes and the third stage fired the re-entry vehicle into the atmosphere at an altitude of . The missile re-entry vehicle subsequently impacted the pre-designated target point more than away in the Indian Ocean. The director of the test range, S.P. Das, informed BBC that all test parameters were met. According to news reports the Agni-V was able to hit the target nearly at pin-point accuracy, within a few metres of the designated target point. =Second test launch= On 15 September 2013, India conducted a second test flight of Agni-V from the Wheeler Island off Odisha coast. The missile was test-fired from a mobile launcher from Launch Complex 4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at about 8:50 am. The flight duration was little over 20 minutes and hit the pre- designed target in the Indian Ocean with an accuracy of a few metres. =Third test launch= On 31 January 2015, India conducted a third successful test flight of the Agni-V from the Wheeler Island facility. The test used a canisterised version of the missile, mounted over a Tatra truck. The Integrated Test Range Director, M. V. K. V. Prasad, said: \\"The missile, witnessed a flawless 'auto launch' and detailed results will be known after all data is retrieved from different radars and network systems.\\" = Fourth test launch = On 26 December 2016, a fourth test of the missile was successfully conducted from complex 4 of Wheeler Island, Odisha at 11.05 IST. This was the second canisterised test of the missile and will now pave way for user trials of the missile by the Strategic Forces Command (SFC). = Fifth test launch = On 18 January 2018, a fifth test of the missile was successfully conducted from the Wheeler Island facility, Odisha at 09.53 IST. This was the third consecutive canisterised test of the missile on a road mobile launcher and the first in its final operational configuration. The missile covered a distance of 4,900 km in 19 minutes. = Sixth test launch = On 3 June 2018, a sixth test launch of Agni-V was successfully conducted from Abdul Kalam Island at 09.45 IST. It was the sixth missile test since 2012 and was a \\"precision launch\\". The Indian Ministry of Defence stated that the radars, electro-tracking stations, and telemetry stations tracked the vehicle throughout the course. = Seventh test launch = On 10 December 2018, a seventh test launch of Agni-V was successfully conducted from the Launching Complex-IV of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Abdul Kalam Island at about 1.30 pm. This was for the first time that the missile was test-fired in a lofted trajectory. The missile blasted off from a hermetically sealed canister and covered nearly 2,041 km. This lofted trajectory flight was used to determine whether it followed the perfect flight path with close to zero error. This trial completed the Agni-V pre-induction trials. Description Agni missile range. =Propulsion= The Agni-V is a three-stage solid fuelled missile with composite motor casing in the second and third stage. In many aspects, the Agni-5 carries forward the Agni-3 pedigree. With composites used extensively to reduce weight, and a third stage added on (the Agni-3 was a two-stage missile), the Agni-5 can fly significantly more to inter-continental range. Total flight duration for the first flight test of Agni-V on 20 April 2012 was for 1130 seconds. The first stage ignited for 90 seconds. =Range= The DRDO chief V.K. Saraswat initially declined to disclose the exact range of Agni-V. Later, however, he described Agni V as a missile with a range of 5,500–5,800 km. Du Wenlong, a researcher at China's PLA Academy of Military Sciences, told the Global Times that the missile has a range of around . Wenlong also said that the Indian government had deliberately downplayed the missile's capability in order to avoid causing concern to other countries. The exact range of the Agni-V missile is classified. Business Standard reported that the range of Agni-V can be increased if needed. =Mobility= Agni-V on a road-mobile vehicle during rehearsal of Republic Day parade in 2013 \\"The Agni-5 is specially tailored for road-mobility,\\" explained Avinash Chander, Director, ASL. \\"With the canister having been successfully developed, all India's future land-based strategic missiles will be canisterised as well.\\" The missile will utilise a canister and will be launched from it. Made of maraging steel, a canister must provide a hermetically sealed atmosphere that preserves the missile for years. During firing, the canister must absorb enormous stresses when a thrust of is generated to eject the missile. If the missile is ejected using a gas generator from the canister, then the missile could be launched from any pre-surveyed launch location without the need for any pre-built launch site. The launcher, which is known as the Transport-cum- Tilting vehicle-5, is a 140-ton, 30-metre, 7-axle trailer pulled by a 3-axle Volvo truck (DRDO Newsletter2014). The canister design \\"will reduce the reaction time drastically...just a few minutes from 'stop-to-launch, ’ =Anti-satellite version= V.K. Saraswat said that an ASAT version is technically possible: ASAT weapon would require reaching about 800 km altitude. Agni V offers the boosting capability and the 'kill vehicle', with advanced seekers, will be able to home into the target satellite. =MIRVs= In future, Agni-V is expected to feature Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRVs) with each missile being capable of carrying 2–10 separate nuclear warheads. Each warhead can be assigned to a different target, separated by hundreds of kilometres; alternatively, two or more warheads can be assigned to one target. MIRVs ensure a credible second strike capability even with few missiles. According to DRDO sources, a MIRV payload would be significantly heavier, since it would consist of several nuclear warheads, each of them weighting about 400 kilogrammes. A 5-warhead MIRV, therefore, would weigh two tonnes. Reactions to testingDomestic= In India, the success of the launch was received with much acclaim and widespread media coverage. Then Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, congratulated the DRDO.CNN IBN: Agni-V missile test-fired: PM congratulates DRDO. Ibnlive.in.com (10 May 2011). Retrieved 20 April 2012. Missile program director Avinash Chander hailed that the launch by saying that it signified \\"giant strides.\\" The then Defence Minister A.K.

We believe that both sides should cherish the hard-won good state of affairs at present, and work hard to uphold friendly strategic co-operation to promote joint development and make positive contributions towards maintaining peace and stability in the region.\\" The state-owned China Central Television (CCTV) reported that the test was \\"a historic moment for India, and it shows that India has joined the club of the countries that own ballistic missiles.\\" However, CCTV listed some of the missile's shortcomings and reported that \\"it does not pose a threat in reality.\\" More negative commentary can be found in Global Times, a state-run tabloid, which reported that India \\"still lags behind in infrastructure construction, but its society is highly supportive of developing nuclear power and the West chooses to overlook India's disregard of nuclear and missile control treaties\\" and warned India not to \\"over-estimate its strength\\". Subsequently, they also claimed that although India may have missiles that can reach all parts of China, India stands \\"no chance in an overall arms race\\" with the country. Chinese experts say that the missile actually has the potential to reach targets away and that the Indian government had \\"deliberately downplayed the missile's capability in order to avoid causing concern to other countries\\". * – Pakistani websites and news agencies prominently displayed news of the launch.

A US State Department spokesman said, \\"We urge all nuclear-capable states to exercise restraint regarding nuclear capabilities. That said, India has a solid non-proliferation record.\\" Moreover, responding to comparisons with North Korea's attempted launch of a long-range rocket that same week, Jay Carney said that, \\"India's record stands in stark contrast to that of North Korea, which has been subject to numerous sanctions, as you know, by the United Nations Security Council.\\" : A Washington-based think tank has claimed that the US is supportive of India's efforts to close missile gap with China and is comfortable with the progress being made by New Delhi in this regard. Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia, and Baker Spring, research fellow in National Security Policy, at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank said in a commentary, \\"The lack of US condemnation of India's latest missile test demonstrates that the US is comfortable with Indian progress in the nuclear and missile fields and appreciates India's need to meet the emerging strategic challenge posed by rising China\\". \\"It is telling that no country has criticised India's missile test\\", the US experts wrote. \\"The US change in position with regard to Indian missile capabilities demonstrates how far the US-India relationship has evolved over the last decade\\", Curtis and Spring said. =International organisations= * – NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that they did not think India was a missile threat, nor a threat to NATO and its allies, despite India's advancement in missile technology.

The name may also refer to Clan Russell, a Scottish armigerous clan. Historian William Anderson has written that Scottish Russells from Aberdeenshire can trace their ancestry through local parish records, back to a baron Rosel who purchased estates at Aden in Aberdeenshire in 1333. The first appearance of the Russell form of the name on any official record was William Russell, son of a Ralph de Rosel whose name appears in the Winton Domesday Book of (1107-1128). The Lenton Register named William Russell as Ralph de Rosel's son. (J.H. Wiffen, The Time of the Norman Conquest). The ancestor of the family may originate from le Rozel (Normandy, Cotentin, le Rosel in 1135, de Rosel in 1187François de Beaurepaire, Les Noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de la Manche, editions Picard 1985, p. 185). The last recorded use of the de Rosel form of the name in England in any official document was in a charter by Alain Russell, who held the fief of the church of Donnington in Lincolnshire from his father Robert Russell. In 1258 Alain Russell made a charter bestowing the church of St. Stephen at le Plessis-Grimoult in Normandy to the local parish, in which he named himself Alain de Rosel, showing that he continued to use the older de Rosel form of the name when in France. (J.H. Wiffen, The Time of the Norman Conquest) The Subsidy Roll carried out in 1327 lists 22 land owners named Russell with estates large enough to be taxed, but no one named de Rosel, showing that by 1327 the older de Rosel form of the name was no longer widely used in England.

McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court which ruled that, in the case of a person stopped for a misdemeanor traffic offense, once they are in custody, the protections of the Fifth Amendment apply to them pursuant to the decision in Miranda v. Arizona 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Previously, some courts had been applying Miranda only to serious offenses. Background An officer observed the defendant's car weaving in and out of its traffic lane.. The officer stopped defendant and asked him to get out of his car. The officer noticed that the defendant was having difficulty standing. The defendant's speech was slurred and difficult to understand. Defendant could not perform a “balancing test” without falling. The officer then asked the defendant if he had consumed any intoxicants. Defendant said that he drank two beers and smoked several joints of marijuana shortly before being stopped. The officer then arrested the defendant and took him to the county jail where the defendant took an intoxilyzer test. The test results were negative for the presence of alcohol. The officer then resumed questioning the defendant.Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 424. The defendant responded affirmatively when asked if he had been drinking. When asked if he was under the influence of alcohol said \\"I guess, barely.\\" At no time was the defendant advised of his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress his pre and post arrest statements. After exhausting his state appeals, the defendant filed a motion for writ of habeas corpus.Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 425. The federal district court denied the motion. The court of appeals reversed holding that “Miranda warnings must be given to all individuals prior to custodial interrogation, whether the offense investigated is a felony or a misdemeanor traffic offense, and that respondent's post- arrest statements, at least, were inadmissible.” The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider two issues - whether the Miranda rule applies to defendants charged with a misdemeanor and whether an investigative detention is equivalent to Miranda custodial interrogation. Opinion of Court # Miranda applies to custodial interrogations involving minor traffic offenses. # Routine questioning of motorists detained pursuant to traffic stops is not custodial interrogation under Miranda. The Miranda rule prohibits the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings that is the product of custodial police interrogation unless the police properly advised the defendant of his Fifth Amendment rights and the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived those rights and agreed to talk to the police. The circumstances triggering the Miranda safeguards are \\"custody\\" and \\"interrogation.\\" Custody means formal arrest or the deprivation of freedom to an extent associated with formal arrest. Interrogation means explicit questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Unquestionably the defendant in Berkemer was interrogated. In fact, he was interrogated twice - prearrest roadside questioning and post arrest questioning at the jail. In neither case had the officer advised the defendant of his Miranda rights. As for post arrest interrogation, the defendant was in custody since he had been arrested. The issue for the court was whether to create an exception to Miranda for custodial interrogations that related to minor offenses.Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 429. The Supreme Court declined to carve out such an exception because to do so would sacrifice the certainty and clarity of the Miranda rule.Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 430–432. The pre arrest interrogation raised the issue of whether detention was equivalent to custody for purposes of the Miranda rule.Detention is a fourth amendment concept. A detention is a temporary seizure of a person for purposes of investigation. A person who is detained is not free to leave. However, a temporary constraint on one's freedom of movement falls short of fifth amendment custody. The fourth amendment analog to custody is arrest. Note that a person who has been detained has the right to remain silent and decline to answer questions. Berkemer holds that the police are not required to follow the Miranda procedures before questioning the suspect. (The Supreme Court has upheld a law that required a person to give his name when requested by a law enforcement officer) In its opinion, the Court stated: The Court found that there were two significant differences between interrogation of person taken into custody and detainees. First was the length of the detention. Investigative detentions were brief and usually culminated in the issuance of a citation and release of the defendant. Second, the circumstances attendant to roadside detention were substantially less coercive and compulsive than those typically surrounding custodial interrogation.\\"In short, the atmosphere surrounding an ordinary traffic stop is substantially less \\"police dominated\\" than that surrounding the kinds of interrogation at issue in Miranda itself ...\\" Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 438-39. Specifically the Court noted that during most traffic stops the actions of the officer were \\"exposed\\" to public view and that stops typically involved only one or two officers.Given the brevity and openess of roadside detention the opportunity and effectiveness of psycholigical ploys and strategems is reduced. :*A police officer can stop a vehicle if he has a reasonable articulable reason to suspect that “criminal activity is occurring.”The officer may also stop if he has probable cause to believe that a crime is was or will be committed. :*The officer may detain for sufficient time to conduct a reasonable investigation that either confirms or dispels his suspicions. :*The officer is not required to arrest the suspect once the officer has PC. The officer may delay the arrest for purposes of conducting a non-custodial interrogation. :*The officer may interrogate the suspect without advising him of his Miranda rights. :*The officer may ignore suspect's attempts to exercise her Miranda rights because the rights have not attached. ::For example, if a person who is being detained on suspicions of impaired driving asks to contact a lawyer the officer may ignore the statement and continue to question the suspect.

Early years Jessen was born on 19 June 1907 in Copenhagen to Hans Jessen and Christine Jessen (née Larsen). He attended Skt. Jørgens Gymnasium, where he was taught by the Hungarian mathematician Julius Pal during his first year. In 1925, Jessen graduated from the gymnasium and enrolled at the University of Copenhagen. During his time at the university he got to know Harald Bohr, then a leading figure in Danish mathematics. In 1928, Bohr established a collaboration with Jessen, which would last until Bohr's death in 1951. After receiving his master's degree in the spring of 1929, Jessen embarked on a stay abroad. Supported by the Carlsberg Foundation, he spent the fall of 1929 at the University of Szeged, where he met Frigyes Riesz, Alfréd Haar, and Lipót Fejér. He then spent the winter semester of 1929–30 at the University of Göttingen, where he attended lectures by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau while working on his PhD thesis. On 1 May 1930 Jessen defended his thesis in Copenhagen. He later elaborated the thesis into an article that was published in Acta Mathematica in 1934. The same year, he was appointed as a docent at The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Denmark.Olsen, L. W. (2003). Essays on Georg Rasch and his contributions to statistics. Københavns Universitet, Økonomisk Institut. p. 23 In 1931, Jessen married Ellen Pedersen (1903–1979), cand. mag. in mathematics and the daughter of Peder Oluf Pedersen. Jessen continued to travel frequently in the early 1930s, visiting Paris, Cambridge, England, the Institute for Advanced Study, Yale and Harvard University in America. Career Jessen was a professor of descriptive geometry at the Technical University of Denmark from 1935 till 1942, when he moved back to the University of Copenhagen where he was professor from 1942-1977 when he retired. He was the president of the Carlsberg Foundation in 1955-1963 and one of the founders of the Hans Christian Ørsted Institute. He was the Secretary of the Interim Executive Committee of the International Mathematical Union (1950–1952), and in September 1951 he officially declared the founding of the Union, with its first domicile in Copenhagen. He was also active in the Danish Mathematical Society. After his death, the society named an award in his honor (Børge Jessen Diploma Award).

It runs from U.S. Route 2 (US 2) north of Alburgh and runs due north to the Canada–US border, where it becomes Quebec Route 225, from which it derives its number. The route is entirely within Alburgh in Grand Isle County. The entirety of VT 225 is maintained by the town of Alburgh. Route 225 most practically serves as part of a connection between Vermont and the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in Quebec, located about southeast of Montreal, Quebec. Route description The southern terminus of Vermont Route 225 diverging from US Route 2. Vermont Route 225 is essentially a northern spur of U.S. Route 2, which approaches running northward through the town of Alburgh. US 2 turns westward towards its final approach to New York, and VT 225 begins to the north. The route only intersects two through roads: a short former alignment of US 2 literally mere yards long, and Blair Road, a secondary road which parallels Route 225 northward to the border. Both of these intersections occur within a quarter mile of VT 225's southern terminus. Route 225, appropriately named Border Road, runs almost directly north to the Canada–US border at the Alburgh–Noyan Border Crossing, only passing a few isolated homes along the way. Upon crossing the border into Quebec, the road becomes Quebec Route 225. History The length of VT 225 was designated as part of VT 104, a highway extending from VT 15 in Cambridge north to the Canada–US border near Alburgh, by 1938. VT 104 was truncated on its northern end to St. Albans in the mid-to-late 1950s, at which time the former routing of VT 104 between Alburgh and the Canada–US border was redesignated VT 68. It was renumbered to VT 225 between 1976 and 1985 to match the designation of the highway it connected to (Quebec Route 225) in Quebec.

Biography Born in London to a British consular official, Walter spent most of his early life in India. In partnership with two of his brothers he later set up a business in Bombay. After serving in the legislative council of Bombay from 1863 to 1865, he returned to England. Supernatural Religion > Supernatural Religion... excited much interest by the outspoken criticism > pervading it.

The assaults > which were made upon minor details leave its main positions unharmed.\\"Samuel > Davidson, D.D., L.L.D., Introduction to the Study of the New Testament, > Preface to 2nd edition (1882). Cassels is renowned as the author of the anonymous work that appeared in 1874 under the title Supernatural Religion: An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine Revelation. The work at once attracted attention, and it resulted in much speculation about the real author. But no one ever admitted openly of its writing. In a reply to this book many articles and books were written. The most famous were essays written by Bishop J. B. Lightfoot, and printed later as a book. As a result a third volume was added to Supernatural Religion, and a revised edition was published in 1879. Replies to Bishop Lightfoot and other critics were made anonymously, appearing in magazine articles and as footnotes or prefaces to later editions of Supernatural Religion. These replies were also printed as a book. Speculation that Cassels is the author surfaced in 1895 after his publication of a series of theological articles. Cassels however never publicly acknowledged his authorship of Supernatural Religion. Not much is known about his private life or how he became an early Christianity expert. He wrote poetry and was an art collector. Never married, he died in London on 10 June 1907. Works * Eidolon, or the Course of a Soul; and other poems. William Pickering: London, 1850. * Poems.

It is the largest electricity distribution utility in India (2nd largest in Asia after SGCC). MSEDCL distributes electricity to the entire Maharashtra state. Then other electric supply come in Market like Reliance and MTNL and others except some part of Mumbai city where Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport, Tata Power and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited are electricity distributors. History The erstwhile Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) was looking after Generation, Transmission & Distribution of Electricity in the State of Maharashtra. But with enactment of Electricity Act 2003 of the Government of India, MSEB was unbundled into 4 Companies on 6 June 2005 viz. * MSEB Holding Company Limited. * Mahanirmiti (महानिर्मिती) or Mahagenco (Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (MSPGCL)) * Mahapareshan (महापारेषण) or Mahatransco (Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL)) * Mahavitaran (महावितरण) or Mahadiscom (Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL)) Of these, Mahavitaran is responsible for distribution of electricity throughout the state by buying power from either MahaGenco, Captive Power Plants or from other State Electricity Boards and Private sector power generation companies. The 'MSEB Holding Company' was created to hold all the stakes in these three companies.  Consumer base  MSEDCL supplies electricity to a staggering 27 million consumers across the categories all over Maharashtra. There are about 20.7 million Domestic Residential (72.4%), 4 million Agricultural (16%), 1.7 million commercial (7%) and0.346million industrial consumers (1.8 0%) in MSEDCL who fetch an Annual Revenue of about Rs.500 million. The consumption share of Residential Consumers is 19.03%, Commercial Consumers is 7.35%, Industrial Consumers is 42%, Agricultural Consumers is 25.13% and others is 6.49%. Sources of power MSEDCL's sources of power include thermal, hydro, gas and non conventional sources like solar, wind, bagasse etc. apart from hydro power of the Koyna Hydroelectric Project. Thermal power constitutes the major share which it gets from Mahagenco projects, Central Sector projects and RGPPL. Infrastructure In terms of infrastructure, MSEDCL operates a vast far flung network comprising * 33 kV, 22 kV & 11 kV transmission lines, * Sub- stations and Distribution Transformers spread over 3.08 lakh km2 geographical area of Maharashtra covering 41,095 villages and 457 towns. It has 2680 sub- stations & Switching Stations with 49,000 MVA of transformation capacity, 10,334 HV feeders, and several thousand circuit km of HT and LT lines. Human resource development MSEDCL has a workforce of about 69,000 employees. This force is the real asset of the company . The welfare and well being of this asset has been given top priority by the company. As such it has enhanced the scope of training facilities to a great extent. In addition to the existing 4 training centers, MSEDCL has recently established well equipped 25 training centers at Circle offices which impart necessary training to line staff. Every year about 20000 employees are put through refresher/professional/HR trainings. Safety is given special importance and safety training is imparted to line staff on regular basis. Engineers are also deputed to various other well reputed training centers outside Maharashtra for training under MDP module and also deputed for training under DRUM Project of USAID on regular basis. Social responsibility In last 2 years, about 2000 wards of deceased employees have been provided with jobs. Two ITIs at Vaijapur (Dist. Aurangabad) and Kalyan have been adopted to improve facilities their to help the local population. Empowering women employees Ever increasing number of female engineers in the workforce of MSEDCL necessitated the thought of their empowerment. A novel idea of formation of all women's squads popularly known as Damini Pathaks is being implemented. A Damini Pathak, headed by a local female engineer and assisted by 2-3 outsourced female employees, equipped with digital camera, a security guard in uniform and a vehicle has been established at each of the Circle offices under the leadership of respective Superintending Engineers. The task assigned to these squads is to undertake surprise checks of the photo meter readings in their area. The aim of the exercise is to address the consumer complaints regarding photo meter reading. The members of the squad visit the households between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. when generally housewives are present at homes. The squads are working satisfactorily and results are encouraging.  Mahila Bachat Gat  We do come across the instances of women's self-help groups like Mahila Bachat Gats helping poor and needy women earn their livelihood through production and marketing of home products. MSEDCL thought to exploit the vast woman power by offering them some good opportunities on bigger scale. It offered the Mahila Bachat Gats across the state to come forward and undertake the work of distribution of energy bills. This is indeed a great initiative towards empowering women. Accordingly, some of the Mahila Bachat Gats have already taken up the said works at various places in the State and an overall response is quite encouraging. It is hoped that the women engaged in this would experience significant rise in their daily earnings.  Important projects  To overcome the power crisis and improve consumer services MSEDCL made in- depth study involving sub- division wise research of distribution network and planned ambitious projects. They include : =Infra-plan= MSEDCL's existing network handles a load of about 10,000 to 11,000 MW. By 2012, there will be an addition of another 10,000 MW in the system. With a view to cater future load, provide quality, reliable energy supply and reduce losses MSEDCL formulated a Rs. 11000 crore infrastructure plan. The plan envisages erection and commissioning of 586 sub-stations, 52351 circuit kilometers of HT lines, 58,629 distribution transformers besides augmentation of existing network. MSEB had erected 1846 sub-stations during its lifetime, whereas MSEDCL aims to construct 586 sub stations in just 2 years. A leap forward in the direction of infrastructure development. The project is being implemented on total turn-key basis and through 119 DPRs. Orders of about Rs. 9189 crore have already been placed on various agencies. Earlier capital investment for infrastructure development was a paltry sum of Rs. 200 to 300 crore per year. The new infrastructure with augmentation and renovation of the distribution network will revolutionize the quality and reliability of supply. =Load management= MSEDCL has been implementing long term Load Management schemes to reduce load shedding. Feeder separation is one such long term scheme in which agriculture feeders are carved out. This not only helps load management but also strengthens the infrastructure and reduces technical losses. MSEDCL has also implemented Single Phasing Scheme in some parts of Maharashtra. Currently rural areas face 8.30 to 11 hours of load shedding a day which is decided by MERC. However, the load shedding hours have been almost halved in about 24,461 villages that have been covered so far under these schemes. The load shedding duration of these villages has come down to 2.00 to 5.45 hours which is on par with urban areas. The project cost of these schemes is Rs. 3233 crore. =Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidhutikarn Yojana (RGGVY)= This is a flagship scheme of Govt. of India. There are 4,709 villages and 13,44,087 identified BPL households targeted to be electrified under this scheme. MSEDCL had prepared proposals for 34 schemes costing Rs. 829 crore for 33 districts of Maharashtra. Maharashtra has been implementing the scheme and has spent Rs. 443 crore so for. Connections to 905541 BPL households have been released and 4243 villages electrified under the scheme. BPL families are provided with 1.5 point power connections at a nominal charge of Rs.15/- each and the villages are electrified as per new definition under this scheme. =Restructured – Accelerated Power Development & Reforms Programme (R-APDRP)= R-APDRP is a flagship scheme sponsored by Govt. of India and financed by Power Finance Corporation of India (PFC). There are 134 towns having population more than 30,000 as per 2001 census selected in Maharashtra under this scheme. The scheme is being implemented in two phases – Part-A and Part-B. Creation of IT infrastructure and allied works are included in Part-A for which a turn key contract for 95 towns has been awarded to M/s.Larsen & Toubro Ltd. while M/s Spanco Ltd has been awarded the Part 'A' contract for remaining 35 towns. On completion of Part-A, the works under Part-B which include renovation and modernization of distribution network, load bifurcation, load balancing, arial bunched conductoring, HVDS, capacitor bank etc. will be taken up. Distribution loss in R-APDRP towns is targeted to be reduced to 15%. Major achievements post restructuring Energisation of Agricultural Pumps : Maharashtra has a record number, highest as compared to any state, of agricultural pumps energized so far. The number is about 30 lakhs. Earlier, there used to be a long list of pending applications and the farmers used to wait for years together for supply. The issue was addressed in a proper perspective by MSEDCL. Nowadays about 1 lakh agricultural pumps are energized every year. MSEDCL, in a year or two, would be in a position to grant agricultural connections on demand on par with other categories of consumers. Loss reduction In 5 years, MSEDCL reduced distribution losses from 35% to 20% through various drives such as: =Anti theft drive= This is being implemented on regular basis. MSEDCL has established 43 flying squads functioning under Security and Enforcement department to detect and handle power theft cases quickly. =Meter shifting= For many consumers, meters were installed in hard-to-access places, making theft easy to conceal. MSEDCL, therefore, decided to shift all meters to the front of buildings to make them as conspicuous as possible. This project is currently in progress on a large scale. =Mass meter replacement project= MSEDCL has decided to replace all the meters which have been in service for last 10 years and more under mass meter replacement programme. It is planned to replace all the electro mechanical meters with static ones. A process has already been initiated for purchasing about 30 lakh meters for the purpose. This is a huge project which will definitely lead to increase in metered sale. =Energy accounting= MSEDCL has undertaken accurate energy accounting through various methods such as : =Feeder metering= MSEDCL plans to install high quality meters at all necessary system points, including interconnecting points. Feeder metering of all 10,240 feeders in complete and again, photo reading of these feeder meters are taken. =DTC metering= There are in all 2,84,633 Distribution Transformer Centers(DTCs) in operation, out of which about 1.51 Lakh DTCs have already been metered. =Distribution franchisee= Bhiwandi, a powerloom city, had typical problems like rampant theft and non-payment. MSEDCL opted for an input based franchisee model for electricity distribution. It has handed over Bhiwandi Circle to M/S Torrent Power on 26 January 2007. This experiment proved to be very successful and a trend setter in power distribution sector of the Country. Recently the company has appointed Distribution Franchisees for Aurangabad Urban I & II Divisions of Aurangabad Urban Circle and Gandhibag, Civil Lines and Mahal Divisions of Nagpur Urban Circle. Zero load shedding model Zero Load Shedding Model is being implemented at certain places with the active participation of local citizens through consumer groups and peoples representatives. The mechanism is extremely transparent and is prior approved by the Regulator. In this model, a costly power to the extent of shortfall is arranged for which a reliability charge is levied upon the local consumers. Beginning in Pune, the model was implemented in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Pen and Baramati. Of late MSEDCL itself filed a petition before the MERC for implementing Zero Load Shedding Model at all the Headquarters of Revenue Divisions - Nagpur, Amravati, Navi Mumbai, Pune and Aurangabad. The MERC approved the proposal and the model was implemented at these headquarters from December 2009. MSEDCL has planned to extend it further to district headquarters, taluka headquarters and so on. Improvement in consumer services Online bill payment facility has been made available for all LT consumers across the state by commissioning own Payment Gateway on MSEDCL website www.mahadiscom.in. Earlier the facility was available to People in Pune, Bhandup, Kalyan, Thane, Vashi, Kolhapur, Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur only. A Consumer Facilitation Center (CFC) consists of a single window system with a help desk for customers. The CFCs accept consumer complaints, application forms for new connections, meter change requests and name or address change forms etc. Six state of the art CFCs have been opened at Rastapeth Pune, GaneshKhind Pune, Nagpur, Amravati, Nanded and Baramati. More are being planned. Small CFCs at 32 Circle headquarters have been established and more being established. Fifteen call centers have been established at the Municipal Corporations of kalyan, Bhandup, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Sangli, Akola, Solapur, Nanded, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Amravati. Customers can receive their monthly bills via email by registering on MSEDCL's website. Internal Complaints Redressal Units at all 40 Circles established. Consumers approach this platform for redress of their complaints before going in appeal before Zonal Consumer Grievances Redressal Forums which are there at every Zonal Headquarters.

The metal surfaces reach a temperature at which they flow plastically under pressure, surface impurities are expelled and a forged weld is formed. A friction stud weld. This technique is rather more costly than arc stud welding and is therefore used for special applications where arc welding may present problems, such as: *welding underwater *welding on live subsea pipelines to attach anodes *welding in explosive environments and zoned areas *welding materials that are difficult to join by fusion welding processes *friction plug welding Portable equipment for friction stud welding is available for use on construction work sites, offshore, underwater and in workshops. These portable units are much lighter and smaller than the large static friction welding machines which are used, for example, in factories to weld engine components such as drive shafts. Principle of operation A portable friction stud welding tool consists of a motor to rotate the stud at high speed and a piston to apply the necessary force to the stud. The equipment may be air or hydraulically powered. A clamping system is also required to hold the tool onto the work piece and to provide reaction to the force on the stud. The clamps used are typically magnetic or vacuum clamps for flat surfaces, chain or claw clamps for pipes and various mechanical clamps for welding onto I beams or other shapes. The weld is made by rotating the stud at high speed and forcing it onto the substrate causing friction which heats the stud tip and substrate surface. Metal at the interface between the stud and the substrate flows plastically under pressure, removing impurities from the metal surfaces, and a solid phase weld is formed. The rotation of the stud is then stopped but the force on the stud is maintained for a few seconds. The maximum temperatures reached during welding are much lower than the melting point of the metals. Advantages and disadvantages Some notable advantages of the process are: *The relatively low temperature at which the weld is formed means that the process can be adapted for applications such as welding on live pipelines and in explosive environments. *The absence of an electric arc and a liquid phase in the metal avoids some of the potential problems encountered with arc welding such as contamination of the weld with hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. *The rapid weld cycle time (typically 5 to 10 seconds) and the method of weld formation result in a fine grain structure. In the “as welded” condition the residual stresses are compressive which tend to result in good fatigue life. Studs can also be welded through epoxy paint or rubber coatings. The main disadvantages of this process are: *The process can only be used to weld relatively small components (such as studs or plugs) which can be rotated at high speed, onto a work piece. The systems used are limited to studs up to typically 25 mm diameter and plugs for filling holes up to typically 25 mm diameter (plug welding). *The system requires a rigid clamp to hold the welding tool on the work piece and withstand the force applied to the stud during welding. Although these clamps can be moved from one weld location to the next quite rapidly they are generally larger and more cumbersome than is the case with arc stud welding systems. Applications For the type of applications listed here it is especially important that the welding and operating procedures are fully tested and certified for both weld integrity and operational safety prior to use in production. Operators must be thoroughly trained and systems must be in place to ensure that the procedures are properly applied and risks properly assessed. =Welding underwater= When this process is used underwater, a shroud is fitted around the stud which prevents the weld from being cooled too rapidly by the surrounding water. The air powered systems can operate underwater to a depth of approximately 20m and are relatively simple for divers to use. The hydraulically powered systems can also be used by divers and have welded to depths in excess of 300m from a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Current friction stud welding systems are designed to operate to a depth of approximately 1000m. =Welding on live subsea pipelines to attach anodes= Friction stud welding has been used to retrofit sacrificial anodes to subsea pipelines while the pipeline is “live” (that is, it continues to transport hydrocarbons at pressure). In some cases the anodes are placed on the sea bed next to the pipeline and a lug on a cable from the anode is connected to the stud welded on the pipeline. Another option is a tripartite weld where the lug on the anode cable is made of steel with a tapered hole in it. The tapered end of the stud welds through the hole onto the pipeline, welding to both the lug and the pipe and providing a fully welded connection between the anode cable and pipeline. The advantage of this method is that there is no significant increase in the electrical resistance of the connection due to corrosion during the lifetime of the pipeline. Many subsea pipelines have concrete weight coating on them and a small area of this can be removed with a water jet to permit welding. =Welding in explosive environments and zoned areas= Friction stud welding has been used to attach grating to offshore oil platforms in areas where arc welding is not permitted because of the risk of causing a fire or explosion. A shroud similar to the one used for welding underwater acts as a barrier between the weld and the surrounding atmosphere. A water screen can also be used as an additional barrier. An M16 stud weld being performed with a shroud inside a vacuum clamp. In this example the central part of the clamp is flooded with water during welding. =Welding materials that are difficult to join by fusion welding processes= Friction stud welding is a solid phase welding process where the metals do not liquefy. This permits metal combinations such as welding aluminium studs to steel which would be problematic with arc welding because of the formation of brittle inter-metallic compounds. =Friction plug welding= In friction plug welding a tapered shaped plug is friction welded into a tapered hole in the substrate. This welding method can be used to repair defects in castings. It has also been used to fill the holes that occur on completion of a friction stir welding pass when the stirring probe is withdrawn from the weld. Specific recent applications of friction stud welding include: *Retrofitting anodes in an FPSO oil storage tank in a Zone 1 area. *Retrofitting equipment in Zone 1 areas on offshore platforms. *Attachment of anodes inside seawater discharge pipelines in a gas processing plant.

HistoryCompany Profile Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company limited, a wholly owned corporate entity under the Maharashtra Government, was incorporated under the Companies Act, in June, 2005 after restructuring the erstwhile Maharashtra State Electricity Board to transmit electricity from its point of Generation to its point of Distribution. It owns and operates most of Maharashtra’s Electric Power Transmission System. MSETCL operates a transmission network of 39871 Circuit KM of transmission lines and 559 EHV Substations with 89178 MVA transformation capacity. This infrastructure constitutes most of the inter regional as well as intra regional electric power transmission system in the State. Today, MSETCL is the largest state transmission utility in the country. The company also has the distinction of being the only power utility in the state sector to own HVDC lines. The Company operates a 752 km long, 1500 MW, 500 KV bi- polar HVDC line from Chandrapur to Padghe. This has been marked as a major success as electric power is generated in east Maharashtra, due to easy availability of coal, whereas the bulk use of power is in the western part of Maharashtra in and around cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. The power losses are very low in the HVDC line. As a result, the power received at Padghe is practically the same as what is injected at Chandrapur. The load dispatch center is the nerve centre for the operation, monitoring and control of the power system. The SLDC Kalwa near Mumbai is fully computerized and has ultra modern facilities. Mahatransco also has a Load Dispatch center at Ambazari near Nagpur. To keep up with the increase in Power generation in the next 5 years, Mahatransco also has planned to establish a robust transmission network. It is implementing an ambitious expansion plan over the period 2011-12 to 2015-16, to meet the evacuation and grid strengthening needs of the future. The adoption of predictive maintenance practices has helped the company to reduce interruptions and improve the network’s availability to 99.70%. It has installed ABT metering at 530 Sub-stations for energy accounting purposes and implementation of FBSM. The ERP system is fully integrated and being put into use, where functions of key departments are on line. To set up a comprehensive communication network by utilizing existing infrastructure, an Optic Fibre communication system of about 2801 km is being installed. It has also experimented with unmanned remotely controlled substations at two locations and GIS substations at Bhandup and Hinjewadi. To raise funds from the market for equity capital/ capex schemes and to reduce its interest burden, MSETCL is readying itself for the launch of an IPO. It has undertaken an ambitious task of establishment of a 765 KV substation at Aurangabad. The State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) at Kalwa and Ambazari are being renovated and modernized with 140 Nos. of SCADA – RTU. The Company has adopted the National Training Policy and has established Training Centres at 7 different locations which are attached to respective Zonal offices. These centres impart training on Technical, Safety and Soft skills which are guided and monitored by the HR/Training Department. It has recently established a Technical Training Centre - the Power System Learning Centre - at Aurangabad where employees are trained on various power system protection and equipment testing. Recently the Company won the \\"Special Commendation National Award 2011\\" for Innovative Training Practices from the Indian Society for Training and Development, New Delhi.

In the 2008-2009 season it looked like he was going to be second choice goalkeeper, after the signing of highly cited goalkeeper Pierre Ebede. However, after some very poor performances by Ebede, Constantinou was handed the starting position. So, he had established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper for AEL Limassol, despite his young age. He made some great saves and since he was in a very good form, it was expected by the media and fans to receive a national call-up, but this never happened. His exceptional form during the 2008-2009 season earned him a new 1-year contract with AEL Limassol which he signed on the 24th of March 2008, and stayed to the club until the summer of 2010. =APOEL= On May 29, 2010, he signed a one-year contract with APOEL.

It consolidated provisions in the law related to offences against the person (an expression which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. It was part of the criminal law reforms known collectively as \\"Peel's Acts\\", passed with the objective of simplifying the law. Among the laws it replaced was clause XXVI of Magna Carta, the first time any part of Magna Carta was repealed, and the Buggery Act 1533. It also abolished the crime of petty treason. The Act only applied to England and Wales (then described as England). A similar statute was passed for Ireland the following year (10 Geo. 4 c. 34). A number of the Act's provisions were repealed and replaced by the Offences against the Person Act 1837. The death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent (s.12), and for post-quickening abortions (s.13) under this Act was abolished by repeal of those sections by section 1 of the 1837 Act (sections 12 and 13 of this act were replaced by sections 4 and 6 of the 1837 Act, respectively). The death penalty for rape (s.16) and carnal knowledge of a girl under ten (s.17) was abolished by amendment of those sections by section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841. Section 18 made provision in relation to proof of carnal knowledge. The Act was wholly replaced by the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1828, several sections pertained to the crime of rape. The penalty for being convicted of rape was still death, and remained so until 1841. The Act also made it a felony punishable by death to carnally know a girl under the age of ten. Carnally knowing a girl over the age of ten and under the age of twelve was a misdemeanour punishable with imprisonment with the option of hard labour for a term to be determined by the court. The Act also affirmed that proof of penetration was sufficient to reach the conclusion that one person had had carnal knowledge of another; before the 1828 statute, victims of rape had to prove that the perpetrator ejaculated. Historian Anna Clark has argued that medical experts used ejaculation as proof of rape because it was tangible evidence that reduced the need for a victim's testimony. Clark also contends that requiring proof of ejaculation allowed judges and magistrates to ask victims humiliating and explicit questions. By changing the definition of carnal knowledge from ejaculation to proof of penetration, the 1828 act made it a little easier for victims to prosecute their rapists. Records show that from 1828 to 1841, 63 defendants accused of rape were tried at the Old Bailey. Of those 63 defendants, 16 were found guilty and 12 were sentenced to death. Three had their sentenced reduced to imprisonment, and one had his judgment respited altogether. The Act and its focus on interpersonal violence also had the effect of increasing formal accusations of domestic violence, by reducing the stigma surrounding such activity and diminishing judicial delays.

Mihevk Creek, a tributary of the Poljane Sora, flows just north of the village center. Zviršek Spring lies east of the village below the Reber Ridge. There are tilled fields and meadows in the plain between the Poljane Sora and Brebovščica rivers, and hay fields and woods to the east. Name The name Dolenja Dobrava means 'lower Dobrava', contrasting with neighboring Gorenja Dobrava (literally, 'upper Dobrava'), which stands about higher. Dolenja Dobrava was attested in historical sources as Hard Inferiori in 1291, Dobraw in 1420, and Dolenidobraui in 1500. The place name Dobrava is relatively frequent in Slovenia. It is derived from the Slovene common noun dobrava 'gently rolling partially wooded land' (and archaically 'woods, grove'). The name therefore refers to the local geography. Cultural heritage The house at Dolenja Dobrava no. 2 is registered as cultural heritage. The building stands along the road from Gorneja Vas to Dolenja Dobrava. It is a two-story structure with a decorated facade, including quoined corners, carved window frames, and a gable cornice. The wooden entry doors are carved with figures in low-relief and bear the year 1908, and the rectangular door frame is made of marble and dates from 1888. The house was built before 1825 and has been remodeled several times.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number ešd 16981  References  External links  * *Dolenja Dobrava on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Gorenja vas-Poljane ","title":"Dolenja Dobrava, Gorenja Vas–Poljane"},{"id":"20755473","text":"Attack of the Mutant Artificial Trees is a free online video game developed as part of a marketing campaign by the National Christmas Tree Association in 2004.

Count Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy (), also known as the \\"American\\" (Американец) (17 February 1782 – 5 November 1846) was a Russian nobleman from the well-known Tolstoy family. Possessed of an unusual temper, he became famous for his gambling, his passion for duels, and his voyage to North America, where he earned his nickname. He was acquainted with many famous authors of his period and served as a prototype for some of the characters in their works. LifeChildhood and youth= Tolstoy was one of seven children of Count Ivan Andreyevich Tolstoy (1747–1811) and his wife Anna Fyodorovna, who came from the Maikov family. Fyodor Tolstoy's place of birth is not known for certain; most likely he was born on the ancestral estate of the Tolstoys near Kologriv.kologriv.com Despite their high rank, the Tolstoys were at that time relatively poor, the result of a conflict with the authorities in the eighteenth century in which several members of the family were exiled or deprived of property. In order to ensure worthy careers for their sons, it was common in the Tolstoy family to send them to military schools. Thus, Fyodor Tolstoy, along with both his brothers, were educated at the Naval Cadet Corps in Saint Petersburg. A young Tolstoy While still a boy Tolstoy possessed, according to the memoirs of his contemporaries,S. L. Tolstoy, 1926 an uncommon physical strength, endurance, and dexterity, which fulfilled the necessary prerequisites for a successful military career. At the same time, he already had an unpredictable, even cruel personality. In the cadet corps he mastered shooting and fencing, which made him an extremely dangerous opponent in duels. Upon finishing school Tolstoy went into service not in the navy, but in the elite Preobrazhensky regiment, perhaps owing to the assistance of influential relatives. His comrades at that time, among others, the future literary critic Faddei Bulgarin,Faddei Bulgarin, Воспоминания, vol 5, Saint Petersburg, 1848 described Tolstoy as an excellent shooter and a brave fighter. According to their memoirs, he had an energetic and passionate personality, but while fighting he was cool and resolute. His \\"wild\\" character, along with his taste for women and card games, gave him frequent cause for arguments with his comrades and higher officers that often ended in a violation of discipline. Moreover, Tolstoy was very rancorous and vengeful towards those who happened to anger him. Among the nobility of early nineteenth-century Russia, excessive bravery and a deliberate search for dangerous adventures was widespread and highly valued, not only on the front, but also in daily life. As a result, duels remained very popular during this period and often arose out of the smallest arguments. This societal influence, as well as the individual traits of Tolstoy's character, explains his enthusiasm for duels. In 1799, at the age of 17, he fought his first duel with an officer who had reprimanded him for a violation of discipline. The details of this duel are unknown. There are also no reliable witnesses as to Tolstoy's punishment; several memoirs allege that he was demoted to the rank of a soldier, but other sources contradict this information. =World tour= In 1803 Tolstoy went on a circumnavigation of the world as a member of the sloop Nadezhda (\\"Hope\\"), captained by Adam Johann von Krusenstern. This was the first circumnavigation of the world made by a ship under a Russian flag. How Tolstoy, who did not serve in the navy, came to be aboard the ship is unknown. Marya Kamenskaya, the daughter of his cousin, the subsequently famous artist Fyodor Petrovich Tolstoy, writes in her memoirsМемуары Марьи Каменской [Memoirs of Marya Kamenskaya], 1894 that Tolstoy in this way cleverly avoided punishment in the Preobrazhensky regiment. According to Kamenskaya, he posed as his cousin and namesake, who was on the crew of the ship but who did not wish to sail because he suffered from seasickness. The sloop Nadezhda The ship Nadezhda, as well as the accompanying sloop Neva under the command of Yuri Lisyansky, set sail in August 1803 from Kronstadt. In addition to its exploratory goals, the expedition was also meant to help establish diplomatic and economic relations between Russia and Japan, for which the party included a large diplomatic delegation headed by Nikolai Rezanov. Nadezhda took a route across the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, past the Canary Islands and Brazil, after which the ship rounded Cape Horn and set across the Pacific Ocean towards Japan, making stops at the Marquesas and the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands, and also at Kamchatka. After visiting Japan, Nadezhda and Neva set off towards Sitka, Alaska, sailed past China and Macao on the Indian Ocean, then rounded Africa and came back across the Baltic Sea to Kronstadt. The voyage lasted a total of more than three years, from August 7, 1803, to August 19, 1806. Tolstoy's behavior on board, where he was unencumbered by official duties, was very unpredictable. He often provoked quarrels with other members of the team, including the captain himself. In addition, Tolstoy permitted himself some japes when addressing members of the crew that he did not like: for example, once he intoxicated the priest accompanying the Neva, and when the latter lay dead drunk on the floor, Tolstoy stuck his beard to the deck boards with sealing wax. When the priest came to, he was obliged to cut off his beard to free himself. On another occasion, when Krusenstern was gone from his cabin, Tolstoy sneaked into his cabin with a ship's pet, an orangutan that Tolstoy had bought while the ship was moored on an island in the Pacific Ocean. He took Krusenstern's logbook, put a blank sheet of paper on top and began to show the ape how to cover the paper with ink. Then he left the orangutan alone in the cabin, who went on drawing on the notebook. When Krusenstern returned, all his records had already been destroyed. Similar behavior more than once caused Tolstoy to be put under arrest. Finally, Krusenstern lost patience and abandoned the passenger during a stop at Kamchatka. Further details of Tolstoy's travels are known only through his own not always credible accounts. From Kamchatka Tolstoy managed to get to one of the Aleutian islands or to Sitka island, where he spent several months among Alaskan natives of the Tlingit tribe. It is possible that he travelled from Kamchatka to Sitka on the ship Neva, after he was dropped off by the Nadezhda. During his sojourn on Sitka (or according to other sources, during the earlier stop of the Nadezhda stop in the Marquesas), he acquired multiple tattoos, which he later displayed with pride to curious acquaintances. The afore-mentioned orangutan, which was left on land with Tolstoy and whose later fate is unknown, gave rise to a great deal of gossip in aristocratic circles. According to one of the rumors, during his stay in Kamchatka, Tolstoy lived together with the ape; according to others, he ate it. At any rate, Tolstoy's return to European Russia via the Far East, Siberia, the Urals and the Volga Region, was probably full of adventures, the details of which only Tolstoy knew. According to his accounts, a merchant ship picked him up in Alask and dropped him off at Petropavlosk, from where Tolstoy wound his way overland to Petersburg on carts, on sleighs, and partly on foot. One of the few written testimonies of this odyssey is found in the \\"Notes\\" of the writer Philip Vigel, which only resurfaced in 1892. Vigel, who traveled around Russia at the beginning of the nineteenth century to study Russian daily life, met Tolstoy in Udmurtia and described this episode in the following way: \\"At one of the stations we were surprised to see an officer approach us in a uniform of the Preobrazhensky Corps. This was Count F. I. Tolstoy . . . . He was traveling around the world with Krusenstern and Rezanov, quarreled with all, drove all to quarrel, and as a dangerous person was put ashore at Kamchatka and made his way across land back to Petersburg. What hasn't been said about him . . . .\\"Filipp Vigel, Записки, Moscow: 1892 Tolstoy's voyage concluded with his arrival in Petersburg at the beginning of August 1805. Thanks to his adventures, which gave rise to much gossip in high society, the count acquired an almost legendary celebrity, as well as the lifelong nickname \\"the American\\", referring his stay in Russian America. =War= Battle of Ratan and Sävar, near Umeå Immediately upon Tolstoy's arrival in Petersburg, he was greeted with new problems: he was arrested at the city gates and sent to the guardhouse. Moreover, a special ukase from Alexander I forbad him from entering the capital. Tolstoy's scandalous past also disrupted his military career. He was demoted from the elite Preobrazhensky regiment to a post in the little-known Neishlott fortress, where he served from 1805 to 1808. Philippe Vigel wrote regarding this onerous period for Tolstoy: \\"the punishment was severe for the brave man, who had never seen battle, especially during a time when all Europe, from west to east, had broken out in war.\\" Only Tolstoy's friendship with the commander Mikhail Dolgorukov helped the count in the end to get a post as an aide-de- camp on the front during the recently begun Finnish War. There Tolstoy was in his element: he actively participated in the battles, including the battle of Idensalmi, in which Dolgorukov died. A while after, Tolstoy, risking his life, headed a reconnaissance detachment during an operation of the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia, thanks to which the corps under the command of General Michael Barclay de Tolly managed to cross the ice of the gulf and occupy the city of Umeå without casualties. These feats, which facilitated Russia's rapid victory, rehabilitated Tolstoy in the eyes of the command, and from 31 October 1808 he was allowed to serve in the Preobrazhensky Regiment as a lieutenant. A few months later, however, Tolstoy fought two more duels. In the first of these he mortally wounded his comrade and captain, whom he himself had provoked by spreading sordid rumors about his sister. A few days later there followed a duel with the young ensign Naryshkin, who had asserted that Tolstoy had cheated him in a card game; Naryshkin challenged Tolstoy to a duel and was also killed. After this, Tolstoy was for several months confined to a guardhouse in the Vyborg fortress, and on 2 October 1811 he was dismissed from the army. Less than a year afterwards, Tolstoy returned to the war, this time as a volunteer in the defense of Moscow during the French invasion of Russia. During the Battle of Borodino, he was severely wounded in the knee. On the recommendation of General Nikolai Rayevsky, who in a letter to Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov mentioned Tolstoy's bravery, Tolstoy received the Cross of St. George, fourth rank. Moreover, Tolstoy was once again rehabilitated and received the rank of colonel. At the end of the war he finally left the army and settled down in Moscow. =In Moscow= From 1812 until his death Tolstoy lived most of his life in Moscow, in a house on Sivtsev Vrazhek lane. His notorious, almost heroic past earned him fame in the Moscow aristocratic circles, and Tolstoy took advantage of his celebrity. He regularly took part in noble gatherings and balls, and he himself organized several festive soirées and had a reputation as a refined gastronome. Owing to the erudition that he had gained in military school, he easily conversed with representatives of the creative intelligentsia, and became friends with many of them. Among his friends were the writers Evgeny Baratynsky, Vasily Zhukovsky, Aleksandr Griboyedov, Konstantin Batyushkov, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Denis Davydov, Nikolai Gogol, and Aleksandr Pushkin. Card games and duels Tolstoy loved gambling and became particularly famous for this during his years in Moscow. He did not hide the fact that he sometimes cheated. According to the memoirs of his contemporaries, Tolstoy did not like to rely on luck during a game, preferring, by way of cardsharping, to \\"play for certain\\", since \\"only fools rely on luck\\", as he himself liked to say. A. N. Vulf recounts that once when Pushkin met Tolstoy playing cards, he remarked upon his cheating, to which Tolstoy replied, \\"Yes, I know that myself, but I do not like to be reminded of it.\\"Пушкин в воспоминаниях современников, 1. С. 413 Partly owing to his cheating, Tolstoy often won large sums of money, which he in general spent rapidly and capriciously on society life. At other times Tolstoy became the victim of other cardsharps and suffered great losses. Even more famous was Tolstoy's participation in a number of duels, the reasons for which were often found in card games. It is unknown how many duels Tolstoy fought in his life, but some accounts state that he killed eleven men altogether in duels. For Tolstoy, duels were evidently not only a way of vindicating his honor—as was accepted in officers' circles in Russia—but also an ordinary pastime. Once Tolstoy had to serve as a second in the duel of one of his closest friends. Fearing for the life of his friend, Tolstoy decided to intervene to prevent the worst: before the duel was held, he himself challenged his friend's opponent and killed him. Leo Tolstoy, the first cousin once removed of Fyodor, whom he knew from his early childhood, used to recount this event. Personal life In his early years in Moscow, Tolstoy's love affairs provided copious material for rumor and gossip in society. He married the gypsy dancer Avdotya Tugayeva on January 10, 1821, but only after having lived with her for several years. Marya Kamenskaya's memoirs explain the reason for this marriage: Sarra, Tolstoy's daughter This marriage lasted until Tolstoy's death. Tugayeva gave birth to twelve children, however, only one reached the age of maturity: their daughter Praskovya Fyodorovna, who lived till 1887. Tolstoy and Tugayeva's eldest daughter, Sarra, possessed of a poetic gift, but unhealthy both physically and mentally, died at the age of 17 of consumption. All the other children were born dead or died in infancy. Relationship with Pushkin Fyodor Tolstoy, in a drawing by Pushkin One of the best-known aspects of Count Tolstoy's life in Moscow was his not always friendly relationship with the poet Aleksandr Pushkin. Pushkin and Tolstoy met for the first time in the spring of 1819. A notorious quarrel between them began in 1820 after Pushkin fell into disgrace because of his poems and was exiled to Ekaterinoslav, then to the Caucasus, Crimea and Bessarabia. During this time Tolstoy spread a rumor in Moscow, intentionally or unintentionally, that Pushkin was flogged by the police before his departure into exile. Hearing about this false rumor, the temperamental and sensitive Pushkin was so offended that he swore to challenge Tolstoy to a duel upon his return from exile. Moreover, the poet answered Tolstoy with the epigram \\"В жизни мрачной и презренной…\\" (\\"In a gloomy and despicable life...\\") and harsh verses in a message \\"To Chaadayev\\":Лотман. Комментарии к «Евгению Онегину».А. С. Пушкин. Чаадаеву \\"Or a philosopher, who in his early years / Amazed the world with his depravity, / But, becoming enlightened, made amends for his disgrace: / He quit drinking wine and became a cardsharp?\\" It is curious that when, during the publication of the poem, the words \\"or a philosopher\\" (или философа) were changed to \\"a fool-philosopher\\" (глупца-философа), Pushkin strongly objected: \\"'A fool-philosopher' is printed; why a fool? The poem refers to the American Tolstoy, who is not a fool at all\\". While in exile, Pushkin assiduously prepared himself for the duel, practicing his shooting on a regular basis. On September 8, 1826, almost immediately after returning to Moscow, he sent Tolstoy his challenge. The duel was prevented then only by Tolstoy's accidental absence from Moscow. A while later the known bibliographer and friend of Pushkin Sergei Sobolevsky managed to reconcile Pushkin with Tolstoy. Tolstoy was possibly also interested in reconciliation, as he knew that killing Pushkin would probably cut off his relations with many famous poets whose friendship he valued. In subsequent years Tolstoy and Pushkin even became friends. Thus in 1829, Pushkin entrusted Tolstoy with the delivery of a letter to Tolstoy's acquaintance and Pushkin's future mother-in-law, Natalya Nikolayevna Goncharova, in which he declared himself a suitor for the hand of her 17-year-old daughter Natalya. Although the elder Goncharova could not give Pushkin a definite answer, Pushkin eventually succeeded in his suit, and in 1831, he and Natalya were married. Final years Tolstoy suffered greatly from the death of his children, especially when his eldest daughter, Sarra, died at the age of seventeen. Some of Tolstoy's friends recounted later that by the end of his life grew devout and considered the death of his eleven children to be God's punishment for his killing of eleven men in duels. During this time, Tolstoy no longer fought duels and played cards only seldom. Instead, he prayed more and more, attempting to atone for the sins of his youth. Sometimes he went abroad to take the waters, spending time in various European countries. One of Tolstoy's best-known acquaintances during these years was Aleksandr Herzen, who reminisced about Tolstoy a decade later in his book, My Past and Thoughts (Былое и думы): Tolstoy's grave in the Vagankovo Cemetery Tolstoy died on November 5, 1846, after a short illness, in his Moscow home in the presence of his wife and only surviving daughter Praskovya. According to the recollections of his close friends, before his death he summoned a priest and confessed to him for several hours. Tolstoy was buried in the Vagankavo Cemetery. His widow Avdotya outlived him by fifteen years and died a violent death: she was stabbed by her own cook in 1861. The Tolstoy's house on Sivtsev Vrazhek near the old Arbat was not preserved: it was destroyed in the 1950s to make way for the \\"Kremlin\\" clinic. Fyodor Tolstoy in literaturePushkin= Owing to his notorious past and to his close acquaintance with many authors, Tolstoy became the prototype for some of the characters in their books, the most famous of whom was Aleksandr Pushkin. In his novel in verse Eugene Onegin (1823–1831) Tolstoy appears as the duellist Zaretsky, Lensky's second in his duel with the main character, Onegin. Pushkin depicts Zaretsky/Tolstoy in the following way: :Five versts or so from Krasnogórie, :Lensky's estate, there lives and still :thrives to this moment, in a station :of philosophic isolation, :Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls :and hetman of the gambling-halls, :arch-rake, pothouse tribune-persona, :but now grown plain and kind in stead, :paterfamilias (unwed), :unswerving friend, correct landowner, :and even honourable man: :so, if we want to change, we can! Pushkin, Eugene Onegin, trans. Johnston, . These lines show that Pushkin had made peace with Tolstoy: Pushkin refers to him as an \\"honorable man\\", who has transformed from an \\"arch-rake\\" into a \\"paterfamilias\\", with, however, the label \\"unwed\\"—an allusion to his long-lasting ménage with the gypsy Tugayeva. Further on in the story, Pushkin displays his friendship with Tolstoy: :He was no fool; appreciated :by my Eugene, not for his heart, :but for the effect that he created :of sense and judgement. For his part :his converse gave Onegin pleasure... Yuri Lotman agrees that fundamentally Zaretsky was based on Tolstoy, but concludes that Pushkin subjected this real prototype to a significant reworking.Лотман, Ю. М. Комментарии к «Евгению Онегину». In particular, unlike Zaretsky, who fell off his \\"Kalmyk horse\\" and was captured, Tolstoy was an infantry officer, who was never in captivity. =Griboyedov= The other famous poet who used Tolstoy as a model was Alexander Griboyedov. In his comedy Woe from Wit the character Repetilov refers to Tolstoy in a monologue, calling him a \\"nighttime robber and duellist\\" with \\"unclean hands\\", who was \\"exiled to Kamchatka and came back as an Aleutian\\". Tolstoy himself wrote corrections into one of the manuscripts. He modified the phrase \\"he was exiled to Kamchatka\\" to \\"the devil took him to Kamchatka\\", noting that he was never exiled, and limited the line about \\"unclean hands\\" to include \\"at cards\\", remarking that \\"for a true likeness these corrections are necessary, so that people will not think, that [this character] steals snuffboxes from tables\\". Tolstoy also accused Griboyedov of implying that he was a bribetaker. When Griboyedov objected, saying \\"but you do play unfairly, after all\\", Tolstoy responded, \\"Only that? Well you should have written it that way.\\" Tolstoy loved to dwell on this line, bringing it up on many occasions. At one of the first performances of Woe from Wit, Tolstoy, who was seated in the audience, stood up after Repetilov's speech and shouted, \\"I never took bribes, because I never served [in the government]!\\", a quip that was greeted with applause. Notes and references Tolstoy was also most likely used as a model for the cruel and bloodthirsty duellist Dolokhov, who fights Pierre Bezukhov in War and Peace.

The commission, headed by Valeriy Konovalyuk of the Party of Regions, was formed on September 2, 2008. In December 2008, the commission released a report, accusing the Ukrainian leadership of arming Georgia in violation of Ukrainian and international law. On December 19, 2008, the parliament heard the report and decided to consider it and to forward it to the President and the Prime Minister of Ukraine, while the office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine is requested to evaluate its findings. The Prosecutor General is further asked to give a legal evaluation of the measures taken by Ukraine's security services and the Ministry of Defence that, according to the commission, were aimed at interfering with its investigation. At the same time, the parliament refused to extend the commission's mandate until June 2009 and to suspend the weapons exports to Georgia, as suggested by the commission.  Background  Burned Georgian T-72 tank, supplied by Ukraine, after the Battle of Tskhinvali. On August 7, 2008, a war broke out between Georgia on one side and its secessionist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, supported by Russia, on another. Shortly after, Russia accused Ukraine of illegally supplying the Georgian Army with weapons and claimed that the Ukrainian mercenaries participated in the conflict on the Georgian side. Ukraine denies illegal export of its weapons and involvement of its nationals in the conflict. A commission was thus created in the Ukrainian parliament to investigate the Russian claims.  Members of the commission  The commission was composed of 6 people's deputies representing every political party or bloc in the parliament, except for the pro-presidential Our Ukraine–People's Self- Defense Bloc. * Valeriy Konovalyuk (Party of Regions) – Head of Commission * Igor Alekseyev (Communist Party of Ukraine) – Deputy Head of Commission * Valeriy Bondyk (Party of Regions) * Serhiy Hrynevetsky (Lytvyn Bloc) * Serhiy Osyka (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) * Mykola Petruk (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc)  Investigation and findings  The commission summarized its findings in a report, issued in December 2008. It concluded that Ukraine exported a variety of assault weapons, such as tanks, BMP infantry fighting vehicles, BTR armoured personnel carriers, 2S7 Pion self-propelled artillery units, Grad multiple rocket launcher units, and Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters just prior to the onset of the South Ossetian war. The report also claims that some weapons exports were conducted in a manner detrimental to Ukraine's defence: a number of Buk missile system units sold to Georgia were taken off active duty, thus diminishing Ukraine's air defence capabilities. Furthermore, the report alleges widespread financial machinations involving weapons being sold for prices 3-5 times lower than the market value and payments not reaching Ukraine's budget. Additionally, the commission released a list of Ukrainian military specialists, thought to had been present in Georgia during the onset of the war.  Reaction  All the parties implicated by the commission have strongly denied any wrongdoing, accusing the commission of using its position as a tool in the ongoing political struggle for power.

The salad is topped with a mayonnaise-based dressing and sometimes sour cream is added. It is often served in a glass bowl or large pan so the layers can be observed. The dish is often associated with potlucks, picnics, and barbecues, where a large gathering of people takes place and many people need to be fed. There are many variants of the seven-layer salad and it can be made with additional (or sometimes fewer) layers, making it (for example) an eight-layer salad instead. History Although there are many variations, the traditional seven-layer salad has remained the same for decades. The dish may have originated in the South and was called the \\"seven-layer pea salad\\" for its main layers of peas. The traditional seven-layer salad is covered with a coating of mayonnaise (and sometimes sour cream) and includes eggs and bacon. It has been said to have \\"helped give salads of the 1950s a bad name... when it came to health.\\" Variations Popular variations on the home-made salad's ingredients include ham, mushrooms, celery, carrots, and bell peppers. The dish remains a party staple, and its impressive height and layered architecture have been adapted by some restaurant chefs, though \\"our mothers were stacking long before many of today's chefs were even born.\\" Cooks modifying the salad include those at Aura restaurant on Lincoln Road in Florida who include sliced mozzarella, red tomatoes and basil layered for red, green and white color, and others using fruit, cutting back on high-fat ingredients, substituting low-fat yogurt or a vinaigrette dressing for the mayonnaise/sour cream, and modifying the ingredients with ethnic and gourmet foods such as tomatillos, chickpeas, black beans and pepperoni.

Overview The television programme focuses on regional reporting. In addition to the afternoon programme hallo hessen and the previous evening tabloid magazine maintower as well as a compact late edition of the regional news, hessenschau kompakt (both Monday to Friday), the daily hessenschau at 7:30 p.m. has above all consolidated itself in the programme as a permanent institution and programme with the highest ratings. Other programmes include the regional political magazine defacto, the panel shows strassenstars and Wer weiss es?, the business and consumer magazine mex and the cultural magazine hauptsache kultur. Currently the most successful format is the Sunday hessenQuiz with Jörg Bombach. Ranking shows are often broadcast in which the \\"most popular\\" or \\"most beautiful\\" rivers, castles, mountains in or celebrities from Hesse are presented. From 1990 to 1993, the channel broadcast the weekly talk show Zeil um Zehn and from 1999 to 2004 from Monday to Friday the Late Lounge moderated by Roberto Cappelluti from 10:00 p.m. on.Clemens Niedenthal: Senderschnarchen, 18.

Friedman, the first literary programme on German television bücher, bücher, the animal programme herrchen gesucht, the Stadtgespräch and the c't magazine. History The third television programme of Hessischer Rundfunk was founded on 5 October 1964 under the name Hessisches Fernsehprogramm. Its registered office is in Frankfurt am Main. In the last few decades, the name, logo and appearance of the program have changed several times. Between 1983 and 1997 the programme was called Hessen Drei and from 1997 to 2004 hessen fernsehen. Since 3 October 2004 it has been called hr-fernsehen. Hessen 3 was the only third programme to broadcast television advertising from January 1985 to December 1992. The proceeds were intended to finance the fourth radio programme (hr4). Initial revenues of around DM 15 million a year were generated, most recently they amounted to around DM 12 million. In the 1987 Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag), however, the states agreed that no more advertising should be broadcast in Hessen 3 as soon as the funds required for hr4 from broadcasting fees were available. In 1988 a passage was included in the HR-law, after which the hr was only allowed to broadcast advertising in Hessen 3 until the end of 1992.vgl. BVerfG, Beschluss des Ersten Senats vom 6.

When a program is about to overwrite an existing file (for example, when the user saves the document they are working on), the program may first make a copy of the existing file, with \`.bak\` appended to the filename. This common \`.bak\` naming scheme makes it possible to retrieve the original contents of the file.

Songs Most of these songs were covered by major artists on the charity album Wig in a Box. =Tear Me Down= \\"Tear Me Down\\" is a song from the off-Broadway musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch and subsequent film. It was composed by Stephen Trask, and performed by the characters Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) and Yitzhak (Miriam Shor). It is the show's opening number. It contains a spoken section alluding to the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961 and its fall on November 9, 1989. Meaning Tear Me Down introduces Hedwig as a person who has been, just like her home town of Berlin, \\"split in two\\". Most obviously she is part-male and part-female, but as the song progresses, we see that she is also a cross between conqueror and victim (\\"Enemies and adversaries, they try and tear me down\\"); spirituality and repugnance (\\"I rose ... like Lazarus\\" and \\"decorate/degrade me with blood, graffiti and spit\\"); accessibility and imprisonment (\\"Ain't much of a difference between a bridge and a wall\\"). Notably, Hedwig is compared to the divide between Communist East Germany and capitalist West Germany. Her personal crisis stems from the disparity between these two states and her inability to reconcile them, much as she cannot reconcile her new body (\\"I rose from off the doctor's slab\\"). Other versions *The song was covered by the rock artist Meat Loaf on his 2003 album Couldn't Have Said It Better, adapting some of the lyrics (notably the spoken section about the Berlin Wall) so that the song is instead about Texas and Meat Loaf's own life. (Trask, who composed the music for Hedwig, was much influenced by Meat Loaf's albums when he was growing up. A deleted scene on the Hedwig DVD acknowledges the debt in a roundabout way, as we overhear Hedwig's manager Phyllis Stein (Andrea Martin) arguing about the band's sound on the phone: \\"MEAT LOAF..?! Bowie!\\") *In the same year, the band Spoon covered the song, with Stephen Colbert reciting the spoken part originally performed by Miriam Shor, for a charity tribute album called Wig in a Box, released by Off Records. =Sugar Daddy= \\"Sugar Daddy\\" is a song from the off-Broadway musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch and subsequent film. It was composed by Stephen Trask, and is performed in the musical by the characters Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) and Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint in the film). The divide between Communist East Germany and the democratic Western World is illustrated in the numerous cultural references included in the song's lyrics; they underline the idea that Hedwig is living in the Communist world where dictators and violence are the norm, while across the wall, Luther (and the American food products, fashion items and technological advancements) represents the American Dream. The song was performed by Neil Patrick Harris at the 2014 Tony Awards. Covers * Frank Black (Engineered by Joel Hamilton, Produced by Reid Paley, who also appears on guitar) on the charity tribute album Wig in a Box: Songs from & Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch =Angry Inch= \\"The Angry Inch\\" is a song from the off-Broadway musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and its subsequent film adaptation. It was composed by Stephen Trask and performed by John Cameron Mitchell. The song details the botched sex-change operation that Hedwig got in order to marry an American soldier and move to the United States. The eponymous \\"angry inch\\" is what remains of Hedwig's penis — \\"six inches forward and five inches back\\". The song was covered by Type O Negative on the album Life is Killing Me. Sleater-Kinney and Fred Schneider also covered the song for Wig in a Box, a benefit album for the Hetrick-Martin Institute. Production of the album was documented in the 2006 film Follow My Voice: With the Music of Hedwig. In the film, the song was performed at the fictional Bilgewater's and the song started a fight. =Wig in a Box= \\"Wig in a Box\\" is a song from the off- Broadway musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and its subsequent film adaptation. It was composed by Stephen Trask and is performed in the musical by the character Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) and her band The Angry Inch. The titular wig in the box is the last present that Hedwig's husband Luther bought her, and the song concerns Hedwig listening to music and trying on wigs, which enables her to escape her present troubles and become whomever she wants. The part of the story in which this song appears is set in 1989, but the song contains references to sound recording (and playing) devices already outdated in 1989; they reflect the time period of each wig style and the character Hedwig assigns to it (\\"Miss Farah Fawcett on TV,\\" \\"Miss Beehive 1963,\\"). Covers * The Polyphonic Spree on the charity tribute album Wig in a Box: Songs from & Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch =The Origin of Love= \\"The Origin of Love\\" is a song from the stage show Hedwig and the Angry Inch and subsequent film. Stephen Trask wrote the song, which is based on a story from Plato's Symposium. Origins In the Symposium, a party is being held in which a series of speeches are given paying homage to Eros, the Greek god of love. \\"The Origin of Love\\" is taken from the speech given by the playwright Aristophanes. According to the speech, long ago, humans were composed of two people stuck back-to-back, with two faces and eight limbs. Male-male humans came from the Sun, female-female humans from the Earth and male-female humans from the Moon. The gods, out of jealousy, split them in half. Now, throughout our lives, we are always trying to find our \\"other half\\", and sexual intercourse is the only means we have to put the two halves back together; this desire to be one person again is what we call \\"love\\". However, it is impossible to fully rejoin two people because it is our souls and not our bodies that most desire to be reunited. The song Trask says of the song's form: \\"When I started writing that song, the only way I could think to write it was as a picture book. So I wrote it, all the images in it, and the way the story gets told, as the language of, like, a Dr. Seuss picture book. If you read the lyrics out loud, they read like a picture book.\\"Agent Orange: Stephen Trask On Hedwig & The Angry Inch! While taken from the story within the story in the Symposium, the song deliberately jumbles deities of different cultures (such as Zeus, Osiris, and Thor.) It puts forward Hedwig's idea that humans have pre-destined soul mates, and that she is seeking hers. At the end of the film, Tommy addresses this idea in the reprise of the song Wicked Little Town, arguing that no cosmic force controls our destiny (\\"And there's no mystical design, no cosmic lover preassigned\\"), and suggesting that she needs to move on. According to the Internet Movie Database, and the DVD's commentary track, the vocals for this song as it appears in the film were recorded live.Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001) - Trivia The animation that accompanies the song in the film version was drawn by Emily Hubley. Covers *On the album Wig in a Box (a charity cover of the Hedwig soundtrack), \\"The Origin of Love\\" is covered separately by Rufus Wainwright and Jonathan Richman. *Bonnie Pink included a version on her cover album Reminiscence =Wicked Little Town= \\"Wicked Little Town\\" is a song from the off-Broadway musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and the subsequent film adaptation. Composed by Stephen Trask, the song is a poetic reflection on the doomed love between two of the characters, Hedwig and Tommy Gnosis. Summary and context The original song is basically about a person who falls in love with someone in a wicked town that seems to be impossible to escape. In the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Hedwig sings the tune as a love song to Tommy, while in the film, she is singing a version of the song when Tommy comes into a donut shop, and later in the film, a full, rock ballad reprise version has been created for Tommy to sing to Hedwig. After his relationship with Hedwig was revealed, Tommy sings that he is sorry for how much he has hurt Hedwig, that he never understood she was \\"more than a woman or a man\\" and that now he finally sees how much he took from her by stealing her songs. He also tells her that her ideas about soulmates and cosmic destiny are preventing her from moving on (\\"Maybe there's nothing up in the sky but air...\\") and then, wishing her well, he slips away into the darkness, leaving Hedwig in tears. It is notable that a line in the song, \\"If you've got no other choice, you know you can follow my voice\\" is literally played out in the story, as Hedwig stalks Tommy around the country from concert to concert, \\"following his voice.\\" It could also be said that Tommy followed Hedwig's voice, given his hero worship of her, his taking on of the Tommy Gnosis persona she devised, and his theft of her songs. When Tommy sings the reprise, he stops singing at \\"voice\\" while the song continues to play, and Hedwig smiles in a reaction shot.

It was composed and by Stephen Trask. In the film version, the song was cut (except for the part where Tommy is working on the line \\"Look what you've done.\\" In the stage version, the song is sung by Hedwig's husband Yitzhak, when Hedwig becomes overwhelmed with emotion and is unable to perform the song. The lyrics accuse Hedwig's former lover (Tommy Gnosis) of grifting her, singing: \\"I didn't want to know that your cool, seductive serenade // Is a tool of your trade, you gigolo.\\" Hedwig concludes by deprecating the entirety of their love, singing \\"The love that had me in your grip // was just a long, long grift.\\" Covers * They Might Be Giants on the charity tribute album Wig in a Box: Songs from & Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch =Midnight Radio= \\"Midnight Radio\\" is a song from the off-Broadway musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and its subsequent film adaptation.

Friedrich Hagedorn (1814–1889) was a German painter who was active in Brazil. After twenty years of residence in the country, he then returned to Germany, his homeland. His production was relatively plentiful and always attentive to the discovery of new landscapes. He was born and died in Germany. Biography After having been a court painter in Lisbon between 1844-1847, he settled in Rio de Janeiro from 1848 to 1853, completing a group of German artists who have documented the landscape and the national customs, traveling to Pernambuco, São Paulo, Bahia and Minas Gerais. He immediately installed his atelier at Rua São José, nr. 12, and started painting. Later he moved to Rua do Teatro, nr. 17. He took part in the Exposição Geral de Belas-Artes in 1859–1860. He remained in Brazil for twenty years, working in Niterói, Petrópolis, Teresópolis, Juiz de Fora, Salvador and Recife. Although he found a good market for his productions, his presence seems to have been little noticed by the official circles and art critics of the time. He worked specially with watercolor and tempera, and some of his landscapes were disseminated through Chromolithographs. His work is preserved mainly in the Hispanic Society of America, in New York, the National Library of Brazil, the Museu do Estado de Pernambuco, as well as in private collections.

Route description Looking southeast along SR 795 from its northtern terminus, June 2014 SR 289) at the eastern terminus of SR 795, June 2014 SR 795 begins at a T intersection with East 2nd Street about northeast of downtown Winnemucca and immediately northwest of the city limits. (East 2nd Street heads northeast through Weso to end near the south bank of the Humboldt River. East 2nd Street heads southwest as SR 289 to downtown Winnemucca to connect with U.S. Route 95 [US 95].) From its southern terminus, SR 795 heads northwest along Reinhart Lane to cross the Humboldt River. Just after the river crossing, SR 795 has an intersection with East National Avenue, which heads south-southwest to northwest Winnemucca. (The road continues north- northeast as a dirt road roughly following the course of the river.) SR 795 then curves to a northerly course before turning to head west-northwest and reaching its northern terminus at US 95, about north of downtown Winnemucca. (Reinhart Drive continues a bit farther to a T intersection with Sage Heights Drive. US 95 heads south to downtown Winnemucca and north to Oregon and western Idaho.) SR 795, along with SR 289, provides an alternate and more direct connection between northern Humboldt County on US 95 and destinations east on Interstate 80. History Prior to becoming a state route in the late 1990s, SR 795 existed as a dirt road maintained by Humboldt County. The route historically served as a shortcut to Winnemucca and was experiencing increasing traffic volumes. The county worked with the Nevada Department of Transportation to bring the road to state highway standards and include it the state highway system.

Dwyer has also appeared on Juno Award winning recordings with Hugh Fraser (1988), Joe Sealy (1997), Guido Basso (2004), Don Thompson (2006), Molly Johnson (2009), Terry Clarke (2010), and Diana Panton (2015). He is an alumnus and Honorary Fellow of The Royal Conservatory of Music. Biography Dwyer was born December 17, 1965, in Duncan, British Columbia, and went to high school in Parksville, and Qualicum Beach, British Columbia. Dwyer’s first national press exposure came from journalist Mark Miller, who profiled Dwyer in a piece filed for The Globe and Mail in 1982 from the Canadian Stage Band Festival (precursor to MusicFest Canada), held that year in Hamilton, Ontario. Dwyer performed with his Ballenas Secondary School group Triple Image and took the Gold Medal in the combo category. Dwyer joined the American Federation of Musicians, Local 145, in 1983, at age 17, to perform with Fred Stride's West Coast Jazz Orchestra, 'subbing' for well known Vancouver saxophonist/flautist Tom Keenlyside. A recording of his first Vancouver performance as a bandleader led to his receiving a Canada Council grant in 1983 to study in New York with David Liebman, which led in turn to studies with Steve Grossman. Earlier teachers included saxophonists Steve Jones and David Branter, pianist Don Thompson, piano/theory teacher Joan Gosselin and high school band director Bill Cave. His high school contemporaries included trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, bassist Pat Collins, and singer/pianist Diana Krall, for whom years later Dwyer would compose the tribute song 'Diana Piana'. In 1985, Dwyer returned to Canada to stay, stopping in Edmonton on his way to Vancouver to perform the Hugh Fraser’s VEJI band, and guitarist Oliver Gannon’s Quartet, at the Edmonton Jazz City Festival. From 1985 through 1988, Dwyer was based in Vancouver, where he worked as a freelance musician, was a member of VEJI and the Hugh Fraser Quintet and traveled south to work with bassist David Friesen’s Trio (with drummer Alan Jones). Among his earlier recordings were the Juno winning Looking Up (Hugh Fraser Quintet), Classic VEJI, and Friesen’s Other Times, Other Places. Reviewers, including journalist Scott Yanow, highlighted Dwyer’s contributions to Friesen’s recording in particular. In 1988, Dwyer relocated to Toronto and established a freelance performing and recording career, as well as joining the music faculty at York University. He was a frequent performer at Toronto jazz clubs such as the Top o' the Senator, Montréal Bistro, George's Spaghetti House, the Pilot Tavern, and the Rex Jazz Bar. He also appeared at concert venues such as Massey Hall, Roy Thompson Hall, the O'Keefe Centre, and others. Among the artists with whom Dwyer appeared are Kenny Wheeler, Aretha Franklin, Rodney Whitaker, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Esprit Orchestra, Holly Cole, Tom Harrell, Renee Rosnes, and many others. During the time he lived in Toronto he also toured frequently across Canada, in the U.S., South America, Europe, and Asia, appearing at various clubs and festivals with different Canadian based groups and in 1995 with Gino Vannelli. From the early 1990s until 2004, Dwyer was a fixture in the Toronto recording studios, appearing on many albums, radio shows, and commercials. Some of his most frequent collaborators included Doug Riley, Don Thompson, Roberto Occhipinti, Molly Johnson, Guido Basso, John Johnson, Manteca, and Tim Tickner. He also wrote commercial music for production companies Rosnick/McKinnon, Einstein Bros., Pirate, and others. In 1999-2000, Dwyer studied composition with Michael Colgrass, which led to him writing music by commission for the Amici Ensemble, Patricia O'Callaghan, Art Of Time, Gryphon Trio, Mark Fewer, CBC Orchestra, Kate Alton (choreographer), and several CBC Radio projects. In 2004, Dwyer relocated to Qualicum Beach, on his native Vancouver Island. He continued to tour, write and record prolifically, including recordings with Terri Lyne Carrington, Terry Clarke, Joey Defrancesco, Don Thompson, Molly Johnson, Ian McDougall, Phil Dwyer Orchestra, Jon McCaslin, Melinda Whitaker, Norman Foote, David Gogo and the Bridge Quartet. He also founded and operated the Phil Dwyer Academy of Musical and Culinary Arts (PDAMCA). In 2013, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada \\"for his contributions to jazz as a performer, composer and producer, and for increasing access to music education in his community\\". Other activities Dwyer is a founding partner of Seawind Musical Instruments Inc., manufacturer of the Phil Dwyer Edition line of saxophones as well as other musical instruments and accessories. In 2014, Dwyer was admitted to the University of New Brunswick law school, and as of June 2015 had completed his first year. Dwyer was motivated to pursue the legal career due to his long-standing interests in a number of social justice, environmental, and political issues.

Stuart is a middle aged bachelor and a Ranger with the United States Forest Service. The character was portrayed by Robert Bray.Jenkins, Henry. \\"Lassie.\\" Museum of Broadcast Communications, nd. Corey Stuart first appeared in the series as a one-shot character in the tenth season episode, \\"Disappearance\\" (1963). He was a hit with the audience and returned full-time the following season as the series' only human lead. His last appearance occurred in the two-part episode of the fifteenth season, \\"The Holocaust\\" (1968). Background As the eleventh season of Lassie approached in 1964, series star Jon Provost was a fourteen-year-old with his contract up for a three-year renewal. Provost however was not interested in remaining with the show, and did not renew his contract. He later recalled, > \\"I was just tired of being Timmy everywhere I went. I couldn't see myself > being Timmy until I was seventeen or eighteen years old...If they had let > him grow up a little, maybe I would have wanted to stay on.\\"Collins, Ace. > Lassie: A Dog's Life. Penguin, 1993. A few episodes in the last farm seasons were set in wilderness locations, and proved audience favorites. With Provost leaving the show, producers decided to scrap the farm scenario, and fashioned instead a plot about Lassie teaming up with Forest Ranger Stuart. The groundwork for their pairing was laid in the tenth season five-part episode, \\"Disappearance\\". Stuart rescues Lassie from a storm in the first part and reunites her with the Martins in the final-part. In the meantime, Lassie helps Stuart rescue others lost in the storm, stops a poacher on Federal land, survives avalanche and forest fire, and forms a profound bond with Stuart. With the new plot good to go, the Martin family was shipped off to Australia to teach agriculture in the eleventh season opener. Lassie remained in the States due to Australia's strict quarantine regulations and found a home with Stuart. The two would share adventure in America's national forests and scenic wonderlands. The show transitioned to color filming in 1965 with the twelfth season, and episodes became mini-travelogues with some locations being seen for the first time on television in color. Casting Several actors tested for the role of Corey Stuart with Bray and a popular Western star competing in the finals. While the Western star was liked by the producer, sponsor, and advertising agency, Bray proved to have a more appealing on-camera relationship with Lassie and was awarded the role.Raddatz, Leslie. \\"Robert Bray: The Man with Dog Appeal.\\" TV Guide, 14 August 1965. Cancellation With the cancellation of the Martin characters and the farm plot, Lassie began a steady decline in ratings. Robert Bray's emotional problems and alcoholism brought about his departure from the series. According to dialogue coach Lloyd Nelson, > \\"Robert Bray left Lassie because of alcoholism. It was a very tragic > situation...It was so sad the way he allowed alcohol to take control of > him...The reshooting and looping he caused cost a lot of money, but nobody > wanted to run him off. We all understood he had personal problems, and for > years they gave him every chance to work them out.\\" Corey Stuart was last seen in \\"The Holocaust,\\" a two-part episode of the fifteenth season, (1968). There, he suffers serious injuries fighting a forest fire that require extensive treatments. Lassie meanwhile finds a home with two of Corey's co-workers Bob Erickson (Jack De Mave) and Scott Turner (Jed Allan). Both characters remained in the series as duo-human leads another season before disappearing without explanation. Lassie then saw a year alone before settling at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons. References *Jenkins, Henry. The Wow Climax:Tracing the Emotional Impact of Popular Culture.

The residents of the neighbourhood stated that militants had fired on soldiers nearby, which prompted the operation. Some of the villagers claimed that many women were raped by soldiers that night. The First information report filed in the police station after a visit by the local magistrate reported the number of women alleging rape as 23. However, Human Rights Watch asserts that this number could be between 23 and 100.\\"...reports that Indian armymen belonging to the 4th Rajputana Rifles of the 68 Mountain Division entered a settlement at Kunan Poshpora in Kupwara district on the night of February 23–24, 1991 and gangraped a minimum of 23 and a maximum of 100 women of all ages and in all conditions.\\" These allegations were denied by the army. The government determined that the evidence was not sufficient and issued a statement condemning the allegations as terrorist propaganda. While the Government's investigations into the incident rejected the allegations as 'baseless', International human rights organizations have expressed serious doubts about the integrity of these investigations and the manner in which they were conducted, Human Rights Watch stated that the government had launched a \\"campaign to acquit the army of charges of human rights violations and discredit those who brought the charges.\\" Incident The New York Times had quoted, the residents of the Kunan Poshpora neighbourhood stating that militants had fired on security forces nearby, which prompted the search operation by the forces. On February 23, 1991 The paramilitary troops of the Central Reserve Police Force and the Border Security Force cordoned off the twin villages of Kunan and Poshpora to conduct a search operation for the militants. The men in the village were assembled outside and interrogated about the militant activity while the village was searched. After the search operation was over, some of the villagers claimed that many women were allegedly raped by soldiers that night. Later on the local Islamic militant commander of the Hizbi Islami organization named Mushtaq ul-Islam gave an interview to the New York Times from a well-guarded hideout in the same neighborhood. His Islamic fundamentalist organization supported Kashmir to join Pakistan. His group had been broadcasting messages over loudspeakers, asking the security personnel to convert to Islam. The militant leader had denied that his group had fired first on the troops but claimed that his commandos were armed to fight the forces off. Investigations On 5 March, The villagers complained about the incident to the local magistrate S.M. Yasin. After visiting the village on 7th March, he filed his report that included the statement from 23 women alleging they have been raped. The report also raised questions about the discrepancies in the testimony of the women and suggested a more comprehensive investigation. The increased publicity about the incident in the national media led to strong denials from military officials. On 8 March 8, an FIR was registered at Trehgam police station, that mentioned 23 women were allegedly gangraped in Kunan and Poshpora. On March 17, Mufti Baha-ud-Din Farooqi, Chief Justice of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir, led a fact-finding delegation to Kunan Poshpora. Over the course of his investigation, he interviewed 53 women who alleged to have been raped by the soldiers, and tried to determine why a police investigation into the incident had never taken place. According to his report, villagers claimed that a police investigation into the event had never commenced because the officer assigned to the case, Assistant Superintendent Dilbaugh Singh, was on leave. Farooqi later stated that in this case normal investigative procedures were ignored.\\" Just a few months later, in July, 1991, Dilbaugh Singh was transferred to another station without ever having started the investigation. On March 18, Wajahat Habibullah, the divisional commissioner, after a visit to the village filed a report. Habibullah had found the complaint to be exaggerated but not unfounded. A certificate of good behaviour was given to the troops before departing from Kunan Poshpura, by the village headman known as lumbardar. The lumbardar had told Habibullah his unawareness of the alleged crimes against the women. Habibullah's report concluded that the veracity of the complaint was highly doubtful, but the reason for such a complaint should be investigated. The report recommended for further investigation by a gazetted police officer.\\" =Press Council of India= The government's investigation was criticized, subsequently the Press Council of India, a statutory & quasi-judicial body of the print media, appointed a committee for the investigation of the incident. The investigative committee visited Kunan Poshpora in June. Upon interviewing a number of the alleged victims, the team claimed that contradictions in their testimony rendered their allegations of rape \\"baseless.\\" A pediatrician who was a member of a citizen's group named as the Jammu and Kashmir People's Basic Rights Committee and had made the allegation that one of the women who had been pregnant at the time of the incident had given birth to a child with a fractured arm just four days later. The investigative committee interviewed the hospital officials and concluded that injuries like this may happen due to the efforts of doctors, who are trying to position the unborn fetus for a delivery. On March 15 and 21, Medical examinations were conducted on 32 of the women, confirmed presence of abrasions on their chests and abdomens, and three of the unmarried women had torn hymens. The team concluded that \\"such a delayed medical examination proves nothing\\" and that such abrasions are commonly found among villagers in Kashmir. The hymen can be torn due to natural factors, injury or pre marital sex In stark contrast of the purported allegations of abuses, these investigations concluded the allegations themselves are \\"grossly exaggerated or invented\\". The team concluded that the charges against the army were, \\"a massive hoax orchestrated by militant groups and their sympathizers and mentors in Kashmir and abroad as a part of sustained and cleverly contrived strategy of psychological warfare and as an entry point for reinscribing Kashmir on the International Agenda as a Human rights issue. The loose-ends and the contradictions in the story expose a tissue of lies by many persons at many levels\\". Following the release of the Press Council's report, government authorities dismissed all of the allegations of mass rape as groundless. In September, the case was declared \\"un-fit for launching criminal prosecution\\" and was closed after a month. =Criticism= The Press Council's dismissal of allegation was criticized by Human Rights Watch. It stated that although the results of the examinations failed to prove the charges of rape, they still raised questions on activity of the army in Kunan Poshpora. According to HRW, the committee had dismissed any evidence that may contradict the government version of events. The HRW report accused the committee of being more concerned about countering the criticism than uncovering truth. The United States Department of State, in its 1992 report on international human rights, stated that there was \\"credible evidence\\" that supports the mass rape charges against the army unit at Kunan Poshpora. =Litigation= In 2004, one of the alleged victims approached the J&K; State Human Rights Commission seeking a reinvestigation of the case. In 2007, more women approached the SHRC for reopening of the case. The villagers from the two villages formed Kunan- Poshpora Coordination Committee (KCC) headed by 70-year-old man Ghulam Ahmad Dar to seek justice for the victims. In October 2011, the Jammu & Kashmir Human Rights Commission asked the J&K; government to reinvestigate the alleged mass rape case and compensate the victims. In 2013, a writ petition was filed in Jammu and Kashmir High Court alleging that over 30 women were raped. The charges had not been proved and there had been no progress in trial. High Court observed that it hopes the committee appointed by the J&K; government would examine and quickly implement the recommendations of the SHRC. In December 2017, J&K; government approached the Supreme Court of India against various orders of the High Court. The top court directed that the appeals should be heard expeditiously. Social impact The Indian Express reported on July 21, 2013 that the victims and their families are being socially ostracised by other villagers in the locality. The only government school in the two affected villages teaches up to standard eight. The students going for higher education in the nearby Trehgam and Kupwara were taunted due to the incident and most of them choose to drop out after class eight. Families not involved in the incident at the same villages have disassociated socially with the victims' families. Villagers claimed that it was difficult to find grooms for their children.

Biography Joseph Barsalou was born in Agen in the south west of France. He came from a family of apothecaries that was originally from Narbonne. Joseph Barsalou received no formal medical training. His father handed down his knowledge of herbs and minerals. It is through his friendship with the Scaliger family that Joseph Barsalou gained access to the library of Julius Caesar Scaliger and his son Joseph Justus Scaliger. Julius Caesar Scaliger was a physician, philosopher and commentator of Aristotle. His son Josephus Justus Scaliger was a scholar, linguist and historian. Joseph Barsalou built on his traditional knowledge of herbs with an introduction to medicine and philosophy reading Galen, Aristotle and Pythagoras. Agen in the early 17th century was at the crossroads of the religious debate revolving around the new Protestant faith. The region favoured the Reformation. Nerac its neighbour and rival was the political and intellectual capital of French Protestants. The Edict of Nerac in 1579 had given the French Protestant 14 more protected towns and confirmed the Edict of Poitiers that recognised the religious rights of Protestants in France. Josephus Justus had been seduced by the Reformation and become one of its great scholars. Yet Joseph Barsalou's life took a different direction from his predecessor. Joseph Barsalou gravitated towards Avignon and Rome the centers of Roman Catholic Church. As a physician Joseph Barsalou treated people in and around the town of Agen. With the many political and religious battles being fought nearby the region was rife with disease: tuberculosis, typhus, scurvy and other fevers. Many physicians actually died from being in contact with the patients they treated. Joseph Barsalou survived. Locally his reputation was built as much on treating others as surviving the contact with so many instances of disease. It testified to his skills as a physician. Through his travels in the south of France he became acquainted with Philippe Jacques de Maussac, President of the Court of Montpellier. They remained close friends during their lives exchanging a number of letters. It is believed that it is Philippe Jacques de Maussac who introduced Joseph Barsalou to Antonio Barberini and the Italian leg of his journey. In 1640 Joseph Barsalou was asked to treat Antonio Barberini, nephew of Pope Urban VIII and the Legate of Avignon who suffered from a fever on a visit to Avignon in the south of France. As Antonio Barberini's health was restored, he insisted on keeping Barsalou as his personal physician and took him to Paris and Rome. During his time with Antonio Barberini, Barsalou was introduced to Charles Bouvard who had been physician of King Louis XIII of France and Superintendent of the Jardin du Roi in Paris the new medicinal garden of the king, now known as the Jardin des Plantes. Barsalou and Bouvard shared a common interest in medicine and herbal remedies. They exchanged ideas on recipes and treatments for a wide variety of conditions: tuberculosis, typhus, cholera and the plague. Yet Joseph Barsalou's position in Rome was dependent on the power of the Barberini family. In 1644 he was called to assist Urban VIII on his death bed. With the enthronement of the new Pope Innocent X, and the subsequent disgrace of Barberinis for corruption and nepotism Barsalou lost favour and had to leave the papal city. Between 1644 and 1649 Barsalou practiced in Florence, attending to the Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici. At the time Florence was a hub of modern experimental knowledge. Ferdinando II was a patron of science and a student of Galileo himself, and founded the Academy of Experimentation in 1642 and attracts the brightest minds of the time. Scientists working there at the time include Evangelista Torricelli, Vincenzo Viviani and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli. In 1650 he returned to Montpellier in France, where he took care of his lifelong friend Philippe Jacques de Maussac, who died that same year. Barsalou then went to Agen permanently and practiced in the region. He died in 1660.  His work  Barsalou's practice he combined the traditional knowledge and methods of his forefathers that has been enhanced through trial and error over generations and is influenced by Alchemical practice. He knew of the classical Greek medical texts, applying Galen's principles such as bloodletting. Later, he was stimulated to rethink his approach through his contact with the Florentine scientists and their modern experimental practice. During his years in Florence, Barsalou's ideas developed rapidly. He wrote to his friend Charles Bouvard about the experiments he carried out to create new elixirs. He tried to understand the healing properties of plants, minerals and metals. He perhaps found his inspiration in a broad range of ideas that circulate at the time, from the alchemical texts of Jabir to Fibonacci's work on numbers and Pythagorean principles amongst many others. In his letters he explained how he tried to understand the power of plants through numbers. Despite this, Joseph Barsalou was not an alchemist: there is no reference in his letters to a quest for the philosopher's stone or the transmutation of metal into gold. Apart from the letters to Charles Bouvard and de Maussac no compendium of his work survived him. A professional instinct for secrecy, maybe the fear of persecution from the Church or just the fact that many similar writings were perceived as alchemy and therefore often associated with charlatans, might have determined his decision not to write down the recipes of his elixirs, let alone publish his work.

They can be produced in materials in many ways, such as by a localized impact or by piezo-electric transduction, and are frequently used in non-destructive testing for detecting defects. Rayleigh waves are part of the seismic waves that are produced on the Earth by earthquakes. When guided in layers they are referred to as Lamb waves, Rayleigh–Lamb waves, or generalized Rayleigh waves.  Characteristics  Picture of a Rayleigh wave. Comparison of the Rayleigh wave speed with shear and longitudinal wave speeds for an isotropic elastic material. The speeds are shown in dimensionless units. Rayleigh waves are a type of surface wave that travel near the surface of solids. Rayleigh waves include both longitudinal and transverse motions that decrease exponentially in amplitude as distance from the surface increases. There is a phase difference between these component motions. The existence of Rayleigh waves was predicted in 1885 by Lord Rayleigh, after whom they were named.http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s1-17/1/4.full.pdf \\"On Waves Propagated along the Plane Surface of an ElasticSolid\\", Lord Rayleigh, 1885 In isotropic solids these waves cause the surface particles to move in ellipses in planes normal to the surface and parallel to the direction of propagation – the major axis of the ellipse is vertical. At the surface and at shallow depths this motion is retrograde, that is the in-plane motion of a particle is counterclockwise when the wave travels from left to right. At greater depths the particle motion becomes prograde. In addition, the motion amplitude decays and the eccentricity changes as the depth into the material increases. The depth of significant displacement in the solid is approximately equal to the acoustic wavelength. Rayleigh waves are distinct from other types of surface or guided acoustic waves such as Love waves or Lamb waves, both being types of guided waves supported by a layer, or longitudinal and shear waves, that travel in the bulk. Rayleigh waves have a speed slightly less than shear waves by a factor dependent on the elastic constants of the material. The typical speed of Rayleigh waves in metals is of the order of 2–5 km/s, and the typical Rayleigh speed in the ground is of the order of 50–300 m/s for shallow waves less than 100-m depth and 1.5-4 km/s at depths greater than 1 km. Since Rayleigh waves are confined near the surface, their in-plane amplitude when generated by a point source decays only as {1}/{\\\\sqrt{r}}, where r is the radial distance. Surface waves therefore decay more slowly with distance than do bulk waves, which spread out in three dimensions from a point source. This slow decay is one reason why they are of particular interest to seismologists. Rayleigh waves can circle the globe multiple times after a large earthquake and still be measurably large. There is a difference in the behavior (Rayleigh wave velocity, displacements, trajectories of the particle motion, stresses) of Rayleigh surface waves with positive and negative Poisson's ratio. In seismology, Rayleigh waves (called \\"ground roll\\") are the most important type of surface wave, and can be produced (apart from earthquakes), for example, by ocean waves, by explosions, by railway trains and ground vehicles, or by a sledgehammer impact. = Rayleigh wave speed and dispersion = Dispersion of Rayleigh waves in a thin gold film on glass. In isotropic, linear elastic materials described by Lamé parameters \\\\lambda and \\\\mu , Rayleigh waves have a speed given by solutions to the equation : \\\\zeta^3 -8 \\\\zeta^2 + 8 \\\\zeta (3-2\\\\eta) - 16 (1-\\\\eta) = 0, where \\\\zeta = \\\\omega^2 / k^2 \\\\beta^2 , \\\\eta = \\\\beta^2/\\\\alpha^2, \\\\rho \\\\alpha^2 = \\\\lambda + 2 \\\\mu , and \\\\rho \\\\beta^2 = \\\\mu . Since this equation has no inherent scale, the boundary value problem giving rise to Rayleigh waves are dispersionless. An interesting special case is the Poisson solid, for which \\\\lambda = \\\\mu, since this gives a frequency-independent phase velocity equal to \\\\omega/k = \\\\beta \\\\sqrt{0.8453}. For linear elastic materials with positive Poisson ratio ( u > 0.3), the Rayleigh wave speed can be approximated as c_R = c_S \\\\frac{0.862 + 1.14 u}{1+ u}, where c_S is the shear-wave velocity. The elastic constants often change with depth, due to the changing properties of the material. This means that the velocity of a Rayleigh wave in practice becomes dependent on the wavelength (and therefore frequency), a phenomenon referred to as dispersion. Waves affected by dispersion have a different wave train shape. Rayleigh waves on ideal, homogeneous and flat elastic solids show no dispersion, as stated above. However, if a solid or structure has a density or sound velocity that varies with depth, Rayleigh waves become dispersive. One example is Rayleigh waves on the Earth's surface: those waves with a higher frequency travel more slowly than those with a lower frequency. This occurs because a Rayleigh wave of lower frequency has a relatively long wavelength. The displacement of long wavelength waves penetrates more deeply into the Earth than short wavelength waves. Since the speed of waves in the Earth increases with increasing depth, the longer wavelength (low frequency) waves can travel faster than the shorter wavelength (high frequency) waves. Rayleigh waves thus often appear spread out on seismograms recorded at distant earthquake recording stations. It is also possible to observe Rayleigh wave dispersion in thin films or multi-layered structures. Rayleigh waves in non- destructive testing Rayleigh waves are widely used for materials characterization, to discover the mechanical and structural properties of the object being tested – like the presence of cracking, and the related shear modulus. This is in common with other types of surface waves. The Rayleigh waves used for this purpose are in the ultrasonic frequency range. They are used at different length scales because they are easily generated and detected on the free surface of solid objects. Since they are confined in the vicinity of the free surface within a depth (~ the wavelength) linked to the frequency of the wave, different frequencies can be used for characterization at different length scales. Rayleigh waves in electronic devices Rayleigh waves propagating at high ultrasonic frequencies (10–1000 MHz) are used widely in different electronic devices. In addition to Rayleigh waves, some other types of surface acoustic waves (SAW), e.g. Love waves, are also used for this purpose. Examples of electronic devices using Rayleigh waves are filters, resonators, oscillators, sensors of pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. Operation of SAW devices is based on the transformation of the initial electric signal into a surface wave that, after achieving the required changes to the spectrum of the initial electric signal as a result of its interaction with different types of surface inhomogeneity, is transformed back into a modified electric signal. The transformation of the initial electric energy into mechanical energy (in the form of SAW) and back is usually accomplished via the use of piezoelectric materials for both generation and reception of Rayleigh waves as well as for their propagation.  Rayleigh waves in geophysics  Rayleigh waves from earthquakes= Because Rayleigh waves are surface waves, the amplitude of such waves generated by an earthquake generally decreases exponentially with the depth of the hypocenter (focus). However, large earthquakes may generate Rayleigh waves that travel around the Earth several times before dissipating. In seismology longitudinal and shear waves are known as P-waves and S-waves, respectively, and are termed body waves. Rayleigh waves are generated by the interaction of P- and S- waves at the surface of the earth, and travel with a velocity that is lower than the P-, S-, and Love wave velocities. Rayleigh waves emanating outward from the epicenter of an earthquake travel along the surface of the earth at about 10 times the speed of sound in air (0.340 km/s), that is ~3 km/s. Due to their higher speed, the P- and S-waves generated by an earthquake arrive before the surface waves. However, the particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so the surface waves tend to cause more damage. In the case of Rayleigh waves, the motion is of a rolling nature, similar to an ocean surface wave. The intensity of Rayleigh wave shaking at a particular location is dependent on several factors: Rayleigh wave direction * The size of the earthquake. * The distance to the earthquake. * The depth of the earthquake. * The geologic structure of the crust. * The focal mechanism of the earthquake. * The rupture directivity of the earthquake. Local geologic structure can serve to focus or defocus Rayleigh waves, leading to significant differences in shaking over short distances. =Rayleigh waves in seismology= Low frequency Rayleigh waves generated during earthquakes are used in seismology to characterise the Earth's interior. In intermediate ranges, Rayleigh waves are used in geophysics and geotechnical engineering for the characterisation of oil deposits. These applications are based on the geometric dispersion of Rayleigh waves and on the solution of an inverse problem on the basis of seismic data collected on the ground surface using active sources (falling weights, hammers or small explosions, for example) or by recording microtremors. Rayleigh ground waves are important also for environmental noise and vibration control since they make a major contribution to traffic-induced ground vibrations and the associated structure-borne noise in buildings.  Possible animal reaction  Low frequency (< 20 Hz) Rayleigh waves are inaudible, yet they can be detected by many mammals, birds, insects and spiders. Humans should be able to detect such Rayleigh waves through their Pacinian corpuscles, which are in the joints, although people do not seem to consciously respond to the signals. Some animals seem to use Rayleigh waves to communicate. In particular, some biologists theorize that elephants may use vocalizations to generate Rayleigh waves. Since Rayleigh waves decay slowly, they should be detectable over long distances. Note that these Rayleigh waves have a much higher frequency than Rayleigh waves generated by earthquakes. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, some people have speculated that Rayleigh waves served as a warning to animals to seek higher ground, allowing them to escape the more slowly traveling tsunami. At this time, evidence for this is mostly anecdotal. Other animal early warning systems may rely on an ability to sense infrasonic waves traveling through the air.

It has a great reputation for being a progressive, family-oriented club as well as being one of Leinster’s fastest growing. The club is known across Ireland as ‘Clon’ or ‘CRFC’, and its grounds are located at Gordon Park, Kingswood Cross, Clondalkin, D22 EN24. The club colours are yellow and blue and these colours feature on the club's crest which also includes a round tower, in reference to the 8th century tower located in Clondalkin village.  History  Clondalkin RFC was founded in 1973 by a group of rugby enthusiasts in this rapidly expanding area of Dublin. Their first game was against Old Kilcullen RFC and the outing confirmed that the potential existed for a rugby club in Clondalkin, so the club was formed and affiliated to the Leinster Branch. For the first five years, the club was based at Moyle Park College, one of the largest secondary schools in Clondalkin and the club adopted the school's colours as an acknowledgement of the support it received from the school in its formative years. Gradually, the club began to expand, the number of teams in the club grew and a junior section was established. To cater for this expansion, the club purchased the grounds where it now resides at Kingswood Cross, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the committee and club members, and the invaluable support of local businesses and the community. Instrumental in the move was a local bank manager and club member, Paddy Gordon, after whom the grounds are named.  Present Day  ‘Clon’ currently has three senior men's teams, a senior women's team and a thriving youth and mini section featuring players from the ages of 5 up to 16 - boys and girls. The senior men's first team compete in Leinster League (J1) Division 1B, the second highest division in Leinster junior rugby while the senior women's team compete in Division 2. Many current and former senior players now help to coach the youth and mini teams, developing the Clon stars of the future. Current Leinster star, James Lowe is a friend of, and regular visitor to, the club and gives tremendous encouragement to the club's young players.

It was originally written for string quartet and named simply \\"Serenade in G major\\". By April 1890, he was referring to it in his letters as Italian Serenade. In 1892, he arranged it for string orchestra. It is one of his few works other than Lieder. The work was written between 2 and 4 May 1887. One of its inspirations was his concurrent work on setting various poems by Joseph Eichendorff to music, and the first of them \\"Der Soldat I\\" has a theme that is similar to that of the Serenade. That poem's subject is similar to that of Eichendorff's novella Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts (From the Life of a Ne'er-Do-Well), and it may be that Wolf was as much influenced by this work as he was by the poem. The novella includes a section about an Italian serenade played by a small orchestra. The hero of the novella is a young violinist who leaves home to seek his fortune further afield, and this could well have been something that Wolf could relate to. It was originally planned as part of a work in three movements. However, Wolf later abandoned this plan in favor of a self-contained, one-movement work.Diabo Regional Arts Association His father died only a week after he wrote the Italian Serenade, and he wrote no more music for the remainder of 1887. When Wolf orchestrated the work in 1892, he was intending it as the first movement of a four-movement suite. He did sketch a slow movement in G minor, but never finished it. In his letters, he mentions another movement that he claimed to have completed, but that score has never come to light, only 45 measures of sketches being extant. In 1897, he sketched a few pages of a Tarantella to complete the suite, but he was committed to an insane asylum before he could finish it. In summary, all that remains of the projected suite is the Italian Serenade. Throughout his time in the asylum, where he remained for the rest of his life, he planned to complete the suite, but this never eventuated. Wolf died in February 1903. The Italian Serenade is quite short, taking only about 7 minutes, and has a lilting and varied theme, played over a pizzicato figure.amazon.com The main theme is said to have been based on an old Italian melody played on an obsolete form of oboe called the piffero. Its lively and optimistic manner is an evocation of the Italianate spirit, realised through melodic richness.Hyperion: Favourite Encores for String Quartet Robert W. Gutman has written that \\"The essence of the delicious Italian Serenade is its antithesis of romantic sentiment and mocking wit\\".Richmond Symphony Its first performance was in Vienna in January 1904, eleven months after Wolf's death. Both the original string quartet version and the orchestral version were played at the premiere. The Italian Serenade has been recorded many times; it is a favourite encore piece for string quartets, and it has been arranged by other hands for combinations of instruments such as a wind quintetScore Exchange and solo viola and orchestra.Schubertiade in Cincinnati ReferencesExternal links * The Kennedy Center * marbecks.co.nz * Music@Menlo 2008 * Italian Serenade sheet music: arrangement for string quartet * Ayryn Quartet, YouTube * Feguš Quartet, YouTube * The Doric String Quartet ,YouTube Category:Compositions for string quartet Category:Compositions for string orchestra Category:Compositions by Hugo Wolf Category:1887 compositions Category:Serenades ","title":"Italian Serenade (Wolf)"},{"id":"20756040","text":"The Research Centre for DNA Diagnostics (RCDD) is a medical research facility at Karnatak University, Dharwar, Karnataka, India.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The Manor of Parwich was owned by the Cockaynes of Ashbourne until they sold it in about 1603 to Thomas Levinge of Norfolk. His great grandson, Richard Levinge, was Speaker of the House of Commons in Ireland and became the first of the Levinge Baronets. His son the second Baronet replaced the old manor house with the present brick and limestone mansion house in 1747. The entrance front has three storeys and five bays, symmetrical around the slightly advanced and pedimented central bay. A three-bayed service wing was added to the west in 1905 and raised to three storeys in 1930. The Levinge family seat was moved to Westmeath in Ireland and the house was let out and in 1814 was sold to William Evans of Allestree Hall. During part of the time of Evans' ownership the house was occupied by the vicar Rev Carr, a relative of Evans. After the death of Sir Thomas Evans in 1892, another clerical descendant, Rev Claud Lewis, had the use of the house. The house was sold in 1915 and again in 1931 when it was acquired by the Inglefield (later Crompton-Inglefield) family. John Frederick Crompton-Inglefield was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1938. It later became the home of the Shields family.

Batman Park is a small open grassed space with paths and planted Eucalyptus trees bordered by Spencer Street at the west, Flinders Street Viaduct at the north and King Street to the east. The park was established in 1982 through the conversion of a disused freight train rail yard and was named after one of the founders of Melbourne, John Batman with historical associations as a landing place of the Schooner Rebecca and nearby settlement at Batman's Hill. In 1997 Batman Park was effectively split in half with the section east of King Street rebranded as Enterprize Park. Much of the land on the new park was reclaimed to recreate a historical 1850s turning basin and timber wharf with sculptures by Bruce Armstrong and Geoffrey Bartlett recalling the site's maritime history. Enterprize park also became the site of the Melbourne Aquarium. History The site was originally part of the Wurundjeri nation's territory prior to European settlement. At this time the site was part of extensive riverside wetlands. After settlement the area was used as a dumping ground for waste and discharge for sewerage and storm water, destroying the wetlands and turning the site from diverse riverside wetlands to smelly muddy swampland. Throughout the 19th century the main port of Melbourne, today known as the Turning Basin, directly east of the park, dictated the use of the surrounding land for cargo facilities and rail yards. In the late 19th century more substantial wharfs and docks were constructed in deepened waters downstream, abandoning the cargo facilities and rail yards at the site. The site remained largely disused throughout much of the mid 20th century until the park was established in 1982. The park was home to Ron Robertson-Swann's Vault sculpture, commonly nicknamed the \\"Yellow Peril\\", which was relocated several times throughout the 1980s and 90s. The sculpture has resided at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art since 2002.EMelbourne.net.au In 1997 the original turning basin, which had been filled in during the 1950s, was reinstated, and the portion of Batman Park to the east of Kings Bridge was renamed Enterprize Park after the schooner which landed at the site in 1835. Detail of the pigeon loft. In 2006 a pigeon loft was built in the north-east corner of the park to encourage pigeons to roost away from the city buildings and streets. Council were particularly concerned about pigeon droppings eroding the facades of historical buildings. Eggs laid in the loft were replaced with dummy eggs for the pigeons to incubate. However, the loft proved to be unsuccessful at attracting pigeons and was removed nine years later in 2015. In 1999, the Melbourne Aquarium was built directly east of the park, at the western end of Enterprize Park. The park has survived development while surrounding sites have not, construction of residential apartments has begun on the former Fish Market site to the north of the park opposite the Flinders Street Viaduct, which had formally been proposed as an extension of Batman Park. Location, Geography and Ecology Batman Park, looking west from Kings Way showing the pigeon loft. The park is located on the northern bank of the Yarra river between Queens Street and Kings Way. Its northern boundary is bordered by the Flinders Street Viaduct which was constructed around the same time the park was founded, the viaduct separated the park from the former Fish Markets which is currently the site of new apartment buildings. The park sits on an almost flat section of the riverbank that very occasionally floods. Prior to the construction of the Upper Yarra Dam, the site flooded more regularly, depositing silt and soil, creating swamp and wetlands. Current vegetation in the park consists of sparse maturing eucalypts with no understorey or saplings. The ground is covered by non-native grasses, creating vast lawns which are intersected by a basic network of sealed paths.

Despite his nominal leadership, the real power lay with his mother Caterina Sforza. Early life He was the oldest son of Girolamo Riario, a nephew of Pope Sixtus IV who had obtained possessions in Italy thanks to the pontiff's patronage, and Caterina Sforza. After his father's murder, he was created lord of Imola and Forlì in July 1488 by Pope Innocent VIII, under the regency of his mother. Despite his official status, the nine- year-old Ottaviano was, in reality, controlled by his domineering mother and her lover Giacomo Feo. When Feo humiliated Ottaviano in public by slapping him, his nominal courtiers did nothing to support him. After this episode, the situation in Forlì became very strained. Ottaviano's friends plotted to use the episode as an excuse to \\"liberate\\" the city from the rule of Giacomo Feo by assassinating him. The first attempt in 1490 failed. Five years later, on August 27, 1495, Feo was ambushed and killed. The fifteen-year-old Ottaviano was not involved. Later lordship Feo's death did not diminish the power of Ottaviano's mother, who continued to make decisions on his behalf. Ottaviano was employed twice by the Florentines as a condottiero to defend Florentine interests. He was offered 15,000 florins in 1497 and 10,000 in 1499. Niccolò Machiavelli undertook negotiations on the second occasion. Ottaviano was still only the nominal leader, as the actual negotiations were conducted with Caterina. However, Ottaviano personally commanded small forces in these local wars. In 1498 he took part in the siege of Pisa with 100 men-at-arms and 100 light horse. In 1499 he aided Ludovico Sforza, who was at war with the French and Venetians. At this point the Borgias decided to intervene. Pope Alexander VI sent his son Cesare Borgia to capture Imola and Forlì, claiming that dues had not been paid. Caterina and Ottaviano were deposed in January 1500. After Alexander's death Ottaviano made several attempts to recapture his territories, but was unable to muster sufficient forces to achieve his goal. Church career Ottaviano later entered the church. On September 16, 1506 he was elected bishop of Viterbo and he remained in that position until his death in 1523.

The only surviving example of resort facilities in the region, it recalls the popularity of the region as the vacationland for the middle class in the late nineteenth century. The Inn was built for a group of 11 investors calling themselves The Newfoundland Health Association headed by Dr Edgar DayDr Edgar Day -- Listed Physician, Brooklyn Medical Journal Vol XVI No. 5 May 1902 from Brooklyn, NY. Idylease is situated on the summit of an -hill in the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains and is located 30 miles northwest from New York City.  History  Work began on Idylease in summer of 1900 and opened its doors on New Year's Day in 1902. Architecturally, Idylease Inn embodies a variety of distinctive characteristics commonly associated with this type of resort architecture in this region at the turn of the century. On the exterior the most salient features associated with this type are the broad veranda and second story balcony which deteriorated and was removed sometime during the 1930s. Expansive porches and open air-balconies were an essential feature of the resort hotel, providing guests with vistas of the surrounding wilderness and pleasant public spaces for social gatherings. Verandas also served as sanitary and therapeutic retreats from which to enjoy the \\"healthful and moral atmosphere of nature, reflecting the popularity of resorts not only for pleasure and recreational activity but also for escapes from the crowded, disease ridden and immoral conditions of the suddenly industrialized cities of the northeast.\\"  The Newfoundland Health Association  Dr. Day founded The Newfoundland Village Improvement Society in 1902 which was formed to \\"protect the interest of the residents and property holders of Newfoundland, New Jersey improve the conditions of the roads, secure better railroad service, and in general do whatever shall tend to increase the beauty and attractiveness of our village and its surroundings.\\" Dr Day remained president of the society until his death at Idylease in 1906. Dr. Daniel Drake who was the resident physician and general manager of Idylease at the time of Dr. Days death became the principal stock holder of the Newfoundland Health Association which owned Idylease. George A. Day, Dr. Drakes brother was appointed assistant manager. In 1954 a doctor from Jersey City, NJ purchased Idylease from the Newfoundland, Health Association. Arthur Zampella, MD purchased Idylease Inn from the estate of Dr. Daniel Drake and converted the Inn into the Idylease Nursing Home. Idylease Nursing Home maintained a staff of 11 doctors and employed 65 people. Idylease Nursing home closed in 1972 and subsequently became a congregate living facility. Dr. Zampella died in January 1992 and is buried in the Newfoundland cemetery. Dr. Daniel Drake, is also interred there as well. On April 11, 2016 Film Producer Richard Zampella, the son of Dr. Arthur Zampella purchased Idylease. Noted guests Thomas Edison was a regular guest of Idylease while working on a magnetic ore extracting device at the Franklin/Odgensberg MineFranklin/Ogdensberg Mine for the New Jersey Zinc Company . F. Fichter Hoagan, a longtime business manager to previous owner Dr. Daniel Drake often reminisced of the days when “Mr. Edison would stay overnight at Idylease while traveling to the mine. Newfoundland marked the half way point from Edison’s laboratories in East Orange. He would spend the night at Idylease and have his car serviced at the local garage”. Edison was no stranger to the area. He had filmed scenes from The Great Train Robbery (film) in Echo Lake and was known to fish along the banks of the Pequannock River. Mary Teresa Norton (March 7, 1875 – August 2, 1959) was an American politician. The sixth woman in the United States Congress, she was the first from an Eastern state (New Jersey), and the first non-Republican (she was a Democrat). She went on to serve an unprecedented 13 consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1925 to 1951, and chaired four committees. She was a labor advocate and a supporter of women's rights. During the late 1920s Ms.Norton was a regular guest at Idylease. The Plaza Hotel Fountain: Pomona Priscilla Smith was a five-year resident of Idylease during the latter part of the 1960s. As a young girl, Priscilla was a glamorous model whose fun loving and explosive personality and blazing bohemian beauty befuddled and charmed some of the greatest artists of the postwar world. She spent the final years of her life at Idylease. Priscilla will be best remembered as the favored model of Austrian Artist Karl Bitter, and was the artist's model for the statue atop the Pulitzer Fountain opposite the Plaza Hotel located on southern half of Grand Army Plaza in New York City. Bitter’s bronze sculpture represents Pomona, the Roman goddess of abundance. Smith, the artist’s model was a shy 19-year-old girl from Queens, New York when she was personally chosen by Bitter as the model for Pomona because of her striking features and reserved demeanor. Although familiar with virtually all games in the realm of sports, William B. Hanna (1862–1930) specialized in sports writing in baseball and football. He was brought up in Kansas City and began his newspaper career with the Kansas \\"Star\\" but came to New York in 1888, joining the staff of the New York, \\"Herald.\\" He is widely considered one of the most noted sports writers of the period. His style was noted for his eschewing of slang such as \\"swat, pill, horsehide\\", etc. His choice of words were those less chosen, terse, precise, kind. His style was succinct, his knowledge encyclopedic. He always signed his copy, William B. Hanna, and became upset if anyone changed it.

He was a founder member of the Société archéologique et historique d'Ille-et-Vilaine, of which he was president from 1863 to 1890. Gaining recognition for his innumerable works on the history of Brittany, he enlivened research in many areas and inspired many historians by his influence and example. He was the director of the historic review Revue de Bretagne et Vendée (published from 1867 to 1900) that he founded aged 25. He had been elected conseiller général of Ille-et-Vilaine from 1864 to 1871 then, the same year, député for Vitré, until 1876. In this role he was reporter of the Commission d'enquête sur les actes du gouvernement de la défense nationale (Commission of Inquiry into the Acts of the Government of National Defence). In particular he led the investigation into events at Camp Conlie where 50,000 Breton soldiers were held and supposedly mistreated in 1871. His report was overwhelmingly critical of the French army, which demonstrated a total lack of organization. In the years after the Franco-Prussian War he re-formed the Association bretonne which had been dissolved as suspect by the government of Napoléon III. A large part of his library is now in the town library of Rennes, while the huge collection of original documents which he amassed is now housed in the departmental archives of Ille-et-Vilaine.

It is commonly applied in the research field of optical spectroscopy on superconductors. It was derived to explain the anomalous skin effect of superconductors. Originally, the anomalous skin effect indicates the non-classical response of metals to high frequency electromagnetic field in low temperature, which was solved by Robert G. Chambers. At sufficiently low temperatures and high frequencies, the classically predicted skin depth (normal skin effect) fails because of the enhancement of the mean free path of the electrons in a good metal. Not only the normal metals, but superconductors also show the anomalous skin effect which has to be considered with the theory of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS).  Response to an electromagnetic wave  The most clear fact the BCS theory gives is the presence of the pairing of two electrons (Cooper pair). After the transition to the superconducting state, the superconducting gap 2Δ in the single-particle density of states arises, and the dispersion relation can be described like the one of a semiconductor with band gap 2Δ around the Fermi energy. From the Fermi golden rule, the transition probabilities can be written as : \\\\alpha_s = \\\\int {\\\\left M_s \\\\right^2 N_s (E)N_s (E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega ) \\\\times [f(E) - f(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )]{\\\\rm{ }}} dE where N_s is the density of states. And M_s is the matrix element of an interaction Hamiltonian H_1 where : H_1 = \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k\\\\sigma ,k'\\\\sigma '} {B_{k'\\\\sigma ',k\\\\sigma } c_{k'\\\\sigma '}^* } c_{k'\\\\sigma '} In the superconducting state, each term of the Hamiltonian is dependent, because of the superconducting state consists of a phase-coherent superposition of occupied one-electron states, whereas it is independent in the normal state. Therefore, there appear interference terms in the absolute square of the matrix element. The result of the coherence changes the matrix element M_s into the matrix element M of single electron and the coherence factors F(Δ,E,E'). : F(\\\\Delta ,E,E') = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(1 \\\\pm \\\\frac\\\\right) Then, the transition rate is : \\\\alpha _s = \\\\int {\\\\left M \\\\right^2 F(\\\\Delta ,E,E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )N_s (E)N_s (E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega ) \\\\times [f(E) - f(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )]{\\\\rm{ }}} dE where the transition rate can be translated to real part of the complex conductivity, \\\\sigma_1, because the electrodynamic energy absorption is proportional to the \\\\sigma _1 E^2. : \\\\frac = \\\\frac{{\\\\sigma _{1s} }} In finite temperature condition, the response of electrons due to the incident electromagnetic wave can be regarded as two parts, the “superconducting” and “normal” electrons. The first one corresponds to the superconducting ground state and the next to the thermally excited electrons from the ground state. This picture is the so-called \\"two-fluid\\" model. If we consider the “normal” electrons, the ratio of the optical conductivity to the one of the normal state is : \\\\frac = \\\\frac{2} \\\\int_\\\\Delta ^\\\\infty {\\\\frac{{\\\\left {{\\\\text{E(E + }}\\\\hbar \\\\omega {\\\\text{)}} + \\\\Delta ^2 } \\\\right[f(E) - f(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )]}} {{(E^2 - \\\\Delta ^2 )^{1/2} [(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )^2 - \\\\Delta ^2 ]^{1/2} }}dE} {\\\\text{ + }}\\\\frac{1} \\\\int_{\\\\Delta - \\\\hbar \\\\omega }^{ - \\\\Delta } {\\\\frac{{\\\\left {{\\\\text{E(E + }}\\\\hbar \\\\omega {\\\\text{)}} + \\\\Delta ^2 } \\\\right[1 - 2f(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )]}} {{(E^2 - \\\\Delta ^2 )^{1/2} [(E + \\\\hbar \\\\omega )^2 - \\\\Delta ^2 ]^{1/2} }}dE} The first term of the upper equation is the contribution of \\"normal\\" electrons, and the second term is due to the superconducting electrons.  Use in optical study  The calculated optical conductivity breaks the sum rule that the spectral weight should be conserved through the transition. This result implies that the missing area of the spectral weight is concentrated in the zero frequency limit, corresponding to the dirac delta function (which covers the conduction of the superconducting condensate, i.e. the Cooper pairs). Many experimental data supports the prediction. This story on electrodynamics of superconductivity is the starting point of optical study. Because any superconducting Tc never exceeds 200K and the superconducting gap value is about the 3.5 kBT, microwave or far-infrared spectroscopy is suitable technique applying this theory. With the Mattis–Bardeen theory, we can derive fruitful properties of superconducting gap, like gap symmetry. ReferencesFurther reading *Michael Tinkham, Introduction to Superconductivity.

Although Yí is often translated as \\"barbarian\\", other translations of this term in English include \\"foreigners\\", \\"ordinary others\\" Liu believes the Chinese in early China did not originally think of Yi as a derogatory term. \\"wild tribes\\", and \\"uncivilised tribes\\". The Hua–Yi distinction asserted Chinese superiority, but implied that outsiders could become Hua by adopting Chinese values and customs. Historical context Zhou dynasty cosmography of Huaxia and the Siyi. Ancient China was composed of a group of states that arose in the Yellow River valley. According to historian Li Feng, during the Zhou dynasty (), the contrast between the 'Chinese' Zhou and the 'non-Chinese' Xirong or Dongyi was \\"more political than cultural or ethnic\\".. Li explains that \\"Rong\\" meant something like \\"warlike foreigners\\" and \\"Yi\\" was close to \\"foreign conquerables\\". Lothar von Falkenhausen argues that the perceived contrast between \\"Chinese\\" and \\"Barbarians\\" was accentuated during the Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE), when adherence to Zhou rituals became increasingly recognised as a \\"barometer of civilisation\\"; a meter for sophistication and cultural refinement. It is widely agreed by historians that the distinction between the Huà and the Yí emerged during that period. Gideon Shelach claimed that Chinese texts tended to overstate the distinction between the Chinese and their northern neighbours, ignoring many intergroup similarities. He doubted the existence of the Hua–Yi distinction. Nicola di Cosmo doubted the existence of a strong demarcation between the \\"Zhou Universe\\" and \\"a discrete, 'barbarian', non-Zhou universe\\" and claimed that Chinese historian Sima Qian popularised this concept, writing of the \\"chasm that had 'always' existed between China – the Hua-Hsia [Huaxia] people – and the various alien groups inhabiting the north.\\" The conclusion of the Warring States period brought the first unified Chinese state—established by the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE—who established the imperial system and forcibly standardized the traditional Chinese script, leading to the first of the distinctions between the 'refined' Huà and the increasingly marginalised Yí. The Han dynasty (221 BCE–206 CE) further contributed to the divide with its creation of a persistent Han ethnocultural identity. The Han Chinese civilisation influenced neighbouring states Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand and other Asian countries. Although Han Chinese superiority had only been sporadically reinforced by displays of Chinese military power, their Sinocentric system treated these countries as vassals of the emperor of China, literally \\"the Son of Heaven\\" (), who was in possession of the Mandate of Heaven (), the divine right to rule. Areas outside Sinocentric influence and the divine rule of the Emperor were considered to consist of uncivilised lands inhabited by barbarians. Throughout history, Chinese frontiers had been periodically attacked by nomadic tribes from the north and west. These people were considered barbarians by the Chinese who believed themselves to be more refined and who had begun to build cities and live an urban life based on agriculture. It was in consideration of how best to deal with this threat that the philosopher, Confucius (551–479 BCE) was prompted to formulate principles for relationships with the barbarians, briefly recorded in two of his Analects. Although China had been trading goods to and from Europeans for centuries, it was not until the arrival of the industrialised European trade and colonialism in the 18th and 19th centuries that exposed Chinese civilisation to technological developments that had long outstripped China's. As such, Chinese society was forced to undergo a modification of its traditional views of its relationships with \\"barbarians\\", and in particular could no longer regard all foreigners as objectively inferior. China Confucius lived during a time of war between Chinese states. He regarded people who did not respect the confucian value of \\"li\\" () as \\"barbarians\\", as he believed the workings of a civilised state should be founded on ethical conduct, which he said must stem from . Confucius argued that a state founded on the relatively cruel social codes of conquest and warlordism was barbaric in contrast to one founded on the principles of stately righteousness. In the Ames and Rosemont translation of Analect 3.5, Confucius said, \\"The Yí () and Dī () barbarian tribes with rulers are not as viable as the various Chinese states without them.\\" The Disposition of Error, a fifth-century tract defending Buddhism, notes that when Confucius was threatening to take residence among the nine barbarian states () he said, \\"If a gentleman-scholar dwells in their midst, what baseness can there be among them?\\"\\"The Disposition of Error (c. 5th Century BCE)\\" City University of New York. Retrieved 11 Jan 2009 An alternate translation of the philosopher's Analect 9.14 is, \\"Someone said: 'They are vulgar. What can you do about them?' The Master said: 'A gentleman used to live there. How could they be vulgar?'\\" In both translations, the author is shown to believe in the superiority of the Huá culture over that of the Yí (barbarians). The prominent Shuowen Jiezi character dictionary (121 CE) defines yí as \\"level; peaceful\\" or \\"people of eastern regions\\" and does not attempt to marginalise them. This implies that the Hua-Yi distinction was not universally held. =Zhou Dynasty= The Bamboo Annals record that the founder of Zhou, King Wu of Zhou \\"led the lords of the western barbarians\\" on a journey to conquer the Shang dynasty and while Duke Huan of Qi called upon the various Chinese states to fight the barbarian invasion and uphold the dynasty of the King of Shang; the Duke's defence of the Shang was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the creation of the Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou would later contribute as much as the Shang to the Huá–Yí distinction. Not all Zhou regarded the Hua–Yi distinction as a cultural barrier that needed to be overcome to 'purify' China. Zhou philosopher Mencius believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus, followed by both Hua and Yi people- \\"Shun was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. King Wen was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand li apart, and there were a thousand years between them. Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally. The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical.\\" =Jin Dynasty= In order to alleviate the shortages of labour caused by the Three Kingdoms wars, the Jin allowed millions of non-Chinese, Yi people to reside in Jin territory. Many officials opposed this decision in the name of the Hua–Yi distinction, claiming that if the barbarians did not identify with the Huaxia, they would conspire to destroy the empire. =Wu Hu uprising= During the Uprising of the Five Barbarians () and ravaging of North China that occurred around 310 CE, the Jin dynasty and other Chinese appealed to entrenched beliefs in the Hua–Yi distinction when calling for resistance to the Wu Hu invasion and the Yi they represented.Li and Zheng 2001, 387–389 The historians of the Southern dynasties, who were all Han Chinese, portrayed the Wu Hu as barbaric. Ran Min's order to kill the barbarians In 349 or 350 CE (disputed), the Han general Ran Min (冉閔) seized power from the last emperor of the Zhao and encouraged the Han Chinese to slaughter the Jie people, many of whom lived in the Zhao capital of Ye. In this massacre and the wars that ensued, hundreds of thousands of Jie (羯), Qiang (羌), and Xiongnu (匈奴) were killed. The \\"five barbarians\\" quickly unified to fight Ran Min, yet Ran Min won victory after victory. Despite his military success, however, Ran's regime was toppled in 353 CE. As a result of this period of turbulence, three of the five main \\"barbarian\\" ethnic groups in China disappeared from Chinese history. Ran Min continues to be a controversial figure. He is considered by some to be a hero, whereas others believe he bore extreme prejudice arising from the Hua–Yi distinction. =Northern Wei= Emperor Shaowu of Northern Wei (a state that controlled the north of China), who was of the Xianbei (鮮卑) people attempted to eliminate Yi from his state by imposing Sinicisation on his people. The Xianbei language was outlawed and Xianbei people began to adopt Chinese surnames; for example, the Tuobas became the Yuans. =Sui Dynasty= In 581, Sui Emperor Yang Jian deposed the Xianbei ruler of Northern Zhou and restored Han rule over North China. This event marked the end of all power that the Xianbei and other non-Chinese groups had over China, and racial tension subsided. =Tang Dynasty= During the Tang dynasty, various ethnic groups including Koreans, Indians and Tibetans journeyed to Chang'an and other major Tang cities for business or study. These people brought their religions and customs: Buddhism, Islam, Zoroastrianism (Xianjiao), Manichaeism (Monijiao) and Syriac Christianity (Jingjiao), all of which flourished. This cosmopolitan policy caused controversy among the literati, many of whom questioned the recommendation of the Kaifeng governor for the participation of Arab-born Li Yan-sheng in the 847 imperial examinations and several similar incidences of what they believed as incorrect racial privileging. Such was the discourse that Tang intellectual Chen An wrote an essay defending the governor's decision; The Heart of Being Hua (), which is often cited as expressing the sentiments of the \\"non-xenophobic\\" Chinese position on the Hua–Yi distinction. In the essay, Chen wrote: \\"If one speaks in terms of geography, then there are Hua and Yi. But if one speaks in terms of education, then there can be no such difference. For the distinction between Hua and Yi rests in the heart and is determined by their different inclinations.\\" A prominent Tang Confucian, Han Yu, wrote in his essay Yuan Dao, \\"When Confucius wrote the Chunqiu, he said that if the feudal lords use the Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi. If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese.\\" Han Yu went on to lament that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings,\\"孔子之作春秋也，诸侯用夷礼，则夷之；进于中国，则中国之.\\" creating the possibility that although insiders could lose their culture, outsiders could similarly gain insider culture. Arguments that excoriated the Tang's lax attitude towards foreigners were strengthened by the Yi-led An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), which propelled the Tang into decline. An intellectual movement \\"to return to the pure... sources of orthodox thought and morality\\", including many of the concepts of the Classical Prose Movement, also targeted \\"foreign\\" religions, as exemplified by Han Yu's diatribe against Buddhism. Emperor Wenzong of Tang passed decrees in line with these views, especially restricting Iranian religions and Buddhism, but this policy was relaxed by his successors. =Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms= The \\"Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms\\" was a period in which the north of China was ruled by a non-Chinese people, the Shatuo, for three short-lived dynasties while the south was ruled by Chinese. Their legitimacy was recognised by the Song dynasty. =Song Dynasty= The Song Dynasty saw both an economic boom and invasion by alien states. States like the Liao dynasty (遼) and Western Xia (西夏) began to take territories inhabited by large numbers of Chinese and asserted that they too were Chinese and successors to the Tang, and posed legitimacy issues for Song rule. In response to rising concerns from citizenry and claims from Yi states such as the Western Xia, Song scholars stipulated that groups like the Shatuo (whom the Song largely succeeded and who largely continued the rule of the Tang) were not barbarian or \\"Yi\\" but Chinese or \\"Hua\\" and that the Song had only descended from ruling groups that were Hua. Secondly, the Song asserted that the Liao and Western Xia, and later the Jin (金), were barbarian states despite their control of large areas of Chinese territory because they had not inherited any mandate from a legitimate, \\"Hua\\" dynasty. =Yuan Dynasty= Concerns over legitimacy were not limited to the Song alone: states rose up again in the Yuan dynasty, as its rulers were non-Han Chinese. However, the Yuan dynasty adopted a different approach to quelling the conflict. The Yuan asserted that the Song, Liao and Jin were all legitimate; therefore all three dynasties were given their own history, as recognition of their legitimacy. Despite this, the Yuan racially segregated their people; dividing society into four categories: *Mongols (蒙古): the ruling group and hence, the most important *Semu (色目; \\"assorted categories\\"): a term for non-Chinese and non-Mongol foreigners who occupied the second slate; *Han (漢人): a term for the Han Chinese, Jurchens, and Khitan under the rule of the Jin dynasty; *Southerner (南人): a term for Han Chinese under the rule of the Song dynasty. In addition, the Yuan also divided society into 10 castes, based on \\"desirability\\": *High officials (大官) *Minor officials (小官) *Buddhist monks (釋) *Daoist priests (道) *Physicians (医) *Peasants (農) *Hunters (獵) *Courtesans (妓) *Confucian scholars (儒) *Beggars (丐) The Yuan rulers were Mongols and were viewed as barbaric and humiliating for the Han Chinese, although they did not last long in China (from 1271 to 1368). =Ming Dynasty= In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed the Ming dynasty and issued a long manifesto, in which he labeled the Yuan as barbarians who had usurped the Chinese throne, and who had inflicted atrocities such as rape and murder. He lists incidents where the Mongols massacred men in entire villages and appropriated the women. Zhu's northern military expedition had been a success; Beijing was captured in the same year and China was again governed by Han. Although the Ming referred to the preceding Yuan as \\"胡元\\", or wild Yuan, they also accepted the Yuan before them as a legitimate dynasty. Hongwu Emperor indicated on another occasion that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China. In addition, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that Hua was and is superior to Yi.Zhou Songfang, \\"Lun Liu Ji de Yimin Xintai\\" (On Liu Ji's Mentality as a Dweller of Subjugated Empire) in Xueshu Yanjiu no.4 (2005), 112–117. During the Miao Rebellions, Ming forces engaged in massive slaughter of the Hmong and other native ethnic groups in South China; after castrating Hmong boys to use as eunuch slaves, Chinese soldiers took Hmong women as wives and colonised the southern provinces. Towards the end of the Ming dynasty, Ming loyalists invoked Hua-Yi zhi bian to urge the Chinese to resist the Manchu invaders. =Qing dynasty= The Qing dynasty's order that all subjects shave their forehead and braid the rest of their hair into a queue was viewed as a symbolic gesture of servitude by many Han Chinese, who thought that changing their dress to the same as Yi would be contrary to the spirit of \\"Hua-Yi zhi bian.\\" Scholar Lü Liuliang (1629–1683), who lived through the transition between the Ming and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, refused to serve the new dynasty because he claimed that upholding the difference between Huaxia and the Yi was more important than respecting the righteous bond between minister (臣) and sovereign (君王). In 1728, failed Imperial examination candidate Zeng Jing (曾靜), influenced by Lü's works, called for the overthrow of the Manchu regime. The Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1723–1735), whom Zeng accused of ten major crimes, took this event as an opportunity to educate the Qing's Chinese subjects. In a series of discussions with Zeng Jing, the emperor proclaimed that Chinese were not inherently superior to the barbarians. To justify his statements, he declared that King Wen, the sage king and the founder of the Zhou dynasty, was of Western Yi origin, but this did not hurt his greatness. The Yongzheng Emperor also borrowed from Han Yu, indicating that Yi can become Hua and vice versa. In addition, according to Yongzheng, both Hua and Yi were now a part of the same family under the Qing. One of the goals of the tract Dayi juemi lu (大義覺迷錄), which the Yongzheng Emperor published and distributed throughout the empire in 1730, was \\"to undermine the credibility of the hua/yi distinction.\\". Lü's original sentence was \\"Hua yi zhi fen da yu jun chen zhi yi\\" 華夷之分，大於君臣之義. However, due to the fact that this tract also helped to expose many unsavoury aspects of court life and political intrigues in the imperial government, Yongzheng's successor the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1736–1796) recalled the tracts and had them burned for the fear that it would undermine the legitimacy of the Qing empire. During the Qing, the Qing destroyed writings that criticised the Liao, Jin and Yuan using the Hua–Yi distinction. Sun Yat-sen also used the Hua–Yi distinction to justify the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. However, the Qing adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven, while at the same time trying to retain their own indigenous culture. Due to the Manchus' adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) accepted the Manchus as the legitimate rulers. =Republic of China= Historian Frank Dikötter (1990:420) says the Chinese \\"idea of 'race' (zhong [種], \\"seed\\", \\"species\\", \\"race\\") started to dominate the intellectual scene\\" in the late 19th-century Qing dynasty and completed the \\"transition from cultural exclusiveness to racial exclusiveness in modern China\\" in the 1920s. Following the overthrow of the Qing, Sun Yat-sen allegedly went to the grave of Zhu Yuanzhang and told him that the Huaxia had been restored and the barbarians overthrown. However, after the Republic of China revolution, Sun also advocated that all ethnic groups in China were part of the Chinese family. =People's Republic of China= The PRC did not abide by the concept of \\"Hua Yi zhi bian\\" and recognised the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing as legitimate dynasties. Initially, the Communist Party condemned all Chinese dynasties as \\"feudal.\\" Hua-Yi zhi bian has little practical and real significance in twenty-first century China.Li Bo and Zheng Yin (2001) Conceptualisation of the Hua–Yi distinction in non-Chinese statesJapan= In ancient times Japan seems to have had a vassal relationship with China. In 57 Emperor Guangwu of Han sent an imperial seal which mentions King of Japan (漢委奴國王) and in 239 Emperor Ming of Cao Wei sent a seal of 親魏倭王 (pro-Wei King of Japan) to Japan. However, in 607 Prince Shotoku of Japan stated its perspective of being independent and equal to China in a diplomatic letter by referring to the Japanese ruler as an emperor (“日出處天子致書日沒處天子無恙云云” An emperor of where the sun rises is writing to an emperor of where the sun sets). It was taken as an insult by the Chinese emperor of the time, Emperor Yang of Sui, since in Hua–Yi distinction emperor is a title for the ruler of China, but not for other foreign countries. Confucianism was introduced into Japan about at the same time as Buddhism, but it was not encouraged to be spread as much as Buddhism was. Some Japanese philosophers, like the neo-Confucianists Yamaga Sokō and Aizawa Seishisai claimed that Japan was 中國 Chūgoku instead of China. =Korea= Following the 1644 Manchu conquest, Joseon Koreans began to refer to themselves as Sojunghwa \\"Little China\\" (). As the Joseon supported the Ming, they were reported to have extended a friendliness to the Ming that they did not display to the Qing dynasty. This sentiment was in large part due to the fact that Jurchens were descended from Mohe people, who were once subjects of Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo and Balhae. In addition, Jurchens were widely recognised as barbarians, as Jurchen tribes have been raiding and pillaging the northern border regions of Korean Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms for centuries. This sentiment did not disappear even after Qing completed sinicisation. Because Korea had been closely tied to Han Chinese \\"barbarianism ruling China\\" became a major issue for discussion there. As the Ming dynasty fell, Korea was worried about its own security. This was due to previous instances in which Ming China aided Korea such as in the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98). Long after the establishment of the Qing dynasty, the Joseon ruling elite and even the Joseon government continued to use the Chongzhen Emperor's era name () of the last Ming emperor. In private they referred to the Manchu Emperor as the \\"barbarian ruler\\" and Qing ambassadors as \\"barbarian ambassadors\\". These feelings could not be expressed as the \\"barbarians\\" held great power over Korea following their successful invasion in the Later Jin invasion of Joseon in 1627 and the Qing invasion of Joseon of 1637. Over time the Qing government exerted more power over Korea. This would eventually turn Korea into a hermit kingdom to limit foreign influence. =Ryūkyū= The Ryukyu Kingdom was heavily influenced by Chinese culture, taking language, architecture, and court practices from China. It also paid annual tribute to first the Ming and later Qing courts from 1374 until 1874. =Vietnam= Vietnamese dynasties competed for primacy, adopting the same descriptive term, \\"central state\\" (Trung Quốc 中國), while Chinese were \\"outsiders\\". For example, Emperor Gia Long used Trung Quốc as a name for Vietnam in 1805. Cambodia was regularly called Cao Man, the country of \\"upper barbarians\\". In the 1800s, Nguyễn rulers such as Emperor Minh Mạng claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China's Han dynasty for Vietnam. Vietnamese called themselves as Hán dân (漢民) and Hán nhân (漢人),https://web.archive.org/web/20040617071243/http://kyotoreview.cseas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/issue/issue4/article_353.html while they referred to ethnic Chinese as Thanh nhân (清人) or Đường nhân (唐人). For example, Emperor Gia Long said Hán di hữu hạn (漢夷有限, \\"the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders\\") when differentiating between Khmer and Vietnamese. As Vietnam conquered territory from the Khmer and Lao kingdoms and various tribes on the Central Highlands such as the Jarai and the Mạ, Emperor Minh Mạng implemented an acculturation integration policy directed at these peoples. He declared, \\"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\\" Clothing was also affected by Nguyễn policies. Lord Nguyễn Vo Vuong ordered traditional wrapped-skirt and cross-collar clothing which is very popular in Sinosphere to be replaced by Qing and Ming- style clothing although isolated hamlets in northern Vietnam continued to wear skirts until the 1920s. The ao dai was created when tucks, which were close fitting and compact, were added to this Chinese style in the 1920s. The White Hmong have also adopted trousers, replacing the traditional skirts that females wore. Up to 1812, the 1644 Ming Datong calendar was used by the Nguyen in Vietnam.

He was damaged politically by a personal scandal. Hughes- Hallet was the son of Charles Madras Hughes-Hallett and his wife Emma Mary Roberts. He became a colonel in the Royal Artillery. In 1885 he was elected as Member of Parliament for Rochester and reelected in 1886. However, a personal scandal led to his being hounded by the press and shunned by his parliamentary colleagues and he stood down from Parliament in 1889. He was involved in the investigation of the murder of Martha Tabram in Whitechapel in 1888, one of the cases linked with Jack the Ripper. Military career He was commissioned in the Royal Regiment of Artillery in December 1859 and served in the army until 1885. Marriages In 1871, Hughes-Hallett married Catherine Rosalie Greene, the widow of Sir Charles Jasper Selwyn and of Reverend Harry Dupuis. They had three children: Frank Victor (1872-1937, married Hilda Marion Cook and Katherine Gameson Swinnerton), Egerton (1873-1890), and Sybil Rosalie (1875-1958, married Graham Brown). Catherine Hughes-Hallett, who died in childbirth in 1875, also brought to the marriage four children from her previous marriage, a son, Harry Jasper Selwyn (1870-1919), a stepson, Charles William Selwyn (1858-1893, married Isabella Constance Dalgety), and two stepdaughters, Edith Adriana Selwyn (1859-1910, married Edward Grant Fraser- Tytler) and Beatrice Eugénie Selwyn (1865-1898, married Patrick Herbert). In 1882, Hughes-Hallett wed a middle-aged American heiress, Emilie Page von Schaumberg (1833-1923), the daughter of James von Schaumberg and Caroline Page, but the marriage ran into difficulties five years later, when Hughes- Hallet was caught in flagrante delicto with his first wife's stepdaughter, Beatrice. Scandal During a country-house weekend around at Ellingham Hall, Bungay, Norfolk, the home of W. Henry Smith, Colonel Hughes-Hallett was caught in the bedroom of Beatrice Selwyn, whose stepmother had been Hughes-Hallett's first wife.\\"The Parliamentary Scandal: Colonel Hughes-Hallett's Confession\\", The Pall Mall Budget, 29 September 1887, pages 7-9 As Smith, who was Miss Selwyn's uncle, wrote to Emilie Hughes-Hallett, \\"I went to your husband's bedroom shortly before midnight and found that he was not there. I then called upon a housekeeper ... as well as the young lady’s maid and I gave them instructions to enter her room. You know the rest. I gave him half an hour to pack up his things and turned him out of the house.\\" The affair had been of some duration, having begun in the Hughes-Hallett's London residence, where he lived with his second wife and his minor children. Hughes-Hallett also \\"admitted accompanying [Beatrice Selwyn] to various hotels—the Bear at Havant, the Crown at Emsworth and the Cannon Street Hotel. The lady gave birth to a child.\\"\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 Complicating matters too was that Hughes-Hallett, always short of cash, had secretly borrowed money from Beatrice Selwyn, in the amount of £5,000.\\"The Parliamentary Scandal: Colonel Hughes-Hallett's Confession\\", The Pall Mall Budget, 29 September 1887, pages 7-9 As Hughes- Hallett said in his defence, \\"Regarding the money part of the question, Miss Selwyn some time ago asked me to try to get her better interest on 5,000 pounds than she was getting. She covenanted by a deed in my possession to lend money for five years. Some weeks ago her solicitors suddenly called the money in. Within twenty-four hours the principal, with interest, was handed my solicitors for transference to her solicitors.\\"Chicago Tribune, 21 September 1887\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 He also initially disputed that he was the father of Beatrice Selwyn's child or that he hoped to have access to Miss Selwyn's £40,000 fortune.\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 W. T. Stead published the allegation of the affair on the front page of The Pall Mall Gazette for 20 September 1887. Aftermath of the scandal Though Hughes-Hallett maintained some degree of success in political circles, his personal reputation was largely destroyed. As The New York Times sympathetically stated in 1888, \\"the critical press are so unkind as to stigmatize him as a social leper ...\\"\\"Old World News By Cable\\", The New York Times, 22 July 1888, page 1 Still, it pointed out, he did not enjoy the \\"Parliamentary session, however, as no member will sit on the same bench with him\\".\\"Old World News By Cable\\", The New York Times, 22 July 1888, page 1 And Beatrice Selwyn's brother, Captain Charles William Selwyn, also an MP, threatened to horsewhip his sister's seducer if they ever crossed paths in the House of Commons.\\"Anglo-Colonial Notes: The Hughes- Hallett Scandal\\", Te Aroha News, 2 January 1889 Soon Hughes-Hallett separated from his wife, who went to live in Dinard, Brittany, for the remainder of her life. In 1893 he sued Passmore Edwards, a newspaper publisher who had been the defeated Liberal candidate for Rochester, for libel, when Edwards declared that Hughes-Hallett had no business running again for Parliament unless he could be voted in as the Member of Parliament for Sodom and Gomorrah. In the libel action, Edwards stated that \\"Sodom and Gomorrah as a suitable constituency for Col Hughes-Hallett carried no criminal imputation; that it only referred to uncleanliness of living, and that in respect of this Col Hughes-Hallett's reputation so stank in the public nostrils that nothing that could be said could affect it.\\"\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 As for the judge in the case, he said, \\"That Col Hughes-Hallett's reputation is so bad that nothing that can be said of him can injure it, and Col Hughes-Hallett has no right to ask for consideration from any man.\\"\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 The defendant lost the case.\\"Col Hughes Hallett and Mr Passmore Edwards: An Action for Libel\\", West Briton Newspaper, 4 May 1893 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1838 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1885–1886 Category:UK MPs 1886–1892 Category:Royal Artillery officers ","title":"Francis Hughes-Hallett"},{"id":"20756329","title":"Ladbrokes Hurdle"},{"id":"20756333","text":"Andrew James Fenn (born 1 July 1990) is a British former professional cyclist, who rode professionally between 2011 and 2018 for four different teams.

Mary Ashraf, The Life and Times of Thomas Spence, Newcastle upon Tyne, Frank Graham, 1983. Spence laid out his ideas about Spensonia in a series of literary works published in the late 18th century: * A Supplement to the History of Robinson Crusoe (1782) * A Marine Republic, or A Description of Spensonia (1794) * The Constitution of a Perfect Commonwealth (1798) * The Constitution of Spensonia: A Country in Fairyland Situated Between Utopia and Oceana (1801) * The Receipt to Make a Millenium or Happy World (1805). Spence issued these works in several editions, creating a complex bibliography. Since he also developed and advocated his own scheme of language reform,Joan C. Beal, English Pronunciation in the Eighteenth Century, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002; pp. 1-12. he released his Spensonian works in both standard spelling texts and in his own Spensonian alphabet. Spence's utopian writings are significant in that he was the first to apply Enlightenment ideas about democracy and majority rule to the genre, and also the first to attempt a utopian response to the Industrial Revolution. Spence's utopian works \\"were directed explicitly at the major institutions, economic and political, of the time. In so doing he provided the model of most future utopias.\\"Lyman Tower Sargent, \\"Themes in Utopian Fiction in English before Wells,\\" Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3 No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 275-82; see p. 277. Plot Spence united these utopian writings with a frame story about shipwrecked English mariners. When a ship carrying English merchant brothers is stranded on a remote island, the brothers decide to take the arrangement they had aboard ship, the \\"Marine Constitution\\" given to them by their father, and apply it to their life on land; and so they create a commonwealth of collective ownership. The land of the island is the property of the collective, and individuals rent it for their own uses. They organize their own democratic government to manage their new social system.Lewis Mumford, The Story of Utopias, New York, Boni and Liveright, 1922; Forgotten Books, 2008; pp. 81-3. Their society thrives and flourishes. Men and women are equal. Spensonia maintains cordial relations with other republics, and extends political asylum to refugees from tyranny.

History At the same time as hollywood films were experimenting and executing VFX, India had also closely followed and caught on. Dada Saheb Phalke's silent movie Kaliamardhan in the year 1919 is one such example with amazing work. Later came Telugu cinema like Pathala Bhairavi and Maya Bazaar which took VFX to greater heights. With the advent of Computer Graphics in Hollywood in the 1970s Indian films yearned to similar work and in the 1980s India's first Computer graphics facilities came up led by Prasad Video Digital which later gave birth to Prasad EFX who imported the first film scanners and recorders to India and thus pioneered the digital image revolution in India. Gentleman is the first Indian film to use computer graphics for a scene featuring the heart of a teenager after a bomb blast. The first complete computer graphics film is Ammoru. Later Kaadhalan, Jeans, Indian and Mudhalvan had VFX similar to Hollywood movies made in Tamil by the director S. Shankar. Graphic designer Venky noted that Indian was his most difficult project to date (in 1997) with a scene constructed to feature Kamal Haasan's character alongside freedom fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose. Venky had to remove blemishes on the film reel of Bose provided by the Film Division's archive before merging Kamal Haasan on to the shot to make it appear that the pair were marching in tandem.[9] One of the earliest Bollywood films to use heavy VFX shots was Love Story 2050 in 2008, that had around 1200 VFX shots. The Telugu movie Magadheera used 1600 VFX shots in 2009. The Tamil movie, Enthiran had the highest budget for VFX at that time in 2010. It has 2000 VFX shots including the dual roles of Rajinikanth. Ra.One that became the first Bollywood film to raise the bar of VFX techniques, using as many as 2500 VFX shots in the film in 2011. Eventually, Krrish 3 marched ahead, with a record breaking 3500 VFX shots in more than 50 sequences in 2013. Films like Indian and Enthiran took Indian cinema to next level in VFX/CGI technology and fan is the first of its kind vfx that used in Indian Cinema. The action sequence was shot using 120 cameras for employing the time slice photography technique, a visual effect known as \\"bullet time\\" and popularised by the American film The Matrix (1999), to achieve the frozen-time effect.[13] Shankar had earlier toyed with the idea of time-slice and tried it while filming the song \\"Ale Ale\\" in his Boys.[79] While the time-freeze sequence in Boys was achieved by the linking of 60–62 cameras to attain a 180° rotation, Anniyan employed 120–122 cameras for a 270° rotation. Impressed with the film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became the visual effects supervisor in December 2007\\\\. He asked Shankar to increase the filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700 million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200 million. As a result, the visual effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses for most of the film to reduce the cost and difficulty of animating his eyes. The films Baahubali: The Beginning(2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) were commercial and critical hit breaking the box office records of Indian cinemas and were famous for its vfx shots See also * National Film Award for Best Special Effects References Category:Cinema of India ","title":"History of visual effects in Indian cinema"},{"id":"20756361","text":"Ridgeton Farm is a historic home located at Taylor's Island, Dorchester County, Maryland, United States.

Advantages The main advantage of LBIST is the ability to test internal circuits having no direct connections to external pins, and thus unreachable by external automated test equipment. Another advantage is the ability to trigger the LBIST of an integrated circuit while running a built-in self test or power-on self test of the finished product. Disadvantages LBIST that requires additional circuitry (or read-only memory) increases the cost of the integrated circuit. LBIST that only requires temporary changes to programmable logic or rewritable memory avoids this extra cost, but requires more time to first program in the BIST and then to remove it and program in the final configuration. Another disadvantage of LBIST is the possibility that the on-chip testing hardware itself can fail; external automated test equipment tests the integrated circuit with known-good test circuitry. Related technologies Other, related technologies are MBIST (a BIST optimized for testing internal memory) and ABIST (either a BIST optimized for testing arrays or a BIST that is optimized for testing analog circuitry). The two uses may be distinguished by considering whether the integrated circuit being tested has an internal array or analog functions.

Under Hochberg, the Bank also increased its focus on customers, particularly America’s small business exporters, and in several years during his tenure, nearly 90 percent of EXIM Bank authorizations directly supported small businesses. He streamlined processes, cutting transactions times so that 98% of transactions were processed within 100 days.http://www.exim.gov/sites/default/files//FPH%20Biography_as%20of%2012%2019%202016.pdf After Hochberg's tenure at the U.S. Export-Import Bank he led fellowships at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago in the fall of 2017 and the Institute of Politics at Harvard University in the spring of 2018. Following his fellowships, Hochberg published Trade is Not a Four Letter Word: How Six Everyday Products Make the Case for Trade, his first book. The book is described as the antidote to today’s acronym-laden trade jargon pitched to voters with simple promises that rarely play out so one-dimensionally. The book was published by Simon & Schuster on January 14, 2020 in advance of voting getting underway in the 2020 Democratic Presidential primaries. The book was met with critical praise and has been referred to as \\"a sprightly and clear-eyed testimonial to the value of globalization\\" and “a rousing, well- argued defense of global trade in a time of isolationist entrenchment.\\" LGBTQ activism Hochberg has served as chair of the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent lesbian and gay rights group.

It was a protest movement, largely targeting a new tax on truck transport (billed as an \\"écotaxe\\" by the government). This tax was to be enforced in part by gantries set up on highways to detect vehicles carrying heavy loads and the presence of the required billing apparatuses. Through a combination of demonstrations and violent actions, including the destruction of many of these tax gantries, the movement forced the French government to rescind the tax. An anti-tax sign affixed to an “ecotaxe” gantry a few days before it was destroyed The protesters considered the tax harmful to Breton agriculture, which was already having a difficult time competing with its counterparts in Europe. They wore red caps, in reference to the seventeenth century revolt of the papier timbré which was particularly active in Brittany, though the Phrygian cap as a protest symbol goes back much further.  Activity  Hundreds of red-cap-wearing demonstrators protested against the highway tax gantry at Pont-de-Buis on 28 October 2013, and during the course of the protest a demonstrator had his hand blown off when he picked up a grenade thrown by law enforcement. Soon after, the French government announced that it would be temporarily suspending the new tax until 2015 at the earliest.“France delays ‘ecotax’ on road transport after protests” MENAFN 29 October 2013 This did not satisfy the demonstrators, who went on to destroy more than two dozen tax gantries and many smaller radar-camera-like outposts, by the first week of November.“France’s Hollande defies Breton tax protest” Reuters 6 November 2013; “Lorry spy destroyed in green tax protest” The Times 6 November 2013 These would typically be destroyed by fire, often by filling tires stacked at their bases with flammable material and lighting them. Sometimes, less- destructive means were used, such as wrapping the radar cameras in plastic and topping them with bonnets rouges of their own.“Haut-Doubs: les six radars déguisés en «Bretons»” Le Républicain Lorrain 15 November 2013 By late November, 46 tax radars and gantries had been destroyed and other anti-tax groups were beginning their own direct action, including farmers and equestrians who disrupted traffic in Paris with their tractors and horses. At the end of November, the movement massed in Carhaix and simultaneously used shipping trucks to blockade highways throughout France.“Bretagne : les Bonnets rouges gagnent le pari de la mobilisation” L’Obs 30 November 2013; “Manifestations anti-écotaxe : la liste des barrages routiers dans toute la France ” MYTF1 News 29 November 2013 At one point the demonstrators held an auction at which they sold off bits and pieces of previously-destroyed road tax gantries as souvenirs. In an amusing moment, a hundred employees of Ecomouv, the quasi-private company responsible for collecting the new tax, held a holiday party in Metz. Posing for a group photo in front of the company offices in their Santa Claus hats, police mistook them for a demonstration of the bonnets rouges, and they quickly intervened. By January, the number of highway tax and radar-ticket machines destroyed had topped 200.“Fronde des Bonnets Rouges : plus de 250 radars vandalisés en trois mois” Network Visio 17 January 2014 This had the desired effect. In 2013, for the first time since ticket-giving radar cameras had been installed in France, the number of tickets issued by the machines declined. The government made its first big counterattacks in the Spring. Eleven suspected bonnets rouges were arrested and charged with conspiracy in April.“Radars bretons. Un sur quatre a disparu” Le Télégramme 20 April 2014; “Bonnets Rouges: 11 défèrements devant le procureur de la République” Seizh 20 April 2014 The following month, the government convicted Samantha Prime of participating in the destruction of a radar outpost.“Samantha Prime, symbole des Bonnets Rouges, va à nouveau comparaître ce lundi à Saint-Malo” France 3 Bretagne 18 May 2014 Destruction of highway tax gantries, however, continued. The eleven conspirators were convicted and sentenced to between four and 18 months imprisonment, along with a total of about €10,000 in fines. The same day the sentences were declared, farmers in Brittany invaded the city of Morlaix, dumped their produce in big piles in the streets, set fire to the tax office, and blockaded the area to keep fire trucks from responding. In September and October, three other French tax offices were put to the torch, and French tax officials complained of feeling threatened.“Ras-le-bol-fiscal : Quatre perceptions ont brûlé depuis la rentrée” économie matin 3 October 2014; “Les agents des impôts craignent d'être les victimes de la «fronde fiscale»” Le Figaro 2 October 2014 The French government finally decided, in late October, to abandon the hated tax entirely. The cost to the government was enormous. In addition to the loss of anticipated revenue from the tax (€390 million per year) and the property damage and other costs associated with the demonstrations, the government was required to pay compensation to Ecomouv, the quasi-private company that had contracted to administer the tax, and others — nearly one billion euros in all.

History The Duchy of Chaulnes was established by a letters patent of January 1621, registered on 6 March 1621 at the Parliament of Paris in favour of a younger brother of Charles d'Albert, Duke of Luynes (1578–1621), Honoré d'Albert (1581–1649), Marshal of France in 1619, known as the Marshal de Cadenet. On 14 January 1620 he married Charlotte Eugénie d'Ailly who was the heir to a family holding the titles of Count of Chaulnes (created in December 1563), Vidame d'Amiens and Baron de Picquigny. The marriage contract stipulated that their heirs would take the name and arms of Ailly, which indeed happened; their children took the surname of d'Albert d'Ailly. The first Duke of Chaulnes est known by the bloody repression of the Breton people in 1675 (The Revolt of the Red Caps: http://www.contreculture.org/TB_Code_Paysan_1675.html [archive]) The first Duke of Chaulnes had several sons; only one was married, however, and he himself sired only girls. He became the second duke, and when he died in 1653, lacking male progeny, the title passed to a minor who became the third Duke. In 1667, to avoid the title passing into disuse, the third duke, at the request of his mother, Charlotte d'Ailly, named his heir as the Duke of Chevreuse, second son of the Duke of Luynes. This was stipulated in the Duke of Chevreuse's marriage contract which also stipulated that the title would pass to the youngest child of the marriage and, in case the male line subsequently ended, to the youngest of that name who held the arms of the d'Albert family. Thus two distinct houses were created: Luynes, which the Duke of Chevreuse inherited from his father in 1688, and Chaulnes, which remained distinct and separate from the former until the direct line of inheritance came to an end. In that case, the two houses should be reunited until it was possible to separate them again. Thus, at the time at which the first line of d'Albert d'Ailly ended with the death of the third Duke of Chaulnes in 1698, the Duchy of Chaulnes went to the Duke of Chevreuse, who in the meantime had become the Duke of Luynes. In 1694, he passed the duchy of Luynes to his eldest son Charles Honoré on the occasion of his marriage, and assigned the Duchy of Chaulnes to his younger son Charles Francis, Vidame Amiens, also on the occasion of his marriage in 1710. This transmission was confirmed by letters patent in October 1711, registered on 1 December 1711, which established Chaulnes as a duchy for the first time in favour of Charles Francis. Charles Honoré's son was killed in 1704 and it was his grandson Charles Philippe who inherited the duchy of Luynes. In 1732, the 4th Duke of Luynes, Charles Philippe, and the 4th Duke of Chaulnes, Louis Auguste, made an agreement whereby the former relinquished his rights over the duchy of Chaulnes, while the latter received confirmation which said that if the Duchy of Chaulnes should return to the house of Luynes, it would pass to the youngest child of that family, and then remain in the direct male line.

Biography Abdul Wahab was born the son of a sailor in the northern city of El Mina, which was then known as Al-Askaleh, during the Ottoman rule. Wahab received little schooling, and became a foreman on the El Mina docks, where merchant ships used smaller, local boats to onload and offload cargo. This was a lengthy, and labor-intensive process, and Abdul Wahab, with the help of his brother Adel, and enjoying the advantage of having a large family, the Abdul Wahabs, came to dominate the El Mina harbour labour force during the first decade of the 20th century, seeing Kheireddine himself become the owner of the small loading boats, leveraging his labour advantage. In 1914, with the World War I imminent, the importance of vital harbors became apparent. Kheireddine enjoyed good relations with the Ottomans at the time, and with political backing was the first, and to this day, the only man who leased one of Lebanon's islands, Cows island (today known as Abdul Wahab Island), as his ship construction site. This was the beginning of a long history of shipping, that extended between Cairo and Aleppo, branching out into commercial transport, import and export, in addition to the piloting and harboring business in El Mina. By the end of the war and the inception of the French Mandate on Lebanon, Abdul Wahab had switched camps, and had helped Allied forces during the war through using his shipping business and in his status as a respected figure in the region. Among other tasks, he served as a proxy to assist the Allies in smuggling arms, ammunition and food behind enemy lines. With the end of war in 1918, the French mandate modernized many outlets in Lebanon, one of which was the construction of the \\"Grumpk\\" key, as well as deepening the waters and the construction of a modern harbor in Tripoli, Lebanon, that still stands today. The project was contracted to a French corporation, which in turn subcontracted it to the local businesses, including Abdul Wahab's. The mandate then issued him the exclusive right of providing piloting, harboring, and fresh water supply services within Tripoli harbor waters. The French mandate appointed Kheireddine Abdul Wahab as mayor of the newly established city of Al-Askaleh, a position which he held for 20 years until his death. In his later years, and after forming the Kheireddine and Adel Abdul Wahab Holding company, which at one point was a major owner of Al- Askaleh business and real estate, Abdul Wahab retired and took to philanthropy until his death in January 1944.

The Spanish Army, 14,000 strong, advanced, but the Duke of Chaulnes was too weak to go into combat, instead distributing his troops along the border with the Spanish Netherlands to harass the enemy. However, he was reinforced by the cavalry levies from Boulonnais, allowing him to drive back the Spanish. When new cavalry regiments were formed in 1636, one was named after the Duke of Chaulnes. To retaliate for the damage done by the Spanish to Picardy during the last campaign, the Duke assembled 1200 men in January 1636, entered Artois and burned numerous villages, in addition to defeating 400 Irish mercenaries. In 1640, with the Marshal of Châtillon, he won the Siege of Arras on 10 August. After this campaign, the Duke ceased to serve in the army of Louis XIII, and he resigned from the government of Picardy in 1645. That same year he was appointed Governor of Auvergne, a position which he held until his death on 30 October 1649. He is also known for making the cadenette hairstyle fashionable.

Biography Château of Dampierre-en-Yvelines: domesticated Baroque built for the duc de Chevreuse by Jules Hardouin Mansart. The Duke of Chevreuse was the grandson of the Marie de Rohan, the infamous duchesse de Chevreuse and one of the leading members of the Fronde, and the son-in-law of Colbert. His wife was Jeanne Marie Colbert, with whom he had three children. He married Jeanne Marie in Paris on 3 February 1667. His younger half sister was Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes, the mistress of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia. The duc de Chevreuse was a private advisor of Louis XIV, and a sort of unofficial minister without portfolio. From 1698 until 1712 he was the non-residing governor of the province of Guienne (from the time of Louis XIV onwards the governorship of French provinces was essentially an honorific title and governors were not allowed to reside or even penetrate in their provinces). Friend of the Duke of Beauvilliers and of the famous archbishop Fénelon, he maintained a steady exchange of correspondence with the latter. It is at the Duke of Chevreuse's estate in Chaulnes (Somme department) that Fénelon wrote his Tables de Chaulnes (1711). Along with his friends, Chevreuse was a reformist in the circle of the Duke of Burgundy, petit dauphin, grandson of Louis XIV and heir to the throne, advocating a less centralised and absolute monarchy relying more on the aristocracy. His ideas were briefly applied after 1715 (see polysynody), although he did not live long enough to see it. He died in Paris in 1712.

It is notable for two ancient Hindu temples which are in the same compound, and are both protected monuments. The more famous in religious terms is the Kumaraswami Temple (8th-10th century), believed to be the first abode in south India of Murugan or Karthikeya, the Hindu god of war, son of Parvati and Shiva, and brother of Ganesha. To art historians the Parvati Temple beside it (7th-8th century) is the more unusual in terms of Hindu temple architecture. Temples The complex houses temples of Parvati and Kumaraswami. The Ganesha idol in the Kumaraswami Temple is more popular these days than the main deity Kartikeya. Both monuments are now a protected monuments. It was discovered by the local rulers, the Ghorpades, in the thickly-wooded Swamimale hill in the 15th century. Women were earlier strictly not allowed to enter the shrine. Murarirao Yeshwantrao Ghorpade lifted the ban on women in October 1996.Women finally get to worship at 1,000-year-old Kumaraswamy temple in Karnataka 1 December 1997, www.indiatoday.in. Retrieved 2019-01-16 After the ban was lifted, nearly 3,000 women have worshipped at the temple. The Ghorpades, well loved and respected by the locals, had declared the temple open to Harijans as early as the 1930s. After learning of this on his visit to Sandur in 1934, Mahatma Gandhi said, \\"a small state in south India has opened the temple to the Harijans, the heavens have not fallen.\\" =Parvati temple= The Parvati temple has a number of unusual features. It apparently belongs to the \\"middle phase\\" of Badami Chalukya architecture, also called the Vesara style by some, and \\"Karnataka Dravida\\" by Adam Hardy, who sees this Deccan style as a part of the Dravidian architecture of the south, distinct from the version that developed in Tamil Nadu. The temple has no mandapa, but a long antarala, over which is, according to Adam Hardy, \\"possibly the first use of a sukanasa in a Dravida temple\\". The vimana tower over the shrine is \\"a very unusual composition, strangely advanced-looking in the compression of horizontal layers, and in the sense of outsurge\\".Hardy, 74-75 According to one account, the Parvati temple (which was originally called Kumaraswamy temple) was built by the Badami Chalukyas (7th -8th century) and has the image of Parvati as the main deity. =Kumaraswami Temple= The temple currently called the Kumaraswamy temple (originally had Shanmukha as the main deity) was constructed during the rule of the Rashtrakutas (8th-10th century). Legends of the mountain A distinctive feature of the mountain is its elliptical shape with a diametric narrow pass. According to legend, this gap is made when Kartikeya pierced the mountain in the battle with the demon Tharaka, with his sphere weapon vel to kill the demons who were hidden inside mountain. This legend is held in high esteem in Hindu mythologies including Mahabharata (salya parva.46), Skanda Purana(asura kandam). Krauncha Giri is also associated with legends of the sages Agastya and Parasuram. Kalidasa in his work Megha Sandesa describes the gap in the mountain. This place is connected with legends of Sri Sailam jyotirlinga in Andhra Pradesh. The name 'Krauncha Giri' is very familiar to many, but few know the location of this legendary mountain. For many, it's just a mythical one like Mount Meru. Swamimale forest range According to geologists, this peculiar mountain is made of volcanic eruptions and is very rich in mineral deposits. The soil and lake here is red marshy that owes to presence of rich ferrous deposits. Nowadays due to mindless mining in this area is resulting in habitat destruction. Many plant species such as Strobilanthes kunthiana (neela kurunji) is found in the shola type grasslands of mountains, many birds such as orange-headed thrush, tickell's blue flycatcher, Indian pitta, verditer flycatcher, spot-brested fantail, yellow throated bulbul, spotted dove, red whiskered bulbul, oriental white eye, brown-headed barbet, puff-throated babbler, blue-capped rockthrush, red breasted flycatcher etc. Many more birds species of western ghats can be found here. It is a good habitate for many species of orchids too. The place is filled with dense green forests which normally resemble the rainforests of western ghat. Though the place is in a hot region, because of high mountains it is always cool, many cool atmosphere-loving species of plants and fungi such as mosses, ferns, lichens, mushrooms, toad stools tinder fungus, puff ball fungus, thrive here, giving boost to many shade loving insects reptiles. Trees such as rosewood, sandalwood, teak wood, etc. flourish in forests. This centuries old temple complex is located inside Swamimalai forest range and is said to be infested with venomous snakes like russell viper and spectacled cobras. Peacocks are also a very common sight here. The forest range is also a very good habitat of leopards.Tigers roamed in the forests till 1960. But due to hunting habitat loss due to mining, they were swept away. Transport Karnataka State highway No.40 pass through the above said gap in mountain, connecting Sandur to rest of the State. Temple is approachable by road from Sandur. Nearest Rail Heads are Hospet& Bellary on Guntakal-Hubli line. The temple complex is located on south-west corner and is connected to Sandur by road.

It is native to most of North America, including most of Canada, most of the United States except for some portions of the South, and northern Mexico. It is a plant of many habitats, including temperate coniferous forest. The specific epithet ciliatus is Latin for \\"ciliate\\", referring to the delicate hairs of the leaf blades. Description Bromus ciliatus is a perennial grass that grows in tufts up to tall, and occasionally taller in the Great Plains. The grass lacks rhizomes but has a well developed root system. The sheaths are glabrous or bear minute hairs and have a narrow \\"V\\" shaped orifice. The sheaths are typically shorter than the internodes. The scabrous leaves often have sparse long hairs and measure wide. The open inflorescence bears many spikelets on stalks, the upper ones ascending and the lower nodding or drooping. This panicle is long. The flattened spikelets are long and wide. The spikelets are greenish and occasionally tinged with bronze or purple. The spikelets bear three to nine flowers and display their rachilla at maturity. The glumes are conduplicate, with the upper glume tapering at its base. The firm lemmas are also conduplicate, measuring broad with delicate nerves. The linear palea is typically enclosed by the folded lemma. The anthers are long. The caryopsis is lanceolate in shape. The grass flowers from July into early October. Habitat Bromus ciliatus is common in subalpine areas. It is a very palatable forage grass that is heavily grazed and shade tolerant.

Biography John was the third of four children. One of his elder sisters, Agnes MacWhirter was also a noted artist of still lifes. He attended a school in Colinton, and after his father's death was apprenticed to Oliver & Boyd, booksellers in Edinburgh. He stayed there for only a few months and then in 1851 enrolled at the Trustees Academy under Robert Scott Lauder and John Ballantyne (1815–97). He spent long periods sketching and studying nature outdoors. His first painting to be exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy at age 14, was 'Old Cottage at Braid'. In 1880, he was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Exploring and painting abroad he visited Italy, Sicily, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey, Norway and the U.S.A. - the Alps being a great inspiration. He moved to London in 1867 and on 4 May 1893 was elected a Royal Academician. MacWhirter specialised in romantic landscapes with a great fondness for trees, spending much time in the hilly countryside of Perthshire. Initially, under the influence of John Everett Millais, he experimented with the detailed images of the Pre-Raphaelites, but later adopted a more sweeping style. With John Pettie he illustrated Wordsworth's Poetry for the Young (Strahan, 1863). With Waller H. Paton and others, MacWhirter illustrated The Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe (Hislop, 1869).

It offers six Bachelor of Science degree programs, three of which are recognized by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence in Chemistry, Biology (as of July 2, 2010), and Psychology.http://science.ust.edu.ph/index.php/component/content/article/3-showcase/404-3-science- programs-recognized-as-coes.html It also offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology, the only undergraduate microbiology program in the Philippines. It is the first in the university to have been accredited Level IV by the Philippine Association of Colleges & Universities Committee on Accreditation (PACUCOA). The College is located at the third floor of the UST Main Building. Brief history The College of Science of the University of Santo Tomas was established in 1926 as the College of Liberal Arts. It then offered four-year programs leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.). It also has a two-year program for Associate in Arts which served as preparatory courses for the Law and Medical schools. The offerings of the College became diversified, in response to the advancements made in the field of science. Thus, specialized degree programs in the various fields of science were developed and introduced through the years: B.S. Chemistry (1931), B.S. major in Zoology (1947), B.S. major in Psychology (1948), and B.S. Mathematics and Physics (1952). In 1959, the preparatory course for the Medical School was extended to three years, in compliance with the requirements of the Medical Act. In 1964, the College of Liberal Arts was re-organized. The A.B. program was ceded to the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters (now Faculty of Arts and Letters). The B.S. programs remained in the college, which became known as the College of Science. Consistent with its goals of being relevant to the fast-developing world, the College of Science introduced new degree programs in the succeeding years: B. S. Mathematics in 1966, B.S. Mathematics majoring in Actuarial Science in 1974; B.S. Microbiology in 1981; B.S. major in Biology in 1982, B.S. Mathematics major in Computer Science in 1984, which was converted into B.S. Computer Science in 1999, B.S. Information Technology and B.S. Information Management in 1999, B.S. Applied Physics in 2001, and B.S. Applied Mathematics in 2009. Degree programs * Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics Major in Actuarial Science ** Actuarial Science is applied mathematics that involves the study of evaluation of risks, analysis of financial problems, application of mathematical probabilities, and management of programs to reduce adverse financial effects on people’s lives. * Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics Major in Instrumentation ** Applied Physics is the application of all branches of physics to the broad realm of practical problems in engineering, science and industry. This BS Applied Physics program blends the concrete and the abstract aspects of physics. It provides the students with an opportunity to acquire abilities for continued advancement in technology from fundamental principles in physics. This also promotes the development of strong analytical skills as well as experimental capability through its upper core programs. The instrumentation specialty involves training in design and utilization of scientific instruments. * Bachelor of Science in Biology ** Biology deals with the study of living organisms and all aspects of their existence. This can be achieved through the mastery of the various disciplines and application of laboratory techniques that motivate the students to undertake researches on plant, animal and microbial life.

Over 12,000 papers have been archived to date. It is freely accessible, aligned with the Open Access (OA) movement and is a voluntary enterprise.  About E-LIS  E-LIS is the largest international open repository in the field of Library and Information Science. It is freely accessible and users are able to search, access, and archive full-text documents = Objectives = E-LIS is based on the philosophy and principles of open source software whereby people from all over the world co-operate in building freely-licensed software. Its aim is to further the open access philosophy by making full text Library and Information Science documents visible, accessible, harvestable, searchable, and usable by any potential user with access to the Internet. The objectives of the E-LIS are: * To improve knowledge of the building and management of open archives working practically in the field within the framework of Open Digital Libraries; * Not only to promote open archives in various disciplinary environments, but also to create a valid and credible model in the Library and Information Science discipline for the building of a global LIS archive; * To establish a base for communal work between librarians information technology professionals, and to enhance the Open Access movement. = Governance = E-LIS is established, managed and maintained by an international team of 73 librarians and information scientists from 47 countries and support for 22 languages. The development of an international Library and Information Science network has been stimulated by the extension of the open access concept to LIS works and facilitated by the dissemination of material within the LIS community. The editorial work is performed under the management of an executive board that drives the policies, alliances, new actions, collaborations and any topic that is of interest to E-LIS. The executive board is made up of two chief executives, two representatives of the editorial team, two representatives of CIEPI - International Centre for Research in Information Strategy and Development -which is the association created by E-LIS members for representing institutionally the E-LIS interest as a legal entity - and two technical representatives that have deep technical experience on document repositories. In addition to this structure, the advisory board appointed to advise the executive board is formed by institutions and people that support E-LIS. = Users = There are currently 8,000 authors represented in E-LIS. It is possible to deposit works in any language, although abstracts and keywords must be included in English, in addition to abstracts and keywords in the original language of the document. In a broad sense, any document related to LIS that is electronically available, can be submitted to the archive in PDF or HTML. The types of user are: librarians, academics, archivists, information management specialists from: academic libraries, archives, government libraries, health libraries, information centres, museums, national libraries, private libraries, public libraries, school libraries or universities. E-LIS provides features for editors and users including automatic alerts for editors, full metadata display of metadata records, full-text search, browsing by user, a counter in the homepage as well as statistics. A strength of the repository is the national editors from 47 countries, carrying out the quality control of the metadata. Each editor approves documents of their own country and coordinates the actions on the promotion of E-LIS in their country. All the editors share this common vision and mission, while contributing to E-LIS with their own experience and competence. E-LIS deals with each country's specific issues to decide the best solution for technical and non-technical barriers so that international visibility can be promoted whilst national interests are served. International co-operation can facilitate debate on current issues. = Copyright = Copyright is one of the key issues for E-LIS. The submission of documents and their accessibility is not an infringement of copyright. All work in E-LIS remains property of the author. If the document is a preprint, the process is quite straightforward because there are no limits concerning copyright: the author holds the exclusive copyright for the pre-refereed preprints. For the refereed postprint, the issue becomes more complex. The author might have given the rights to, for instance, a publisher. The right to self-archive the refereed postprint is a legal matter because the copyright transfer agreement applies to the text. Most journals permit self-archiving, but it depends on the publisher's copyright policy. Authors can also deposit the postprint inside the archive with restricted access. Some publishers have stated that they grant these rights as a standard procedure. Copyright law gives the creator of copyrighted work exclusive rights, which may be both segmented and transferred to others. = Funding = Being a nonprofit and voluntary initiative, in the past E-LIS has received small funds from the Spanish Ministry of Education, but there is no regular funding of any kind from any institution or state. = Activities = The current short-term plan of activities is described in the \\"Acropolis Strategy\\". The \\"Acropolis Strategy\\" roadmaps the actions of the E-LIS community in 2011. It was drafted by the E-LIS Executive Board and E-LIS staff and sets critical goals, which are expected to improve the current situation of E-LIS services. The \\"Acropolis Strategy\\" is continuously referred to in order to assess the progress of the E-LIS community activities. One of E-LIS Team prime priorities is to publish the bibliographic data in E-LIS as Linked Open Data.

Its use in literature goes back at least as far as Olaf Stapledon's science fiction novel Last and First Men (1930).\\"Group Ego\\"\\"Coalescing minds: brain uploading-related group mind scenarios\\" by Kaj Sotala, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki A group mind might be formed by any fictional plot device that facilitates brain to brain communication, such as telepathy. This term may be used interchangeably with hive mind. \\"Hive mind\\" describes a group mind in which the linked individuals have no identity or free will and are possessed or mind-controlled as extensions of the hive mind. It is frequently associated with the concept of an entity that spreads among individuals and suppresses or subsumes their consciousness in the process of integrating them into its own collective consciousness. The concept of the group or hive mind is an intelligent version of real-life superorganisms such as an ant colony or beehive. List of hive minds As conceived in speculative fiction, hive minds often imply (almost) complete loss (or lack) of individuality, identity, and personhood. The individuals forming the hive may specialize in different functions, similarly to social insects. =Books=Literature * The Bebebebeque in Larry Niven's The Draco Tavern. * The Bicameral Order of posthuman monks who have integrated science as religion, in Peter Watts's novel Echopraxia * The Boaty- Bits in the Saga of Cuckoo by Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson. *The Bugs in Robert A.

The term appears in sociobiology, political science and in context of mass peer review and crowdsourcing applications. It may involve consensus, social capital and formalisms such as voting systems, social media and other means of quantifying mass activity. Collective IQ is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Collective intelligence has also been attributed to bacteria and animals. It can be understood as an emergent property from the synergies among: 1) data- information-knowledge; 2) software-hardware; and 3) experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone;Glenn, Jerome C. Collective Intelligence – One of the Next Big Things, Futura 4/2009, Finnish Society for Futures Studies, Helsinki, Finland or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.Glenn, Jerome C. Chapter 5, 2008 State of the Future. The Millennium Project, Washington, DC 2008 This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as \\"symbiotic intelligence\\" by Norman Lee Johnson.Norman Lee Johnson, Collective Science site The concept is used in sociology, business, computer science and mass communications: it also appears in science fiction. Pierre Lévy defines collective intelligence as, \\"It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or hypostatized communities.\\" According to researchers Pierre Lévy and Derrick de Kerckhove, it refers to capacity of networked ICTs (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.Flew, Terry New Media: An Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 21 Collective intelligence strongly contributes to the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S. Raymond (1998) and JC Herz (2005), open source intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations (Flew 2008). Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence.Jenkins, Henry Convergence Culture: Where old and new media collide. New York: New York University Press, 2006, p. 259 Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes to a better understanding of diverse society. Similar to the g factor (g) for general individual intelligence, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor c factor for groups indicating a group's ability to perform a wide range of tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are derived from g. Similarly as g is highly interrelated with the concept of IQ, this measurement of collective intelligence can be interpreted as intelligence quotient for groups (Group-IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se. Causes for c and predictive validity are investigated as well. Collective intelligence is used to help create widely known platforms including Google, Wikipedia and political groups. Google is a major search engine that is made of millions of websites that have been created by people all around the world. It has the ability to share knowledge and creativity with each other to collaborate and expand thoughts and expressions. Google includes five key dynamics within their teams to create a well-collaborated system. Dynamics include psychological safety, dependability, structure & clarity, meaning of work and impact of work. Their ideas behind their rediscovery of collective intelligence is to ensure that all workers can express themselves without any fear of potential embarrassment. Google's teamwork is said to be one of the main reasons for their success by including the use of emotional and collective intelligence to ensure teamwork is involved in any discussions. The system behind Google exemplifies the combining of knowledge of the web-to- people not just knowledge of people-to-people. Writers who have influenced the idea of collective intelligence include Francis Galton, Douglas Hofstadter (1979), Peter Russell (1983), Tom Atlee (1993), Pierre Lévy (1994), Howard Bloom (1995), Francis Heylighen (1995), Douglas Engelbart, Louis Rosenberg, Cliff Joslyn, Ron Dembo, Gottfried Mayer-Kress (2003).  History  H.G. Wells World Brain (1936–1938) The concept (although not so named) originated in 1785 with the Marquis de Condorcet, whose \\"jury theorem\\" states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases with the number of members of the group (see Condorcet's jury theorem). Many theorists have interpreted Aristotle's statement in the Politics that \\"a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out of a single purse\\" to mean that just as many may bring different dishes to the table, so in a deliberation many may contribute different pieces of information to generate a better decision. Recent scholarship, however, suggests that this was probably not what Aristotle meant but is a modern interpretation based on what we now know about team intelligence. A precursor of the concept is found in entomologist William Morton Wheeler's observation that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism (1910).Wheeler, W. M. (1910). Ants: their structure, development and behavior (Vol. 9). Columbia University Press. Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in ants that acted like the cells of a single beast he called a superorganism. In 1912 Émile Durkheim identified society as the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in \\"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\\" that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time.Émile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, 1912. Other antecedents are Vladimir Vernadsky and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's concept of \\"noosphere\\" and H.G. Wells's concept of \\"world brain\\" (see also the term \\"global brain\\"). Peter Russell, Elisabet Sahtouris, and Barbara Marx Hubbard (originator of the term \\"conscious evolution\\") are inspired by the visions of a noosphere – a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence – an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher Pierre Lévy. In a 1962 research report, Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: \\"Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone\\".Engelbart, Douglas (1962) Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework – section on Team Cooperation In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society.Engelbart, Douglas (1994)Boosting Collective IQ (Slide Handouts) – 'Collective IQ' defined on Slide 4; also (1994) BBN Distinguished Guest Lecture (Video) – 'Collective IQ' defined @16:56 \\"CoDIAK\\" The idea of collective intelligence also forms the framework for contemporary democratic theories often referred to as epistemic democracy. Epistemic democratic theories refer to the capacity of the populace, either through deliberation or aggregation of knowledge, to track the truth and relies on mechanisms to synthesize and apply collective intelligence. Collective intelligence was introduced into the machine learning community in the late 20th century, and matured into a broader consideration of how to design \\"collectives\\" of self-interested adaptive agents to meet a system-wide goal. This was related to single-agent work on \\"reward shaping\\" and has been taken forward by numerous researchers in the game theory and engineering communities.  Dimensions  Complex adaptive systems model Howard Bloom has discussed mass behavior – collective behavior from the level of quarks to the level of bacterial, plant, animal, and human societies. He stresses the biological adaptations that have turned most of this earth's living beings into components of what he calls \\"a learning machine\\". In 1986 Bloom combined the concepts of apoptosis, parallel distributed processing, group selection, and the superorganism to produce a theory of how collective intelligence works.Howard Bloom, The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History, 1995 Later he showed how the collective intelligences of competing bacterial colonies and human societies can be explained in terms of computer-generated \\"complex adaptive systems\\" and the \\"genetic algorithms\\", concepts pioneered by John Holland. Bloom traced the evolution of collective intelligence to our bacterial ancestors 1 billion years ago and demonstrated how a multi-species intelligence has worked since the beginning of life.Howard Bloom, Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century, 2000 Ant societies exhibit more intelligence, in terms of technology, than any other animal except for humans and co-operate in keeping livestock, for example aphids for \\"milking\\". Leaf cutters care for fungi and carry leaves to feed the fungi. David SkrbinaSkrbina, D., 2001, Participation, Organization, and Mind: Toward a Participatory Worldview, ch. 8, Doctoral Thesis, Centre for Action Research in Professional Practice, School of Management, University of Bath: England cites the concept of a 'group mind' as being derived from Plato's concept of panpsychism (that mind or consciousness is omnipresent and exists in all matter). He develops the concept of a 'group mind' as articulated by Thomas Hobbes in \\"Leviathan\\" and Fechner's arguments for a collective consciousness of mankind. He cites Durkheim as the most notable advocate of a \\"collective consciousness\\" and Teilhard de Chardin as a thinker who has developed the philosophical implications of the group mind. Tom Atlee focuses primarily on humans and on work to upgrade what Howard Bloom calls \\"the group IQ\\". Atlee feels that collective intelligence can be encouraged \\"to overcome 'groupthink' and individual cognitive bias in order to allow a collective to cooperate on one process – while achieving enhanced intellectual performance.\\" George Pór defined the collective intelligence phenomenon as \\"the capacity of human communities to evolve towards higher order complexity and harmony, through such innovation mechanisms as differentiation and integration, competition and collaboration.\\"George Pór, Blog of Collective Intelligence Atlee and Pór state that \\"collective intelligence also involves achieving a single focus of attention and standard of metrics which provide an appropriate threshold of action\\". Their approach is rooted in scientific community metaphor. The term group intelligence is sometimes used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence as a measure of group intelligence and group creativity. The idea is that a measure of collective intelligence covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction. The features of composition that lead to increased levels of collective intelligence in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group. Atlee and Pór suggest that the field of collective intelligence should primarily be seen as a human enterprise in which mind-sets, a willingness to share and an openness to the value of distributed intelligence for the common good are paramount, though group theory and artificial intelligence have something to offer. Individuals who respect collective intelligence are confident of their own abilities and recognize that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of any individual parts. Maximizing collective intelligence relies on the ability of an organization to accept and develop \\"The Golden Suggestion\\", which is any potentially useful input from any member. Groupthink often hampers collective intelligence by limiting input to a select few individuals or filtering potential Golden Suggestions without fully developing them to implementation. Robert David Steele Vivas in The New Craft of Intelligence portrayed all citizens as \\"intelligence minutemen,\\" drawing only on legal and ethical sources of information, able to create a \\"public intelligence\\" that keeps public officials and corporate managers honest, turning the concept of \\"national intelligence\\" (previously concerned about spies and secrecy) on its head. Stigmergic Collaboration: a theoretical framework for mass collaboration According to Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, collective intelligence is mass collaboration. In order for this concept to happen, four principles need to exist; ; Openness: Sharing ideas and intellectual property: though these resources provide the edge over competitors more benefits accrue from allowing others to share ideas and gain significant improvement and scrutiny through collaboration. ; Peering: Horizontal organization as with the 'opening up' of the Linux program where users are free to modify and develop it provided that they make it available for others. Peering succeeds because it encourages self-organization – a style of production that works more effectively than hierarchical management for certain tasks. ; Sharing: Companies have started to share some ideas while maintaining some degree of control over others, like potential and critical patent rights. Limiting all intellectual property shuts out opportunities, while sharing some expands markets and brings out products faster. ; Acting Globally: The advancement in communication technology has prompted the rise of global companies at low overhead costs. The internet is widespread, therefore a globally integrated company has no geographical boundaries and may access new markets, ideas and technology.Tapscott, D., & Williams, A. D. (2008). Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything , USA: Penguin Group  Collective intelligence factor c  Scree plot showing percent of explained variance for the first factors in Woolley et al.'s (2010) two original studies. A new scientific understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on task performance. The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are highly correlated with full- scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se. Mathematically, c and g are both variables summarizing positive correlations among different tasks supposing that performance on one task is comparable with performance on other similar tasks. c thus is a source of variance among groups and can only be considered as a group's standing on the c factor compared to other groups in a given relevant population. The concept is in contrast to competing hypotheses including other correlational structures to explain group intelligence, such as a composition out of several equally important but independent factors as found in individual personality research. Besides, this scientific idea also aims to explore the causes affecting collective intelligence, such as group size, collaboration tools or group members' interpersonal skills. The MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, for instance, announced the detection of The Genome of Collective Intelligence as one of its main goals aiming to develop a taxonomy of organizational building blocks, or genes, that can be combined and recombined to harness the intelligence of crowds. = Causes = Individual intelligence is shown to be genetically and environmentally influenced. Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons why certain groups perform more intelligent than other groups given that c is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members. According to Woolley et al.'s results, neither team cohesion nor motivation or satisfaction is correlated with c. However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: the variance in the number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity and the proportion of females. All three had similar predictive power for c, but only social sensitivity was statistically significant (b=0.33, P=0.05). The number speaking turns indicates that \\"groups where a few people dominated the conversation were less collectively intelligent than those with a more equal distribution of conversational turn-taking\\". Hence, providing multiple team members the chance to speak up made a group more intelligent. Group members' social sensitivity was measured via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RME) and correlated .26 with c. Hereby, participants are asked to detect thinking or feeling expressed in other peoples' eyes presented on pictures and assessed in a multiple choice format. The test aims to measure peoples' theory of mind (ToM), also called 'mentalizing' Pdf. or 'mind reading', which refers to the ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires or intents, to other people and in how far people understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions or perspectives different from their own ones. RME is a ToM test for adults that shows sufficient test-retest reliability and constantly differentiates control groups from individuals with functional autism or Asperger Syndrome. It is one of the most widely accepted and well- validated tests for ToM within adults. ToM can be regarded as an associated subset of skills and abilities within the broader concept of emotional intelligence. The proportion of females as a predictor of c was largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobel z = 1.93, P= 0.03) which is in vein with previous research showing that women score higher on social sensitivity tests. While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed in an interview with the Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the high social sensitivity of group members. It is theorized that the collective intelligence factor c is an emergent property resulting from bottom-up as well as top-down processes. Hereby, bottom-up processes cover aggregated group-member characteristics. Top-down processes cover group structures and norms that influence a group's way of collaborating and coordinating. = Processes = Predictors for the collective intelligence factor c. Suggested by Woolley, Aggarwal & Malone (2015)  Top-down processes  Top-down processes cover group interaction, such as structures, processes, and norms. An example of such top-down processes is conversational turn-taking. Research further suggest that collectively intelligent groups communicate more in general as well as more equally; same applies for participation and is shown for face-to- face as well as online groups communicating only via writing.  Bottom-up processes  Bottom-up processes include group composition, namely the characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level. An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members. Furthermore, collective intelligence was found to be related to a group's cognitive diversity including thinking styles and perspectives. Groups that are moderately diverse in cognitive style have higher collective intelligence than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.  Serial vs Parallel processes  For most of human history, collective intelligence was confined to small tribal groups in which opinions were aggregated through real-time parallel interactions among members. In modern times, mass communication, mass media, and networking technologies have enabled collective intelligence to span massive groups, distributed across continents and time-zones. To accommodate this shift in scale, collective intelligence in large-scale groups been dominated by serialized polling processes such as aggregating up-votes, likes, and ratings over time. In engineering, aggregating many engineering decisions allows for identifying typical good designs. While modern systems benefit from larger group size, the serialized process has been found to introduce substantial noise that distorts the collective output of the group. In one significant study of serialized collective intelligence, it was found that the first vote contributed to a serialized voting system can distort the final result by 34%. To address the problems of serialized aggregation of input among large-scale groups, recent advancements collective intelligence have worked to replace serialized votes, polls, and markets, with parallel systems such as \\"human swarms\\" modeled after synchronous swarms in nature. Based on natural process of Swarm Intelligence, these artificial swarms of networked humans enable participants to work together in parallel to answer questions and make predictions as an emergent collective intelligence. In one high-profile example, a human swarm challenge by CBS Interactive to predict the Kentucky Derby. The swarm correctly predicted the first four horses, in order, defying 542–1 odds and turning a $20 bet into $10,800. The value of parallel collective intelligence was demonstrated in medical applications by researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine and Unanimous AI in a set of published studies wherein groups of human doctors were connected by real-time swarming algorithms and tasked with diagnosing chest x-rays for the presence of pneumonia. When working together as \\"human swarms,\\" the groups of experienced radiologists demonstrated a 33% reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to traditional methods. = Evidence = Standardized Regression Coefficients for the collective intelligence factor c as found in Woolley et al.'s (2010) two original studies. c and average (maximum) member intelligence scores are regressed on the criterion tasks. Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone (2010), the originators of this scientific understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly recruited from the public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the McGrath Task Circumplex, a well- established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a factor analysis. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor c underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a general individual intelligence factor g typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests. Afterwards, a more complex criterion task was absolved by each group measuring whether the extracted c factor had predictive power for performance outside the original task batteries. Criterion tasks were playing checkers (draughts) against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a regression analysis using both individual intelligence of group members and c to predict performance on the criterion tasks, c had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with c, c was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor c, because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that c is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ. Engel et al. (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al., they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes. The online collaborating participants, however, did neither know nor see each other at all. The authors conclude that scores on the RME must be related to a broader set of abilities of social reasoning than only drawing inferences from other people's eye expressions. A collective intelligence factor c in the sense of Woolley et al. was further found in groups of MBA students working together over the course of a semester, in online gaming groups as well as in groups from different cultures and groups in different contexts in terms of short-term versus long-term groups. None of these investigations considered team members' individual intelligence scores as control variables. Note as well that the field of collective intelligence research is quite young and published empirical evidence is relatively rare yet. However, various proposals and working papers are in progress or already completed but (supposedly) still in a scholarly peer reviewing publication process. = Predictive validity = Next to predicting a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks as shown in the original experiments, the collective intelligence factor c was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months. Thereby, highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better. This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker. Individual intelligence can be used to predict plenty of life outcomes from school attainment and career success to health outcomes and even mortality. Whether collective intelligence is able to predict other outcomes besides group performance on mental tasks has still to be investigated. = Potential connections to individual intelligence = Gladwell (2008) showed that the relationship between individual IQ and success works only to a certain point and that additional IQ points over an estimate of IQ 120 do not translate into real life advantages. If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time or the question of improving intelligence. Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training, a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies. Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading literary fiction as well as watching drama movies. In how far such training ultimately improves collective intelligence through social sensitivity remains an open question. There are further more advanced concepts and factor models attempting to explain individual cognitive ability including the categorization of intelligence in fluid and crystallized intelligence or the hierarchical model of intelligence differences. Further supplementing explanations and conceptualizations for the factor structure of the Genomes of collective intelligence besides a general c factor', though, are missing yet. = Controversies = Other scholars explain team performance by aggregating team members' general intelligence to the team level instead of building an own overall collective intelligence measure. Devine and Philips (2001) showed in a meta-analysis that mean cognitive ability predicts team performance in laboratory settings (.37) as well as field settings (.14) – note that this is only a small effect. Suggesting a strong dependence on the relevant tasks, other scholars showed that tasks requiring a high degree of communication and cooperation are found to be most influenced by the team member with the lowest cognitive ability. Tasks in which selecting the best team member is the most successful strategy, are shown to be most influenced by the member with the highest cognitive ability. Since Woolley et al.'s results do not show any influence of group satisfaction, group cohesiveness, or motivation, they, at least implicitly, challenge these concepts regarding the importance for group performance in general and thus contrast meta-analytically proven evidence concerning the positive effects of group cohesion, motivation and satisfaction on group performance. Noteworthy is also that the involved researchers among the confirming findings widely overlap with each other and with the authors participating in the original first study around Anita Woolley.  Alternative mathematical techniques  Computational collective intelligence = Computational Collective Intelligence, by Tadeusz Szuba In 2001, Tadeusz (Tad) Szuba from the AGH University in Poland proposed a formal model for the phenomenon of collective intelligence. It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.Szuba T., Computational Collective Intelligence, 420 pages, Wiley NY, 2001 In this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic. They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements. Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence. Thus, a non-Turing model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of social structure and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as \\"the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure\\". While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation. Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies. = Collective intelligence quotient = One measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a \\"collective intelligence quotient\\" (or \\"cooperation quotient\\") – which can be normalized from the \\"individual\\" intelligence quotient (IQ) – thus making it possible to determine the marginal intelligence added by each new individual participating in the collective action, thus using metrics to avoid the hazards of group think and stupidity.  Applications  Elicitation of point estimates = Here, the goal is to get an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd. = Opinion aggregation = In this situation, opinions are gathered from the crowd regarding an idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon's star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users. = Idea Collection = In these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a data science problem (as in Kaggle) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in Threadless) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon's Mechanical Turk). The objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas. James Surowiecki divides the advantages of disorganized decision-making into three main categories, which are cognition, cooperation and coordination. = Cognition = Market judgment  Because of the Internet's ability to rapidly convey large amounts of information throughout the world, the use of collective intelligence to predict stock prices and stock price direction has become increasingly viable. Websites aggregate stock market information that is as current as possible so professional or amateur stock analysts can publish their viewpoints, enabling amateur investors to submit their financial opinions and create an aggregate opinion. The opinion of all investor can be weighed equally so that a pivotal premise of the effective application of collective intelligence can be applied: the masses, including a broad spectrum of stock market expertise, can be utilized to more accurately predict the behavior of financial markets. Collective intelligence underpins the efficient-market hypothesis of Eugene Fama – although the term collective intelligence is not used explicitly in his paper. Fama cites research conducted by Michael Jensen in which 89 out of 115 selected funds underperformed relative to the index during the period from 1955 to 1964. But after removing the loading charge (up-front fee) only 72 underperformed while after removing brokerage costs only 58 underperformed. On the basis of such evidence index funds became popular investment vehicles using the collective intelligence of the market, rather than the judgement of professional fund managers, as an investment strategy.  Predictions in politics and technology  Voting methods used in the United States 2016 Political parties mobilize large numbers of people to form policy, select candidates and finance and run election campaigns. Knowledge focusing through various voting methods allows perspectives to converge through the assumption that uninformed voting is to some degree random and can be filtered from the decision process leaving only a residue of informed consensus. Critics point out that often bad ideas, misunderstandings, and misconceptions are widely held, and that structuring of the decision process must favor experts who are presumably less prone to random or misinformed voting in a given context. Companies such as Affinnova (acquired by Nielsen), Google, InnoCentive, Marketocracy, and Threadless have successfully employed the concept of collective intelligence in bringing about the next generation of technological changes through their research and development (R&D;), customer service, and knowledge management. An example of such application is Google's Project Aristotle in 2012, where the effect of collective intelligence on team makeup was examined in hundreds of the company's R&D; teams. = Cooperation = Networks of trust  Application of collective intelligence in the Millennium Project In 2012, the Global Futures Collective Intelligence System (GFIS) was created by The Millennium Project, which epitomizes collective intelligence as the synergistic intersection among data/information/knowledge, software/hardware, and expertise/insights that has a recursive learning process for better decision-making than the individual players alone. New media are often associated with the promotion and enhancement of collective intelligence. The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users. Francis Heylighen, Valentin Turchin, and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and cybernetics. In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a global brain. The developer of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. J.C.R. Licklider, demanded more accessibility and utility.Weiss, A. (2005). The Power of Collective Intelligence. Collective Intelligence, pp. 19–23 The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. Henry Jenkins, a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture . He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating \\"whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals\\". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills. Collective intelligence is not merely a quantitative contribution of information from all cultures, it is also qualitative. Lévy and de Kerckhove consider CI from a mass communications perspective, focusing on the ability of networked information and communication technologies to enhance the community knowledge pool. They suggest that these communications tools enable humans to interact and to share and collaborate with both ease and speed (Flew 2008). With the development of the Internet and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as Wikipedia, is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to \\"harness the hive\\" Researchers at the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers.MIT Center for Collective Intelligence . Cci.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-13. In this context collective intelligence is often confused with shared knowledge. The former is the sum total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community.Jenkins, H. 2006. Convergence Culture. New York: New York University Press. Collective intelligence as represented by Web 2.0 has less user engagement than collaborative intelligence. An art project using Web 2.0 platforms is \\"Shared Galaxy\\", an experiment developed by an anonymous artist to create a collective identity that shows up as one person on several platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and Second Life. The password is written in the profiles and the accounts named \\"Shared Galaxy\\" are open to be used by anyone. In this way many take part in being one. Another art project using collective intelligence to produce artistic work is Curatron, where a large group of artists together decides on a smaller group that they think would make a good collaborative group.

Parenting social network and collaborative tagging as pillars for automatic IPTV content blocking system In social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging), users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. The resulting information structure can be seen as reflecting the collective knowledge (or collective intelligence) of a community of users and is commonly called a \\"Folksonomy\\", and the process can be captured by models of collaborative tagging. Recent research using data from the social bookmarking website Delicious, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics.Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging, Proceedings 6th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211–220, ACM Press, 2007. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies.Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems, ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009. Such vocabularies can be seen as a form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social bookmarking.Carlos J. Costa, January 2012.  P2P business  Research performed by Tapscott and Williams has provided a few examples of the benefits of collective intelligence to business: ;Talent utilization :At the rate technology is changing, no firm can fully keep up in the innovations needed to compete. Instead, smart firms are drawing on the power of mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities. ;Demand creation :Firms can create a new market for complementary goods by engaging in open source community. Firms also are able to expand into new fields that they previously would not have been able to without the addition of resources and collaboration from the community. This creates, as mentioned before, a new market for complementary goods for the products in said new fields. ;Costs reduction :Mass collaboration can help to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The results will be more personal, robust and error-free products created in a short amount of time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R&D; outside the confines of the company.  Open source software  Cultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the Trainz product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon \\"the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software\\".John A.L.

Gosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of alternate reality gaming. This genre, he describes as an \\"across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences\\"Gosney, J.W, 2005, Beyond Reality: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming, Thomson Course Technology, Boston. as events that happen outside the game reality \\"reach out\\" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires \\"the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players\\"; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and \\"collective intelligence\\" in order to solve the mystery of the game.  Benefits of co-operation  Co-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co- operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits. For example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves.\\"Surowiecki, J., 2007 'The Wisdom of crowds. Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few' = Coordination = Ad- hoc communities  Military, trade unions, and corporations satisfy some definitions of CI – the most rigorous definition would require a capacity to respond to very arbitrary conditions without orders or guidance from \\"law\\" or \\"customers\\" to constrain actions. Online advertising companies are using collective intelligence to bypass traditional marketing and creative agencies.Lee, Sang M., et al. \\"Success factors of platform leadership in web 2.0 service business.\\" Service Business 4.2 (2010): 89–103. The UNU open platform for \\"human swarming\\" (or \\"social swarming\\") establishes real-time closed-loop systems around groups of networked users molded after biological swarms, enabling human participants to behave as a unified collective intelligence. When connected to UNU, groups of distributed users collectively answer questions and make predictions in real-time.Rosenberg, L.B., \\"Human swarming, a real-time method for parallel distributed intelligence,\\" in Swarm/Human Blended Intelligence Workshop (SHBI), 2015, vol., no., pp.1–7, 28–29 Sept. 2015 doi: 10.1109/SHBI.2015.7321685 Early testing shows that human swarms can out-predict individuals. In 2016, an UNU swarm was challenged by a reporter to predict the winners of the Kentucky Derby, and successfully picked the first four horses, in order, beating 540 to 1 odds. Specialized information sites such as Digital Photography Review or Camera Labs is an example of collective intelligence. Anyone who has an access to the internet can contribute to distributing their knowledge over the world through the specialized information sites. In learner-generated context a group of users marshal resources to create an ecology that meets their needs often (but not only) in relation to the co-configuration, co-creation and co-design of a particular learning space that allows learners to create their own context.Luckin, R., du Boulay, B., Smith, H., Underwood, J., Fitzpatrick, G., Holmberg, J., Kerawalla, L., Tunley, H., Brewster, D. and Pearce, D. (2005), 'Using Mobile Technology to Create Flexible Learning Contexts '. Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 22.Luckin, R. (2006), Understanding Learning Contexts as Ecologies of Resources: From the Zone of Proximal Development to Learner Generated Contexts. Paper presented at the Proceedings of World Conference on Elearning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2006.Luckin, R., Shurville, S. and Browne, T. (2007), 'Initiating e-learning by stealth, participation and consultation in a late majority institution '. Journal of Organisational Transformation and Social Change, 3 (3), 317–332. Learner-generated contexts represent an ad hoc community that facilitates coordination of collective action in a network of trust. An example of learner-generated context is found on the Internet when collaborative users pool knowledge in a \\"shared intelligence space\\". As the Internet has developed so has the concept of CI as a shared public forum. The global accessibility and availability of the Internet has allowed more people than ever to contribute and access ideas. (Flew 2008) Games such as The Sims Series, and Second Life are designed to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations. For them, collective intelligence has become a norm. In Terry Flew's discussion of 'interactivity' in the online games environment, the ongoing interactive dialogue between users and game developers,Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) \\"Games: Technology, Industry, Culture\\" in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114. he refers to Pierre Lévy's concept of Collective Intelligence and argues this is active in videogames as clans or guilds in MMORPG constantly work to achieve goals. Henry Jenkins proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new participatory culture arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends.Henry Jenkins (2002) in Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) Games: Technology, Industry, Culture in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114. Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content. Secondly, the rise of subcultures promoting such creations, and lastly, the growth of value adding media conglomerates, which foster image, idea and narrative flow.  Coordinating collective actions  The cast of After School Improv learns an important lesson about improvisation and life Improvisational actors also experience a type of collective intelligence which they term \\"group mind\\", as theatrical improvisation relies on mutual cooperation and agreement, leading to the unity of \\"group mind\\". Growth of the Internet and mobile telecom has also produced \\"swarming\\" or \\"rendezvous\\" events that enable meetings or even dates on demand. The full impact has yet to be felt but the anti-globalization movement, for example, relies heavily on e-mail, cell phones, pagers, SMS and other means of organizing. The Indymedia organization does this in a more journalistic way. Such resources could combine into a form of collective intelligence accountable only to the current participants yet with some strong moral or linguistic guidance from generations of contributors – or even take on a more obviously democratic form to advance shared goal. A further application of collective intelligence is found in the \\"Community Engineering for Innovations\\".Jan Marco Leimeister, Michael Huber, Ulrich Bretschneider, Helmut Krcmar (2009): Leveraging Crowdsourcing: Activation-Supporting Components for IT-Based Ideas Competition. In: Journal of Management Information Systems (2009), Volume: 26, Issue: 1, Publisher: M.E. Sharpe Inc., Pages: 197–224, , , Winfried Ebner; Jan Marco Leimeister; Helmut Krcmar (2009): Community Engineering for Innovations – The Ideas Competition as a method to nurture a Virtual Community for Innovations. In: R&D; Management, 39 (4), pp 342–356 In such an integrated framework proposed by Ebner et al., idea competitions and virtual communities are combined to better realize the potential of the collective intelligence of the participants, particularly in open-source R&D.; In management theory the use of collective intelligence and crowd sourcing leads to innovations and very robust answers to quantitative issues. Therefore, collective intelligence and crowd sourcing is not necessaryly leading to the best solution to economic problems, but to a stable, good solution.  Coordination in different types of tasks  Collective actions or tasks require different amounts of coordination depending on the complexity of the task. Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: \\"When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish\\". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs.Kittur, A., Lee, B. and Kraut, R. E. (2009) 'Coordination in collective intelligence: The role of team structure and task interdependence', Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1495–1504. Group collective intelligence is a property that emerges through coordination from both bottom-up and top-down processes. In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work.[18] Woolley, A. W., Aggarwal, I. and Malone, T. W. (2015) 'Collective Intelligence and Group Performance', Current Directions in Psychological Science, 24(6), pp. 420–424.  Alternative views A tool for combating self-preservation= Tom Atlee reflects that, although humans have an innate ability to gather and analyze data, they are affected by culture, education and social institutions. A single person tends to make decisions motivated by self-preservation. Therefore, without collective intelligence, humans may drive themselves into extinction based on their selfish needs.Atlee, T. (2008). Reflections on the evolution of choice and collective intelligence , Retrieved 26 August 2008 =Separation from IQism= Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder quotes Bowles and Gintis (1976) that in order to truly define collective intelligence, it is crucial to separate 'intelligence' from IQism. They go on to argue that intelligence is an achievement and can only be developed if allowed to. For example, earlier on, groups from the lower levels of society are severely restricted from aggregating and pooling their intelligence. This is because the elites fear that the collective intelligence would convince the people to rebel. If there is no such capacity and relations, there would be no infrastructure on which collective intelligence is built. This reflects how powerful collective intelligence can be if left to develop. =Artificial intelligence views= Skeptics, especially those critical of artificial intelligence and more inclined to believe that risk of bodily harm and bodily action are the basis of all unity between people, are more likely to emphasize the capacity of a group to take action and withstand harm as one fluid mass mobilization, shrugging off harms the way a body shrugs off the loss of a few cells. This strain of thought is most obvious in the anti-globalization movement and characterized by the works of John Zerzan, Carol Moore, and Starhawk, who typically shun academics. These theorists are more likely to refer to ecological and collective wisdom and to the role of consensus process in making ontological distinctions than to any form of \\"intelligence\\" as such, which they often argue does not exist, or is mere \\"cleverness\\". Harsh critics of artificial intelligence on ethical grounds are likely to promote collective wisdom-building methods, such as the new tribalists and the Gaians. Whether these can be said to be collective intelligence systems is an open question. Some, e.g. Bill Joy, simply wish to avoid any form of autonomous artificial intelligence and seem willing to work on rigorous collective intelligence in order to remove any possible niche for AI. In contrast to these views, companies such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower are using collective intelligence and crowdsourcing or consensus-based assessment to collect the enormous amounts of data for machine learning algorithms. = Solving climate change = Global collective intelligence is seen as the key in solving the challenges humankind faces now and in the future. Climate change is an example of a global issue which collective intelligence is currently trying to tackle. With the help of collective intelligence applications such as online crowdsourcing, people across the globe are collaborating in developing solutions to climate change.

Eusociality (from Greek εὖ eu \\"good\\" and social), the highest level of organization of sociality, is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care (including care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes called castes. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste. Eusociality exists in certain insects, crustaceans and mammals. It is mostly observed and studied in the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) and in Isoptera (termites). A colony has caste differences: queens and reproductive males take the roles of the sole reproducers, while soldiers and workers work together to create a living situation favorable for the brood. In addition to Hymenoptera and Isoptera, there are two known eusocial vertebrates among rodents: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat. Some shrimp, such as Synalpheus regalis, are also eusocial. E. O. Wilson and others have claimed that humans have evolved a weak form of eusociality (e.g., with menopause), but these arguments have been disputed.  History  The term \\"eusocial\\" was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra, who used it to describe nesting behavior in Halictine bees. Batra observed the cooperative behavior of the bees, males and females alike, as they took responsibility for at least one duty (i.e., burrowing, cell construction, oviposition) within the colony. The cooperativeness was essential as the activity of one labor division greatly influenced the activity of another. For example, the size of pollen balls, a source of food, depended on when the egg-laying females oviposited. If the provisioning by pollen collectors was incomplete by the time the egg- laying female occupied a cell and oviposited, the size of the pollen balls would be small, leading to small offspring. Batra applied this term to species in which a colony is started by a single individual. Batra described other species, wherein the founder is accompanied by numerous helpers--as in a swarm of bees or ants--as \\"hypersocial\\". In 1969, Charles D. Michener further expanded Batra's classification with his comparative study of social behavior in bees. He observed multiple species of bees (Apoidea) in order to investigate the different levels of animal sociality, all of which are different stages that a colony may pass through. Eusociality, which is the highest level of animal sociality a species can attain, specifically had three characteristics that distinguished it from the other levels: # \\"Egg-layers and worker-like individuals among adult females\\" (division of labor) # The overlap of generations (mother and adult offspring) # Cooperative work on the cells of the bees' honeycomb Weaver ants, here collaborating to pull nest leaves together, can be considered primitively eusocial, as they do not have permanent division of labour. E. O. Wilson then extended the terminology to include other social insects, such as ants, wasps, and termites. Originally, it was defined to include organisms (only invertebrates) that had the following three features: # Reproductive division of labor (with or without sterile castes) # Overlapping generations # Cooperative care of young As eusociality became a recognized widespread phenomenon, however, it was also discovered in a group of chordates, the mole-rats. Further research also distinguished another possibly important criterion for eusociality known as \\"the point of no return\\". This is characterized by eusocial individuals that become fixed into one behavioral group, which usually occurs before reproductive maturity. This prevents them from transitioning between behavioral groups and creates an animal society that is truly dependent on each other for survival and reproductive success. For many insects, this irreversibility has changed the anatomy of the worker caste, which is sterile and provides support for the reproductive caste.  Taxonomic range  Most eusocial societies exist in arthropods, while a few are found in mammals. = In insects = meat-eater ant colony The order Hymenoptera contains the largest group of eusocial insects, including ants, bees, and waspsthose with reproductive \\"queens\\" and more or less sterile \\"workers\\" and/or \\"soldiers\\" that perform specialized tasks. For example, in the well-studied social wasp Polistes versicolor, dominant females perform tasks such as building new cells and ovipositing, while subordinate females tend to perform tasks like feeding the larvae and foraging. The task differentiation between castes can be seen in the fact that subordinates complete 81.4% of the total foraging activity, while dominants only complete 18.6% of the total foraging. Eusocial species with a sterile caste are sometimes called hypersocial. While only a moderate percentage of species in bees (families Apidae and Halictidae) and wasps (Crabronidae and Vespidae) are eusocial, nearly all species of ants (Formicidae) are eusocial. Some major lineages of wasps are mostly or entirely eusocial, including the subfamilies Polistinae and Vespinae. The corbiculate bees (subfamily Apinae of family Apidae) contain four tribes of varying degrees of sociality: the highly eusocial Apini (honey bees) and Meliponini (stingless bees), primitively eusocial Bombini (bumble bees), and the mostly solitary or weakly social Euglossini (orchid bees). Eusociality in these families is sometimes managed by a set of pheromones that alter the behavior of specific castes in the colony. These pheromones may act across different species, as observed in Apis andreniformis (black dwarf honey bee), where worker bees responded to queen pheromone from the related Apis florea (red dwarf honey bee). Pheromones are sometimes used in these castes to assist with foraging. Workers of the Australian stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria, for instance, mark food sources with a pheromone, helping their nest mates to find the food. Reproductive specialization generally involves the production of sterile members of the species, which carry out specialized tasks to care for the reproductive members. It can manifest in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior or morphology is modified for group defense, including self-sacrificing behavior (\\"altruism\\"). An example of a species whose sterile caste displays this altruistic behavior is Myrmecocystus mexicanus, one of the species of honey ant. Select sterile workers fill their abdomens with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests, acting as food storage for the rest of the colony.Conway, John R. \\"The Biology of Honey Ants.\\" The American Biology Teacher, Vol. 48, No. 6 (Sep., 1986), pp. 335–343. Not all social species of insects have distinct morphological differences between castes. For example, in the Neotropical social wasp Synoeca surinama, social displays determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood. These castes are sometimes further specialized in their behavior based on age. For example, Scaptotrigona postica workers assume different roles in the nest based on their age. Between approximately 0–40 days old, the workers perform tasks within the nest such as provisioning cell broods, colony cleaning, and nectar reception and dehydration. Once older than 40 days, Scaptotrigona postica workers move outside of the nest to practice colony defense and foraging. In Lasioglossum aeneiventre, a halictid bee from Central America, nests may be headed by more than one female; such nests have more cells, and the number of active cells per female is correlated with the number of females in the nest, implying that having more females leads to more efficient building and provisioning of cells. In similar species with only one queen, such as Lasioglossum malachurum in Europe, the degree of eusociality depends on the clime in which the species is found. Termites (order Blattodea, infraorder Isoptera) make up another large portion of highly advanced eusocial animals. The colony is differentiated into various castes: the queen and king are the sole reproducing individuals; workers forage and maintain food and resources;Costa- Leonardo AM, Haifig I. (2014). Termite Communication During Different Behavioral Activities. In: Biocommunication of Animals. Dortrecht, Springer, 161-190. and soldiers defend the colony against ant attacks. The latter two castes, which are sterile and perform highly specialized, complex social behaviors, are derived from different stages of pluripotent larvae produced by the reproductive caste. Some soldiers have jaws so enlarged (specialized for defense and attack) that they are unable to feed themselves and must be fed by workers. Austroplatypus incompertus is a species of ambrosia beetle native to Australia, and is the first beetle (order Coleoptera) to be recognized as eusocial. This species forms colonies in which a single female is fertilized, and is protected by many unfertilized females, which also serve as workers excavating tunnels in trees. This species also participates in cooperative brood care, in which individuals care for juveniles that are not their own. Some species of gall-inducing insects, including the gall-forming aphid, Pemphigus spyrothecae (order Hemiptera), and thrips such as Kladothrips (order Thysanoptera), are also described as eusocial. These species have very high relatedness among individuals due to their partially asexual mode of reproduction (sterile soldier castes being clones of the reproducing female), but the gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a defensible resource that sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. They produce soldier castes capable of fortress defense and protection of their colony against both predators and competitors. In these groups, therefore, high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior, but requires that groups occur in a restricted, shared area. These species have morphologically distinct soldier castes that defend against kleptoparasites (parasitism by theft) and are able to reproduce parthenogenetically (without fertilization). = In crustaceans = Eusociality has also arisen three different times among some crustaceans that live in separate colonies. Synalpheus regalis, Synalpheus filidigitus, and Synalpheus chacei, three species of parasitic shrimp that rely on fortress defense and live in groups of closely related individuals in tropical reefs and sponges, live eusocially with a single breeding female and a large number of male defenders, armed with enlarged snapping claws. As with other eusocial societies, there is a single shared living space for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it. The fortress defense hypothesis additionally points out that because sponges provide both food and shelter, there is an aggregation of relatives (because the shrimp do not have to disperse to find food), and much competition for those nesting sites. Being the target of attack promotes a good defense system (soldier caste); soldiers therefore promote the fitness of the whole nest by ensuring safety and reproduction of the queen. Eusociality offers a competitive advantage in shrimp populations. Eusocial species were found to be more abundant, occupy more of the habitat, and use more of the available resources than non-eusocial species. Other studies add to these findings by pointing out that cohabitation was more rare than expected by chance, and that most sponges were dominated by one species, which was frequently eusocial. = In nonhuman mammals = Naked mole-rat, one of two eusocial species in the Bathyergidae Among mammals, eusociality is known in two species in the Bathyergidae, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) and the Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis), both of which are highly inbred. Usually living in harsh or limiting environments, these mole-rats aid in raising siblings and relatives born to a single reproductive queen. However, this classification is controversial owing to disputed definitions of 'eusociality'. To avoid inbreeding, mole rats sometimes outbreed and establish new colonies when resources are sufficient. Most of the individuals cooperatively care for the brood of a single reproductive female (the queen) to which they are most likely related. Thus, it is uncertain whether mole rats classify as true eusocial organisms, since their social behavior depends largely on their resources and environment. Some mammals in the Carnivora and Primates exhibit eusocial tendencies, especially meerkats (Suricata suricatta) and dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). These show cooperative breeding and marked reproductive skews. In the dwarf mongoose, the breeding pair receives food priority and protection from subordinates and rarely has to defend against predators. =In humans= An early 21st century debate focused on whether humans are prosocial or eusocial. Edward O. Wilson called humans eusocial apes, arguing for similarities to ants, and observing that early hominins cooperated to rear their children while other members of the same group hunted and foraged. Wilson argued that through cooperation and teamwork, ants and humans form superorganisms. Wilson's claims were vigorously rejected because they were based on group selection and reproductive division of labour in humans. However, it has been claimed that suicide, male homosexuality, and female menopause evolved through kin selection, which, if true, would by some definitions make humans eusocial.  Evolution  Phylogenetic distribution = Eusociality is a rare but widespread phenomenon in species in at least seven orders in the animal kingdom, as shown in the phylogenetic tree (non-eusocial groups not shown). All species of termites are eusocial, and it is believed that they were the first eusocial animals to evolve, sometime in the upper Jurassic period (~150 million years ago). The other orders shown also contain non-eusocial species, including many lineages where eusociality was inferred to be the ancestral state. Thus the number of independent evolutions of eusociality is still under investigation. The major eusocial groups are shown in boldface in the phylogenetic tree. = Paradox = Prior to the gene-centered view of evolution, eusociality was seen as an apparent evolutionary paradox: if adaptive evolution unfolds by differential reproduction of individual organisms, how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes evolve and persist? In On the Origin of Species, Darwin referred to the existence of sterile castes as the \\"one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory\\".Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species, 1859. Chapter 8 Darwin anticipated that a possible resolution to the paradox might lie in the close family relationship, which W.D. Hamilton quantified a century later with his 1964 inclusive fitness theory. After the gene-centered view of evolution was developed in the mid 1970s, non-reproductive individuals were seen as an extended phenotype of the genes, which are the primary beneficiaries of natural selection.Dawkins, Richard. The Extended Phenotype,1982. = Inclusive fitness and haplodiploidy = According to inclusive fitness theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also via increasing the reproductive output of other individuals that share their genes, especially their close relatives. Individuals are selected to help their relatives when the cost of helping is less than the benefit gained by their relative multiplied by the fraction of genes that they share, i.e. when Cost < relatedness * Benefit. Under inclusive fitness theory, the necessary conditions for eusociality to evolve are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species because of their unusual relatedness structure. In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males develop from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is haploid, his daughters share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton first termed \\"supersisters\\" which are more related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring. Even though workers often do not reproduce, they can potentially pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes). This unusual situation, where females may have greater fitness when they help rear siblings rather than producing offspring, is often invoked to explain the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera. While females share 75% of genes with their sisters in haplodiploid populations, they only share 25% of their genes with their brothers. Accordingly, the average relatedness of an individual to their sibling is 50%. Therefore, helping behavior is only advantageous if it is biased to helping sisters, which would drive the population to a 1:3 sex ratio of males to females. At this ratio, males, as the rarer sex, increase in reproductive value, negating the benefit of female-biased investment. However, not all eusocial species are haplodiploid (termites, some snapping shrimps, and mole rats are not). Conversely, many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, resulting in a hive of half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. The association between haplodiploidy and eusociality is below statistical significance. Haplodiploidy alone is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality to emerge. However relatedness does still play a part, as monogamy (queens mating singly) has been shown to be the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated. If kin selection is an important force driving the evolution of eusociality, monogamy should be the ancestral state, because it maximizes the relatedness of colony members. = Ecology = Many scientists citing the close phylogenetic relationships between eusocial and non-eusocial species are making the case that environmental factors are especially important in the evolution of eusociality. The relevant factors primarily involve the distribution of food and predators. Increased parasitism and predation rates are the primary ecological drivers of social organization. Group living affords colony members defense against enemies, specifically predators, parasites, and competitors, and allows them to gain advantage from superior foraging methods. With the exception of some aphids and thrips, all eusocial species live in a communal nest which provides both shelter and access to food resources. Mole rats, many bees, most termites, and most ants live in burrows in the soil; wasps, some bees, some ants, and some termites build above-ground nests or inhabit above-ground cavities; thrips and aphids inhabit galls (neoplastic outgrowths) induced on plants; ambrosia beetles and some termites nest together in dead wood; and snapping shrimp inhabit crevices in marine sponges. For many species the habitat outside the nest is often extremely arid or barren, creating such a high cost to dispersal that the chance to take over the colony following parental death is greater than the chance of dispersing to form a new colony. Defense of such fortresses from both predators and competitors often favors the evolution of non-reproductive soldier castes, while the high costs of nest construction and expansion favor non-reproductive worker castes. The importance of ecology is supported by evidence such as experimentally induced reproductive division of labor, for example when normally solitary queens are forced together. Conversely, female Damaraland mole-rats undergo hormonal changes that promote dispersal after periods of high rainfall, supporting the plasticity of eusocial traits in response to environmental cues. Climate also appears to be a selective agent driving social complexity; across bee lineages and Hymenoptera in general, higher forms of sociality are more likely to occur in tropical than temperate environments. Similarly, social transitions within halictid bees, where eusociality has been gained and lost multiple times, are correlated with periods of climatic warming. Social behavior in facultative social bees is often reliably predicted by ecological conditions, and switches in behavioral type have been experimentally induced by translocating offspring of solitary or social populations to warm and cool climates. In H. rubicundus, females produce a single brood in cooler regions and two or more broods in warmer regions, so the former populations are solitary while the latter are social. In another species of sweat bees, L. calceatum, social phenotype has been predicted by altitude and micro-habitat composition, with social nests found in warmer, sunnier sites, and solitary nests found in adjacent, cooler, shaded locations. Facultatively social bee species, however, which comprise the majority of social bee diversity, have their lowest diversity in the tropics, being largely limited to temperate regions. = Multilevel selection = Once pre-adaptations such as group formation, nest building, high cost of dispersal, and morphological variation are present, between-group competition has been cited as a quintessential force in the transition to advanced eusociality. Because the hallmarks of eusociality will produce an extremely altruistic society, such groups will out-reproduce their less cooperative competitors, eventually eliminating all non-eusocial groups from a species. Multilevel selection has however been heavily criticized by some for its conflict with the kin selection theory. = Reversal to solitarity = A reversal to solitarity is an evolutionary phenomenon in which descendants of a eusocial group evolve solitary behavior once again. Bees have been model organisms for the study of reversal to solitarity, because of the diversity of their social systems. Each of the four origins of eusociality in bees was followed by at least one reversal to solitarity, giving a total of at least nine reversals. In a few species, solitary and eusocial colonies appear simultaneously in the same population, and different populations of the same species may be fully solitary or eusocial. This suggests that eusociality is costly to maintain, and can only persist when ecological variables favor it. Disadvantages of eusociality include the cost of investing in non-reproductive offspring, and an increased risk of disease. All reversals to solitarity have occurred among primitively eusocial groups; none have followed the emergence of advanced eusociality. The \\"point of no return\\" hypothesis posits that the morphological differentiation of reproductive and non-reproductive castes prevents highly eusocial species such as the honeybee from reverting to the solitary state.  Physiological and developmental mechanisms  An understanding of the physiological causes and consequences of the eusocial condition has been somewhat slow; nonetheless, major advancements have been made in learning more about the mechanistic and developmental processes that lead to eusociality. = Involvement of pheromones = Pheromones are thought to play an important role in the physiological mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of eusociality. In fact the evolution of enzymes involved both in the production and perception of pheromones has been shown to be important for the emergence of eusociality both within termites and in Hymenoptera. The most well-studied queen pheromone system in social insects is that of the honey bee Apis mellifera. Queen mandibular glands were found to produce a mixture of five compounds, three aliphatic and two aromatic, which have been found to control workers. Mandibular gland extracts inhibit workers from constructing queen cells in which new queens are reared which can delay the hormonally based behavioral development of workers and can suppress ovarian development in workers. Both behavioral effects mediated by the nervous system often leading to recognition of queens (releaser) and physiological effects on the reproductive and endocrine system (primer) are attributed to the same pheromones. These pheromones volatilize or are deactivated within thirty minutes, allowing workers to respond rapidly to the loss of their queen. The levels of two of the aliphatic compounds increase rapidly in virgin queens within the first week after eclosion (emergence from the pupal case), which is consistent with their roles as sex attractants during the mating flight. It is only after a queen is mated and begins laying eggs, however, that the full blend of compounds is made. The physiological factors regulating reproductive development and pheromone production are unknown. In several ant species, reproductive activity has also been associated with pheromone production by queens. In general, mated egg laying queens are attractive to workers whereas young winged virgin queens, which are not yet mated, elicit little or no response. However, very little is known about when pheromone production begins during the initiation of reproductive activity or about the physiological factors regulating either reproductive development or queen pheromone production in ants. Among ants, the queen pheromone system of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta is particularly well studied. Both releaser and primer pheromones have been demonstrated in this species. A queen recognition (releaser) hormone is stored in the poison sac along with three other compounds. These compounds were reported to elicit a behavioral response from workers. Several primer effects have also been demonstrated. Pheromones initiate reproductive development in new winged females, called female sexuals. These chemicals also inhibit workers from rearing male and female sexuals, suppress egg production in other queens of multiple queen colonies and cause workers to execute excess queens. The action of these pheromones together maintains the eusocial phenotype which includes one queen supported by sterile workers and sexually active males (drones). In queenless colonies that lack such pheromones, winged females will quickly shed their wings, develop ovaries and lay eggs. These virgin replacement queens assume the role of the queen and even start to produce queen pheromones. There is also evidence that queen weaver ants Oecophylla longinoda have a variety of exocrine glands that produce pheromones, which prevent workers from laying reproductive eggs. Similar mechanisms are used for the eusocial wasp species Vespula vulgaris. In order for a Vespula vulgaris queen to dominate all the workers, usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony, she exerts pheromone to signal her dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne pheromone from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance. The mode of action of inhibitory pheromones which prevent the development of eggs in workers has been convincingly demonstrated in the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. In this species, pheromones suppress activity of the corpora allata and juvenile hormone (JH) secretion. The corpora allata is an endocrine gland that produces JH, a group of hormones that regulate many aspects of insect physiology. With low JH, eggs do not mature. Similar inhibitory effects of lowering JH were seen in halictine bees and polistine wasps, but not in honey bees. = Other strategies = A variety of strategies in addition to the use of pheromones have evolved that give the queens of different species of social insects a measure of reproductive control over their nest mates. In many Polistes wasp colonies, monogamy is established soon after colony formation by physical dominance interactions among foundresses of the colony including biting, chasing and food soliciting. Such interactions created a dominance hierarchy headed by individuals with the greatest ovarian development. Larger, older individuals often have an advantage during the establishment of dominance hierarchies. The rank of subordinates is positively correlated with the degree of ovarian development and the highest ranking individual usually becomes queen if the established queen disappears. Workers do not oviposit when queens are present because of a variety of reasons: colonies tend to be small enough that queens can effectively dominate workers, queens practice selective oophagy or egg eating, or the flow of nutrients favors queen over workers and queens rapidly lay eggs in new or vacated cells. However, it is also possible that morphological differences favor the worker. In certain species of wasps, such as Apoica flavissima queens are smaller than their worker counterparts. This can lead to interesting worker-queen dynamics, often with the worker policing queen behaviors. Other wasps, like Polistes instabilis have workers with the potential to develop into reproductives, but only in cases where there are no queens to suppress them. In primitively eusocial bees (where castes are morphologically similar and colonies usually small and short-lived), queens frequently nudge their nest mates and then burrow back down into the nest. This behavior draws workers into the lower part of the nest where they may respond to stimuli for cell construction and maintenance. Being nudged by the queen may play a role in inhibiting ovarian development and this form of queen control is supplemented by oophagy of worker laid eggs. Furthermore, temporally discrete production of workers and gynes (actual or potential queens) can cause size dimorphisms between different castes as size is strongly influenced by the season during which the individual is reared. In many wasp species worker caste determination is characterized by a temporal pattern in which workers precede non-workers of the same generation. In some cases, for example in the bumble bee, queen control weakens late in the season and the ovaries of workers develop to an increasing extent. The queen attempts to maintain her dominance by aggressive behavior and by eating worker laid eggs; her aggression is often directed towards the worker with the greatest ovarian development. In highly eusocial wasps (where castes are morphologically dissimilar), both the quantity and quality of food seem to be important for caste differentiation. Recent studies in wasps suggest that differential larval nourishment may be the environmental trigger for larval divergence into one of two developmental classes destined to become either a worker or a gyne. All honey bee larvae are initially fed with royal jelly, which is secreted by workers, but normally they are switched over to a diet of pollen and honey as they mature; if their diet is exclusively royal jelly, however, they grow larger than normal and differentiate into queens. This jelly seems to contain a specific protein, designated as royalactin, which increases body size, promotes ovary development and shortens the developmental time period. Furthermore, the differential expression in Polistes of larval genes and proteins (also differentially expressed during queen versus caste development in honey bees) indicate that regulatory mechanisms may occur very early in development.

Birth and first marriage Ginevra Sforza was born in Ancona in 1440, the illegitimate daughter of Alessandro Sforza, Lord of Pesaro. She married Sante Bentivoglio, a cousin of Giovanni II Bentivoglio, on 19 May 1454 at the church of San Giacomo Maggiore. Her first husband gave her two children: * Constance (1458–1491), who married Antonmaria Pico della Mirandola, and * Ercole Bentivoglio (1459–1507), a condottiero, who married Barbara Torelli. Second marriage In 1463 Ginevra became a widow, and a year later married Giovanni II Bentivoglio, becoming among other things, his counsellor. Probably a relationship already existed between the two. Ginevra gave her husband sixteen children, of whom five died in infancy. The others were: Bentivoglio family by Lorenzo Costa *Annibale II Bentivoglio (1469–1540) who married Lucrezia, daughter of Ercole I d'Este, and who was lord of Bologna from 1511 to 1512; *Ermes Bentivoglio (1475–1513) *Alessandro Bentivoglio (1474–1532), who married Ippolita Sforza; *Camilla, a nun at Corpus Christi *Isotta, a nun at Corpus Christi *Francesca, married to Galeotto Manfredi *Antongaleazzo Bentivoglio, prelate *Eleonora *Laura, wife of Giovanni Gonzaga *Violante, wife of Pandolfo IV Malatesta *Bianca Ginevra befriended Gentile Budrioli, wife of the notary Alessandro Cimieri and student at the University of Bologna, who was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake in 1498. In 1466 Pope Paul II acknowledged the lordship of Giovanni II and gave him the papal vicariate of Bologna. After facing a conspiracy by the Malvezzi family in 1488, in 1501 the Bentivoglio discovered another conspiracy organized by the rival family of Marescotti. On the advice of Ginevra, many family members were killed in revenge. Exile and death In 1505 the conspirators who had escaped the carnage petitioned Pope Julius II, who ordered Giovanni II to leave the city with his family. Ginevra, exiled in Parma, where she had taken refuge with the Marquis Pallavicini, was excommunicated because she had not gone far enough from Bologna. Julius II refused to reverse the excommunication, despite numerous pleas, or to return the castle of Ponte Poledrano (now Castello di Bentivoglio), of which he had taken possession. The Bentivoglio properties in Bologna were looted and the Palazzo Bentivoglio was razed. Ginevra died on 16 May 1507 and her body was buried in a common grave near Busseto. Giovanni II died the next year.

She won the ladies' singles tennis title at the 1912 Wimbledon Championships as well as 11 badminton titles at the All England Badminton Championships. Career Ethel was born 8 June 1879 as the second child of Herbert Warneford Thomson, surgeon, and his wife, Sophia Charlotte Bond. Her older brother Hugh was born in 1878. She first competed at Wimbledon in 1902 when she lost in the first round to Agnes Morton. The following year, 1903, she reached the final of the All-Comers tournament in which she was defeated by Dorothea Douglass in three sets. Larcombe did not play competitive tennis for four years from 1907 until her return in 1911. In 1912 she became Wimbledon champion by first defeating Charlotte Cooper Sterry in the All-Comers' final and subsequently receiving a walkover in the Challenge Round. The following year she was unable to defend her singles title when she was injured in the final of the mixed doubles. Her partner James Cecil Parke misjudged a smash in the second set which hit her full on the side of the face and the resulting eye injury forced her to retire from the mixed doubles final and to default from her challenge round match against Dorothea Lambert Chambers scheduled for the following day. In total she participated in 11 editions of the Wimbledon Championships between 1902 and 1921. She won the Scottish Championships singles title three times (1910–12) and she won the singles title at the Irish Championships in 1912 defeating Mrs. Norton-Barry in the final in two sets. =Playing style= In contrast to most of her contemporaries Larcombe played her service underhand. In 1903 A. Wallis Myers wrote that her favorite shot was the backhand down the line and that she possessed an effective smash. According to Dorothea Lambert- Chambers she was one of the best female volleyers of her time but did not have a very good condition, causing her to fade in matches. After her return to tennis in 1911 several aspects of her game had improved including her forehand shot as well as her stamina.

The uprising began on 14 November 1973, escalated to an open anti-junta revolt, and ended in bloodshed in the early morning of 17 November after a series of events starting with a tank crashing through the gates of the Polytechnic.  Causes  Since 21 April 1967, Greece had been under the dictatorial rule of the military, a regime which abolished civil rights, dissolved political parties and exiled, imprisoned and tortured politicians and citizens based on their political beliefs. 1973 found the military junta leader Georgios Papadopoulos having undertaken a \\"liberalisation\\" process of the regime, which included the release of political prisoners and the partial lifting of censorship, as well as promises of a new constitution and new elections for a return to civilian rule. Opposition elements including Socialists were thus given the opportunity to undertake political action against the junta. The United States took a clandestine interest in suppressing Socialists and had a C.I.A. operative named John Maury who was in consultation supporting the Junta Leaders. American Vice President Spiro Agnew praised the junta as \\"the best thing to happen to Greece since Pericles ruled in ancient Athens\\". The junta, trying to control every aspect of politics, had interfered with student syndicalism since 1967, by banning student elections in universities, forcibly drafting students and imposing non-elected student union leaders in the national students' union, EFEE. These actions eventually created anti-junta sentiments among students, such as geology student Kostas Georgakis who committed suicide in 1970 in Genoa, Italy as an act of protest against the junta. The first massive public action against the junta came from students on 21 February 1973, when law students went on strike and barricaded themselves inside the buildings of the Law School of the University of Athens in the centre of Athens, demanding repeal of the law that imposed forcible drafting of \\"subversive youths\\", as 88 of their peers had been forcibly drafted to the army. The police were ordered to intervene and many students were reportedly subjected to police brutality. The events at the Law School are often cited as the prelude to the Polytechnic uprising. The student uprising was also heavily influenced by the youth movements of the 1960s, notably the events of May 1968 in France. An anti-dictatorial student movement was growing among the youth, and the police utilised brutal methods and torture towards them, in order to confront the threat.  November events  The entrance of the National Technical University of Athens = 14 November = On 14 November 1973, students at the Athens Polytechnic (Polytechneion) went on strike and started protesting against the military regime (Regime of the Colonels). As the authorities stood by, the students were calling themselves the \\"Free Besieged\\" (Greek: Ελεύθεροι Πολιορκημένοι, a reference to the poem by Greek poet Dionysios Solomos inspired by the Ottoman siege of Mesolonghi). Their main demand-slogan was: An assembly was formed spontaneously and decided to occupy the Polytechnic. The two main student parties, the Marxist pro-Soviet A-AFEE and Rigas did not endorse the movement. Leftists and anarchists initiated the sit-in. While they contended that the uprising should demand capitalism's abolition, the larger, unconvinced rebel group disagreed and chose instead to demand democracy's restoration. A Coordination Commission of the Occupation was formed but had loose control over the uprising. Police had gathered outside but did not manage to break into the premises. Slogans and graffiti by the students were anti-NATO and anti-American comparing the Greek junta with the Nazi Germany. = 15 November = During the second day of the occupation (often called celebration day), thousands of people from Athens poured in to support the students. A radio transmitter was set up and Maria Damanaki, then a student and member of A-EFEE, popularized the slogan \\"Bread-Education-Freedom\\". The demands of the occupation were anti-imperialistic and anti-NATO. Third parties that allied themselves with the student protests were the construction workers (who set up a parallel committee next to CCO) and some farmers from Megara, who coincidentally protested on the same days in Athens. = 16 November = A proclamation was announced on Friday, 16 November by the CCO that the students were aiming to bring down the Junta. During the afternoon, demonstrations and attacks against neighbouring ministries took place. Central roads closed, fires erupted and Molotov cocktails were thrown for the first time in Athens. The Junta decided to reply firmly, by repressing the riots. Snipers were placed at buildings next to the Polytechnic and assassinated 24 people in total. Students barricaded themselves in and constructed a radio station (using laboratory equipment) that repeatedly broadcast across Athens: Maria Damanaki, later a politician, was one of the major speakers. Soon thousands of workers and youngsters joined them protesting inside and outside of the \\"Athens Polytechnic\\". =17 November= In the early hours of November 17, 1973, the transitional government sent a tank crashing through the gates of the Athens Polytechnic.\\"Past present\\" and quote:Markezinis had humiliated himself by 'requesting' Papadopoulos to reimpose martial law in the wake of the November 17 uprising at the Athens Polytechnic , Athens News, 4 October 2002 through Internet Archive Soon after that, Spyros Markezinis himself had the task to request Papadopoulos to reimpose martial law. Prior to the crackdown, the city lights had been shut down, and the area was only lit by the campus lights, powered by the university generators. An AMX 30 Tank (still kept in a small armored unit museum in a military camp in Avlonas, not open to the public) crashed the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic at around 03:00 am. In unclear footage clandestinely filmed by a Dutch journalist, the tank is shown bringing down the main steel entrance to the campus, to which people were clinging. Documentary evidence also survives, in recordings of the \\"Athens Polytechnic\\" radio transmissions from the occupied premises. In these a young man's voice is heard desperately asking the soldiers (whom he calls 'brothers in arms') surrounding the building complex to disobey the military orders and not to fight 'brothers protesting'. The voice carries on to an emotional outbreak, reciting the lyrics of the Greek National Anthem, until the tank enters the yard, at which time transmission ceases. An official investigation undertaken after the fall of the Junta declared that no students of the Athens Polytechnic were killed during the incident. Total recorded casualties amount to 24 civilians killed outside Athens Polytechnic campus. These include 19-year-old Michael Mirogiannis, reportedly shot to death by officer Nikolaos Dertilis, high-school students Diomedes Komnenos and Alexandros Spartidis of Lycee Leonin, and a five-year-old boy caught in the crossfire in the suburb of Zografou. The records of the trials held following the collapse of the Junta document the circumstances of the deaths of many civilians during the uprising, and although the number of dead has not been contested by historical research, it remains a subject of political controversy. In addition, hundreds of civilians were left injured during the events.BBC: On this day quote: It follows growing unrest in Greece, and comes eight days after student uprisings in which 13 people died and hundreds were injured.. Ioannides' involvement in inciting unit commanders of the security forces to commit criminal acts during the Athens Polytechnic uprising was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the Greek junta trials and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.  Aftermath of the uprising  The uprising triggered a series of events that put an abrupt end to the regime's attempted \\"liberalisation\\" process under Spiros Markezinis. Papadopoulos, during his liberalisation process and even during the dictatorship, attempted to re-engineer the Greek political landscape and failed repeatedly. In his biographical notes published as a booklet by supporters in 1980 it is mentioned that he attended Polytechneion, the prime Engineering School in the country, but did not graduate. Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannides, a disgruntled Junta hardliner,\\"Greece marks '73 student uprising\\", and:the notorious Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis now serving a life sentence for his part in the 1967 seizure of power – immediately scrapped a programme of liberalisation introduced earlier and: His was but to do the bidding of a junta strongman who had never made a secret of his belief that Greeks were not ready for democracy. Athens News, 17 November 1999 through Internet archiveIoannis Tzortzis, University of Birmingham \\"The Metapolitefsi that Never Was: a Re-evaluation of the 1973 ‘Markezinis Experiment’\\" quote 1: Thus the students ‘had been played straight into the hands of Ioannidis, who looked upon the coming elections with a jaundiced eye. quote 2: Ioannidis said to Pattakos ‘we are not playing. We shall have a dictatorship, send all our opponents to exile on the islands and stay in power for thirty years!’ through Internet Archive used the uprising as a pretext to re-establish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew George Papadopoulos and Spiros Markezinis on November 25 the same year. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General Phaedon Gizikis as President, and economist Adamantios Androutsopoulos as Prime Minister, although Ioannides remained the behind-the-scenes strongman. Ioannides' abortive coup attempt on 15 July 1974 against Archbishop Makarios III, then President of Cyprus, was met by an invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. These events caused the military regime to implode and ushered in the era of metapolitefsi (Greek for \\"polity/regime change\\"). Constantine Karamanlis was invited from self-exile in France, and was appointed Prime Minister of Greece by President Phaedon Gizikis. Parliamentary democracy was thus restored, and the Greek legislative elections of 1974 were the first free elections held in a decade.  Legacy  A sculpture for the uprising Gate of Polytechneio, 17 November 2011 17 November is currently observed as a holiday in Greece for all educational establishments; commemorative services are held and students attend school only for these, while some schools and all universities stay closed during the day. The central location for the commemoration is the campus of the Polytechneio. The campus is closed on the 15th (the day the students first occupied the campus on 1973). Students and politicians lay wreaths on a monument within the Polytechneio on which the names of Polytechneio students killed during the Greek Resistance in the 1940s are inscribed, while a catalog of victims by the 7 years junta is uttered. The commemoration day ends traditionally with a demonstration that begins from the campus of the Polytechneio and ends at the United States embassy. The day is often a day of social unrest where mass riots occur during the entire night. Two protesters were killed during the 1980 demonstration: Iakovos Koumis and Stamatina Kanellopoulou. The student uprising is hailed by many as a valiant act of resistance against the military dictatorship, and therefore as a symbol of resistance to tyranny. The student's struggle had also a lasting effect on Greek anarchism. Despite the far-left's minor influence in the uprising itself, their unfulfilled vision became a rallying cry for Greek anarchists internally. The now-defunct far-left organization Revolutionary Organization 17 November is named after the last day of the Polytechnic uprising.

She was commissioned as USS SC-1072, an SC-497 Class Submarine Chaser on 28 June 1943. She was reclassified as a PGM-1 Class Motor Gunboat on 10 December 1943. She was dispatched to the Solomon Islands for patrol service. History All twenty-four crew members reporting on board USS SC-1072, 28 June 1943, were received from the receiving station, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official Reports of Changes for USS SC-1072 provide port locations and sailing destinations as follows: 19 July 43 sailing from Naval Air Station, Cape May, New Jersey to Jacksonville, Florida 11 August 43 sailing from Pier #2, S.C.T.C, Miami, Florida to Navy Section Base, Key West, Florida 15 August 43 sailing from N.O.B., Key West, Florida to Burwood, Mississippi 17 August 43 sailing from Burwood, Louisiana to Canal Zone [Burwood is located in the state of Louisiana, perhaps the 15 August entry refers to the Mississippi River as the location of Burwood?] 28 August 43 sailing from Naval Station, Coco Solo, Canal Zone to Naval Station, San Diego, California 14 September 43 sailing from Naval Base, San Diego, California to Naval Base, San Francisco, California 24 September 43 sailing from Naval Section Base, Treasure Island, California to Naval Section Base, Seattle, Washington 19 November 43 sailing from NavSta, Pier 41, Seattle, Washington to Naval Operating Base, San Pedro, California 23 November 43 sailing from NavSecBase, Treasure Island, California to Naval Operating Base, San Pedro, California 23 January 1944, USS PGM-7 departed San Pedro, California, headed for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, in company of PGM's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 and USS Armadillo (IX-111). The Armadillo provided fuel and water for the PGM's in transit to Hawaii. The Log Book of USS PGM-3 contains the following entry for 25 January 1045 hours: “U.S.S. PGM-2 reported bad leak and was ordered by Senior Officer Present Afloat to return to port accompanied by U.S.S. PGM-4 as escort.” PGM-7 and the remaining ships continued their journey, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 1 February. On 12 February the PGM-7 left Pearl Harbor en route to Palmyra Atoll in company of PGM's 8, 5, 3 and 1 and arrived there 15 February. The next day the five PGM's continued their journey en route to Pago Pago, Tutuila Island, American Samoa, arriving there on 20 February. Sadly, Edmund Roman Niess, Machinist's Mate first class, a member of the crew of PGM-7, drowned in an accident on 23 February 1944, in Pago Pago Harbor. He was buried in the USMC Cemetery, Tutuila, the next day. Niess was the only member of the crew of PGM-7 lost during the war according to the official Reports of Changes for the ship. The five PGM's left Pago Pago on 24 February, headed toward Suva, Viti Levu, Fiji, arriving there on 27 February after adjusting the ships’ clocks forward one day. PGM's 8, 5, 3 and 7 departed Suva on 28 February en route to Nouméa, New Caledonia, arriving there 2 March. The same four PGM's departed Nouméa 10 days later en route for Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, arriving there 14 March. PGM-7 departed for the Solomon Islands on 15 March in company of PGM's 5 and 8, arriving at Guadalcanal two days later. After a short stay at Guadalcanal, the ships crossed over to nearby Tulagi, Florida Islands (known today as Nggela Islands). After a stay of nearly two weeks, PGM's 5, 7 and 8 departed the Florida Islands on 29 March en route for Rendova Island, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands. On 6 April, PGM-7 departed Rendova in company of PGM-5 headed for the Motor Torpedo Boat Base #9, Treasury Islands, arriving there on the same day. MTB Base #9 served as the home base for the remainder of PGM-7’s navy career. Two days after arriving at MTB Base #9, PGM-7 departed at 1743 hours on 8 April for its first patrol of the coastal waters of southwest Bougainville Island. Over the next three months, PGM-7 conducted anti-barge and anti-submarine patrols along the southwest and southeast coasts of Bougainville, the general vicinity of Fauro Island, and the west coast of Choiseul Island. The ship was accompanied on these patrols by various other PGM ships of PGM Division One as well as various PT boats from nearby squadrons. Starting at the end of June 1944, the PGM-7 participated in a prolonged patrol along the northwestern coast of New Ireland (island), in view, at a distance, of night attacks on the Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. On 28 June, PGM’s 5, 7 and 8 departed Torokina for New Ireland to patrol area “uncle.” The patrol included the coastal locations of Tambaker Point, Huru Point and Cape Roloss. The ships visited the advance base at Green Islands, arriving the afternoon of 1 July and departing the afternoon of 4 July, taking on fuel and water and doing other unspecified work during this period. The PGMs returned to the same patrol area, concluding their patrol on 7 July and arriving back at MTB Base #9 on the Treasury Islands on 8 July. In the early morning hours of 18 July, PGM-7 departed MTB Base #9 for another patrol of New Ireland in company of PGM's 4, 5 and 8. At 0543 hours PGM-7 was severely damaged in a collision with PGM-4. An eyewitness account of the collision is available in the book Splinter Fleet by Theodore R. Treadwell. Heavy seas contributed to difficulties in maintaining proper patrol formation and PGM-4 lost track of PGM-7 on radar. Suddenly the PGM-7 appeared off the starboard bow of PGM-4 and it was too late to prevent a collision. Contrary to other reports, the official Log Book of PGM-7 establishes for a fact that the ship did not sink. Quoted here are the entries in the ship's log for 18 July 1944 and subsequent dates: thumbNational Archives photo no. 80-G-2811314 USS PGM-7 following ramming by USS PGM-4. Taken from USS PGM-5.

It was apparently scrapped by the navy due to extensive damage to the hull. Fate of the crew of PGM-7 All 27 crew and 3 officers of PGM-7 survived the collision of 18 July 1944. The PGM-7 Report of Changes for the month ending 31 July 1944, lists 19 crew members transferred to MTBRons, Base 9, Navy 811, Treasury Islands, for temporary duty. The PGM Division One (Base Force at Treasury Islands) Report of Changes for the month ending 30 September 1944, lists 28 crew members received from PGM-7 on 17 September 1944, with 14 transferred the same day to other PGMs of Division One (the extra crew member reported aboard after the collision). Officers of PGM-7 for the period 1 January 1944 to 17 September 1944 Deck Log List of Officers 31 May 44 to 30 June 44 provides the following three officers: A. J.

Life She was reared by her mother and grew up in the San Gabriel Valley (California) along with three siblings. She attended St. Joseph’s elementary school and Bishop Amat Memorial High School. Like her two older brothers, nephew and aunt, she attended UC Berkeley. After traveling to Spain, Mexico and Puerto Rico as an undergraduate, she fulfilled a lifelong dream and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish in 1976. Professor Chabram- Dernersesian received the departmental commendation for excellence in Spanish and was the keynote speaker for the Chicana/o graduation. While at Berkeley, also helped to catalog the newspaper collection at The Chicana/o Studies Library. Upon graduation, Professor Chabram-Dernersesian was admitted to the doctoral program of the Literature Department at the University of California at San Diego. Under the direction of Professor Rosaura Sánchez she pursued doctoral studies in the fields of Chicana/o, Mexican, and Latin American literature. As a graduate student Professor Chabram-Dernersesian also developed a keen interest in Chicana/o theory and criticism. She published seminal articles in this field after accepting a tenure-track position at the University of California at Davis in the Fall of 1984. At UC Davis Professor Chabram-Dernersesian worked with students in the Spanish for Native Speakers Program and developed the Chicana/o Literature Series which emphasizes poetry, theater, and the novel. She also worked to develop the Chicana/o Studies Program, both in terms of its curriculum and faculty, and was instrumental in its acquisition of departmental status. As an Assistant Professor Chabram- Dernersesian was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute of American Cultures/The Chicana/o Research Center. As a result of this fellowship and the collaborations it facilitated, her interest turned to cultural studies and she edited a special issue of the journal, Cultural Studies, (1990) in conjunction with Professor Rosa Linda Fregoso. She also published an entry for the book, Cultural Studies, edited by Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula Treichler (2002), as well as a number of other articles. Her interest in cultural studies became central to a new research agenda which now focused on cultural representations of gender, identity, Chicana/o studies, race, ethnography, and multiculturalism. In 1999 Professor Chabram-Dernersesian edited a second special issue of Cultural Studies and was subsequently invited to participate in the special tribute to Stuart Hall, Without Guarantees (2000). In 2006 Professor Chabram-Dernersesian edited The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader (Routledge), which introduces readers to the contentious dialogues and alternative legacies of (Chicana/o) cultural studies with various critical entries. In 2007 she published what can be seen as a companion text: The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Forum (New York University Press). This Forum, which is the result of a number of interviews obtained and edited by Chabram-Dernersesian, includes lengthy introductions on the topic and a spoken intellectual history of the practices of Chicana/o cultural studies in our worlds. In addition, this edited book incorporates a valuable comparative context with the inclusion of interventions of practitioners from Black, American, Latina/o, Asian American, and Mexican cultural studies. In 2008 Professor Chabram-Dernersesian turned her attention to cultural narrative and edited Speaking from the Body: Latinas on Health and Culture (University of Arizona Press) in collaboration with Adela de la Torre. This book argues that Latinas “experience illness within a narrative, or story, that gives meaning to what they are feeling, moment to moment” (Donald, 1998). Speaking from the Body also includes the stories of Latinas living with hypertension, breast cancer, obesity, diabetes, depression, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, Parkinson’s, lupus, and hyper/hypothyroidism. In recognition of the importance of her work, Professor Chabram-Dernersesian was selected for the Davis Humanities Institute Seminar on Health, Medicine, and Culture in a Globalizing World. Professor Angie Chabram-Dernersesian’s current research and teaching are firmly located in Chicana/o (feminist) cultural studies, a critical intervention which she views as including representations of the body, community, health, and illness. Generally speaking, she is interested in promoting transnational/ global cultural studies networks and collaborative work teams that provide critical literacy for marginalized and subaltern communities that have not had access to higher learning and are underrepresented within the primary of circuits of cultural production. At the University of California at Davis Professor Chabram- Dernersesian focuses her attention on mentoring undergraduate as well as graduate students. She has consistently participated in the Murals Program, the Graduate Group of Cultural Studies, and the Designated Emphasis in Feminist Theory and Research. She hopes to collaborate with scholars and students alike to create a state of the arts curriculum that creates bridges instead of borders and challenges students to pursue education as a form of social inquiry and change. Her work as a Professor is inspired in the example of her mother who encouraged her children to work hard, do the best they could, and to go to high school and college—despite the odds. Her support ethic is credited to her sister whose consistent “presence” made it possible for her to seek a path of higher education.

The term was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.Cyborgs and Space, in Astronautics (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and American scientist and researcher Nathan S. Kline. The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback. While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism. D. S. Halacy's Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a \\"new frontier\\" that was \\"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' – a bridge...between mind and matter.\\"D. S. Halacy, Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman (New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1965), 7. In science fiction, the most recognizable portrayal of a cyborg is a human being with visibly mechanical parts, such as the superhero Cyborg from DC Comics or the Borg from Star Trek. But cyborgs may also be portrayed as looking more like robots or more like ordinary humans. Cyborgs may appear as humanoid robots, such as Robotman from DC's Doom Patrol or the Cybermen from Doctor Who, or they may appear as non-humanoid robots, such as the Daleks in Doctor Who or some of the Motorball players in Battle Angel Alita. More human appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing, such as Darth Vader from Star Wars or Misty Knight from Marvel Comics. Cyborgs may even have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human. The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman had bionic parts that looked like the body parts they replaced. Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is a full-body cyborg whose body looks human. In the examples mentioned, as well as many more, it is common for cyborgs to have physical or mental abilities beyond what humans are capable of. They may have super strength, enhanced senses, computer-assisted brains, or built-in weaponry.  Overview  According to some definitions of the term, the physical attachments humanity has with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs.A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century by Donna Haraway In a typical example, a human with an artificial cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator would be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body, perform signal processing, and can deliver electrical stimuli, using this synthetic feedback mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, especially cochlear implants, that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists cite such modifications as contact lenses, hearing aids, smart phone or intraocular lenses as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities. As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a bio-techno-social definition of aging has been suggested. The term is also used to address human-technology mixtures in the abstract. This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones, computers, the Internet, etc. but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology; for example, pen and paper, and speech and language. When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places, a person becomes capable of much more than they were before. An example is a computer, which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers. Another example, which is becoming more and more relevant is a bot-assisted human or human-assisted-bot, used to target social media with likes and shares. Cybernetic technologies include highways, pipes, electrical wiring, buildings, electrical plants, libraries, and other infrastructure that we hardly notice, but which are critical parts of the cybernetics that we work within. Bruce Sterling in his universe of Shaper/Mechanist suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called Lobster, which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (e.g. a Powered Exoskeleton).Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985. Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally (e.g. the Bishop type in the Alien franchise), Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally (e.g. Elysium, RoboCop). The computer game Deus Ex: Invisible War prominently featured cyborgs called Omar, where \\"Omar\\" is a Russian translation of the word \\"Lobster\\" (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).  Origins  The concept of a man-machine mixture was widespread in science fiction before World War II. As early as 1843, Edgar Allan Poe described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story \\"The Man That Was Used Up\\". In 1911, Jean de La Hire introduced the Nyctalope, a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg, in Le Mystère des XV (later translated as The Nyctalope on Mars). Edmond Hamilton presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his novel The Comet Doom in 1928. He later featured the talking, living brain of an old scientist, Simon Wright, floating around in a transparent case, in all the adventures of his famous hero, Captain Future. He uses the term explicitly in the 1962 short story, \\"After a Judgment Day\\", to describe the \\"mechanical analogs\\" called \\"Charlies\\", explaining that \\"[c]yborgs, they had been called from the first one in the 1960s...cybernetic organisms.\\" In the short story \\"No Woman Born\\" in 1944, C. L. Moore wrote of Deirdre, a dancer, whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body. The term was coined by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline in 1960 to refer to their conception of an enhanced human being who could survive in extraterrestrial environments: Their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to open up. A designer of physiological instrumentation and electronic data-processing systems, Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York. The term first appears in print five months earlier when The New York Times reported on the Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper. A book titled Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer was published by Doubleday in 2001. Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the 35 mm motion picture film Cyberman.  Cyborg tissues in engineering  Cyborg tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses. The work was presented by Di Giacomo and Maresca at MRS 2013 Spring conference on Apr, 3rd, talk number SS4.04. The cyborg obtained is inexpensive, light and has unique mechanical properties. It can also be shaped in the desired forms. Cells combined with MWCNTs co-precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material. Likewise, dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the MWCNT network. When observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial \\"tissue\\" composed of highly packed cells. The effect of cell drying is manifested by their \\"ghost cell\\" appearance. A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall (the most outer part of fungal and plant cells) may play a major active role in establishing a CNTs network and its stabilization. This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing and has the potential to open important new avenues to be exploited in electromagnetic shielding for radio frequency electronics and aerospace technology. In particular, using Candida albicans cells cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported.  Actual cyborgization attempts  Cyborg 300x300px In current prosthetic applications, the C-Leg system developed by Otto Bock HealthCare is used to replace a human leg that has been amputated because of injury or illness. The use of sensors in the artificial C-Leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user's natural gait, as it would be prior to amputation. Prostheses like the C-Leg and the more advanced iLimb are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real-world cyborg applications. Additionally cochlear implants and magnetic implants which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs. In vision science, direct brain implants have been used to treat non-congenital (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was a private researcher William Dobelle. Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into \\"Jerry\\", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry's visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes, the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a two-ton mainframe, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.Vision quest, Wired Magazine, September 2002 In 1997, Philip Kennedy, a scientist and physician, created the world's first human cyborg from Johnny Ray, a Vietnam veteran who suffered a stroke. Ray's body, as doctors called it, was \\"locked in\\". Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy's experiment. Kennedy embedded an implant he designed (and named \\"neurotrophic electrode\\") near the part of Ray's brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body. The surgery went successfully, but in 2002, Johnny Ray died.Baker, Sherry. \\"Rise of the Cyborgs.\\" Discover 29.10 (2008): 50. Science Reference Center. Web. 4 November 2012 In 2002, Canadian Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle's second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second-generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into a coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.Macintyre, James BMI: the research that holds the key to hope for millions, The Independent 29 May 2008 In contrast to replacement technologies, in 2002, under the heading Project Cyborg, a British scientist, Kevin Warwick, had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities. With this in place, Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand, also receiving feedback from the fingertips in order to control the hand's grip. This was a form of extended sensory input. Subsequently, he investigated ultrasonic input in order to remotely detect the distance to objects. Finally, with electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system, they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: \\"Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy\\", IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185–189, 2004 Since 2004, British artist Neil Harbisson has had a cyborg antenna implanted in his head that allows him to extend his perception of colors beyond the human visual spectrum through vibrations in his skull.Alfredo M. Ronchi: Eculture: Cultural Content in the Digital Age. Springer (New York, 2009). p.319 His antenna was included within his 2004 passport photograph which has been claimed to confirm his cyborg status.Andy Miah, Emma Rich: The Medicalization of Cyberspace Routledge (New York, 2008) p.130 (Hardcover: Papercover: ) In 2012 at TEDGlobal,\\"I listen to color\\", TED Global, 27 June 2012.

Neil Harbisson is a global advocate for the rights of cyborgs. Rob Spence, a Toronto-based film-maker, who titles himself a real-life \\"Eyeborg\\", severely damaged his right eye in a shooting accident on his grandfather's farm as a child. Many years later, in 2005, he decided to have his ever-deteriorating and now technically blind eye surgically removed, whereafter he wore an eye patch for some time before he later, after having played for some time with the idea of installing a camera instead, contacted professor Steve Mann at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert in wearable computing and cyborg technology. Under Mann's guidance, Spence, at age 36, created a prototype in the form of the miniature camera which could be fitted inside his prosthetic eye; an invention would come to be named by Time magazine as one of the best inventions of 2009. The bionic eye records everything he sees and contains a 1.5 mm-square, low-resolution video camera, a small round printed circuit board, a wireless video transmitter, which allows him to transmit what he is seeing in real-time to a computer, and a 3-voltage rechargeable Varta microbattery. The eye is not connected to his brain and has not restored his sense of vision. Additionally, Spence has also installed a laser-like LED light in one version of the prototype. Furthermore, many cyborgs with multifunctional microchips injected into their hand are known to exist. With the chips they are able to swipe cards, open or unlock doors, operate devices such as printers or, with some using a cryptocurrency, buy products, such as drinks, with a wave of the hand. = bodyNET = bodyNET is an application of human-electronic interaction currently in development by researchers from Stanford University. The technology is based on stretchable semiconductor materials (Elastronic). According to their article in Nature, the technology is composed of smart devices, screens, and a network of sensors that can be implanted into the body, woven into the skin or worn as clothes. It has been suggested, that this platform can potentially replace the smartphone in the future. = Animal cyborgs = The US-based company Backyard Brains released what they refer to as \\"The world's first commercially available cyborg\\" called the RoboRoach. The project started as a University of Michigan biomedical engineering student senior design project in 2010 and was launched as an available beta product on 25 February 2011. The RoboRoach was officially released into production via a TED talk at the TED Global conference, and via the crowdsourcing website Kickstarter in 2013, the kit allows students to use microstimulation to momentarily control the movements of a walking cockroach (left and right) using a bluetooth-enabled smartphone as the controller. Other groups have developed cyborg insects, including researchers at North Carolina State University, UC Berkeley, and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, but the RoboRoach was the first kit available to the general public and was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health as a device to serve as a teaching aid to promote an interest in neuroscience. Several animal welfare organizations including the RSPCA and PETA have expressed concerns about the ethics and welfare of animals in this project. In the late 2010s, scientists have created cyborg jellyfish using a microelectronic prosthetic which propels the animal to swim almost three times faster while using just twice the metabolic energy of their unmodified peers. The prosthetics can be removed without harming the jellyfish.  Cyborg proliferation in society  In medicine = In medicine, there are two important and different types of cyborgs: the restorative and the enhanced. Restorative technologies \\"restore lost function, organs, and limbs\\".Gray, Chris Hables, ed. The Cyborg Handbook. New York: Routledge, 1995 The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function. There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost. On the contrary, the enhanced cyborg \\"follows a principle, and it is the principle of optimal performance: maximising output (the information or modifications obtained) and minimising input (the energy expended in the process)\\".Lyotard, Jean François: The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984 Thus, the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present. Although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice, bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely. Michael Chorost wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants, or bionic ear, titled \\"Rebuilt: How Becoming Part Computer Made Me More Human.\\" Jesse Sullivan became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve-muscle graft, enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics. By 2004, a fully functioning artificial heart was developed. The continued technological development of bionic and nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement, and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model. The ethics and desirability of \\"enhancement prosthetics\\" have been debated; their proponents include the transhumanist movement, with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present, normative limitations such as aging and disease, as well as other, more general incapacities, such as limitations on speed, strength, endurance, and intelligence. Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biased which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies; namely, a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de-emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood, in favor of definition in terms of upgrades, versions, and utility. A brain-computer interface, or BCI, provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device, effectively creating a cyborg. Research of Invasive BCIs, which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain, has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people, most notably those with severe cases, such as Locked-In syndrome. This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aide them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices. It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people.Baker, Sherry. \\"RISE OF THE CYBORGS.\\" Discover 2008; 29(10): 50–57. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 March 2010. Deep brain stimulation is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes. This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy, chronic headaches, and mental disorders. After the patient is unconscious, through anesthesia, brain pacemakers or electrodes, are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present. The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures. Like all invasive procedures, deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk. However, there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment. Retinal implants are another form of cyborgization in medicine. The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging (conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of ganglion cells) is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells (cells which connect the eye to the brain.) While work to perfect this technology is still being done, there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light. A specialized camera is worn by the subject, such as on the frames of their glasses, which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation. A chip located in the user's eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user. If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them. A similar process has been created to aid people who have lost their vocal cords. This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators. The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck, where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals. The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator. That simulator would then vibrate producing a multi-tonal sound which could be shaped into words by the mouth.Thurston, Bonnie. \\"Was blind, but now I see.\\" 11. Christian Century Foundation, 2007. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 March 2010. An article published in Nature Materials in 2012 reported a research on \\"cyborg tissues\\" (engineered human tissues with embedded three-dimensional mesh of nanoscale wires), with possible medical implications. In 2014, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and Washington University in St. Louis had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly. By using 3D printing and computer modeling these scientist developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers. The device utilizes a \\"spider-web like network of sensors and electrodes\\" to monitor and maintain a normal heart-rate with electrical stimuli. Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient, the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high-resolution imaging technology. The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit's heart, operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient-rich solution. The stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor John A. Rogers in which the electrodes are arranged in a s-shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking. Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate, in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard from heart attacks. The Artificial Pancreas is a substitute for lack of endogenous insulin production, most notably in Type 1 Diabetes. Currently available systems combine a Continuous glucose monitor with an Insulin pump that can be remote controlled, forming a control loop that automatically adjusts the insulin dosage depending on the current blood glucose level. Examples of commercial systems that implement such a control loop are the MiniMed 670g from Medtronic and the t:slim x2 from Tandem Diabetes Care. Do- it-yourself artificial pancreas technologies also exist, though these are not verified or approved by any regulatory agency. Upcoming next-generation artificial pancreas technologies include automatic glucagon infusion in addition to insulin, to help prevent hypoglycemia and improve efficiency. One example of such a bi-hormonal system is the Beta Bionics iLet. = In the military = Military organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage. DARPA has announced its interest in developing \\"cyborg insects\\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupa stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas.The military seeks to develop 'insect cyborgs'. Washington Times (13 March 2006). Retrieved 29 August 2011. Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks. The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.Military Plans Cyborg Sharks. LiveScience (7 March 2006).

The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid-Insect-MEMS, HI-MEMS. Its goal, according to DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office, is to develop \\"tightly coupled machine-insect interfaces by placing micro-mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis\\". The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas In 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Micro-electronic mechanical systems (MEMS) conference in Italy, researchers demonstrated the first \\"wireless\\" flying- beetle cyborg.Ornes, Stephen. \\"THE PENTAGON'S BEETLE BORGS.\\" Discover 30.5 (2009): 14.

Miniature cameras weighing 248 mg were attached to live beetles of the Tenebrionid genera Asbolus and Eleodes. The camera wirelessly streams video to a smartphone via Bluetooth for up to 6 hours and the user could remotely steer the camera to achieve a bug's eye view. = In sports = In 2016 the first cyborg Olympics were celebrated in Zurich Switzerland. Cybathlon 2016 were the first Olympics for cyborgs and the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports. In this event, 16 teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes. There were six different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered prosthetic legs and arms, robotic exoskeletons, bikes and motorized wheelchairs. If on one hand, this was already a remarkable improvement, as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference, on the other hand, it showed that there is still a long way to go. For instance, the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and sit down, navigate a slalom and other simple activities such as walk over stepping stones and climb up and downstairs. Despite the simplicity of these activities, 8 of the 16 teams that participated in the event drop off before the start. Nonetheless, one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetic can make a difference in people's lives. The next Cybathlon is expected to occur in 2020 = In art = Cyborg artist Moon Ribas, founder of the Cyborg Foundation performing with her seismic sense implant at TED (2016) The concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction. However, many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms; these can range from paintings to installations. Some artists who create such works are Neil Harbisson, Moon Ribas, Patricia Piccinini, Steve Mann, Orlan, H. R. Giger, Lee Bul, Wafaa Bilal, Tim Hawkinson and Stelarc. Stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body. He uses medical instruments, prosthetics, robotics, virtual reality systems, the Internet and biotechnology to explore alternate, intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body. He has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm. Between 1976–1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin. For 'Third Ear' he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet-enabled, making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places.Extended-Body: Interview with Stelarc.

His Electric Sheep project generates abstract art by combining the work of many computers and people over the internet.  Artists as cyborgs  Artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination. Some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human-bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums, from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings. Artists that seek to make cyborg-based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists, or may consider their artwork \\"cyborg\\". How an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter's flexibility with the term. Scholars that rely upon a strict, technical description of a cyborg, often going by Norbert Wiener's cybernetic theory and Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline's first use of the term, would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs.Tenney, Tom; \\"Cybernetics in Art and the Myth of the Cyborg Artist \\"; inc.ongruo.us; 29 December 2010; 9 March 2012. Scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics.Volkart, Yvonne; \\"Cyborg Bodies. The End of the Progressive Body: Editorial\\"; medienkunstnetz.de; 9 March 2012. Others may speak of defining subcategories, or specialized cyborg types, that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual. This may range from technological instruments being external, temporary, and removable to being fully integrated and permanent. Nonetheless, cyborg artists are artists. Being so, it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict, technical representation of the term,Taylor, Kate; \\"Cyborg The artist as cyborg\\"; theglobeandmail.com; 18 February 2011; Web; 5 March 2012.  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/the-artist-as-cyborg/article1913032/ seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism. = In body modification = As medical technology becomes more advanced, some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community. While not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics, augmented reality and QR codes are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body. Hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfacesDigital Tattoo Interface, Jim Mielke, United States would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality, bringing a transhumanist way of life into present day reality. In addition, it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest. Individuals may experience pre-implantation feelings of fear and nervousness. To this end, individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness, particularly in a socialized setting, due to their post-operative, technologically augmented bodies, and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion. Anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity. = In popular culture = Cyborgs have become a well-known part of science fiction literature and other media. Although many of these characters may be technically androids, they are often referred to as cyborgs. Well-known examples from film and television include RoboCop, The Terminator, Evangelion, United States Air Force Colonel Steve Austin in both Cyborg and, as acted out by Lee Majors, The Six Million Dollar Man, Replicants from Blade Runner, Daleks and Cybermen from Doctor Who, the Borg from Star Trek, Darth Vader, Lobot, and General Grievous from Star Wars, Inspector Gadget, and Cylons from the 2004 Battlestar Galactica series. From comicbooks are characters including Deathlok and Victor \\"Cyborg\\" Stone; and manga and anime characters including 8 Man (the inspiration for RoboCop), Kamen Rider, Rudol von Stroheim, and Ghost in the Shell's Motoko Kusanagi. Playable characters such as, Kano, Jax, Cyrax, and Sektor from the Mortal Kombat franchise, as well as Genji, an advanced cyborg ninja, who appears in Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, are examples of cyborgs in video games. The Deus Ex video game series deals extensively with the near-future rise of cyborgs and their corporate ownership, as does the Syndicate series. William Gibson's Neuromancer features one of the first female cyborgs, a \\"Razorgirl\\" named Molly Millions, who has extensive cybernetic modifications and is one of the most prolific cyberpunk characters in the science fiction canon. The cyborg was also a central part of singer Janelle Monáe's 48-minute video corresponding with the release of her 2018 album \\"Dirty Computer.\\" This emotion picture intertwined the relationship between human and technology, highlighting the power of the digital on a futuristic, dystopian society. Monáe has previously referred to herself as an android, depicting herself as a mechanical organism often conforming to idealistic standards, thus using the cyborg as a way to detach from these oppressive structures. = In space = Sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation. Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist, stated \\"Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war... I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space.\\" The difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi-planet species. There are many effect of spaceflight on the human body. One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen. If this necessity was taken out of the equation, space exploration would be revolutionized. A theory proposed by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline is aimed at tackling this problem. The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is \\"capable of reducing CO2 to its components with the removal of the carbon and re-circulation of the oxygen...\\"Cyborgs and Space, The New York Times could make breathing unnecessary. Another prominent issue is radiation exposure. Yearly, the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0.30 rem of radiation, while an astronaut aboard the International Space Station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem. To tackle the issue, Clynes and Kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a Rose osmotic pump \\"which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses.\\" Experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance. Although the effects of spaceflight on our body is an important issue, the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important. With our current technology, it would take us about 260 days to get to Mars. A study backed by NASA proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep, or torpor. With this technique, it would \\"reduce astronauts' metabolic functions with existing medical procedures\\". So far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week. Advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to Mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption. = In cognitive science = Theorists such as Andy Clark suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system. In this model \\"cyborg\\" is defined as a part biological, part mechanical system which results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole. Clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition. He suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system. Examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic, such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes, or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone. According to Clark, these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way which is analogous to the way that a technology which would fit the traditional concept a cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host. Because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes, Clark comes to the conclusion that we are \\"natural-born cyborgs\\".Clark, Andy. Natural-Born Cyborgs. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. = Cyborg Foundation = In 2010, the Cyborg Foundation became the world's first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs.García, F.C. \\"Nace una fundación dedicada a convertir humanos en ciborgs\\", La Vanguardia, 1 March 2011. The foundation was created by cyborg Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas as a response to the growing number of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming a cyborg.Rottenschlage, Andreas \\"The Sound of the Cyborg\\" The Red Bulletin, 1 March 2011. The foundation's main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body,Redacción \\"Una fundación se dedica a convertir humanos en ciborgs\\" El Comercio (Peru), 1 March 2011. to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights.Calls, Albert \\"\\"Les noves tecnologies seran part del nostre cos i extensió del cervell\\"\\" La Tribuna, 3 January 2011.

In 2013, the film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival's Focus Forward Filmmakers Competition and was awarded with US$100,000.Pond, Steve \\"Cyborg Foundation\\" wins $100K Focus Forward prize , Chicago Tribune, 22 January 2013  The future scope and regulation of implantable technologies  Given the technical scope of current and future implantable sensory/telemetric devices, these devices will be greatly proliferated, and will have connections to commercial, medical, and governmental networks. For example, in the medical sector, patients will be able to login to their home computer, and thus visit virtual doctor's offices, medical databases, and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted telemetric devices. However, this online network presents huge security concerns because it has been proven by several U.S. universities that hackers could get onto these networks and shut down peoples' electronic prosthetics. These sorts of technologies are already present in the U.S. workforce as a firm in River Falls, Wisconsin called Three Square Market partnered with a Swedish firm called Biohacks Technology to implant RFID microchips in the hands of its employees (which are about the size of a grain of rice) that allow employees to access offices, computers, and even vending machines. More than 50 of the firms 85 employees were chipped. It was confirmed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of these implantations. If these devices are to be proliferated within society, then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations, monitoring, and security of these devices? According to this case study of Three Square Market, it seems that the FDA is assuming the role in regulating and monitoring these devices. It has been argued that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed so that the law keeps up with developments in implantable technologies.

Probability theory \\"Radically elementary probability theory\\" of Edward Nelson combines the discrete and the continuous theory through the infinitesimal approach. The model-theoretical approach of nonstandard analysis together with Loeb measure theory allows one to define Brownian motion as a hyperfinite random walk, obviating the need for cumbersome measure-theoretic developments. Jerome Keisler used this classical approach of nonstandard analysis to characterize general stochastic processes as hyperfinite ones. Economics Economists have used nonstandard analysis to model markets with large numbers of agents (see Robert M. Anderson (economist)). Education The article by Michèle Artigue cited below concerns the teaching of analysis. Artigue devotes one page to \\"NSA and its weak impact on education\\", page 172. She writes: :The non-standard analysis revival and its weak impact on education. The publication in 1966 of Robinson's book NSA constituted in some sense a rehabilitation of infinitesimals which had fallen into disrepute [...] [Robinson's proposal] was met with suspicion, even hostility, by many mathematicians [...] Nevertheless, despite the obscurity of this first work, NSA developed rapidly [...] The attempts at simplification were often conducted with the aim of producing an elementary way of teaching NSA. This was the case with the work of Keisler and Henle-Kleinberg [...] Artigue continues specifically with reference to the calculus textbook: :[Keisler's work] served as a reference text for a teaching experiment in the first year in university in the Chicago area in 1973-74. Sullivan used 2 questionnaires to evaluate the effects of the course, one for teachers, the other for students. The 11 teachers involved gave a very positive opinion of the experience. The student questionnaire revealed no significant difference in technical performance [...] but showed that those following the NSA course were better able to interpret the sense of the mathematical formalism of calculus [...] The appearance of the 2nd book of Keisler led to a virulent criticism by Bishop, accusing Keisler of seeking [...] to convince students that mathematics is only \\"an esoteric and meaningless exercise in technique\\", detached from any reality. These criticisms were in opposition to the declarations of the partisans of NSA who affirmed with great passion its simplicity and intuitive character. [...] However, it is necessary to emphasize the weak impact of NSA on contemporary education. The small number of reported instances of this approach are often accompanied with passionate advocacy, but this rarely rises above the level of personal conviction.

Koxinga had captured Hambroek along with his wife and three of his children, and sent him as a messenger to Frederik Coyett, the Governor of Formosa, to demand the surrender of the Dutch garrison at Fort Zeelandia and the abandonment of their colony. Koxinga promised the missionary death should he return with a displeasing answer; Coyett refused to surrender and Hambroek was executed on his return to Koxinga's camp. After the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine.(Volume 2 of A History of Christianity in Asia, Samuel H.

Brown was replaced, in a caretaker-manager fashion, by Jimmy Meadows. Meadows gave only three starts to Weston before the end of the season, at which point Blackpool were relegated to Division Three.Calley, p. 330 Bob Stokoe was installed as Blackpool's new manager prior to the 1978–79 season, his second time in the role. Weston made 31 league appearances that season, scoring four goals.Calley, p. 332 Stan Ternent replaced Bob Stokoe in the Blackpool hot seat during the close season, and in the following 1979–80 campaign, Weston made 35 league appearances and scored three goals. Alan Ball succeeded Ternent two-thirds of the way through the season, making it six managers Weston had played under in five years at the club.Calley, p. 334 Weston made his final appearance for Blackpool in the final league game of the 1979–80 season, a 2–0 victory at Rotherham United on 6 May.Calley, p. 334 Later career Weston left Blackpool to join Torquay United in June 1980, making his league debut in a 1–0 win at home to Crewe Alexandra on 16 August, the opening day of the season. He played 35 times in the league that season, also playing both games in the League Cup and in all four games as Torquay reached the third round of the FA Cup. He started the first two games of the following season before losing his place, initially to Maurice Cox. He played once more before moving back to the north-west of England in September 1981, when he joined Wigan Athletic. He was Wigan's Player of the Year for the 1982–83 season, but returned to non-League football with Morecambe in 1983.

Hyperbolic law of cosines Take a hyperbolic plane whose Gaussian curvature is -\\\\frac{1}{k^{2}}. Then given a hyperbolic triangle ABC with angles \\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma and side lengths BC = a, AC = b, and AB = c, the following two rules hold: considering the sides, while :\\\\cos\\\\alpha=-\\\\cos\\\\beta\\\\cos\\\\gamma+\\\\sin\\\\beta\\\\sin\\\\gamma\\\\cosh\\\\frac{a}{k}, for the angles. Christian Houzel (page 8) indicates that the hyperbolic law of cosines implies the angle of parallelism in the case of an ideal hyperbolic triangle: Houzel, Christian (1992) \\"The Birth of Non-Euclidean Geometry\\", pages 3 to 21 in ”1830-1930: A Century of Geometry”, Lecture Notes in Physics #402, Springer-Verlag . :When \\\\alpha=0, that is when the vertex ”A” is rejected to infinity and the sides ”BA” and ”CA” are ”parallel”, the first member equals 1; let us suppose in addition that \\\\gamma=\\\\pi/2 so that \\\\cos\\\\gamma=0 and \\\\sin\\\\gamma=1. The angle at ”B” takes a value β given by 1=\\\\sin\\\\beta\\\\cosh(a/k); this angle was later called ”angle of parallelism” and Lobachevsky noted it by ”F(a)” or Π(”a”). Hyperbolic law of Haversines In cases where ”a/k” is small, and being solved for, the numerical precision of the standard form of the hyperbolic law of cosines will drop due to rounding errors, for exactly the same reason it does in the Spherical law of cosines. The hyperbolic version of the law of haversines can prove useful in this case: :\\\\sinh^{2}\\\\frac{a}{2k}=\\\\sinh^{2}\\\\frac{b-c}{2k}+\\\\sinh\\\\frac{b}{k}\\\\sinh\\\\frac{c}{k}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}, Relativistic velocity addition via hyperbolic law of cosines  Setting \\\\left[\\\\tfrac{a}{k},\\\\ \\\\tfrac{b}{k},\\\\ \\\\tfrac{c}{k}\\\\right]=\\\\left[\\\\xi,\\\\ \\\\eta,\\\\ \\\\zeta\\\\right] in (), and by using hyperbolic identities in terms of the hyperbolic tangent, the hyperbolic law of cosines can be written: &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tanh^{2}\\\\zeta}} - \\\\frac{\\\\tanh\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta}}\\\\frac{\\\\tanh\\\\zeta}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\tanh^{2}\\\\zeta}}\\\\cos\\\\alpha  &\\\\Rightarrow & \\\\tanh\\\\xi &= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-\\\\tanh^{2}\\\\zeta - \\\\tanh^{2}\\\\eta + 2\\\\tanh\\\\eta\\\\tanh\\\\zeta\\\\cos\\\\alpha + \\\\left(\\\\tanh\\\\eta\\\\tanh\\\\zeta\\\\sin\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{2}}}{1 - \\\\tanh\\\\eta\\\\tanh\\\\zeta\\\\cos\\\\alpha} \\\\end{align}  }} In comparison, the velocity addition formulas of special relativity for the x and y-directions as well as under an arbitrary angle \\\\alpha, where v is the relative velocity between two inertial frames, u the velocity of another object or frame, and c the speed of light, is given by In English: Pauli (1921), p. 561 :\\\\begin{align} && \\\\left[U_{x},\\\\ U_{y}\\\\right] &= \\\\left[\\\\frac{u_{x} - v}{1 - \\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}u_{x}},\\\\ \\\\frac{u_{y}\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}{1 - \\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}u_{x}}\\\\right]  && U^{2} &= U_{x}^{2} + U_{y}^{2},\\\\ u^{2} = u_{x}^{2} + u_{y}^{2},\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{u_{y}}{u_{x}}  &\\\\Rightarrow & U &= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-u^{2} - v^{2} + 2vu\\\\cos\\\\alpha + \\\\left(\\\\frac{vu\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{c}\\\\right){}^{2}}}{1 - \\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}u\\\\cos\\\\alpha} \\\\end{align} It turns out that this result corresponds to the hyperbolic law of cosines - by identifying \\\\left[\\\\xi,\\\\ \\\\eta,\\\\ \\\\zeta\\\\right] with relativistic rapidities {\\\\scriptstyle \\\\left(\\\\left[\\\\frac{U}{c},\\\\ \\\\frac{v}{c},\\\\ \\\\frac{u}{c}\\\\right]=\\\\left[\\\\tanh\\\\xi,\\\\ \\\\tanh\\\\eta,\\\\ \\\\tanh\\\\zeta\\\\right]\\\\right)}, the equations in () assume the form: :\\\\begin{align} && \\\\cosh\\\\xi &= \\\\cosh\\\\eta\\\\cosh\\\\zeta - \\\\sinh\\\\eta\\\\sinh\\\\zeta\\\\cos\\\\alpha  &\\\\Rightarrow & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{U^{2}}{c^{2}}}} &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}} - \\\\frac{v/c}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\\\frac{u/c}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\\\cos\\\\alpha  &\\\\Rightarrow & U &= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-u^{2} - v^{2} + 2vu\\\\cos\\\\alpha + \\\\left(\\\\frac{vu\\\\sin\\\\alpha}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}}{1 - \\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}u\\\\cos\\\\alpha} \\\\end{align} See also * Hyperbolic law of sines * Hyperbolic triangle trigonometry * History of Lorentz transformations References External links  * Non Euclidean Geometry, Math Wiki at TU Berlin Category:Hyperbolic geometry Category:Special relativity es:Teorema del coseno#Geometría hiperbólica fr:Théorème d'Al-Kashi#Géométrie hyperbolique pl:Twierdzenie cosinusów#Wzory cosinusów w geometriach nieeuklidesowych ","title":"Hyperbolic law of cosines"},{"id":"20757070","text":"Norman Frederick Mitchell (19 February 1900 – 8 March 1973) was an Australian sportsman who played first-class cricket for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield and Australian rules football with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Mitchell's three VFL games came midway through the 1925 season and were against Fitzroy, South Melbourne and Essendon. An Old Melburnian, he played his early football at Melbourne University. As a cricketer he was a right- handed opening batsman and got few opportunities to represent Victoria because they had a prolific pair in Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford. In the four first-class matches that he was picked in, two of them in the Sheffield Shield, it was as a middle order batsman. He made the most of his chance in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1926/27 when he scored 220 of Victoria's 552 first innings runs. Mitchell then dismissed Tasmanian Alfred Watson twice with the ball and also took three catches to round off a good all round performance. His only other wicket at first-class level had come on his debut against New Zealand and was All Blacks rugby player Charlie Oliver. Despite Mitchell's efforts in the Tasmania match, he wasn't picked for Victoria ever again. Later on in his life, Mitchell became a County Court Judge.

He was the nephew of librettist Michel Carré (1821–1872) and cousin of cinema director Michel Carré (1865–1945). His wife was the French soprano Marguerite Carré (1880–1947). For over 50 years Albert Carré was a central personality in the theatrical and musical life of Paris.  Life and work  Albert Carré. Leaving Alsace for Paris in 1870, Carré studied drama at the Paris Conservatoire, winning a 2nd prize in comedy, and was engaged at the Théâtre du Vaudeville, leading to a successful career as an actor, before becoming co-director of the Vaudeville in Paris and later the Théâtre-Libre and the Comédie-Française.Langham Smith R. \\"Albert Carré\\". In: New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He left the Vaudeville to become director of the Opéra in Nancy, where he also helped institute a regular season of symphony concerts in the Salle Poirel from 1889. Carré's main contribution to operatic history was made as director of the Opéra-Comique, a post he held from 1898 to 1914 and then again from 1919–1925 (co-director with Émile and Vincent Isola).Wolff, Stéphane. Un demi-siècle d’Opéra-Comique (1900–1950). André Bonne, Paris, 1953. He worked to raise the musical standards of the Opéra-Comique and was responsible for the premieres of major operas by French composers, commissioning Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande, Gustave Charpentier's Louise and Dukas's Ariane et Barbe-bleue, and works by Reynaldo Hahn, Alfred Bruneau and Georges Hüe. Carré was more progressive musically than his predecessor Carvalho, from whom he took over in 1898. He had written a report for government on the management of opera houses in Germany and approached his position at the Opéra-Comique with reforming zeal, introducing many modern practices. André Messager, (a lifelong friend and collaborator on his most important projects) became the 'directeur de la musique' with expanded responsibilities, allowing him an important role in deciding the works to be performed and singers to be hired. He instituted a more rigorous rehearsal schedule and absentee policy. Carré also created subscription series in which subscribers were guaranteed that works would not be repeated in the same season. In 1899 he inaugurated a 'family series', at a lower cost and concentrating on older works from the repertory. His contract stipulated that he keep in the repertory works of composers who had created the opéra-comique genre, and also that he could not foist the older repertory on secondary artists.Huebner S. French Opera at the Fin de Siecle. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999. He produced the first French performances of several Italian operas, including Tosca (13 October 1903) and Madama Butterfly (28 December 1906), and mounted many other important new productions, including Carmen (8 December 1898). He was responsible for a new production of Le roi malgré lui in 1929 which helped to bring the piece back to the stage. He wrote vaudevilles, comedies, and opéra-comique libretti, sometimes with Alexandre Bisson (1848–1912). He retired in 1936 and wrote his memoirs. Before and during the First World War, Carré also worked for the 'Deuxième Bureau'. This was part of the intelligence service of the French army and was involved in recruiting Alsatians to the French army when the region was still part of Germany.From Albert Carré, Les engagés volontaires alsaciens-lorrains pendant la guerre, Flammarion, 1923, p24, quoted in article L’Académie de Réchésy by Gisèle Loth.

The ballast tanks were now all empty again, which left Valour with a slight starboard list. The weather continued to deteriorate, and by 21:30 the winds were south at , gusting to , with seas. At 22:00 the chief mate went to the wheelhouse and told the captain that there was a slight starboard list (which was consistent with the stability letter). The wind and seas were also pushing the barge to the north, and that strain on the tow wire may have increased the list. At 22:15 the Captain ordered the chief engineer to pump water for 15 minutes into the #18 port ballast tank to correct for the starboard list. Because of poor communications and a lack of established ballasting procedures, water continued to be pumped into that tank for over one hour, at least 45 minutes longer than ordered. At around 23:00-23:15 Valour leveled off and began to list to port. At 23:16 Valour was listing to port and also began rolling to port, alarming the Captain, who then ordered the chief engineer to pump off all ballast. Twenty minutes later, that operation was stopped, and they then began transferring from the #18 port ballast tank to the #18 starboard ballast tank. =Cross-connected tanks= Aboard Valour the three pairs of port and starboard fuel tanks (#'s 4, 5 & 17) were connected by cross-connect lines equipped with isolation valves. The #12 port and starboard wash water tanks were similarly arranged, with the addition of a smaller secondary cross-over line. These valves were required, by regulation, to be kept closed when underway. Nonetheless, the #5 port and starboard fuel tanks (which were feeding the day tank for the main engines) were left open, and this was a standard practice. During the post-accident dives, it was discovered that the isolation valve between the #4 port and starboard fuel tanks was also left open. In addition, it's probable (but unconfirmed) that the isolation valve on the secondary cross-connect line between the wash water tanks was also left open. The valves are kept closed to prevent hydrostatic balancing between the tanks and to minimize free surface effect, both of which are detrimental to a vessel's stability. With improper ballast operations causing a substantial port list, fuel inadvertently began to flow by gravity (hydrostatic balancing) from starboard to port, thereby increasing the severity of the list and eventually causing the aft deck to become awash. An unknown amount of sea water is likely to have entered the #19 & 20 aft ballast tanks through their deck vents, reducing reserve buoyancy further and adding more free surface effect. To counteract this the Captain ordered all ballast to be pumped off, then agreed 20 minutes later to stop pumping ballast water out of the #18 port ballast tank and start pumping ballast water into the #18 starboard ballast tank from the sea (the vessel was not configured to allow internal ballast transfers), causing even more loss of reserve buoyancy. All the while, the barge had been creeping up on them and was now just off the port quarter, with the weight of the tow wire hanging off the port side of the tug. All of this was greatly compounded by the chief mate suffering a fatal fall down the ladder from the wheelhouse and then the loss of an able seaman overboard. Shortly after midnight on the 18th the crew finally released the tow to avoid being tripped. Valour continued to list and roll further to port until it was on its side, then sea water began entering the vessel through the engine room vents on the stack deck. =Sinking= At approximately 02:30 on 18 January 2006, listing heavily to port and going down by the stern, Valour sank approximately off Cape Fear, North Carolina. The captain and five crew members, including the chief engineer, were rescued by the tug Justine Foss. The chief engineer, however, died on board shortly afterward of hypothermia. A total of three lives were lost in this incident: the chief mate, chief engineer and an able seaman. Coast Guard investigation The Coast Guard investigation found that the causes of the sinking were gale to storm-force weather, vessel design shortcomings, loss of stability, and human factors. The vessel's design shortcomings included a lack of valve position indicators for the isolation valves on the tank cross-overs, and a lack of tank level indicators. The loss of stability was caused by a failure to abide by the conditions stipulated in the stability letter. Namely that hydrostatic balancing of the cross-connected fuel tanks occurred because the cross-overs were left open, and that ballasting operations were undertaken to correct the list without first knowing what was causing the list. The human factors include poor communications, the captain's lack of command presence, the captain's loss of situational awareness regarding the vessel's stability, negligence and misconduct on the part of the captain, negligence on the part of the second mate, and misconduct on the part of the chief and assistant engineers.

Early life Richard Lowell Hittleman was born at New York on 7 March 1927,http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi the son of Hittleman and Fillet. Hittleman was a pupil of the Indian spiritual master Ramana Maharshi, along with Paul Brunton, in the late 1940s. He also had an interest in Zen Buddhism, and Buddhism generally. He is said to have been working with his daughter on a re-interpretation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead at the time of his death. His chief teaching was that ultimately all is only divine self (the Hindu atman) and that this was present in all people, to be realized through meditation and other yoga techniques. Hittleman wrote: \\"'Self' is another word for 'God'. This is the God who is the Absolute, immutable, without qualities, pure Awareness, without beginning or end.\\" Richard Hittleman, Yoga for Health, Ballantine Wellspring, New York, 1983, p. 185  Career in yoga  Richard Hittleman specialized in introducing Yoga in an easy-to-follow fashion to those who were new to the subject. Through his books, lectures, recordings and TV programs, he brought Yoga to more people than any other person alive at the time. He was most active in the 1960s and 1970s.Howard Kent, \\"Yoga for Health: A Breakthrough in Television Programs\\" in Yoga and Health, edited by Ronald Hutchinson, Astrian, London, 1972, p. 18 It has been said that Richard Hittleman introduced Yoga to literally millions of people via the medium of television.Ami Chen Mills, Yogi's Boo-boo, 22-November 29, 1995 issue of Metro and Howard Kent in Yoga and Health, London, 1972, p. 18 His method was to start with the most elementary Hatha Yoga postures and gradually bring the student into more advanced physical asanas and the more profound Yoga philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. So popular did his Yoga For Health TV programmes become that \\"... the programs were repeated again and again - indeed, in New York 'Yoga for Health' was screened for more than four-and-a-half years without a break\\".Howard Kent, 'Yoga for Health' in Yoga and Health, ed. Hutchinson, 1972, p.18. Hittleman stated his philosophy as follows: \\"In the Yoga scriptures, it is explained that the word \\"Self\\" is used to indicate that the Absolute we are attempting to describe is Self-luminous. It shines by its own light that has no beginning and no end. It is dependent upon nothing and is not affected by, nor does it react to, any occurrence in the phenomenal world. It is further characterized as having the qualities of Bliss and Knowledge. That is, when you manifest as that which you truly Are, the experience is one of unqualified Joy and direct (not relative) Knowledge.\\"Richard Hittleman, Yoga for Health, Ballantine Wellspring, New York, 1983, p. 172. He wrote numerous popular books on Hatha Yoga, and several covering Yoga philosophy. His style was lucid and readable for newcomers, yet with profound content; he had taken an M.A. in Oriental mysticism at Columbia University and was a friend of Alan Watts. There were two later series of \\"Yoga for Health\\". One was a co production with KTEH, San Jose, starring Hittleman as the instructor and master, with a male model demonstrating intermediate posture and a female model demonstrating beginning postures. The title of the second series was \\"Yoga and Meditation.\\" the second series was a 1/2 hour shows one for each week or 52 shows. This series covered virtually all types of yoga instructions Bhakti, Hatha, Raja and Karma as well. Each show started with introductions of guests, and instructions of poses. last 1/2 of the show was devoted to lectures on yoga types, foods, and life styles. also several shows had lectures on very many meditation technics and styles, deep breathing, deep relaxation. he also lectured on \\"White light healing.\\" These shows were produced by Mort Levit and Gabreal Franklin. A later, and last series, was produced by Mort Levit, and directed by Gabreal Franklin at KMST Studios. Death Hittleman died of prostate cancer on 14 October 1991 at Santa Cruz.

He was born in Prague. In 1960 he was a crew member of the Czechoslovak boat which won the bronze medal in the eights event. Four years later he won his second bronze medal with the Czechoslovak boat in the eights competition. In 1969, Janousek, despite then speaking no English, was appointed as British national rowing coach. In the next seven years, he introduced training methods to British rowing that were already widespread elsewhere in Europe and formed the first British national rowing squad. Janousek stepped down as coach after the 1976 Olympic Games, at which Britain gained silver medals in double sculls and in eights, but stayed in Britain to form a boat-building business, Janousek Racing Boats. In 2003, Bob was nominated for an OBE by a member of the 1975/76 national squad, which the British Cabinet Office declined. The recommendation supported by significant rowing figures such as Mike Sweeney, Hugh Matheson and Richard Lester read as follows:\\"Bob Janousek was National Rowing Coach for Great Britain from 1969 to 1976. At the time there was a deep malaise in British rowing with no medals in international championships since the 1964 Olympics. The top clubs jealously guarded their best talent and resisted releasing their members to a national squad which added to the problems of forming top class international crews. In his first years here Bob set up a coaching award scheme intended to pass his knowledge on to as many coaches as possible and thereby start building the foundations of a pyramid of talent from which would rise world beating crews. In 1973 Bob overcame the resistance of the clubs to a national squad and was able to form a national squad by inviting the best oarsmen from all the clubs in Britain. That same year, the double scull of Baillieu and Hart won a bronze medal at the European championships in Moscow and in 1974 the national VIII won a silver medal at the World Championships in Lucerne. This VIII was composed of oarsmen who had been competing international for some years and typically being placed in the small final (i.e. 6 –12 th). The national VIII coached by Bob repeated the silver medal success again at the 1976 Olympics. This was at a time when the Soviet block sportsmen and women were training on a semi-professional, full-time basis. Bob retired as national coach after the Montreal Olympics but thanks to him British rowing has never looked back. Two of his influences in particular persist to this day: first, the introduction of modern coaching and training techniques and the dispersion of these throughout the country via the ARA coaching scheme. Second and equally important, he installed a belief in the British rowing fraternity that we could produce medal winning crews, a belief that had been absent for some years. Bob is a very unassuming character and despite the fact that since retiring as national rowing coach he has been building rowing boats, he has stayed out of the lime light to the extent that current British oarsmen and women have little understanding of the contribution he made to their success. It is time that he received his just recognition.\\" References * External links * profile Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Czech male rowers Category:Czechoslovak male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Czechoslovakia Category:Rowers at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:Olympic medalists in rowing Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers from Prague Category:European Rowing Championships medalists ","title":"Bohumil Janoušek"},{"id":"20757425","text":"Kasalia is a village in Gopalganj District, Bangladesh, part of Muksudpur Upazila.

White was born in the late 1960s, is a native of Point Lookout, New York, and graduated Fordham University. White worked in his family's business and began to work for Intrepid in 1992 and became chief of staff to Zachary Fisher and fundraiser for the Intrepid Museum Foundation. In 1996 he was awarded the Meritorious Public Service Award for his work for the United States Navy. He resides in Manhattan. In 2008, White was mentioned as a possible nominee for United States Secretary of the Navy for the Obama administration. His nomination was supported by Hugh Shelton, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Jerrold Nadler, in whose congressional district the Intrepid Museum is located. The post eventually went to former Mississippi governor and ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ray Mabus. In June 2009, The Washington Times reported White to be considered for Deputy Chief Management Officer for the United States Department of Defense, which would make him the highest-ranking openly gay person in the department. In 2010, Bill White founded Constellations Group, a strategic consulting firm that advises corporations, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals with their business challenges and philanthropic endeavors. The firms' mission is to support the men and women of the US armed forces and first responder communities and their families. Bill White resigned from his position as President of the Intrepid museum and other Intrepid related positions in May 2010 in order to pursue new challenges with similar goals. The museum gave no explanations for White's abrupt resignation. White had been subpoenaed earlier by the office of then New York State Attorney-General Andrew Cuomo in connection with investigations into campaign fundraising solicitations from pension fund managers. He had been connected to former state comptroller Alan G. Hevesi who resigned after pleading guilty to a felony charge. In September 2010, Bill White agreed to pay a $1,000,000 fine to settle charges that he was involved in the state pension fund pay to play scandal. On February 1, 2011 Bill White was voted back onto the Board of Trustees of the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund On May 14, 2012 it was reported by CNN that in a letter obtained by CNN Bill White had withdrawn his support from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney over his stance on gay marriage days after President Obama had stated his full support for gay marriage. In his letter, Bill White requests that Romney's campaign return his maximum contribution. White stated to CNN that while he does not support President Obama's fiscal policy, he supports him over Romney because he believed Romney would push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage that would nullify his own marriage. After President Trump's election in 2016, Bill White and his husband Bryan Eure, switched their political and donor activity to conservative causes, abandoning their previous support for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Personal life White married his husband Bryan Eure in 2011, with prominent lawyer David Boies officiating. In attendance were Barbara Walters, David A. Patterson, Gayle King, and Joel Grey, among many other high-profile individuals. Aretha Franklin was the wedding singer. Bill splits his time between Atlanta, GA and New York City. In 2012, White purchased a townhouse in Manhattan at 460 West 22nd Street for $4.6 million and subsequently flipped it for $16 million after extensive renovations. The renovated property had been visited by Barack Obama, Jennifer Lopez and Mark Wahlberg before it was bought by DRGB Y Asociados LLC.  2014 Fundraiser with President Obama  On October 7, 2014, President Obama attended a $25,000 a seat fundraiser hosted in the home of Bryan Eure and Bill White, the former president of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum and the chairman of the Constellations Group.

Background  Tian Ji'an was born in 781 or 782, during the reign of Emperor Dezong of Tang. At that time, his father Tian Xu was an officer under Tian Xu's cousin Tian Yue, the military governor of Weibo Circuit, who governed the circuit semi-independently from the imperial regime. (Tian Xu's father Tian Chengsi had been the first military governor of Weibo, but chose Tian Yue to be his successor rather than any of his sons.) Tian Ji'an was Tian Xu's third son, and was born of a mother of lowly birth.Old Book of Tang, vol. 141. After Tian Xu assassinated Tian Yue and succeeded him in 784,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230. Emperor Dezong gave Tian Xu his daughter Princess Jiacheng in marriage in 785.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. As she had no son of her own, she adopted Tian Ji'an as her son. He was thus made the deputy military governor and Tian Xu's designated successor. When Tian Xu died suddenly in 796, the Weibo soldiers supported Tian Ji'an as acting military governor, and Emperor Dezong made him military governor later in the year.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Tian Ji'an also inherited Tian Xu's title as Prince of Yanmen.  As Jiedushi  In 806, Tian Ji'an was further given the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. It was said that in Tian's youth, his behavior was curbed in by Princess Jiacheng's sternness, and that while he was not capable, he followed the rites and the laws. After Princess Jiacheng died, however, he lost self-control, and he spent his time on polo, hunting, and pleasure. In 809, after the death of Wang Shizhen the military governor of neighboring Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, then emperor, was taking a harder line against the circuits acting as semi-independent states, and for months he refused to approve the succession of Wang Shizhen's son Wang Chengzong. Emperor Xianzong finally agreed after Wang Chengzong agreed to allow two of Chengde's prefectures, De (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (棣州, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) be separated into a different circuit under imperial control, to be named Baoxin Circuit (保信, to be headquartered at De Prefecture). He made Xue Changchao () the prefect of De Prefecture, whose wife was from the Wang clan, the military governor of the new circuit. However, when Tian received news of this in advance of the news arriving at Chengde, he informed Wang Chengzong that Xue had betrayed him. In response, Wang Chengzong had Xue arrested and refused to submit the two prefectures.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Emperor Xianzong thereafter ordered a campaign against Chengde, and with the main imperial forces — the Shence Army (), commanded by the eunuch Tutu Chengcui — set to arrive in Weibo's vicinity, Tian was summoning his officers to discuss how to react — fearing that if the imperial forces were successful against Chengde, Weibo would be next. An officer stepped out and advocated a preemptive attack against the Shence Army, and Tian was ready to agree. However, at that time, Tan Zhong (), an emissary from Liu Ji the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in Beijing), happened to be at Weibo, and he, trying to dissuade Tian from acting against imperial troops, pointing out if Weibo were in fact able to defeat the Shence Army, Emperor Xianzong would surely concentrate his attack on Weibo. Instead, Tan suggested, Weibo should enter into a secret agreement with Chengde whereas Weibo would launch a false attack on Chengde and capture a county to outwardly show Emperor Xianzong that he was not rebelling against imperial authority. Tian agreed with Tan, and in a pre-arranged attack captured Chengde's Tangyang County (堂陽, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Meanwhile, it was said that by this point, Tian was cruel. On one occasion, when his secretary Qiu Jiang () had a dispute with another staff member of Tian's, Hou Zang (), Qiu drew Tian's anger, and Tian initially had Qiu demoted to be a county sheriff. He then recalled Qiu but dug a large hole on Qiu's way back, and when Qiu reached the hole, he ordered that Qiu be thrown into the hole and buried alive. Meanwhile, one of his officers, Tian Xing, a distant relative (Tian Xing's father Tian Tingjie () was a cousin of Tian Chengsi's), was favored by the soldiers and often tried to advise him to correct his behavior. Tian Ji'an believed Tian Xing to be a threat and sent him out of the headquarters to serve as the defender of Linqing (臨清, in modern Xingtai). He also considered executing Tian Xing, and Tian Xing, in order to escape death, pretended to suffer paralysis in his limbs. Meanwhile, in 812, Tian Ji'an himself fell ill from a stroke, and his wife Lady Yuan summoned the officers and named his 10-year-old son Tian Huaijian deputy military governor. (Tian Ji'an had at least three other sons, Tian Huaili (), Tian Huaixun (), and Tian Huairang (); it appeared from the Old Book of Tang that Tian Huaijian was the oldest, although the New Book of Tang actually suggested, although did not explicitly state, that Tian Huaijian was the youngest.New Book of Tang, vol. 210.) Tian Ji'an soon died and was given posthumous honors. With Emperor Xianzong refusing to approve Tian Huaijian's succession, the soldiers supported Tian Xing and overthrew Tian Huaijian in a coup.

This global event, supported by events organized by IOM's nearly 500 country offices and sub-offices as well as governmental, international and domestic civil society partners examines a wide range of migration themes, Social Cohesion, Dignity, Exploitation, Solidarity to advocate for migration guided by the principle that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society. Reasons for the Day Celebrations of the 2017 International Migrants Day in Usera, a neighborhood of Madrid, Spain In 1997, Filipino and other Asian migrant organizations began celebrating and promoting 18 December as the International Day of Solidarity with Migrants. This date was chosen because it was on 18 December 1990 that the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Building on this initiative, 18 December with support from Migrant Rights International and the Steering Committee for the Global Campaign for Ratification of the International Convention on Migrants' Rights and many other organizations – began late 1999 campaigning online for the official UN designation of an International Migrant's Day, which was finally proclaimed on 4 December 2000. The United Nations proclamation of the International Migrants Day is an important step, offering a rallying point for all those concerned with the protection of migrants. The UN invited all UN member states, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to observe this day by disseminating information on human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, sharing experiences, and undertaking action to ensure the protection of migrants. International Migrants Day is seen as an opportunity to recognize the contributions made by millions of migrants to the economies of their host and home countries promotes respect for their basic human rights. Global actions to celebrate International Migrants Day Making migrants' voices heard is the common thread throughout International Migrants Day events. Since 2016, International Migrants Day has also served as the platform for the gala final event of IOM's three-week-long Global Migration Film Festival (GMFF) which in 2019 will feature more than 620 screenings of migration-themed movies and panel discussions about IMD2019's theme of Social Cohesion in 107 countries around the world.

It has an attractive mottled appearance with irregular patches of grey, opaque yellow, or scarlet dolomite in small rhomboid crystals, white and coloured calcite veins, and frequent remnants of fossilised algae. Its colour and the high gloss of its polished surface make it a popular material and it was traditionally used in buildings in the area. It is quarried by the local company Marmor Hotavlje, which employs 150 workers and over the years has developed into one of Slovenia's leading stone-cutting companies, using the local quarries to the north of the settlement as well as travertine and tuff quarries in Jezersko and limestone breccia in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The marble is also used for restoration work in registered buildings.

Ford also operates another plant in Louisville, Kentucky Truck Assembly. The plant houses approximately of conveyor belts. History Ford Motor Company began manufacturing Model T cars in Louisville in 1913, at 931 South Third Street. A new four story assembly plant at Third & Eastern Parkway opened in 1916. In 1925 Ford moved production to a new, one level assembly plant on Southwestern Parkway, on the Ohio River. The current plant on Fern Valley Road opened in 1955. Most Edsel automobiles (around 67%) were produced here in 1957-1959. Other models produced included Sunliners, Fairlanes & Galaxies. Louisville Assembly also produced heavy trucks as well as full-size cars on a separate assembly line. Heavy truck production ceased when the Kentucky Truck Plant opened on Chamberlain Lane in 1969. The factory continued with passenger car production that was augmented in 1973 with the addition of F-Series light trucks. F-Series/LTD passenger car production continued until 1981 when the plant was shut down for retooling for the new compact pickup, the Ranger, and its SUV cousin, the Bronco II.

He was a spokesman for blacks of Kansas and \\"the West\\". Born free in Louisa County, Virginia, he was the son of a wealthy white planter and his common-law wife of African American-Pamunkey ancestry, whom his father freed. His father provided for his sons' education and ensured Langston and his brothers inherited his estate. In 1835 Langston and his older brother Gideon were the first African Americans to attend Oberlin College in Ohio. Langston worked for 30 years for equal rights, suffrage and education in Ohio and Kansas. In 1858, Langston was tried with a white colleague for the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, a cause célèbre that was a catalyst for increasing support for abolition. That year Langston helped found the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society and, with his younger brother John as president, led it as executive secretary. After the American Civil War, he was appointed as general superintendent of refugees and freedmen for the Freedmen's Bureau in Kansas. In 1872 he was appointed as principal of the Quindaro Freedman's School (later Western University), the first black college west of the Mississippi River. He was an older brother of John Mercer Langston, an accomplished attorney and activist, who had numerous appointed posts, and in 1888 was the first black person elected to the United States Congress from Virginia (and the last for nearly a century). Charles was the grandfather of renowned poet Langston Hughes. Early life and education Langston was born free in 1817 in Louisa County, Virginia, the second of three sons and a daughter born to Lucy Jane Langston, a formerly enslaved woman of mixed African-American (including European) and Pamunkey (Native American) descent. Their father was her common-law husband, Ralph Quarles, a wealthy white planter who had immigrated from England. Quarles freed Lucy and their daughter Maria in 1806, in the course of what was a common-law relationship of more than 25 years. Charles Langston and his two younger brothers were born free, to a free woman. (Interracial marriage was illegal in Virginia at the time.) In addition to freeing Lucy and Maria, Quarles made legal provisions for his \\"natural\\" (illegitimate) children to inherit his substantial fortune after his death.Cheek, William Francis, and Aimee Lee. John Mercer Langston and the Fight for Black Freedom, 1829-65. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1989, pp. 11-12. Lucy had had three children with another partner before she moved into the Great House and deepened her relationship with Quarles. Their three sons were born after that. Of the older half- siblings, William Langston had the closest relationship with Quarles's sons. Before his death, Ralph Quarles arranged for his Quaker friend William Gooch to be made guardian of his children. As requested by Quarles, after the parents both died in 1833 (when Charles was sixteen and his younger brother John Mercer Langston was four), Gooch moved with the three boys and their half-brother William Langston to Chillicothe, Ohio, in a free state.Frederick J. Blue, No Taint of Compromise: Crusaders in Antislavery Politics, Louisiana State University Press, 2006, p. 66. Their father had left his natural sons substantial inheritances that provided for their education and, as adults, enabled them to work for political reform. The oldest brother, Gideon, looked so much like his father that at age 21, he took the Quarles surname. In 1835 the older brothers Gideon and Charles started at the preparatory school at Oberlin College, where they were the students of African descent to be admitted. Charles Langston graduated from Oberlin College.Richard B. Sheridan, \\"Charles Henry Langston and the African American Struggle in Kansas\\", Kansas State History, Winter 1999, accessed 15 December 2008. Their younger brother John Langston also graduated from there. CareerOhio= Langston quickly became involved in black political affairs in Ohio, where Oberlin was the center of a strong abolitionist movement, with supporters aiding a station on the Underground Railroad. He started working for suffrage and equal rights for blacks. Not only was he active, but Langston introduced his younger brother John to his political circles. He helped the young man be admitted to a state convention in 1850, when he was only 20. It was the start of an illustrious career in which John would eventually overshadow Charles in political office achieved. In 1858 the older Langston was one of a group of men who freed runaway slave John Price from a US Marshal and his assistants in the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. The Underground Railroad hid Price in Oberlin, then helped transport him to Canada and freedom. The daring rescue captured national attention. The president demanded that the rescuers be prosecuted. A grand jury indicted 37 men (among them 12 free blacks). In response, the state arrested the US Marshal and his team. As a result of negotiations between state and federal officials, only Charles Langston and Simon M. Bushnell, a white man, were tried for their part in subverting the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. The state released the arresting party and the federal government released 35 men.Leon F. Litwack and August Meier (eds), \\"John Mercer Langston: Principle and Politics\\", in Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century, University of Illinois Press, 1991, pp. 106-111. Both Bushnell and Langston were tried and convicted by the same all-Democratic white jury, an injustice Langston addressed in his speech to the court. He made a rousing statement of the case for abolition and for justice for \\"colored men\\", Langston closed with these words: The judge gave the men light sentences. Langston and Bushnell sued for a writ of habeas corpus in 1859 in the Ohio Supreme Court, but it ruled against them, with the judge saying he had no choice but to uphold the federal law. =Kansas= Early in the Civil War in 1862, Langston moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he organized a school for contrabands, escaped slaves who had fled to Union lines from Missouri. He taught the children for about three years. In 1863, Langston returned to Ohio and, like his brother John Mercer, helped recruit African Americans for the United States Colored Troops when Ohio raised its first regiment. By 1865, about 2,455 blacks, nearly one-fifth of those in Kansas, lived in Leavenworth, close to Missouri. In 1865, Langston was appointed general superintendent for refugees and freedmen for the Freedmen's Bureau in Kansas. There were more than 12,000 blacks in Kansas by then.Blue, No Taint of Compromise, 2005, p. 88. While living in Leavenworth, he was active in Topeka, Lawrence, Atchison and small towns in northeastern Kansas, frequently covered in press reports of political activities. From 1863 to 1870, Langston worked for equality under the law for blacks in Kansas: suffrage, the right to sit on juries and testify in court, and to have black children educated in common schools. In 1863, he helped lead a state convention of African Americans, who petitioned the state legislature to gain suffrage. Continuing years of trying to gain support for this goal, Langston gained support by Republican Governor Samuel J. Crawford for a referendum in 1867 on the question of black suffrage. He always stressed that he sought legal justice as a human being, not a black human being. The referendum bill passed by the legislature, however, asked voters to decide not only on black suffrage, but on women suffrage, and a third question of disenfranchising persons who had supported the Confederacy during the war. National women suffrage advocates came to Kansas to promote their cause. Opponents suggested that recently emancipated black men should not receive suffrage before educated women; both franchise measures were defeated. More votes were cast against women suffrage than against black suffrage In 1868, Langston moved near Lawrence, Kansas, where he purchased a farm. Despite the efforts of many activists in the state, the legislature did not enfranchise black men until after national passage in 1870 of the Fifteenth Amendment granting the franchise to males without regard for race. Bill Lohse, \\"Charles Henry Langston\\", The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed, 2007-2008, accessed 17 December 2008 Blacks were not authorized to serve on juries until 1874. Langston had pushed for black men to be included on juries (restricted to men at the time), noting that without that representation, blacks were not being tried \\"by a jury of their peers.\\" In 1872, Langston was appointed as president of Quindaro Freedman's School (later Western University), then located on the outskirts of Kansas City west of the Missouri River. The college closed in the 20th century and much of the site was abandoned; it was taken over by Kansas City, but major city development moved westward. Today the Quindaro Townsite is preserved for historical purposes, as the site of an early African-American community in the state. Chartered in 1865 by a group of white abolitionists, Quindaro Freedman's School developed as the earliest college for blacks established west of the Mississippi River. In 1872 the legislature provided funding for its expansion to a four-year curriculum as a normal school, for training of teachers, which Langston headed. Enrollment increased and teachers were trained. The next year, however, the state and school ran into severe financial difficulties, and had to reduce programs when the state suffered agricultural losses. Later in the century the college's programs were revived and expanded, including a theological course. By the early 20th century, the university was promoted as a model of musical and industrial education. It had some noted women graduates who had professional careers in music in New York City.Helen Walker-Hill, \\"Western University at Quindaro, Kansas and its legacy of pioneering musical women\\", Black Music Research Journal, Spring 2006, accessed 17 December 2008. The college closed later in the 20th century, and no buildings remain. As the black population increased rapidly in Kansas in the decades during and after the Reconstruction era, Langston worked to aid the \\"exodusters\\" and other early migrants. From 17,108 blacks in Kansas in 1870, the numbers increased to 43,107 in 1880 and 52,003 by 1900. Most lived in urban areas. In 1880 Langston was president of a statewide Convention of Colored Men that called on the Refugee Relief Board to use monies and goods donated for the new migrants and settle them on school properties to help them get established. In Lawrence, Langston also served as associate editor of the Historic Times, a local paper that promoted the cause of equal rights and justice for blacks. Marriage and family After his first wife died, in 1869 Langston married the widow Mary Patterson Leary in Oberlin. She had survived Lewis Sheridan Leary, another mixed-race political activist from Oberlin. He had joined John Brown's Raid in 1859 on Harper's Ferry and died of wounds eight days after the attack. Mary brought their daughter Louise to the marriage with Langston. They had two children together. The Langstons remained in Lawrence, Kansas, for the rest of their lives, moving in 1888 into town, where Charles had a part-interest in a grocery store. Their children were Nathaniel Turner Langston, named after the man who led a slave rebellion in Virginia; and Caroline Mercer Langston. She married and had a son, Langston Hughes, who became a renowned poet in the United States. The Langstons also had a foster son, named Dessalines Langston after a major leader of the Haitian Revolution. Community involvement In addition to his political activities, while in Columbus, Ohio, Langston was president of the Colored Benevolent Society, first Worshipful Master of St. Mark's Lodge No. 7. He also served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Kansas, and a founder of the Inter-state Library Association. He also was active in an African Methodist Episcopal Church. Legacy and honors *In 1872 the Kansas Republican Party honored Langston by nominating him as one of four electors to cast the state's votes for President Ulysses S. Grant. *At his death in 1892, the Lawrence Weekly Record published a 200-word obituary about him, demonstrating his high community standing. *Historian Richard B.

It is the capital of the Germán Jordán Province and the Cliza Municipality. Along with Punata, Cliza is the major city in the valle alto of the Cochabamba Department.  History  It is believed that in the pre-columbine era, men from Cliza were known as \\"Sapanas\\" (quechua for braid), given that they wore their hair in a long braid. The Sapana men used to live in Sach'amoqo, abundant of green pastures, next to crystal clear springs, under the bluest sky. Manco Kapac's descendants farmed this land and practiced the three Inca commands: Ama quella (Do not be lazy), Ama llulla (Do not lie), and Ama sua (Do not steal), as well as the ayni. When the Spaniards arrived, the name Sach'amoqo was changed to Valle de Elisa because, it is said that when they took over the Tawantinsuyu and asked the quechuas for the sapanas tribe's name, they answered \\"It's the tribe of the Lisas (quechua for brave, surly)\\" . The name was then changed to Valle de Cliza when the Spanish crown offered the town's lands as a gift to Pedro Ximenes de Vargas in 1595. When Pedro Ximenes de Vargas died, his daughter Francisa Vargas inherited the lands, who upon her death, left in her will that the lands go to the Santa Clara Monastery. This event resulted in the final formation of el Valle de Cliza. In September 21st of 1912, Dr. Eliodoro Villazon Montano founded Cliza as a province by law. Later in 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Gualberto Villarroel modified the title of Provincia Cliza for Provincia German Jordan in honor of his son, illustrious, fallen soldier of the Chaco War.  Education  The school system in Cliza is the same of Bolivia. Children begin pre-school around 4 years old to then spend 5 years in elementary school which ends in 5th grade. Intermediate education follows elementary school and includes grades 6,7,8. Lastly, high school or secondary school 1ro de secundaria to 4to de secundaria (grades 9,10,11,12 in America). Cliza does not have universities, therefore, the students who wish to pursue higher education, must move to the city of Cochabamba or other departments. Based on a survey and census from 1992 it was found that approximately 23.6% of the population was illiterate. However, these percentages may have significantly changed due to Mr. President's Evo Morales Ayma's program \\"Yo Si Puedo\\" in 2006. The program sought to end illiteracy specially in rural areas, to help adults over 50 years old who predominantly spoke quechua and worked arduous jobs in the field.  Gastronomy and Tourism  Cliza is mainly known for its famous \\"Pichon a la brasa\\" (grilled baby pigeon/squab) which is served with fideo (macaroni) con mani, chuño (freeze-dried potato), potato and onion and tomato. Pichon a la brasa is found, Monday through Sunday, outside of El Mercado Principal. Though Pichon a la brasa is Cliza's main dish, other typical foods include: pique macho, fideos uchu, salchipapas, pacumutus, anticuchos, picana and chicha. The following are the descriptions of the more meticulous dishes from the list. * Anticucho \\\\- Cow's heart thinly sliced, marinated with salt, garlic and soy sauce (varies by stand), grilled, served with potato and spicy peanut sauce (peanut, locoto, garlic, salt, cumin, all ingredients are ground on a table made out of stone, with a round stone) * Picana - The main ingredient for this dish is pork, cow, chicken and lamb. It is served with humintas (similar to a sweet tamale; it has cheese inside), and potato which are cooked all night in a traditional oven made out of clay. The meats are also cooked all night in a pot made out of clay, at low fire which is fueled with firewood from different trees. * Chicha \\\\- It's a fermented, alcoholic beverage derived from maize. The cost of Pichon a la brasa is 35bs., or around $5.5; the other less intricate dishes range from $1.5, to $4. For deserts and other sweets, rosquetes, helado de leche y canela are the more famous from the region. Tourists come from all sectors of the country, and international tourists are also very common, especially from Europe and surrounding South American countries. The biggest attraction from Cliza are \\"Fiesta de la Virgen del Carmen\\", followed by \\"Feria del Pichon\\" and \\"Feria de la Picana\\" which is the Sunday after Easter; it's a sacred tradition for cliceños. One peculiar fact about the Feria de la Picana is that at the end of the fair there is a competition of around 15 folkloric groups from Cliza and other neighboring towns. This event brings approximately 6,000 tourists each year. Because Cliza's weather template, with an annual average of 18ºC and 27ºC during the warmer months of summer, make Cliza an ideal spot to visit any time of the year.  Notable People  * Ramiro Numbela: Highly respected artist. Mr. Numbela made the well-known sculpture from the plaza. He has contributed to several different projects included the \\"Parque Cretaceo\\", the statues from Arbieto, and sculpted the dinosaurs for the \\"Parque de Huellas de Dinosaurio from ToroToro\\" or Bolivia's Jurassic Park. * David Ferrufino Zurita: Mr. Ferrufino is the most well known mechanic and welder from Cliza, though his name is vastly known in other towns from Santa Cruz and other departments. Born in 1941, he emigrated to Argentina at age 15 and specialized in welding; he worked for the biggest ship company from Argentina at the time, Aliscafo. He worked for the Aliscafo company for nearly 35 years to then return to his native Bolivia and open his own mechanic shop. There is no one in Cliza who does not know of Mr. Ferrufino for he has helped even the most hopeless customer, a lady who got her ring stuck on her finger. His specialty is making seed sowing equipment for tractors from scratch, using scrap metals from his shop.

As a forward operating agency of the United States Army Medical Command, APHC is responsible for providing technical support and expertise in the areas of preventive medicine, public health, health promotion, and wellness to military units around the globe. Throughout the history of warfare, armies have depended on clean water, wholesome food, sanitation, disease and injury prevention, hazard-free environments and other sound public health practices to keep Soldiers in fighting form. The Army Public Health Center has broadened the scope of the public health mission to meet today's Army's needs: to enhance Army readiness by identifying and assessing current and emerging health threats; developing and communicating public health solutions; and assuring the quality and effectiveness of the Army's Public Health Enterprise. John Resta serves as the director. The Maryland Office of ORAU and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) administers research participation programs for APHC. HistoryBefore 2015= The lineage of the APHC can be traced back more than 70 years to the Army Industrial Hygiene Laboratory, which was established in 1942 at the beginning of World War II under the direct jurisdiction of the Army surgeon general. AIHL originally was located at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health; it had a staff of three and an annual budget of $3,000. Its mission was to conduct occupational health surveys and investigations within the Department of Defense industrial production base, a mission that proved beneficial to the nation's war effort. In October 1945, AIHL was transferred to what is now Aberdeen Proving Ground - South. From 1940 to 1960, AIHL's mission and personnel continued to expand, and AIHL became the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (USAEHA) located at Edgewood Arsenal which was later merged with Aberdeen Proving Ground. During the 1960s and early 1970s, AEHA provided a variety of public health services to all US-based Army installations, including water supply, water and air pollution control, industrial hygiene, and others. In 1973, USAEHA became a subordinate command of the U.S. Army Health Services Command (the latter later became the United States Army Medical Command). The following year, USAEHA was given command of the health and environmental resources of the Army medical laboratories. These assets became USAEHA subordinate commands. In 1994, USAEHA was re-designated as the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine. In addition to its continental United States regional commands, USACHPPM also had two subordinate commands. In 1995, USACHPPM Europe was activated in Landstuhl, Germany, and USACHPPM Pacific was activated, moving in 1997 to Camp Zama, Japan. In 2010, the center was merged with the United States Army Veterinary Command (VETCOM) to form U.S. Army Public Health Command. VETCOM supported almost 500 DOD installations worldwide and included the DOD Veterinary Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory and the DOD Military Working Dog Veterinary Service. Through this merger, a uniquely capable military organization was born—one that embodies the “One Health” approach to public health. One Health is the concept that health in animals, people, and the environment is interrelated; that is, the health of each contributes to the health of all. The formal uniting of prevention, health promotion, and veterinary missions allowed for full coordination, synchronization, and integration of the military public health services around the globe. USAPHC, inactivated on October 1, 2016, had six subordinate elements: the Army Institute for Health and five regional commands located at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland; Joint Base San Antonio in Texas; Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington; Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany; and Camp Zama in Japan. USAPHC's mission was to promote health and prevent disease, injury, and disability of Soldiers and retirees, their Families, and Army civilians, and to provide veterinary medicine services for the Army and Department of Defense. USAPHC also provided consulting services to senior military leaders, commanders both deployed and in garrison, and military medical and health professionals. =U.S. Army Public Health Center= USAPHC Toxicology Lab technician assessing samples The APHC reached provisional status on August 17, 2015 and full operating capacity on October 1, 2016. Headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, the APHC is a field operating activity of the U.S. Army Medical Command, but it is unique among MEDCOM organizations in these ways: * Its “patients” are populations, that is groups of people—military units, their families, or Army civilian employees, for example—rather than individuals. * It emphasizes prevention of disease, injury, and disability, rather than healing those who have already experienced these conditions. * It is proactive, optimizing health by educating members of the Army population about healthy behaviors, empowering them to build and sustain their own good health. Mission and Services The APHC draws on a distinguished legacy to provide public health services to its Army and Department of Defense customers around the world. It standardizes and promulgates practices and procedures used throughout the public health enterprise, provides one-of-a-kind and reach-back technical capabilities, and oversees quality assurance of public health missions. The organization completes an extensive amount of analytical support to global operations and is responsible for the collection and archival of all deployment occupational and environmental health surveillance data. APHC personnel have expertise in a variety of fields. Their professions include almost 70 scientific and technical disciplines, which are brought to bear on public health issues and problems in matrixed teams. The APHC continues to fulfill its mission of enhancing Army readiness and focusing on promoting healthy people, communities, animals and workplaces.

Herd behavior occurs in animals in herds, packs, bird flocks, fish schools and so on, as well as in humans. Demonstrations, riots, general strikes, sporting events, religious gatherings, everyday decision-making, judgement and opinion-forming, are all forms of human based herd behavior. Raafat, Chater and Frith proposed an integrated approach to herding, describing two key issues, the mechanisms of transmission of thoughts or behavior between individuals and the patterns of connections between them. They suggested that bringing together diverse theoretical approaches of herding behavior illuminates the applicability of the concept to many domains, ranging from cognitive neuroscience to economics. In animals Shimmering behaviour of Apis dorsata (giant honeybees) A group of animals fleeing from a predator shows the nature of herd behavior. In 1971, in the oft cited article \\"Geometry For The Selfish Herd\\", evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton asserted that each individual group member reduces the danger to itself by moving as close as possible to the center of the fleeing group. Thus the herd appears as a unit in moving together, but its function emerges from the uncoordinated behavior of self-serving individuals. =Symmetry- breaking= Asymmetric aggregation of animals under panic conditions has been observed in many species, including humans, mice, and ants. Theoretical models have demonstrated symmetry-breaking similar to observations in empirical studies. For example, when panicked individuals are confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits, a majority will favor one exit while the minority will favor the other. Possible mechanisms for this behavior include Hamilton’s selfish herd theory, neighbor copying, or the byproduct of communication by social animals or runaway positive feedback. Characteristics of escape panic include: * Individuals attempt to move faster than normal. * Interactions between individuals become physical. * Exits become arched and clogged. * Escape is slowed by fallen individuals serving as obstacles. * Individuals display a tendency towards mass or copied behavior. * Alternative or less used exits are overlooked. In human societies: Early research The philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were among the first to criticize what they referred to as \\"the crowd\\" (Kierkegaard) and \\"herd morality\\" and the \\"herd instinct\\" (Nietzsche) in human society. Modern psychological and economic research has identified herd behavior in humans to explain the phenomenon of large numbers of people acting in the same way at the same time. The British surgeon Wilfred Trotter popularized the \\"herd behavior\\" phrase in his book, Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War (1914). In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Thorstein Veblen explained economic behavior in terms of social influences such as \\"emulation,\\" where some members of a group mimic other members of higher status. In \\"The Metropolis and Mental Life\\" (1903), early sociologist George Simmel referred to the \\"impulse to sociability in man\\", and sought to describe \\"the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society' \\". Other social scientists explored behaviors related to herding, such as Sigmund Freud (crowd psychology), Carl Jung (collective unconscious), Everett Dean Martin (Behavior of Crowds) and Gustave Le Bon (the popular mind). Swarm theory observed in non-human societies is a related concept and is being explored as it occurs in human society. Scottish journalist Charles Mackay identifies multiple facets of herd behaviour in his 1841 work, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.  In markets and economic situations Currency crises= Currency crises tend to display herding behavior when foreign and domestic investors convert a government's currency into physical assets (like gold) or foreign currencies when they realize the government is unable to repay its debts. This is called a speculative attack and it will tend to cause moderate inflation in the short term. When consumers realize that the inflation of needed commodities is increasing, they will begin to stockpile and hoard goods, which will accelerate the rate of inflation even faster. This will ultimately crash the currency and likely lead to civil unrest. =Stock market bubbles= Large stock market trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying (bubbles) or selling (crashes). Many observers cite these episodes as clear examples of herding behavior that is irrational and driven by emotion—greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes. Individual investors join the crowd of others in a rush to get in or out of the market.Markus K. Brunnermeier, Asset Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis, and Herding , Oxford University Press (2001). Some followers of the technical analysis school of investing see the herding behavior of investors as an example of extreme market sentiment.Robert Prechter, The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior, New Classics Library (1999), pp. 152–153. The academic study of behavioral finance has identified herding in the collective irrationality of investors, particularly the work of Nobel laureates Vernon L. Smith, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, and Robert Shiller. Hey and Morone (2004) analyzed a model of herd behavior in a market context. Some empirical works on methods for detecting and measuring the extent of herding include Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). These results refer to a market with a well-defined fundamental value. A notable incident of possible herding is the 2007 Uranium bubble, which started with flooding of the Cigar Lake Mine in Saskatchewan, during the year 2006. = Economic theory of herding = There are two strands of work in economic theory that consider why herding occurs and provide frameworks for examining its causes and consequences. The first of these strands is that on herd behavior in a non-market context. The seminal references are Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch (1992), both of which showed that herd behavior may result from private information not publicly shared. More specifically, both of these papers showed that individuals, acting sequentially on the basis of private information and public knowledge about the behavior of others, may end up choosing the socially undesirable option. A large subsequent literature has examined the causes and consequences of such \\"herds\\" and information cascades, as surveyed by Golub and Sadler (2016). The second strands concerns information aggregation in market contexts. A very early reference is the classic paper by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) that showed that uninformed traders in a market context can become informed through the price in such a way that private information is aggregated correctly and efficiently. Subsequent work has shown that markets may systematically overweight public information; it has also studied the role of strategic trading as an obstacle to efficient information aggregation.  Herd behavior in social and political contexts In crowds= Crowds that gather on behalf of a grievance can involve herding behavior that turns violent, particularly when confronted by an opposing ethnic or racial group. The Los Angeles riots of 1992, New York Draft Riots and Tulsa Race Riot are notorious in U.S. history. The idea of a \\"group mind\\" or \\"mob behavior\\" was put forward by the French social psychologists Gabriel Tarde and Gustave Le Bon. =Sheeple= Sheeple (; a portmanteau of \\"sheep\\" and \\"people\\") is a derogatory term that highlights the passive herd behavior of people easily controlled by a governing power or market fads which likens them to sheep, a herd animal that is easily led about. The term is used to describe those who voluntarily acquiesce to a suggestion without any significant critical analysis or research, in large part due to the majority of a population having a similar mindset. Word Spy defines it as \\"people who are meek, easily persuaded, and tend to follow the crowd (sheep + people)\\". Merriam-Webster defines the term as \\"people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced: people likened to sheep\\". The word is pluralia tantum, which means it does not have a singular form. While its origins are unclear, the word was used by W. R. Anderson in his column Round About Radio, published in London 1945, where he wrote: > The simple truth is that you can get away with anything, in government. That > covers almost all the evils of the time. Once in, nobody, apparently, can > turn you out. The People, as ever (I spell it \\"Sheeple\\"), will stand > anything. Another early use was from Ernest Rogers, whose 1949 book The Old Hokum Bucket contained a chapter entitled \\"We the Sheeple\\". The Wall Street Journal first reported the label in print in 1984; the reporter heard the word used by the proprietor of the American Opinion bookstore.Bob Davis, \\"In New Hampshire, 'Live Free or Die' Is More Than a Motto,\\" The Wall Street Journal, 1984, quoted online at Word Spy The term was first popularized in the late 1980s and early 1990s by conspiracy theorist and broadcaster Bill Cooper on his radio program The Hour of the Time which was broadcast internationally via shortwave radio stations. The program gained a small, yet dedicated following, inspiring many individuals who would later broadcast their own radio programs critical of the United States government. This then led to its regular use on the radio program Coast to Coast AM by Art Bell throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. These combined factors significantly increased the popularity of the word and led to its widespread use. The term can also be used for those who seem inordinately tolerant, or welcoming, of widespread policies. In a column entitled \\"A Nation of Sheeple\\", columnist Walter E. Williams writes, \\"Americans sheepishly accepted all sorts of Transportation Security Administration nonsense. In the name of security, we've allowed fingernail clippers, eyeglass screwdrivers, and toy soldiers to be taken from us prior to boarding a plane.\\"\\"A Nation of Sheeple\\", Capitalism Magazine, October 19, 2005. =Everyday decision-making= \\"Benign\\" herding behaviors may occur frequently in everyday decisions based on learning from the information of others, as when a person on the street decides which of two restaurants to dine in. Suppose that both look appealing, but both are empty because it is early evening; so at random, this person chooses restaurant A. Soon a couple walks down the same street in search of a place to eat. They see that restaurant A has customers while B is empty, and choose A on the assumption that having customers makes it the better choice. Because other passersby do the same thing into the evening, restaurant A does more business that night than B. This phenomenon is also referred as an information cascade.  In marketing  Herd behavior is often a useful tool in marketing and, if used properly, can lead to increases in sales and changes to the structure of society. Whilst it has been shown that financial incentives cause action in large numbers of people, herd mentality often wins out in a case of \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\". = In brand and product success = Communications technologies have contributed to the proliferation to consumer choice and \\"the power of crowds\\", Consumers increasingly have more access to opinions and information from both opinion leaders and formers on platforms that have largely user-generated content, and thus have more tools with which to complete any decision-making process. Popularity is seen as an indication of better quality, and consumers will use the opinions of others posted on these platforms as a powerful compass to guide them towards products and brands that align with their preconceptions and the decisions of others in their peer groups. Taking into account differences in needs and their position in the socialization process, Lessig & Park examined groups of students and housewives and the influence that these reference groups have on one another. By way of herd mentality, students tended to encourage each other towards beer, hamburger and cigarettes, whilst housewives tended to encourage each other towards furniture and detergent. Whilst this particular study was done in 1977, one cannot discount its findings in today's society. A study done by Burke, Leykin, Li and Zhang in 2014 on the social influence on shopper behavior shows that shoppers are influenced by direct interactions with companions, and as a group size grows, herd behaviour becomes more apparent. Discussions that create excitement and interest have greater impact on touch frequency and purchase likelihood grows with greater involvement caused by a large group. Shoppers in this Midwestern American shopping outlet were monitored and their purchases noted, and it was found up to a point, potential customers preferred to be in stores which had moderate levels of traffic. The other people in the store not only served as company, but also provided an inference point on which potential customers could model their behavior and make purchase decisions, as with any reference group or community. Social media can also be a powerful tool in perpetuating herd behaviour. Its immeasurable amount of user-generated content serves as a platform for opinion leaders to take the stage and influence purchase decisions, and recommendations from peers and evidence of positive online experience all serve to help consumers make purchasing decisions. Gunawan and Huarng's 2015 study concluded that social influence is essential in framing attitudes towards brands, which in turn leads to purchase intention. Influencers form norms which their peers are found to follow, and targeting extroverted personalities increases chances of purchase even further. This is because the stronger personalities tend to be more engaged on consumer platforms and thus spread word of mouth information more efficiently. Many brands have begun to realise the importance of brand ambassadors and influencers, and it is being shown more clearly that herd behaviour can be used to drive sales and profits exponentially in favour of any brand through examination of these instances. = In social marketing = Marketing can easily transcend beyond commercial roots, in that it can be used to encourage action to do with health, environmentalism and general society. Herd mentality often takes a front seat when it comes to social marketing, paving the way for campaigns such as Earth Day, and the variety of anti-smoking and anti-obesity campaigns seen in every country. Within cultures and communities, marketers must aim to influence opinion leaders who in turn influence each other, as it is the herd mentality of any group of people that ensures a social campaign's success. A campaign run by Som la Pera in Spain to combat teenage obesity found that campaigns run in schools are more effective due to influence of teachers and peers, and students' high visibility, and their interaction with one another. Opinion leaders in schools created the logo and branding for the campaign, built content for social media and led in-school presentations to engage audience interaction. It was thus concluded that the success of the campaign was rooted in the fact that its means of communication was the audience itself, giving the target audience a sense of ownership and empowerment. As mentioned previously, students exert a high level of influence over one another, and by encouraging stronger personalities to lead opinions, the organizers of the campaign were able to secure the attention of other students who identified with the reference group. Herd behaviour not only applies to students in schools where they are highly visible, but also amongst communities where perceived action plays a strong role. Between 2003 and 2004, California State University carried out a study to measure household conservation of energy, and motivations for doing so. It was found that factors like saving the environment, saving money or social responsibility did not have as great an impact on each household as the perceived behaviour of their neighbours did. Although the financial incentives of saving money, closely followed by moral incentives of protecting the environment, are often thought of as being a community's greatest guiding compass, more households responded to the encouragement to save energy when they were told that 77% of their neighbours were using fans instead of air conditioning, proving that communities are more likely to engage in a behaviour if they think that everyone else is already taking part. Herd behaviours shown in the two examples exemplify that it can be a powerful tool in social marketing, and if harnessed correctly, has the potential to achieve great change. It is clear that opinion leaders and their influence achieve huge reach among their reference groups and thus can be used as the loudest voices to encourage others in any collective direction.

It was held annually in Salt Lake City, Utah, most often in March of each year, and typically lasted for much of a week. For much of the 1990s the conference was held on the campus of the University of Utah, then beginning in 1997 it was held in the Salt Palace Convention Center. During the keynote addresses for the conference, Novell would present its vision of the direction of the computer industry and how its products fit into that direction. There were then many highly technical breakout sessions where Novell technologies were explained in detail and customers and partners could engage Novell engineers regarding them. Typically some 5,000 to 7,000 attendees came to each BrainShare. Aims The goal of BrainShare was to spread the company's message and inform its users and partners as to the capabilities and technical characteristics of its products. As one publication said, \\"Novell holds its annual BrainShare conference to help refocus attention on the company, its goals and objectives for the upcoming year, and its networking technologies.\\" Novell would use BrainShare to help introduce new technologies or acquisitions, such as UnixWare or AppWare, to its base audience. In addition, once Novell's fortunes began a downhill slide in the mid-1990s, especially under pressure from Microsoft Windows NT, BrainShare was used to showcase new approaches that were intended to turn things around. History Novell's product history can be seen in the volumes of presentation books handed out at BrainShare '95 The conference first took place in 1985. During the 1980s the conference was generally just known as the Novell Developers Conference. In 1988 it was held in February in Salt Lake City, and in 1989 it was held over three days in February. By 1991 it was being held in March. The first conference to be known by the name BrainShare appears to be that held in March 1992. During much of the 1990s the conference was held on the campus of the University of Utah, in the hills overlooking the rest of Salt Lake City, around the third week of March of each year, during the school's spring break. Talks for large numbers of attendees were held in the Huntsman Center indoor arena, while ones for smaller numbers were held in other buildings on campus. Novell provided shuttle buses to take attendees from their hotels to the conference site. Beginning with BrainShare '97, the conference was no longer on the university campus, but instead was held in the recently opened Salt Palace Convention Center in downtown Salt Lake. In these years the event was organized in a more conventional manner around a trade show floor. The date of the conference could vary more and in 2003 it was held in April rather than March. Attendance at BrainShare varied from year to year, but for the most part once the conference was fully established it was in the 5,000 to 7,000 range. Attendees came from many countries around the world, in one being stated as coming from 60 countries. Structure Keynote session at BrainShare 2004 at the Salt Palace BrainShare typically lasted for much of a week, such as Sunday through Friday. Each day of BrainShare would start with one or more keynote addresses. One address during the week would be from Novell's CEO of the time. Novell's chief scientist, Drew Major, would usually speak as well. Often outside guests, such as Marc Andreessen or George Gilder, would give their perspective on the future of the industry or the economy. Keynotes would be used to establish the theme of a particular conference, such as \\"pervasive computing\\" in 1995, \\"Smart Global Network\\" in 1996, or \\"Rock the Net\\" in 1997. Ambitious aims would be established, such as 1996's goal of \\"one billion devices interconnected by NetWare by the year 2000\\" In some cases keynotes were used to convey humorous themes, such as the propensity of some executives to dress more formally than necessary. Attendees walking to breakout sessions being held in the university's Francis Armstrong Madsen Building during BrainShare '95 Technical breakout sessions would follow; typically there were more than 200 of these. As one writer for the Deseret News stated, these were \\"extremely technical classes and seminars on the intricacies of developing and implementing Novell networks.\\" In some cases, attendees in these sessions could make enhancement suggestions directly to the developers working on a product. Presentation slides for these sessions were made available as printed handouts at the sessions and, in later years, as downloadable files from the Internet. At least one book on administering NetWare found them a valuable resource. Professionals networking among other attendees was always a main attraction of attending BrainShare. One Novell vice president said in 1996 that BrainShare \\"is the mind-meld that lets us share our vision and our newest technologies supporting it.\\" Promotional merchandise was given out during the show, always an attraction to some; some items had an obvious tie-in to the conference's name, such as small foam \\"brains\\". While some amount of marketing hype was inevitably present during BrainShare, in general the conference kept an emphasis on technical material. Often attendees were passionate about Novell products; one writer termed BrainShare an \\"annual weeklong lovefest\\". Attendees were all kinds of computer professionals, including software architects, software developers, system administrators, IT managers, hardware vendors, systems integrators, consultants, customers, resellers, and service providers. People looked forward to attending BrainShare; one writer termed it his \\"annual pilgrimage to Salt Lake City\\". Chair massages being given during BrainShare 2007 in the Salt Palace Novell's partners would be present at BrainShare. During BrainShare '93, for instance, companies participating in the conference include Microsoft, HP, IBM, WordPerfect, Kodak, Object Design, Lotus Software, and HyperDesk. In some cases these included ones that were Novell competitors, such as Microsoft, following Novell founder Ray Noorda's dictum of \\"coopetition\\". Partners were often listed by level of support, such as Platinum Sponsor. Networking was set up by Novell to allow attendees to join whatever the latest networking technology was at that time. Demonstration rooms, often with names such as the BrainShare Solutions Lab, were constructed for the conference by Novell to allow attendees to see hands-on examples of Novell's latest products and technology. Evening activities would often take place in downtown Salt Lake. Although Salt Lake was not as glamorous as some other convention city destinations, the Wasatch Range provided a scenic backdrop that many attendees found rewarding. Once the conference was in the Salt Palace, evening concerts by name acts were given at the official conference party, such as by Huey Lewis and the News in 2003 and Collective Soul in 2008. The conference was beneficial to the local economy; for instance, BrainShare '95 was said to bring some $4.2 million in revenue to Salt Lake City. Final years In late 2008, after more than 20 years of the conference, Novell announced that BrainShare 2009 would be canceled. The company attributed the decision to customers and partners having reduced travel budgets in the wake of the global recession of 2008–2009. In September 2009, Novell announced that BrainShare would return to Salt Lake City in March 2010. So it did, although attendance was down significantly from historical levels, to around 2,000 people. Novell announced in November 2010 that it had agreed to be acquired by software conglomerate The Attachmate Group. Welcome signs for BrainShare 2013 at the Salt Palace At this point, BrainShare went onto an 18-month cycle rather than being held yearly. Thus, BrainShare 2011 was held in October of that year, and covered products from the Novell, NetIQ, and SUSE product groups. No BrainShare fell into 2012, as BrainShare 2013 was held in February 2013. In September 2014, mainframe software company Micro Focus announced it was buying Attachmate Group, including Novell. The deal had not yet closed when BrainShare 2014 took place in November 2014. By this time attendance was down to 1,200 people, and there was a feeling among some observers that the Salt Palace venue was simply too large for the number of people coming to the conference. The length of the conference was also a couple of days shorter than it had been at its peak; as one writer said, \\"modern BrainShares suffer [by] comparison to the old mega-events.\\" In any case, during the opening keynote Micro Focus executives spoke optimistically about the effects of the upcoming acquisition, and there were intimations that there would be more BrainShare conferences after this one. But there have not been, and on Micro Focus forums a number of people have lamented the disappearance of a conference that they enjoyed attending or presenting at and always found worthwhile. BrainShare UK In the 1990s Salford Computing Services at the University of Salford struck a long-term licensing deal to make Novell (predominantly NetWare) site licences available to universities and other higher educational institutions within the UK. This was very successful, and an annual technical conference was held at the university which Novell fully endorsed and supported. The conference was originally known as the Novell UK Academic Conference, but in later years was known as BrainShare UK.

She served several institutions in various capacities. She received several awards such as Swarnakankanam, instituted by Desoddharaka Kasinathuni Nageswara Rao, Best Telugu Writer award from Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, and Sahitya Akademi among others. Life Krishnakumari was born to Nayani Subba Rao and Hanumayamma in Guntur, a town in Andhra Pradesh, India. She was married to Canakapalli Madhusudana Rao, a lawyer and a distant relative, in 1954. They have one daughter and two sons. Krishnakumari has been an active participant in literary and cultural events. She worked on Telugu ballads and obtained her doctorate in 1970. She had a master's degree in Sanskrit. In her dissertation, Krishnakumari took the western critiquing tools and explained the narrative style in Telugu ballads and correlated their underlying philosophy to the Telugu culture scientifically. Her first book, a story of the Andhra people, entitled Andhrula katha, was published when she was 18. The book was prescribed as a textbook in schools. Her first collection of poetry, agniputri, was published in 1978, shortly after her father died. She died on 29 January 2016 at the age of 85. =Positions held= She started her academic career as lecturer in a women's college in Madras in 1951. In 1952, she moved to Osmania University Women's College in Hyderabad, where she started out as lecturer, and became a reader and professor. During 1983-84, she served as Principal of Padmavathi Mahila University, Tirupati, and returned to Osmania University as Head of the Department of Telugu. She retired in 1990 after serving as the Chair of the Board of Studies in Osmania University for three years. Krishnakumari served as Vice Chancellor of Sri Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, Hyderabad, from 1996 to 1999. At the time of her death, she was professor emeritus. Literary works Krishnakumari was a pioneer in folklore studies and women's literature. Krishnakumari's Telugu Janapada Geya gaathalu (Telugu ballads) is considered her major work. In this dissertation, published in 1977, Krishnakumari discussed at length the origin and development of Telugu ballads in the context of Telugu folk literature. She identified the folk literature as a separate and valuable part of Indian literatures, compared it to similar literatures in other cultures and countries, and produced a systematic classification chart of ethnology, ethnography and sociology. Further, she has shown how other branches such as songs and stories incorporated physical gestures and other theatrical paraphernalia over the course of time. In this she also noted the inclusion of terminology from other languages, which happened with educated singers of the ballads. During her tenure as professor at Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, Krishnakumari published a textbook on folklore entitled Telugu janapada vijnanam: samaajam, samskruti, sahityam, containing articles by several scholars in folklore with topics for discussion and further research. One of Krishnakumari's innovations was to apply the straight line equation from mathematics to the storytelling methods in folklore. This was an innovating experiment in the studies of folklore in Telugu literature and marked Krishnakumari's knowledge of mathematics and her erudition in research methodologies.Ravi Premalatha's article in vidushi. p.25. Krishnakumari publications include two anthologies of her poetry, Agniputri (Daughter of Fire, 1978) and Em cheppanu nestam! (What Can I Say, My Friend!, 1988); history books: Andhrula katha (The Story of Andhra People), manamuu, mana puurvulu (We and Our Ancestors), telugu bhasha charitra (History of Telugu language); two collections of short stories: Ayaatha (A Collection of short stories), Gautami (novel), Aparajita (A collaborative novel with three other writers), pariseelana (An Anthology of reviews), parisodhana (A Collection of research papers), kashmira deepakalika (A travelogue, recounting her experiences of a tour in Kashmir with a group of students), and Telugu Janapada geya gaathalu (Ph.D. dissertation on ballads in Telugu folklore) among several others. Numerous articles on Telugu people's customs, lifestyles, and culture also attest to her comprehension and knowledge in the areas in question. Her travelogue, kashmira deepakalika, is considered unique in Telugu literature for its style. It is an account of her experiences and her response to the beauty of nature in the Kashmir valley during a tour with a group of students she had accompanied. Chekuri Ramarao stated that the book, unlike usual travelogues, is a literary masterpiece brimming with poetry.Rama Rao, Chekuri. \\"kashmira deepakalika yaatraacaritra kaadu: vachana kavitvaaniki rasagulika..\\" vidushi. pp. 55-56. Marking her sixtieth birthday and retirement, several scholars and the elite in Andhra Pradesh honored Krishnakumari. The festschriften volume, vidushi, features several articles from reputable scholars in Andhra Pradesh. =List of important literary works= *Agniputri.

In July 1941 Walter Gericke and his men destroyed the village of Kandanos in Western Crete and killed 180 of its inhabitants. Gericke joined the newly formed Bundeswehr after the rearmament of West Germany and as a Generalmajor led the 1. Luftlande-Division from 1962 to 1965.

His earliest known work dates to the 1820s; he is known to have been active until the time of his death.  Biography  Cosby is said to have worked with Thomas Jefferson on the construction of some of the original buildings of the University of Virginia early in his career, but the precise nature of their collaboration remains unknown. His earliest documented work is the courthouse of Sussex County, Virginia, dated to 1825. Cosby was well-known around southern Virginia and North Carolina, and worked in many styles throughout his career. In 1840 he purchased a lot in Raleigh, North Carolina, living in that town until his death; his letters indicate that he travelled greatly during this time. Most of Cosby's surviving buildings are in Virginia. These include Cumberland County Courthouse in Cumberland, Virginia; Grace Church in the former community of Ca Ira; Halifax County Courthouse in Halifax, Virginia, Venable Hall, on the campus of Hampden–Sydney College; the Sussex County Courthouse in Sussex, and the Goochland County Courthouse complex in Goochland, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as Hotel A, one of the buildings designed by Jefferson that comprise the core of the University of Virginia, which has long housed the Virginia Quarterly Review. In North Carolina he designed the Dr. Beverly Jones House near Bethania, Forsyth County, North Carolina. Cosby died in 1862.

He was the first Manxman ever win the British professional road race title. He is arguably one of the best UK riders of his generation, riding in the 1980s. Cycling career His first cycling race as a youngster was around King Georges Park in Douglas racing in jeans and trainers. However he enjoyed the camaraderie of racing and soon joined the Manx Road Club. By the age of 16 he realised he had talent and won the Merseyside divisional road race championships in 1976 and 1977. He then became the first Manx rider to win the national junior road race series and the British Junior Road race championship. In 1978 he competed in the individual road race at the Commonwealth Games, finishing 27th after crashing on the final lap. The gold medal was won by Phil Anderson. The race featured in a National Film Board of Canada documentary about cycle racing called 'Cycling: Still The Greatest' (https://www.nfb.ca/film/cycling/). The documentary also features footage of Joughin (then an amateur rider who was still working full-time in a garage) training in the Isle of Man. In 1980 he won the Premier Calendar series, whilst riding for the all conquering Manchester Wheelers' Club. However he missed out on selection for the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. At the end of the 1980 season Joughin decided he would spend the 1981 season living and racing in France However he did not settle and was back within a few months. As he was not prepared to live in a hovel scratching around trying to win races in the hope of being offered a professional contract. Instead he opted to live and race in the UK, now and again beating the big stars when they came over. The following season he again won the Premier Calendar series and competed at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. However the highlight was arguably winning a Stage in the Sealink International after outsprinting Dirk De Wolf, the eventual race winner. He was also third in the British National Road Race Championships, the race was won by Jeff Williams. Joughin then turned professional in 1983, aged 23, with the Moducel team which was based in Staffordshire. In only his second season as a professional he won the British National Road Race Championships in 1984. The race was held on the home soil for Joughin, in the Isle of Man and attracted huge crowds. Joughin was in chasing group which caught the main breakaway within sight of the finish. Joughin launched his sprint with 250 metres to go, went past Malcolm Elliott, and then past Bill Nickson just 50 metres from the line. In 1986 Joughin won two stages of the Milk Race leaving behind Djamolidine Abdoujaparov. After four seasons with Moducel he joined Percy Bilton riding alongside Bob Downs and John Herety. That same season he had arguably his greatest ever victory winning stage three in the 1987 Kellogg's Tour of Britain from Manchester to Birmingham, beating some of the biggest names in the sport of cycling such as Sean Kelly. Joughin got into a breakaway and then went clear with Stuart Coles as the race approached Perry Barr on the outskirts of Birmingham. The pair stayed clear of the field all the way to the finish line in Victoira Square in Birmingham city centre, with Joughin winning the sprint comfortably (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bPb3mlkqMM) In 1988 he had one season riding for Ever Ready alongside Tony Doyle and again won the British National Road Race Championships in Newport, Shropshire. However, after just one season he returned to Percy Bilton riding alongside Paul Curran. After notching up 200 wins as an amateur and 80 as pro Joughin retired from racing in 1991. His last season was riding for K.J.C. - Revelation. Joughin showed that he could beat some of the fastest men in the world in bunch sprints. However, it's misleading to pigeon-hole him as purely a sprinter - most of his big wins came from sprinting to victory after going clear in breakaways, including his wins in the 1987 Kellogg’s Tour of Britain and in the British Road Race Championship in 1984 and 1988. Post-cycling career Today Joughin lives in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, where he has run his cycle clothing business, Pro Vision, along with his son Ben, since 1996.

Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs. This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation. Groupthink requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking. The dysfunctional group dynamics of the \\"ingroup\\" produces an \\"illusion of invulnerability\\" (an inflated certainty that the right decision has been made). Thus the \\"ingroup\\" significantly overrates its own abilities in decision-making and significantly underrates the abilities of its opponents (the \\"outgroup\\"). Furthermore, groupthink can produce dehumanizing actions against the \\"outgroup\\". Members of a group can often feel peer pressure to \\"go along with the crowd\\" in fear of rocking the boat or of what them speaking up will do to the overall to how their teammates perceive them. Group interactions tend to favor clear and harmonious agreements and it can be a cause for concern when little to no new innovations or arguments for better policies, outcomes and structures are called to question. (McLeod). Groupthink can often be referred to as a group of “yes men” because group activities and group projects in general make it extremely easy to pass on not offering constructive opinions. Some methods that have been used to counteract group think in the past is selecting teams from more diverse backgrounds, and even mixing men and women for groups (Kamalnath). Groupthink can be considered by many to be a detriment to companies, organizations and in any work situations. Most positions that are senior level need individuals to be independent in their thinking. There is a positive correlation found between outstanding executives and decisiveness (Kelman). Groupthink also prohibits an organization from moving forward and innovating if no one ever speaks up and says something could be done differently. Antecedent factors such as group cohesiveness, faulty group structure, and situational context (e.g., community panic) play into the likelihood of whether or not groupthink will impact the decision-making process. Groupthink is a construct of social psychology, but has an extensive reach and influences literature in the fields of communication studies, political science, management, and organizational theory, as well as important aspects of deviant religious cult behaviour. Groupthink is sometimes stated to occur (more broadly) within natural groups within the community, for example to explain the lifelong different mindsets of those with differing political views (such as \\"conservatism\\" and \\"liberalism\\" in the U.S. political context ) or the purported benefits of team work vs. work conducted in solitude.. However, this conformity of viewpoints within a group does not mainly involve deliberate group decision-making, and might be better explained by the collective confirmation bias of the individual members of the group. Most of the initial research on groupthink was conducted by Irving Janis, a research psychologist from Yale University. Janis published an influential book in 1972, which was revised in 1982. Janis used the Bay of Pigs disaster (the failed invasion of Castro's Cuba in 1961) and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 as his two prime case studies. Later studies have evaluated and reformulated his groupthink model.  History  William H. Whyte Jr. in Fortune magazine, March 1952 '' William H. Whyte Jr. derived the term from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and popularized it in 1952 in Fortune magazine: Irving Janis pioneered the initial research on the groupthink theory. He does not cite Whyte, but coined the term by analogy with \\"doublethink\\" and similar terms that were part of the newspeak vocabulary in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. He initially defined groupthink as follows: He went on to write: Janis set the foundation for the study of groupthink starting with his research in the American Soldier Project where he studied the effect of extreme stress on group cohesiveness. After this study he remained interested in the ways in which people make decisions under external threats. This interest led Janis to study a number of \\"disasters\\" in American foreign policy, such as failure to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941); the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco (1961); and the prosecution of the Vietnam War (1964–67) by President Lyndon Johnson. He concluded that in each of these cases, the decisions occurred largely because of groupthink, which prevented contradictory views from being expressed and subsequently evaluated. After the publication of Janis' book Victims of Groupthink in 1972, and a revised edition with the title Groupthink: Psychological Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes in 1982, the concept of groupthink was used to explain many other faulty decisions in history. These events included Nazi Germany's decision to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, the Watergate scandal and others. Despite the popularity of the concept of groupthink, fewer than two dozen studies addressed the phenomenon itself following the publication of Victims of Groupthink, between the years 1972 and 1998. This was surprising considering how many fields of interests it spans, which include political science, communications, organizational studies, social psychology, management, strategy, counseling, and marketing. One can most likely explain this lack of follow-up in that group research is difficult to conduct, groupthink has many independent and dependent variables, and it is unclear \\"how to translate [groupthink's] theoretical concepts into observable and quantitative constructs\\". Nevertheless, outside research psychology and sociology, wider culture has come to detect groupthink in observable situations, for example: * \\" [...] critics of Twitter point to the predominance of the hive mind in such social media, the kind of groupthink that submerges independent thinking in favor of conformity to the group, the collective\\" * \\"[...] leaders often have beliefs which are very far from matching reality and which can become more extreme as they are encouraged by their followers. The predilection of many cult leaders for abstract, ambiguous, and therefore unchallengeable ideas can further reduce the likelihood of reality testing, while the intense milieu control exerted by cults over their members means that most of the reality available for testing is supplied by the group environment. This is seen in the phenomenon of 'groupthink', alleged to have occurred, notoriously, during the Bay of Pigs fiasco.\\" * \\"Groupthink by Compulsion [...] [G]roupthink at least implies voluntarism. When this fails, the organization is not above outright intimidation. [...] In [a nationwide telecommunications company], refusal by the new hires to cheer on command incurred consequences not unlike the indoctrination and brainwashing techniques associated with a Soviet-era gulag.\\"  Symptoms  To make groupthink testable, Irving Janis devised eight symptoms indicative of groupthink. Type I: Overestimations of the group — its power and morality *Illusions of invulnerability creating excessive optimism and encouraging risk taking. *Unquestioned belief in the morality of the group, causing members to ignore the consequences of their actions. Type II: Closed-mindedness *Rationalizing warnings that might challenge the group's assumptions. *Stereotyping those who are opposed to the group as weak, evil, biased, spiteful, impotent, or stupid. Type III: Pressures toward uniformity *Self-censorship of ideas that deviate from the apparent group consensus. *Illusions of unanimity among group members, silence is viewed as agreement. *Direct pressure to conform placed on any member who questions the group, couched in terms of \\"disloyalty\\" *Mindguards— self-appointed members who shield the group from dissenting information.  Causes  Janis prescribed three antecedent conditions to groupthink. * High group cohesiveness. Janis emphasized that cohesiveness is the main factor that leads to groupthink. Groups that lack cohesiveness can of course make bad decisions, but they do not experience groupthink. In a cohesive group, members avoid speaking out against decisions, avoid arguing with others, and work towards maintaining friendly relationships in the group. If cohesiveness gets to such a high level where there are no longer disagreements between members, then the group is ripe for groupthink. **deindividuation: group cohesiveness becomes more important than individual freedom of expression * Structural faults. Cohesion is necessary for groupthink, but it becomes even more likely when the group is organized in ways that disrupt the communication of information, and when the group engages in carelessness while making decisions. **insulation of the group: can promote the development of unique, inaccurate perspectives on issues the group is dealing with, and can then lead to faulty solutions to the problem. **lack of impartial leadership: leaders can completely control the group discussion, by planning what will be discussed, only allowing certain questions to be asked, and asking for opinions of only certain people in the group. Closed style leadership is when leaders announce their opinions on the issue before the group discusses the issue together. Open style leadership is when leaders withhold their opinion until a later time in the discussion. Groups with a closed style leader have been found to be more biased in their judgments, especially when members had a high degree for certainty. **lack of norms requiring methodological procedures **homogeneity of members' social backgrounds and ideology * Situational context: **highly stressful external threats: High stake decisions can create tension and anxiety, and group members then may cope with the decisional stress in irrational ways. Group members may rationalize their decision by exaggerating the positive consequences and minimizing the possible negative consequences. In attempt to minimize the stressful situation, the group will make a quick decision with little to no discussion or disagreement about the decision. Studies have shown that groups under high stress are more likely to make errors, lose focus of the ultimate goal, and use procedures that members know have not been effective in the past. **recent failures: can lead to low self-esteem, resulting in agreement with the group for fear of being seen as wrong **excessive difficulties in decision-making tasks **time pressures: group members are more concerned with efficiency and quick results, instead of quality and accuracy. Additionally, time pressures can lead to group members overlooking important information regarding the issue of discussion. **moral dilemmas Although it is possible for a situation to contain all three of these factors, all three are not always present even when groupthink is occurring. Janis considered a high degree of cohesiveness to be the most important antecedent to producing groupthink and always present when groupthink was occurring; however, he believed high cohesiveness would not always produce groupthink. A very cohesive group abides to all group norms; whether or not groupthink arises is dependent on what the group norms are. If the group encourages individual dissent and alternative strategies to problem solving, it is likely that groupthink will be avoided even in a highly cohesive group. This means that high cohesion will lead to groupthink only if one or both of the other antecedents is present, situational context being slightly more likely than structural faults to produce groupthink.  Prevention  As observed by Aldag and Fuller (1993), the groupthink phenomenon seems to rest on a set of unstated and generally restrictive assumptions: *The purpose of group problem solving is mainly to improve decision quality *Group problem solving is considered a rational process. *Benefits of group problem solving: **variety of perspectives **more information about possible alternatives **better decision reliability **dampening of biases **social presence effects *Groupthink prevents these benefits due to structural faults and provocative situational context *Groupthink prevention methods will produce better decisions *An illusion of well-being is presumed to be inherently dysfunctional. *Group pressures towards consensus lead to concurrence-seeking tendencies. It has been thought that groups with the strong ability to work together will be able to solve dilemmas in a quicker and more efficient fashion than an individual. Groups have a greater amount of resources which lead them to be able to store and retrieve information more readily and come up with more alternative solutions to a problem. There was a recognized downside to group problem solving in that it takes groups more time to come to a decision and requires that people make compromises with each other. However, it was not until the research of Janis appeared that anyone really considered that a highly cohesive group could impair the group's ability to generate quality decisions. Tight-knit groups may appear to make decisions better because they can come to a consensus quickly and at a low energy cost; however, over time this process of decision-making may decrease the members' ability to think critically. It is, therefore, considered by many to be important to combat the effects of groupthink. According to Janis, decision- making groups are not necessarily destined to groupthink. He devised ways of preventing groupthink: *Leaders should assign each member the role of \\"critical evaluator\\". This allows each member to freely air objections and doubts. *Leaders should not express an opinion when assigning a task to a group. *Leaders should absent themselves from many of the group meetings to avoid excessively influencing the outcome. *The organization should set up several independent groups, working on the same problem. *All effective alternatives should be examined. *Each member should discuss the group's ideas with trusted people outside of the group. *The group should invite outside experts into meetings. Group members should be allowed to discuss with and question the outside experts. *At least one group member should be assigned the role of Devil's advocate. This should be a different person for each meeting. The Devil's advocate in a group may provide questions and insight that contradict the majority group in order to avoid groupthink decisions (Aamodt, M. G. (2016). Group behavior, terms, and conflict. Industrial/organizational psychology: An applied approach (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Cengage Learning.). A study by Hartwig Hartwig, R. (2007). Facilitating problem solving: A case study using the devil’s advocacy technique. Conference Papers - National Communication Association, 1. insists that the devil's advocacy technique is very useful for group problem-solving. It allows for conflict to be used in a way that is most-effective for finding the best solution so that members will not have to go back and find a different solution if the first one fails. Hartwig also suggests that the devil's advocacy technique be incorporated with other group decision-making models such as the functional theory to find and evaluate alternative solutions. The main idea of the Devil's advocacy technique is that somewhat structured conflict can be facilitated to not only reduce groupthink, but to also solve problems. A similar term to groupthink is the Abilene paradox, another phenomenon that is detrimental when working in groups. When organizations fall into the Abilene paradox, they take actions in contradiction to what their perceived goals may be and therefore defeat the very purposes they are trying to achieve. Failure to communicate desires or beliefs can cause the Abilene paradox. As explained in the Abilene paradox, the Watergate scandal is an example of this. Before the scandal had occurred, a meeting took place where they discussed the issue. One of Nixon's campaign aides was unsure if he should speak up and give his input. If he would have disagreed with the group's decision, it could be a possibility that the scandal would have been avoided. Other examples of how groupthink could be avoided or prevented: After the Bay of Pigs invasion fiasco, President John F. Kennedy sought to avoid groupthink during the Cuban Missile Crisis using \\"vigilant appraisal\\". During meetings, he invited outside experts to share their viewpoints, and allowed group members to question them carefully. He also encouraged group members to discuss possible solutions with trusted members within their separate departments, and he even divided the group up into various sub-groups, to partially break the group cohesion. Kennedy was deliberately absent from the meetings, so as to avoid pressing his own opinion. Cass Sunstein reports that introverts can sometimes be silent in meetings with extroverts; he recommends explicitly asking for each person's opinion, either during the meeting or afterwards in one-on-one sessions. Sunstein points to studies showing groups with a high level of internal socialization and happy talk are more prone to bad investment decisions due to groupthink, compared with groups of investors who are relative strangers and more willing to be argumentative. To avoid group polarization, where discussion with like-minded people drives an outcome further to an extreme than any of the individuals favored before the discussion, he recommends creating heterogeneous groups which contain people with different points of view. Sunstein also points out that people arguing a side they do not sincerely believe (in the role of Devil's advocate) tend to be much less effective than a sincere argument. This can be accomplished by dissenting individuals, or a group like a Red Team that is expected to pursue an alternative strategy or goal \\"for real\\".  Empirical findings and meta- analysis  Testing groupthink in a laboratory is difficult because synthetic settings remove groups from real social situations, which ultimately changes the variables conducive or inhibitive to groupthink. Because of its subjective nature, researchers have struggled to measure groupthink as a complete phenomenon, instead frequently opting to measure its particular factors. These factors range from causal to effectual and focus on group and situational aspects. Park (1990) found that \\"only 16 empirical studies have been published on groupthink\\", and concluded that they \\"resulted in only partial support of his [Janis's] hypotheses\\". Park concludes, \\"despite Janis' claim that group cohesiveness is the major necessary antecedent factor, no research has shown a significant main effect of cohesiveness on groupthink.\\" Park also concludes that research on the interaction between group cohesiveness and leadership style does not support Janis' claim that cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink symptoms. Park presents a summary of the results of the studies analyzed. According to Park, a study by Huseman and Drive (1979) indicates groupthink occurs in both small and large decision- making groups within businesses. This results partly from group isolation within the business. Manz and Sims (1982) conducted a study showing that autonomous work groups are susceptible to groupthink symptoms in the same manner as decisions making groups within businesses. Fodor and Smith (1982) produced a study revealing that group leaders with high power motivation create atmospheres more susceptible to groupthink.Fodor, Eugene M.; Smith, Terry, Jan 1982, The power motive as an influence on group decision making, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 42(1), 178–185. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.42.1.178 Leaders with high power motivation possess characteristics similar to leaders with a \\"closed\\" leadership style—an unwillingness to respect dissenting opinion. The same study indicates that level of group cohesiveness is insignificant in predicting groupthink occurrence. Park summarizes a study performed by Callaway, Marriott, and Esser (1985) in which groups with highly dominant members \\"made higher quality decisions, exhibited lowered state of anxiety, took more time to reach a decision, and made more statements of disagreement/agreement\\".Callaway, Michael R.; Marriott, Richard G.; Esser, James K., Oct 1985, Effects of dominance on group decision making: Toward a stress-reduction explanation of groupthink, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 49(4), 949–952. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.49.4.949 Overall, groups with highly dominant members expressed characteristics inhibitory to groupthink. If highly dominant members are considered equivalent to leaders with high power motivation, the results of Callaway, Marriott, and Esser contradict the results of Fodor and Smith. A study by Leana (1985) indicates the interaction between level of group cohesion and leadership style is completely insignificant in predicting groupthink.Carrie, R. Leana (1985). A partial test of Janis' Groupthink Model: Effects of group cohesiveness and leader behavior on defective decision making, \\"Journal of Management\\", vol. 11(1), 5–18. doi: 10.1177/014920638501100102 This finding refutes Janis' claim that the factors of cohesion and leadership style interact to produce groupthink. Park summarizes a study by McCauley (1989) in which structural conditions of the group were found to predict groupthink while situational conditions did not. The structural conditions included group insulation, group homogeneity, and promotional leadership. The situational conditions included group cohesion. These findings refute Janis' claim about group cohesiveness predicting groupthink. Overall, studies on groupthink have largely focused on the factors (antecedents) that predict groupthink. Groupthink occurrence is often measured by number of ideas/solutions generated within a group, but there is no uniform, concrete standard by which researchers can objectively conclude groupthink occurs. The studies of groupthink and groupthink antecedents reveal a mixed body of results. Some studies indicate group cohesion and leadership style to be powerfully predictive of groupthink, while other studies indicate the insignificance of these factors. Group homogeneity and group insulation are generally supported as factors predictive of groupthink.  Case studies  Politics and military = Groupthink can have a strong hold on political decisions and military operations, which may result in enormous wastage of human and material resources. Highly qualified and experienced politicians and military commanders sometimes make very poor decisions when in a suboptimal group setting. Scholars such as Janis and Raven attribute political and military fiascoes, such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate scandal, to the effect of groupthink. More recently, Dina Badie argued that groupthink was largely responsible for the shift in the U.S. administration's view on Saddam Hussein that eventually led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After the September 11 attacks, \\"stress, promotional leadership, and intergroup conflict\\" were all factors that gave rise to the occurrence of groupthink. Political case studies of groupthink serve to illustrate the impact that the occurrence of groupthink can have in today's political scene.  Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis  The United States Bay of Pigs Invasion of April 1961 was the primary case study that Janis used to formulate his theory of groupthink. The invasion plan was initiated by the Eisenhower administration, but when the Kennedy administration took over, it \\"uncritically accepted\\" the plan of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). When some people, such as Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Senator J. William Fulbright, attempted to present their objections to the plan, the Kennedy team as a whole ignored these objections and kept believing in the morality of their plan. Eventually Schlesinger minimized his own doubts, performing self-censorship. The Kennedy team stereotyped Fidel Castro and the Cubans by failing to question the CIA about its many false assumptions, including the ineffectiveness of Castro's air force, the weakness of Castro's army, and the inability of Castro to quell internal uprisings. Janis argued the fiasco that ensued could have been prevented if the Kennedy administration had followed the methods to preventing groupthink adopted during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which took place just one year later in October 1962. In the latter crisis, essentially the same political leaders were involved in decision-making, but this time they learned from their previous mistake of seriously under-rating their opponents.  Pearl Harbor  The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, is a prime example of groupthink. A number of factors such as shared illusions and rationalizations contributed to the lack of precaution taken by U.S. Navy officers based in Hawaii. The United States had intercepted Japanese messages and they discovered that Japan was arming itself for an offensive attack somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Washington took action by warning officers stationed at Pearl Harbor, but their warning was not taken seriously. They assumed that the Empire of Japan was taking measures in the event that their embassies and consulates in enemy territories were usurped. The U.S. Navy and Army in Pearl Harbor also shared rationalizations about why an attack was unlikely. Some of them included: * \\"The Japanese would never dare attempt a full-scale surprise assault against Hawaii because they would realize that it would precipitate an all-out war, which the United States would surely win.\\" * \\"The Pacific Fleet concentrated at Pearl Harbor was a major deterrent against air or naval attack.\\" * \\"Even if the Japanese were foolhardy to send their carriers to attack us [the United States], we could certainly detect and destroy them in plenty of time.\\" * \\"No warships anchored in the shallow water of Pearl Harbor could ever be sunk by torpedo bombs launched from enemy aircraft.\\"  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster  NASA is a United States government agency responsible for scientific and technological exploration in aeronautics and space. On January 28, 1986, the US launched the Space Shuttle Challenger. This was to be monumental for NASA, as a high school teacher was among the crew and was to be the first American civilian in space. NASA's engineering and launch teams rely on group work, and in order to launch the shuttle the team members must affirm each system is functioning nominally. The Thiokol engineers who designed and built the Challenger's rocket boosters warned that the temperature for the day of the launch could result in total failure of the vehicles and deaths of the crew. The launch resulted in disaster and grounded space shuttle flights for nearly three years. The Challenger case was subject to a more quantitatively oriented test of Janis's groupthink model performed by Esser and Lindoerfer, who found clear signs of positive antecedents to groupthink in the critical decisions concerning the launch of the shuttle. The day of the launch was rushed for publicity reasons. NASA wanted to captivate and hold the attention of America. Having civilian teacher Christa McAuliffe on board to broadcast a live lesson, and the possible mention by president Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address, were opportunities NASA deemed critical to increasing interest in its potential civilian space flight program. The schedule NASA set out to meet was, however, self-imposed. It seemed incredible to many that an organization with a perceived history of successful management would have locked itself into a schedule it had no chance to meet.  2016 United States presidential election  In the weeks and months preceding the 2016 United States presidential election, there was near-unanimity among news media outlets and polling organizations that Hillary Clinton's election was extremely likely. For example, on November 7, the day before the election, The New York Times opined that Clinton then had \\"a consistent and clear advantage in states worth at least 270 electoral votes\\". The Times estimated the probability of a Clinton win at 84%. Also on November 7, Reuters estimated the probability of Clinton defeating Donald Trump in the election at 90%, and The Huffington Post put Clinton's odds of winning at 98.2% based on \\"9.8 million simulations\\". The disconnect between the election results and the pre-election estimates, both from news media outlets and from pollsters, may have been due to three factors: failure of imagination, in that few news and polling professionals could accept the idea of such an unconventional candidate as Trump becoming president; polling error, in that a significant number of Trump supporters contacted by pollsters may have lied to or misled the pollsters out of fear of social ostracism,Wilcox, Clifton (2010). Groupthink : an impediment to success. Xlibris Corp., Bloomington, IN. or those that were willing to express support for Trump were under-sampled by surveys; and that polls and electoral simulations would likely have been unable to account for the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. = Corporate world = In the corporate world, ineffective and suboptimal group decision-making can negatively affect the health of a company and cause a considerable amount of monetary loss.  Swissair  Aaron Hermann and Hussain Rammal illustrate the detrimental role of groupthink in the collapse of Swissair, a Swiss airline company that was thought to be so financially stable that it earned the title the \\"Flying Bank\\". The authors argue that, among other factors, Swissair carried two symptoms of groupthink: the belief that the group is invulnerable and the belief in the morality of the group. In addition, before the fiasco, the size of the company board was reduced, subsequently eliminating industrial expertise. This may have further increased the likelihood of groupthink. With the board members lacking expertise in the field and having somewhat similar background, norms, and values, the pressure to conform may have become more prominent. This phenomenon is called group homogeneity, which is an antecedent to groupthink. Together, these conditions may have contributed to the poor decision-making process that eventually led to Swissair's collapse.  Marks & Spencer and British Airways  Another example of groupthink from the corporate world is illustrated in the United Kingdom-based companies Marks & Spencer and British Airways. The negative impact of groupthink took place during the 1990s as both companies released globalization expansion strategies. Researcher Jack Eaton's content analysis of media press releases revealed that all eight symptoms of groupthink were present during this period. The most predominant symptom of groupthink was the illusion of invulnerability as both companies underestimated potential failure due to years of profitability and success during challenging markets. Up until the consequence of groupthink erupted they were considered blue chips and darlings of the London Stock Exchange. During 1998–1999 the price of Marks & Spencer shares fell from 590 to less than 300 and that of British Airways from 740 to 300. Both companies had already featured prominently in the UK press and media for more positive reasons to do with national pride in their undoubted sector-wide performance. = Sports = Recent literature of groupthink attempts to study the application of this concept beyond the framework of business and politics. One particularly relevant and popular arena in which groupthink is rarely studied is sports. The lack of literature in this area prompted Charles Koerber and Christopher Neck to begin a case- study investigation that examined the effect of groupthink on the decision of the Major League Umpires Association (MLUA) to stage a mass resignation in 1999. The decision was a failed attempt to gain a stronger negotiating stance against Major League Baseball. Koerber and Neck suggest that three groupthink symptoms can be found in the decision-making process of the MLUA. First, the umpires overestimated the power that they had over the baseball league and the strength of their group's resolve. The union also exhibited some degree of closed-mindedness with the notion that MLB is the enemy. Lastly, there was the presence of self-censorship; some umpires who disagreed with the decision to resign failed to voice their dissent. These factors, along with other decision-making defects, led to a decision that was suboptimal and ineffective.  Recent developments  Ubiquity model = Researcher Robert Baron (2005) contends that the connection between certain antecedents which Janis believed necessary has not been demonstrated by the current collective body of research on groupthink. He believes that Janis' antecedents for groupthink are incorrect, and argues that not only are they \\"not necessary to provoke the symptoms of groupthink, but that they often will not even amplify such symptoms\\". As an alternative to Janis' model, Baron proposed a ubiquity model of groupthink. This model provides a revised set of antecedents for groupthink, including social identification, salient norms, and low self- efficacy.  General group problem-solving (GGPS) model  Aldag and Fuller (1993) argue that the groupthink concept was based on a \\"small and relatively restricted sample\\" that became too broadly generalized. Furthermore, the concept is too rigidly staged and deterministic. Empirical support for it has also not been consistent. The authors compare groupthink model to findings presented by Maslow and Piaget; they argue that, in each case, the model incites great interest and further research that, subsequently, invalidate the original concept. Aldag and Fuller thus suggest a new model called the general group problem-solving (GGPS) model, which integrates new findings from groupthink literature and alters aspects of groupthink itself. The primary difference between the GGPS model and groupthink is that the former is more value neutral and more political. Group think, may be an active psychological study to make \\"group think\\" a society based experiment to expose a relatively biased decision based on statistics for the requirement of warfare population elimination. = Reexamination = Other scholars attempt to assess the merit of groupthink by reexamining case studies that Janis had originally used to buttress his model. Roderick Kramer (1998) believed that, because scholars today have a more sophisticated set of ideas about the general decision-making process and because new and relevant information about the fiascos have surfaced over the years, a reexamination of the case studies is appropriate and necessary. He argues that new evidence does not support Janis' view that groupthink was largely responsible for President Kennedy's and President Johnson's decisions in the Bay of Pigs Invasion and U.S. escalated military involvement in the Vietnam War, respectively. Both presidents sought the advice of experts outside of their political groups more than Janis suggested. Kramer also argues that the presidents were the final decision-makers of the fiascos; while determining which course of action to take, they relied more heavily on their own construals of the situations than on any group-consenting decision presented to them. Kramer concludes that Janis' explanation of the two military issues is flawed and that groupthink has much less influence on group decision-making than is popularly believed to be. Groupthink, while it is thought to be avoided, does have some positive effects. A case study by Choi and Kim Choi, J. N., & Kim, M. U. (1999). The organization application of groupthink and its limitations in organizations. Journal of Applied Psychology, 84(2), 297-306. shows that with group identity, group performance has a negative correlation with defective decision making. This study also showed that the relationship between groupthink and defective decision making was insignificant. These findings mean that in the right circumstances, groupthink does not always have negative outcomes. It also questions the original theory of groupthink. = Reformulation = Whyte (1998) suggests that collective efficacy plays a large role in groupthink because it causes groups to become less vigilant and to favor risks, two particular factors that characterize groups affected by groupthink. McCauley recasts aspects of groupthink's preconditions by arguing that the level of attractiveness of group members is the most prominent factor in causing poor decision-making. The results of Turner's and Pratkanis' (1991) study on social identity maintenance perspective and groupthink conclude that groupthink can be viewed as a \\"collective effort directed at warding off potentially negative views of the group\\". Together, the contributions of these scholars have brought about new understandings of groupthink that help reformulate Janis' original model. = Sociocognitive theory= According to a new theory many of the basic characteristics of groupthink – e.g., strong cohesion, indulgent atmosphere, and exclusive ethos – are the result of a special kind of mnemonic encoding (Tsoukalas, 2007). Members of tightly knit groups have a tendency to represent significant aspects of their community as episodic memories and this has a predictable influence on their group behavior and collective ideology.

He meets child psychologist Diana Lawson (Janet Eilber) in a car accident, however, who not only doesn't swoon at his attention but has also never heard of him. He tries to win her affection but complicating things is that his ex-lover, Nicky Nides (Patti Hansen), remains a member of his band.

Life and career Skeggs was born in Middlesbrough, a post-industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North Yorkshire. She studied an undergraduate degree in Sociology at the University of York (BA) and went on to study further at Keele University where she obtained a PGCE and PhD. = Career History = She has worked at Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education (Research Fellow), Worcester College of Higher Education (Sociology), University of York (Education and Women's Studies). From 1996 to 1999 she was Director of Women's Studies at Lancaster University (with Celia Lury). In 1999 she was appointed to a Chair in Sociology at the University of Manchester, where she was Head of Department from 2001 – 2004. Since 2004 she has been Professor of Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London, as Head of Department from 2010-2013. During 2007 she was the Kerstin Hesselgren Professor in Gender Studies at Stockholm University. In 2003, she was elected as an Academician of the Academy of the Learned Societies for the Social Sciences. Professor Skeggs was an honorary professor at the University of Warwick, and has received honorary doctorates from Stockholm University, Aalborg University and the University of Teesside (her home town). In June 2019 she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Joensuu, Eastern Finland. She was the joint managing editor of the journal The Sociological Review from 2011-2016, now as European 'editor at large'. From 2013-2016 she held an ESRC Professorial Fellowship to study a 'sociology of values and value'. In September 2017 she became the Academic Director of the Atlantic Fellows programme at the London School of Economics and moved to take up a \\"Distinguished Professor\\" post at Lancaster University in May 2019. Key Studies Formations of Class and Gender: Becoming Respectable (1997) = Beverley Skeggs is the author of the influential study Formations of Class and Gender: Becoming Respectable (1997), a longitudinal ethnography of subjectivity across the lives of women as they move from 'caring courses' to work and family, into sexuality and how they negotiate living class in the UK. Formations was translated into Swedish as: Att Bli Respektabel(2000) Stockholm: Diadalos. Translated into French as Des Femmes Respectables; Class et Genre en Milieu Populaire (2015) (translated by Marie- Pierre Pouly, Preface by Anne-Marie Devereux. The understandings of class in Formations were developed in Class, Self, Culture (2004), which critiques the idea of the self and explores the different ways class circulates as a form of value as it attaches to different bodies. Examining the production of values across a range of different sites, such as the IMF, popular culture and academic theory, it puts to the test sociological theories which suggest that class is in decline. Class, Self, Culture was translated into Finnish (2013) as Elava Luokka (Making and Living sukupuolityylit Class) by Anu Hanna Antilla, Lauri Lahikainen and Mikko Jakonen Helsinki: Vastapaino Press. Skeggs' understanding of how the self is classed is developed through engagement with the works of Pierre Bourdieu. In Feminism After Bourdieu, co- edited with Lisa Adkins, feminists address Bourdieu's ideas on reflexivity, emotional capital, the self and the social and their relation to gender. Skeggs explores affect and the self alongside an introduction to Bourdieu. Her methodological approach was first elaborated in Feminist Cultural Theory: Production and Process (1995), an edited collection that brings together feminists from across disciplines (literature, film, design, media, law, sociology) to discuss how they went about producing their classic texts in cultural studies. In 1998 at Lancaster University, a group of feminists (of which Beverley Skeggs was a part) organised an international conference on feminist theory. The resulting book Transformations: Thinking Through Feminism (edited with Sara Ahmed, Celia Lury, Jane Kilby and Maureen McNeil) includes chapters by Lauren Berlant, Gayatri Spivak, Donna Haraway, Elspeth Probyn and Vikki Bell. The conference also spawned Routledge's 'Transformations' series, which includes a wide range of volumes on feminist theory, including the works of Kirsten Campbell, Breda Grey, Ann Cronin and Steph Lawler. A large scale government funded ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council) research project with Professor Leslie Moran, Paul Tyrer and Karen Corteen examined the sustainability and experience of gay space, resulting in the book Sexuality and the Politics of Violence and Safety. The book explores how violence can be used as a resource in political claims-making. It also brings together innovative multi-methods, including a census space survey and citizen's inquiries, alongside traditional intervies and focus groups. The idea of gender and sexuality as resources that can be deployed, fixed or attached is developed in the article 'Uneasy Alignments, Resourcing Respectable Subjectivity'. Numerous publications were generated from the sexuality project. = Making Class and Self through Televised Ethical Scenarios 2005 - 2008 = Another large ESRC research project was conducted by Skeggs (with Helen Wood, Leicester University and Nancy Thumin, Leeds University) between 2005–2008 on the making of a moral economy through reality TV, Making Class and Self through Televised Ethical Scenarios. This project brings together many of the threads already apparent in Professor Skeggs' research, including the making of the exchange-value self, the emphasis that is placed on performing and telling one's self as a source of value and the class and race based challenges that are made through the construction of an alternative moral value system. This research project was part of a much larger research programme, 'Identities,' an ESRC £7million investigation into identity construction in contemporary Britain. Professor Skeggs delivered one of the inaugural lectures for the programme.,. New Formations of Spectacular Selves A significant methodological contribution was made by this project, which by using a multi-method approach that combined textual analysis with audience research developed the 'affective textual encounter' for studying audience responses. This method showed how class, gender and race relations are made in the research encounter when women authorise their own speech through recourse to cultural resources such as 'taste' and maternal authority (this is developed in their article on method in the 2008 European Journal of Cultural Studies and the ESRC research report). The research participant's authorisation of particular moral economies was closely related to their positions in circuits of value, positions which cut through, disturb and constitute gender, race and class. It has been published as 'Reacting to Reality TV; Audience, Performance and Value'(with Helen Wood). The research also led to an international edited collection on 'Reality Television and Class' (also with Helen Wood) published by BFI/Palgrave. Numerous articles have been published on this project. Her most recent work consolidates the prior analysis of the relationship between value and values, leading to the development of ideas about the moral economy of person production. She developed the idea of 'person value' following a critique of Bourdieu and an exploration of how ideology is produced through 'value struggles'. = Values and Value 2013 - 2017 = In September 2013, Skeggs began an ESRC Professorial Fellowship on 'A Sociology of Values and Value'. You can hear her discuss her introductory framework for the British Journal of Sociology annual lecture. The ESRC Values and Value project began as a study of what happens when economic value is accumulated from spheres previously considered non-economic such as social network platforms and prosperity theology. For instance, Facebook makes considerable economic gain from commodifying friendship through the algorithmic conversion of 'likes' into advertising sales. Does this process reconfigure the value/s of friendship? What happens to values such as loyalty and care in this conversion? Do friends capitalise upon their own value? Using software designed by Dr Simon Yuill, this research installed a plug in on volunteers’ browsers to collect all data over six months. It found that Facebook constantly tracks people whether they are on the Facebook platform or not. Digital friendliness is conducted through rhythms of interaction driven by algorithms. These algorithms artificially stimulate the intensity of exchange with ‘people of influence\\", that is you are more likely to be connected to those on your newsfeed who have power and influence than those who have none. However, with prosperity theology research, conducted through ethnography, the project found that prosperity theology doesn’t just connect people into the faith of money but also provides a social service for marginalized communities. Research papers include: The methodology of a multi- model project examining how Facebook infrastructures social relations.The methodology of a multi-model project examining how Facebook infrastructures social relations (2015) Information, Communication and Society.

In this project software is used alongside quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the digital production of new forms of inequality.

The final symposium of the conference is available on the Sociological Review website. Further Contributions In 2016, (with Mike Savage, Sociology, LSE) Beverley Skeggs established The Sociological Review Foundation as a charity and community organisation to support interdisciplinary social science activities, especially support for ECR's: see. The charity operates alongside the UK's oldest sociological journal. Skeggs has been debating issues of class throughout her career. She edited a special issue on \\"Sociologies of Class: Elites (GBCS) and Critiques\\" (2015) with an introduction on \\"Stratification or exploitation, domination, dispossession and devaluation? This developed from her critique of the GBCS on BBC Radio 4's \\"Thinking Allowed\\". And her response to Mike Savage's inaugural lecture at the LSE on \\"The Old New Politics of Class\\". At the International Sociological Association conference in 2015 she responded to Michael Burawoy in a debate about Gramsci and Bourdieu, \\"Roots of domination\\" =Public interventions= Skeggs can be heard reflecting on the analysis of her 'Formations of Class and Gender; Becoming Respectable'book. An interview about the reality television research can be heard on BBC Radio 4 Thinking Allowed. Julie Burchill interviewed Beverley Skeggs for the Sky TV programmes, 'Chavs' (2005); and 'Girl Power' (2007) (see YouTube). She has also appeared in contributions to popular debates, such as the 1998 Channel 4 TV programme on 'Things to Come', exploring (with a comic twist) the future role of women.http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/programmes/analysis/transcripts/04_12_03.txt The BBC's Thinking Allowed radio programme covered her work in 2003, 2008 and where she has also discussed 'class and Christmas', 'cruel optimism', 'moral economies' and 'everyday life' (with Les Back in 2016. She was a judge for the BSA/BBC Radio 4 ethnography prize in 2015. 'A Guide to the Modern Snob', BBC Radio 4 (2016) features Beverley Skeggs, as does 'Objects of Desire', BBC Radio 4 (2016), where Matthew Sweet explores how the things people accumulate say more than expected about who they are.

Norms are implicit, specific rules, shared by a group of individuals, that guide their interactions with others. People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt social pressure. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone. People often conform from a desire for security within a group—typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as groupthink: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of social rejection. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and youth culture, but strongly affects humans of all ages. Although peer pressure may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad. Driving on the correct side of the road could be seen as beneficial conformity. With the right environmental influence, conforming, in early childhood years, allows one to learn and thus, adopt the appropriate behaviours necessary to interact and develop correctly within one's society. Conformity influences formation and maintenance of social norms, and helps societies function smoothly and predictably via the self-elimination of behaviors seen as contrary to unwritten rules. In this sense it can be perceived as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous. As conformity is a group phenomenon, factors such as group size, unanimity, cohesion, status, prior commitment and public opinion help determine the level of conformity an individual displays.  Peer  Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity. This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence. It follows a U-shaped age pattern wherein conformity increases through childhood, peaking at sixth and ninth grades and then declines. Adolescents often follow the logic that if everyone is doing it, then it must be good and right. However, it is found that they are more likely to conform if peer pressure involves neutral activities such as those in sports, entertainment, and prosocial behaviors rather than anti-social behaviors. Researchers have found that peer conformity is strongest for individuals who reported strong identification with their friends or groups, making them more likely to adopt beliefs and behaviors accepted in such circle.Graupensperger, S., Benson, A. J., & Evans, M. B. (2018) Everyone else is doing it: The association between social identity and susceptibility to peer influence in NCAA athletes. Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 20, 1-11. doi: 10.1123/jsep.2017-0339  Social responses  According to Donelson Forsyth, after submitting to group pressures, individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity. These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement. When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing compliance or acquiescence. In turn, conversion, otherwise known as private acceptance, involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority. Another type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called convergence. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand. [Chapter 7] In addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display independence. Independence, or dissent, can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying anticonformity or counterconformity which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion. To conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the Asch situation or Asch conformity experiments, primarily includes compliance and independence. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.  Main experiments  Sherif's experiment (1936) = Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the autokinetic effect. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it. Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people. Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group. = Asch's experiment (1951) = Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the Asch conformity experiments, people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was wrong. Solomon E. Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials. The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial. On average people conformed one third of the time. A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious. After his first test, Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects. \\"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important – the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question. In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to 15 persons.\\" The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject, the subject became more likely to conform. However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.  Varieties  Harvard psychologist Herbert Kelman identified three major types of conformity. * Compliance is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected. * Identification is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source, and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance. * Internalization is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time. Although Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in social psychology has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are informational conformity, or informational social influence, and normative conformity, also called normative social influence. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human psychology and conformity; the notion of \\"varieties\\" of conformity based upon \\"social influence\\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context. For Deutsch and Gérard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence. = Informational influence = Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to experts for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in internalization or private acceptance, where a person genuinely believes that the information is right. = Normative influence = Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans. In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group. Normative influence usually results in public compliance, doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection. See: Normative influence vs. referent informational influence In a reinterpretation of the original data from these experiments Hodges and Geyer (2006) found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views. By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research. Deutsch & Gérard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one Normative influence, a function of social impact theory, has three components. The number of people in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's strength is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. Immediacy is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy. Baron and his colleagues conducted a second eyewitness study that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval. An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of friends as compared to six-person groups of strangers. Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations. Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse, however, generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other.  Minority influence  Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups, individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them. This is known as minority influence, a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing the majority's beliefs and behaviors. Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed. Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \\"bad apple\\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.  Specific predictors  Culture = Stanley Milgram found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture). Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task. Bond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm. Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time. Influenced by the writings of late-19th- and early-20th-century Western travelers, scholars or diplomats who visited Japan, such as Basil Hall Chamberlain, George Trumbull Ladd and Percival Lowell, as well as by Ruth Benedict's influential book The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, many scholars of Japanese studies speculated that there would be a higher propensity to conform in Japanese culture than in American culture. However, this view was not formed on the basis of empirical evidence collected in a systematic way, but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of cognitive biases. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor Yohtaro Takano from the University of Tokyo, along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.Takano, Y., & Osaka, E. (1999). An unsupported common view: Comparing Japan and the US on individualism/collectivism. Asian Journal of Social Psychology, 2(3), 311-341. The study published in 1970 by Robert Frager from the University of California, Santa Cruz found that the percentage of conformity errors within the Asch paradigm was significantly lower in Japan than in the United States, especially in the prize condition. Another study published in 2008, which compared the level of conformity among Japanese in-groups (peers from the same college clubs) with that found among Americans found no substantial difference in the level of conformity manifested by the two nations, even in the case of in-groups.Takano, Y., & Sogon, S. (2008). Are Japanese more collectivistic than Americans? Examining conformity in in-groups and the reference-group effect. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 39(3), 237-250. = Gender = Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence. For example, Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of 148 studies of influenceability. They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance. Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society. Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent. The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well. In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments. Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias. They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones (sports, cars..) more than female ones (cooking, fashion..), women are feeling uncertain and conformed more, which was confirmed by their results. = Age = Research has noted age differences in conformity. For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age. Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages 18 to 91. The results revealed a similar trend – older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants. In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals. Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity. Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age (under 19 years vs. 19 years and older), gender and surveillance (anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs. not anticipating responses being shared) on conformity to group opinions. They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles. Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals. = Size of the group = Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number. Moreover, a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating. This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong, conformity will be motivated by normative influence; the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group. A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response. = Different stimuli = In 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France. He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity. = Neural correlates = Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity, an area associated with memory and decision-making. For example, Klucharev et al. revealed in their study that by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the pMFC, participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group, suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity. Neuroscience has also shown how people quickly develop similar values for things. Opinions of others immediately change the brain's reward response in the ventral striatum to receiving or losing the object in question, in proportion to how susceptible the person is to social influence. Having similar opinions to others can also generate a reward response. The amygdala and hippocampus have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory. Several other areas have further been suggested to play a role in conformity, including the insula, the temporoparietal junction, the ventral striatum, and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. More recent work stresses the role of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in conformity not only at the time of social influence, but also later on, when participants are given an opportunity to conform by selecting an action. In particular, Charpentier et al. found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point, when a decision is being made without the social influence being present. The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC, with a greater grey matter volume in high conformers.

Demographics As of India's 2001 census, Sampagaon (Bailhongal) had a population of 8936 with 4515 males and 4421 females. History The town has an interesting history, Hiremallasetty and Chikkamallasetty were two brave warriors from Adil Shahi kingdom. Adil Shah was pleased with the valour, bravery and honesty of the two brothers and granted them Sardeshmukhi of 6 villages, namely Rayara Hubbali, Sampagaon, Itagi, Hunasikatti, Kadaravalli and HIrebagewadi. On getting the prestigious Sardeshmukhi, they migrated from Shahapur in Gulbarga district in 1585 and settled down at Sampagaon and established their traditional business. They persuaded their kith and kin to come along and settle with them. In due course of time, they cleared the Hongal forest and made it habitable, thereby giving a new name Bailahongala (which means cleared forest). The Kittur kingdom was founded in 1585 by the blessings of Swamiji of Kallumath monastery. Sampagaon / Bailahongala became the capital of the kingdom. Before Kittur town had its present name, it was called Gijaganagudu (nest of bottle birds). Since the capital was shifted from Sampagaon to the present place, it was called Kittur i.e. a shifted city. Kittur kingdom were the Desai's of Adil Shahi Dynasty of Bijapur. The town used to be the taluka headquarters in place of Bailhongal. The current day town looks to a dry place, although it was once considered to be very beautiful place with lakes and beautiful surroundings. This was a preferred place under the rule of Adil Shahis. If you look into the region this is the only place in the surrounding to have monuments of Adil Shahi, which goes on to prove their presence in the region for sheer love of the place and surroundings. In fact the water reservoir was mostly demanded by the locals, as per the folklore the area from the mosque to the current lake in the village was a well maintained garden till recent past.

Shoe-throwing is the act of using footwear as a projectile as part of a number of folk sports and practices. Shoe-throwing is often associated with tossing a pair of shoes with the laces tied together onto raised wires such as telephone wires and power lines, as well as trees. Shoe throwing occurs throughout North America, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, in both rural and urban areas. Often, the shoes are sneakers; other times, they are leather shoes and boots. Many cultural variations exist; differences abound between socioeconomic areas and age groups. Purpose Several theories have been put forth to explain the phenomenon. One posits that it's a form of bullying: a bully steals a pair of shoes and tosses them where they are unlikely to be retrieved. Another views shoe tossing as a practical joke played on drunks, who wake up to find their shoes missing. More ominously, a 2003 newsletter from former Los Angeles, California mayor James Hahn cited fears of many L.A. residents that \\"these shoes indicate sites at which drugs are sold or worse yet, gang turf,\\" and that city and utility employees had launched a program to remove the shoes. A 2015 study of shoe-tossing data in Chicago found that the rumor and relationship between dangling shoes and drug dealing was correlational, not causal. In some cultures, shoes are flung as part of a rite of passage, for example, to commemorate the end of a school year, or a forthcoming marriage. Some theories suggest the custom originated with members of the military, who are said to have thrown military boots, often painted orange or some other conspicuous color, at overhead wires as a part of a rite of passage after completing basic training or when leaving the service.Adams Cecil (August 2, 1996). Why do you see pairs of shoes hanging by the laces from power lines? The Straight Dope. In the 1997 film Wag the Dog, shoe tossing is an allegedly spontaneous tribute to Sgt. William Schumann, played by Woody Harrelson, who has purportedly been shot down behind enemy lines in Albania. =Shoe-throwing as a wedding custom= Shoe-throwing at weddings has been observed in several cultures. In Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield (1850), the custom is recorded by the narrator following his marriage to Dora Spenlow: In 1887, an article in The New York Times observed that: \\"[The] custom of throwing one or more old shoes after the bride and groom either when they go to church to be married or when they start on their wedding journey, is so old that the memory of man stretches not back to its beginning.\\" Peter Ditchfield, writing in Old English Customs Extant at the Present Time (1896), expands: \\"We also throw old shoes after young married folk in order to express our wishes for their good fortune. Probably this was not the original meaning of the custom. The throwing of a shoe after a bride was a symbol of renunciation of dominion and authority over her by her father or guardian, and this receipt of the shoe by the bridegroom was an omen that the authority was transferred to him. In Kent the shoe is thrown by the principal bridesmaid, and the others run after it. It is supposed that she who gets it will be married first. It is then thrown amongst the men, and he who is hit will be first wedded.\\" =Shoe-throwing as a form of protest= In many Arab cultures, throwing a shoe at someone is considered an insult. In 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntadar al-Zaidi was arrested for throwing two shoes at United States President George W. Bush, in protest against the American military invasion and subsequent occupation, while the president was visiting Baghdad. Al-Zaidi shouted in Arabic: \\"This is from the widows, the orphans and those killed in Iraq!\\" President Bush ducked and was not struck by the shoes. Shoe throwing as an insult is not limited to the Arab world; other notable incidents have involved other celebrities and world leaders, including Steve McCarthy, David Beckham, Lily Allen, and Wen Jiabao. =Shoe-throwing as a competitive sport= Wellie wanging, or boot throwing, is a sport in which competitors are required to throw a Wellington boot as far as possible. The sport appears to have originated in the West Country of England in the 1970s, and rapidly became a popular activity at village fêtes and fundraising events across Britain. The sport is now played in many different countries, including Australia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Russia. =Shoe-throwing as a display= A shoe tree, not to be confused with the shoe-preservation device of the same name, is a tree (or, occasionally, a powerline pole or other wooden object) that has been festooned with old shoes.Shoe Trees. Roadside America. Shoe trees are generally located alongside major local thoroughfares, and they may have a theme (such as high-heeled shoes).

Located on the banks of the Krishna river, also called Uttaravahini - which flows northwards at Savadi, most of the population here is largely dependent on agriculture for its sustenance. Animals domesticated are buffaloes, goats, dogs, horse, bullocks, sheep and fowl. Historically being a belt of Jowar cultivation, with the recent irrigation projects near the village, from the past two decades, the chief crop has been sugarcane. Savadi is closely located to many sugar industries of the Krishna basin, and is part of the major supplier belt of sugarcane in Athani Taluk, and consequently Belgaum district. History Savadi is one of those place in South India, that traces back its history to the Neolithic age. Earliest painted pottery has been found in the tract between Savadi and Satti. In the Krishna basin, wheel-turned grey and red- wares are found, but only in small numbers. The painted pottery was painted in black, and in some cases thin white colour was used. The painted motifs included a variety of designs and animals like fish, stork, dog, peacock, deer, etc. Designs were also engraved in relievo. Unwritten lore says that Savadi was the hermitage of a sage named Saudagnya, who performed his penance here; hence the name. The village mosque stands tall and strong from the era of the Adil Shahi of Bijapur. The Gopalakrishna temple, that lies close to the river bank, is an ancient temple built in the (Kalyana)Chalukyan style of architecture. The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Gopalakrishna also known as Venugopal. It is a typical Trikuteshwar style temple housing two magnificent Shiva Lingas. More relics of the same temple can be found embedded in the steps of the ghats connecting to the riverbank to the village. Minor temples on the ghat and the Uttareshwara temple that lies in the river bed and becomes visible only in the dry summers, are also vital clues to the history of the region. Robbery and restoration of the Gopalakrishna idol In the year 2000, some anti social elements dug at the base of the Shiva Lingas and stole the Gopalakrishna idol. Later on, the stolen idol was discovered near Shiraguppi village(on the other side of the river). The idol has since been placed in the Vithoba temple of the village for worship. Subsequently, though some Government officials have visited this long neglected ancient temple, including those from the archaeological department, no concrete measures have been taken to restore this monument of historic and cultural importance. The entire surrounding of the magnificent temple is covered by uncontrolled growth of trees and dirt. However, Shri. Sharad Savadi whose forefathers were the Archaks of the temple is doing whatever is possible within his means for the upkeep and maintenance of this temple and for the day today Pooja of Gopalkrishna idol.

The annual fairs of the Sanganabasaweshwar Mutt, the Alab celebrated by Muslims, the week-long mud and milk festival of Lord Hanuman are all part and partial of Savadi's culture. The folk songs sung on these occasions are some of the rarest folklore of this region, and have consistently lacked government's attention. The annual fair in Darga, a neighbouring hamlet, consisting of about 50 houses, commemorating the death anniversary of a sufi saint, is by far the most happening event of the year for the locals. The Dasara celebration where there is a generous exchange of sweets, and wishing of good luck among every villager deserves special mention. The chief language spoken is Kannada. With no good schools in Savadi, the kids travel to nearby places for their schooling. Being located remotely, Savadi lacks banks and basic healthcare facilities. Every Thursday is the village bazaar.
