K. Jemisin. It is the first in her Great Cities series. It was developed from her short story \\"The City Born Great\\". It is her first novel since her triple Hugo Award-winning Broken Earth series.  Setting  The City We Became takes place in New York City, in a version of the world in which great cities become sentient through human avatars.  Plot  After the avatar of New York falls into a supernatural coma and vanishes, a group of five new avatars representing the five boroughs come together to fight their common Enemy.  Characters  The avatars = * New York: a queer Black homeless young man. An artist, hustler, and the avatar of New York City. * Manny: a queer, multiracial man in his late 20s. When he becomes Manhattan's avatar, he loses most memory of his former life, representing his role as a new New Yorker. He is a somewhat ruthless strategist. He can allow non-avatar New Yorkers to see the Enemy if he needs to use them. *Brooklyn \\"MC Free\\" Thomason: a Black, middle-aged former rapper, lawyer, and current city councilwoman. She has a child and a sick father. Her power is rooted in music. * Bronca Siwanoy: a queer Lenape woman in her 60s. She has a PhD, a hot temper, a son, and works at the Bronx art center. She is the oldest of the six avatars and thus the holder of the city's lexicon of knowledge. * Padmini Prakash: a 25 year-old Tamil immigrant graduate student living in Queens. Her first name means \\"she who sits on the lotus\\". She can use mathematic imagination to change physical reality. * Aislyn Houlihan: a 30 year-old white woman with brown-hair who lives with her parents on Staten Island. Her father is an abusive, racist cop who calls her 'apple,' though her name means 'dream'. She can become invisible. = Other characters = * São Paulo: the avatar of the city he is named for. He is brown-skinned, lean, and a smoker. His cigarette smoke can combat the Enemy. * Hong Kong: the avatar of the city he is named for. He has a Chinese-inflected British accent. * The Enemy: an infectious, otherworldly life form that wants to kill the newly-born city of New York. It appears in many forms, including the Woman in White, Dr. White, contagious fungal fronds, and x-shaped spider- like creatures. The Enemy is revealed to be R'lyeh, the fictional lost city from H. P. Lovecraft's work. * Madison: a white woman who drives an antique Checker cab. She helps Manny defeat an outbreak on FDR Drive. * Bel Nguyen: A British transgender man and Manny's new roommate. * Josephine Thomason: Brooklyn's 14 year-old daughter. * Yijing: an Asian woman who works with Bronca at the Bronx Art Center. * Veneza: a young Black and Portuguese woman who works with Bronca at the Bronx Art Center. * Jess: a Jewish woman who works with Bronca at the Bronx Art Center. * Alt-Artistes: racist artist collective. * Aishwarya Auntie: Padmini's older relative, with whose family she lives. * Kendra Houlihan: Aislyn's mother. A talented pianist who had won a full-ride to Juilliard, but had to give it up when she became pregnant and married Aislyn's father. * Matthew Houlihan: Aislyn's father, a racist cop. * Connell McGinnis: a young neo-Nazi that Aislyn's father tries to set her up with. He has rectangular black glasses, a waxed and curled mustache, and many racist tattoos.  Reception  The New York Times' review stated, \\"In the face of current events, 'The City We Became' takes a broad-shouldered stand on the side of sanctuary, family and love. It’s a joyful shout, a reclamation and a call to arms.\\" NPR wrote that it is, \\"a love letter, a celebration and an expression of hope and belief that a city and its people can and will stand up to darkness, will stand up to fear, and will, when called to, stand up for each other.\\" A review in Slate said, \\"The city she sings fizzes so joyously through the veins of this novel that anyone mourning the New York before COVID-19 will likely find The City We Became equally sustaining and elegiac, a tribute to a city that may never fully return to us.\\"  References  Category:2020 science fiction novels Category:2020 American novels Category:2020 fantasy novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:Literature by women Category:Literature by African-American women Category:Science fantasy Category:American science fiction novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Afrofuturist novels Category:Novels set in New York City Category:New York City in fiction Category:Novels about racism Category:Feminist literature Category:Allegory Category:Personifications Category:Political literature Category:Womanist literature Category:Womanist novels Category:LGBT speculative fiction novels Category:2020s LGBT novels ","title":"The City We Became"},{"id":"64057157","text":"Tchórzew may refer to one of the following locations in Poland: *Tchórzew, Lublin Voivodeship *Tchórzew, Masovian Voivodeship *Tchórzew-Plewki *Tchórzew- Kolonia ","title":"Tchórzew (disambiguation)"},{"id":"64057165","text":"The 1995–96 Hellenic Football League season was the 43rd in the history of the Hellenic Football League, a football competition in England.

One of the greatest female tight-rope dancers in the world, she was known for performing en pointe on the tightrope, a rare feat. Early life She was born as Marie Catherine Charlotte Marietta Zanfretta in 1832 in Venice in Italy into a family of tightrope performers and acrobats in northern Italy. The oldest of eleven children, her parents were Jeanne Giovanna née Catania (1814–1875) and Barthélémy Bartholomé Bartholoméo Zanfretta (1809–1893), an acrobat. As a child she had received tightrope, acrobatic and ballet training, performing with her parents and siblings in circuses in Europe including in Franconi's Theatre in Paris. In 1852 she was in the United States where she appeared as a featured rider with E. F. and J. Mabie’s Circus before performing for Den Stone's Circus in 1854.William L. Slout, Olympians of the Sawdust Circle - Circus Historical Society In about 1855 the Zanfettta family were hired as part of the troupe of performers of Antoine Ravel (1812-1872) with whom Marietta Zanfretta also did solo and ensemble dancing. She quickly became popular with audiences because of her beauty, charm and skill on the tightrope on which she performed en pointe in addition to doing pirouettes and somersaults. For the Ravel Troupe the Zanfrettas played 300 performances at Niblo's Garden in New York during 1857–59.Gillian M Rodger, Champagne Charlie and Pretty Jemima: Variety Theater in the Nineteenth Century, University of Illinois Press (2010) - Google Books p. 40 As her father's joints began to stiffen with age, and finding himself unable to perform, he returned to Paris where, because of his physique, he became an artists' model.'Seen and Heard in Many Places' - The Times, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 26 May 1896, Page 4 Performing career After her booking with Ravel ended Zanfretta appeared in variety and theatres where she performed her signature tightrope descent. She toured the United States with the Caron and Ravel troupes which included the trapeze artists François and Auguste Siegrist and appeared at The Boston Theatre in Boston (1858). In that year she had a severe fall from which she soon recovered and resumed performing. With the Zanfretta Troupe she also performed in a number of circuses across the United States including in an equestrian act in which she danced and balanced on the back of a horse as it circled the ring. She also appeared with her brothers, with the clown Alexander Zanfretta (1847-1892) regularly appearing on playbills with her.

They adopted a number of children from the New York Foundling Asylum who they trained to form a juvenile troupe of acrobats. These were: Fanny Siegrist; Blanche Siegrist; William 'Willie' Siegrist; Thomas 'Toto' Siegrist, and Louis Siegrist. During one show it was said that one of the babies replaced the globe traditionally turned by the feet of the acrobat until the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children swooped on the act and the baby was replaced by the globe. The infants were retired from the act until they reached a greater growth. The boys later performed as the 'Three Siegrist Brother', but they were only brothers by adoption.

He is the principle theorist and exponent of the New Conceptualism movement in 21st-century music. Career Johannes Kreidler was born in Esslingen, Germany. He studied composition with Mathias Spahlinger at the Musikhochschule in Freiburg from 2000–2006, and has taught at conservatories in Rostock, Detmold, Hannover and Hamburg. In 2019, he was made Professor for Composition and Music Theatre at the Musikakademie Basel. Kreidler came to prominence with a series of politically charged pieces of musical performance art, beginning with 2008's product placements: a 33-second recording containing 70,200 samples of other recordings, which the composer then attempted to register individually with the German copyright authorities. This action garnered substantial press coverage, as did 2009's Charts Music, in which stock market data from the global financial crisis was turned into music using Microsoft's Songsmith software. Later in 2009, Kreidler realised the controversial work Fremdarbeit (Outsourcing), in which he ‘outsourced’ his commission from Klangwerkstatt Berlin to a Chinese composer and an Indian computer programmer to write the piece on his behalf, imitating his style, for a fraction of the commission fee. These three compositions came to encapsulate the composer's approach to ‘conceptual music’, as theorised by Kreidler himself and by the philosopher Harry Lehmann in subsequent lectures, essays and publications.Kreidler, Johannes, 'New Conceptualism in Music', lecture given at Darmstadt, 27.7.2012 (accessed 25 May 2020)Lehmann, Harry, 'Conceptual Music and The Gehalt-aesthetic Turn', lecture at Darmstadt, 5.8.2014 Since 2010, the composer's catalogue has included many more ‘conceptual pieces’ — often video works for gallery or online display — in addition to large-scale music theatre works like the seven-hour Audioguide (2014), the opera My State as Friend and Beloved (2018), and Selbstauslöser (Self-Timer, 2020). In October 2012, Kreidler garnered further press attention after protesting the forced merger of the SWR Symphonieorchester with another orchestra (the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra) by tying together and then destroying two of the orchestra's instruments onstage during a live concert. Kreidler's works have been performed at the Donaueschingen and Darmstadt festivals, Ultima Festival Oslo, Musica Strasbourg, Gaudeamus Music Week, and the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, among others. Kreidler currently lives in Berlin. Style Much of Johannes Kreidler's music is characterised by extensive sampling and quotation, and the use of algorithmic processes to generate material. In pieces such as product placements and Der „Weg der Verzweiflung“ (Hegel) ist der chromatische (2012), these techniques are employed as much for the theoretical questions they raise about creativity and authorship as for their usefulness as compositional tools. Kreidler has described this approach in terms of making ‘music with music’. Often his work makes use of a particular digital technology, using the nature and limits of that technology to determine musical parameters. This has included Microsoft's Songsmith software (Charts Music), Microsoft's Kinect 3D Sensor (kinect studies), a MIDI keyboard (5 Programmings of a MIDI Keyboard), a sensor table (Irmat Studies) and a photographic camera (Steady Shot). Kreidler's work usually involves multimedia elements, sometimes in interaction with a live soloist or ensemble. He often appears as a performer in his own work, including in his often humorous video works which are inspired by meme culture. Kreidler's work is often overtly political. At the premiere of his Fremdarbeit, the composer announced, ‘Tonight’s goal is that no one here will ever vote for the FDP again’ (referring to the German Free Democratic Party who are associated with economic liberalism and free-market capitalism).Fremdarbeit documentary (accessed 25 May 2020) Conceptual music Since the early 2010s, Johannes Kreidler has increasingly described his compositional approach as Konzeptmusik or ‘conceptual music’, a direct reference to the conceptual art movement of the 1960s and 1970s. This paradigm of conceptual music is heavily indebted to the work and theory of his teacher Mathias Spahlinger, and to the philosopher Harry Lehmann's notion of the ‘Gehalt-aesthetic Turn’. In his lectures and essays, Kreidler has also described other works in these terms, including those of Cory Arcangel, Peter Ablinger and John Cage. His 2015 piece Minusbolero is a piece of ‘conceptual music’ that attempts a dialogue with another historical piece of ‘conceptual music’: Ravel’s Boléro. Ravel himself said of his piece, ‘I have written only one masterpiece — Boléro. Unfortunately there is no music in it’. In composing Minusbolero, Kreidler simply removed the melody throughout, leaving only the accompaniment. Thus, if the original Bolero contained ‘no music’, Kreidler's Minusbolero contained ‘negative’ music. The validity and significance of Kreidler's theories of conceptual music has been the subject of considerable academic dispute. Max Erwin has identified ‘New Conceptualism’ as a coherent aesthetic orientation for a significant group of composers from at least four continents, including Kreidler, Stefan Prins and Jennifer Walshe. According to Erwin, ‘[New Conceptualism] is arguably the first coherent aesthetic 'school' in New Music of the twenty-first century’. In contrast, while acknowledging that it had ‘gone mainstream’ in 2014, Martin Iddon has called conceptual music ‘a contradiction in terms’ that ‘represents a desire for a (nostalgic) return to conceptual art that, as it were, really meant something’.

Its holotype specimen was discovered in China, and dated back to the Early Cretaceous period (Aptian stage). Further analysis conclude that it was a genus of dsungaripterid pterosaur.  Discovery and naming  In the early 21st century, Chinese paleontologist Ji Shuan found a jaw of a pterosaur near the village of Xinzhao, which is forty kilometers north of Otog Qi, Inner Mongolia. The find was reported in the scientific literature in 2017.Ji SA, Lu LW, Zhang LF, Yuan CX, Jiang S, Chen XY, Hou YD, 2017, \\"Recent progress in the study of the Early Cretaceous dinosaur fauna from the Ordos region, Inner Mongolia\\". Geology in China, 44 (1): 196–197 In 2020, the type and only species Ordosipterus planignathus was named and described by Ji. The generic name combines a reference to the Ordos basin with a Latinized Greek pteron (meaning \\"wing\\"). The specific name is a combination of the Latin planus (meaning \\"flat\\"), and the ancient Greek gnathos (meaning \\"jaw\\"). The holotype, IG V13-011, has been found in a layer of sandstone, belonging to the lower Luohandong Formation, and may be dated back to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous. The holotype consists only of a set of deformed paired lower jaws forming the mandible.  Description  Life restoration of Ordosipterus = Size = The left dentarium of Ordosipterus has been stated to be around long, while the right dentarium is only measured to be . It is very difficult to determine a size estimate for this pterosaur, but the holotype cannot have been from a large individual, judging by its size. Ji stated that the closely related Dsungaripterus was clearly much larger than Ordosipterus. =Distinguishing traits= Ji identified some distinguishing traits that are unique in the Dsungaripteridae. This includes the dentarium of the lower jaw being as wide as the symphysis, and the middle part of the symphysis showing a weak ridge on the bottom. The top of the dentarium also forms a shelf bounded by a clear lateral ridge, which is parallel to the curved exterior. Along the jaw edge of the dentarium, there are low tooth sockets that are widely spaced, the space increasing to the rear. The distance between two adjacent tooth sockets varied from one and a half to three times their diameter. = Skeleton = The dentarium bears at least eight teeth, five of which along the symphysis in a straight line, the rear three in a slightly inward curving row. Most of the tooth sockets are elevated, but much lower than in other dsungaripterids such as Dsungaripterus, and are found to be oval, with the long axis directed along the jaw, and the tooth sockets somewhat bulge upwards, though not extremely. Only the sixth left tooth is preserved in the fossil, and it appears to be short and blunt in comparison to other dsungaripterids. The middle four of the left teeth sockets are larger than the rear two. More precisely, the gap increases to the rear, ranging from 1.54 to 3.13 times the diameter of the anterior tooth. With a length of , the symphisis forms a broad scoop-shaped plate with strongly curved side edges. At the back of the symphysis a short groove forms a notch with a V-shaped cross section. The side gradually merges into the bottom. The ridge on the bottom of the symphysis ends in front of the trailing edge. The branches of the dentaria are low in side view; their top edge and bottom edge are parallel. The dentarium bends slightly upwards from the sixth tooth.  Classification  Ordosipterus was placed in the Dsungaripteridae, although not on the basis of an exact cladistic analysis. The exact place in the evolutionary tree is therefore uncertain, but this genus was thus placed as a dsungaripterid due to the typical swollen tooth sockets seen in many members of that group.  Paleobiology  Many dsungaripterids have often been seen as durophagous species that cracked shellfish with their convex teeth. Ordosipterus shows a moderate bulge in its teeth, but not the extreme outgrowth that would have been useful for cracking. The broad lower jaws suggest a different way of eating, though Ji does not consider this issue.

BackgroundDenmark in the mid-14th century= Prior to the Black Death, Denmark was the smallest of the Nordic countries, but it had the largest population, between 750.000 and one million people. = The Black Death = Since the outbreak of the Black Death at the Crimea, it had reached Sicily by an Italian ship from the Crimea. After having spread across the Italian states, and from Italy to France from France to England, the plague reached Norway by a ship from England in 1349. In parallel, it was migrating North toward Denmark from Germany in the Holy Roman Empire. Plague migration According to traditional legend, the Black Death came to Denmark when a Norwegian plague ship from England stranded on Vendsyssel on Northern Jylland after all of its crew had died. The plague years for Denmark are traditionally attributed as 1348–1349, because the Zealand Chronicle recorded these years as the plague years. Whether the story of the plague ship is accurate is impossible to know, but the dates are not considered probable in modern research. The Zealand Chronicle was written over ten years later and may have gotten the dates wrong, as they are not supported by other contemporary traces of the Black Death. The Chronicle of the Archbishop of Lund as well as the Annales Scanici from Scania both date the year of the Black Death as 1350. In contrast to the Zealand Chronicle they are contemporary, and it is not likely that the Black Death could have arrived to such a small country as Denmark in 1348 and took two years to progress through it. There are no contemporary witness statements from the Black Death in Denmark, but it is possible to trace the plague migration indirectly through donations, wills and occasional death lists, and according to these, the Black Death was present in Ribe on Jylland in July–October 1350, in Roskilde on Zealand in September–October, in Copenhagen in August–September and in Scania in July–December.Janken Myrdal: Digerdöden, pestvågor och ödeläggelse. Ett perspektiv på senmedeltidens Sverige Consequences The death toll is not possible to estimate. It is clear that Denmark experienced a demographic shock that took centuries to recover from. This is clearly visible from material during the years after the plague. =Economic, social and political effects= Bishop Peter of Ribe mentions in a letter from 1352 that the income from agriculture had deteriorated and that this problem was not likely to become any better any time soon. In 1354, the king pardoned an unusually large number of people from the death penalty with reference to the fact that the population had already diminished too much from the plague. In many parts of Denmark, the devastation is clear by deserted farms: in 1400, 34 of 48 farms under the Bröndum estate in Himmerland on Jylland was deserted, and in 1427 the region Hasle near Århus gave but a third of the income from agriculture that it had done prior to the Black Death. Many churches were also abandoned during the same time. The diminishing population caused by the Black Death resulted in the introduction of serfdom in Denmark, the Vornedskab, which was introducted after the Black Death.Fridlev Skrubbeltrang: Det danske Landbosamfund 1500-1800; Den danske historiske Forening 1978; References Category:14th-century health disasters Category:14th century in Denmark Denmark Category:Death in Denmark Category:Health disasters in Denmark Category:1348 in Europe Category:1349 in Europe Category:1350 in Europe ","title":"Black Death in Denmark"},{"id":"64057469","text":"Alessandra Sala is an Italian computer scientist specializing in distributed algorithms for graph theory, social network analysis, and data privacy.

He made the Roma district renowned throughout Queensland for the excellence of its grapes and its wines. As at 2020, his Romavilla Winery continues to operate and is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.  Early life  Bassett was born at Pencorse, Summercourt, in the county of Cornwall, south of England, on 13 March 1840. He was sixteen years of age when, after a voyage of several months in a sailing ship, he arrived at Sydney, and joined his uncle, J. Christian, a large pastoral proprietor in New South Wales, on his property on the Hunter River.  Roma  In 1860 he came to Euthulla pastoral station, near Roma, in charge of a mob of travelling sheep, and remained in charge of this station for six years. Romavilla Winery, circa 1910 He commenced vinegrowing at Roma, the first consignment of cuttings being landed at Roma by bullock wagon from Toowoomba, the journey taking about two months, laying the foundation of the Romavilla Winery, the largest vineyard and wine-making establishment in Queensland in his lifetime. In the 1870s Bassett also entered into business in Roma as a general storekeeper with Mr. Skinner, and he also acquired a considerable interest withRobert Douglas in the well-known pastoral property, Mount Maria, in the Morven district. Relinquishing his interests in both of these ventures, Mr. Bassett had devoted the whole of his energy and attention to his vineyard. For many years he was a large and regular exhibitor of wines at the Brisbane Exhibition, and winning many prizes. Bassett's wines held the premier place in the Queensland against all competitors, and won for their maker a very large number of valuable medals, some of which were secured at international exhibitions in Europe. In this way he laid the foundation of viticulture in this district, which, being taken up by others as time went on, found a source of employment for a large number of men and families. Year by year the Romavilla vineyards were extended, the capacity of the cellars increased, and the sale of the wines pushed further and further throughout Queensland. Bassett was never idle, and his industry infected everyone about him. Bassett built a comfortable home, which became one of the principal attractions in the district, and where he and his wife were known for their generous hospitality. Bassett took a great interest in the progress of the district to which be had contributed so largely in such a practical way, and had an unwavering faith in its future.  Later life  Ill-health forced him to relinquish the active management of his winery, and, accompanied by his wife, he sought to recuperate by taking a trip to the Pacific Islands, Tasmania, the North Coast, and other places. After a brief visit to Toowoomba, he returned to his home at Roma and died two months later on the afternoon of Christmas Day, 25 December 1912. He was survived by his wife and their six sons and three daughters, Messrs. Robert, Frank, Samuel, William, Lionel, and Kenneth Bassett, and Mrs. J. C. Carlile (Cairns), Mrs. Hector Care (Roma), and Mrs. K. W. Nagel (Cairns). The funeral took place on Thursday 26 December, the interment being preceded by a short service at St. Paul's Anglican Church, and both that service and that at the graveside, at which the Reverend Dawson officiated, were attended by many residents of the town and district.

Life and career Hunter was born on July 2, 1921, to a family with deep roots in the Ozarks. He grew up in Springfield, Missouri, attending Baptist and Methodist church services and singing with his family. He married Virginia Mercer in 1939 and started working for her father as a refrigerator salesman. In 1952, he began working for the John Rhodes Refrigeration Supply Company, traveling on a 150-mile circuit through the Ozarks. During his travels, he began using a tape recorder to record songs from people he met. At the Ozark Folk Festival circa 1956, he met folklorists Vance Randolph and Mary Celestia Parker, who saw his potential as a collector and shared some basic archiving skills. Over his career, he recorded hundreds of singers, including Almeda Riddle, Ollie Gilbert, Fred High, May Kennedy McCord, Raymond Sanders, Jimmy \\"Driftwood\\" Morris, and others who were active in the American folk music revival movement. He sometimes went to great lengths to convince others to let him record them, such as by helping them out with chores, which at one point included delivering moonshine. He also recorded by some estimates more than 14 hours of jokes and 1,100 proverbs. Hunter was the last of the major Ozark ballad collectors, and defied the conventional wisdom of archivists at the time, who thought that such oral traditions had already been fully documented. His archival philosophy was to make absolutely no changes to the songs he collected, even to correct obvious errors. In 1972, he gave his audio tapes to the Springfield-Greene County Library, ignoring the advice of friends who urged him to give them to an academic institution where he worried the songs would get buried. From 1998 to 2001, the archive was digitized by Missouri State University. Many of his recordings are now on file at the Library of Congress and other institutions. Although he quit smoking later in his life, he died of emphysema on November 6, 1999, at the age of 78. See also *Francis James Child *Maud Karpeles *Alan Lomax *John A.

This period of Haitian history commenced with the fall of the Kingdom of Haiti in the north and the reunification of Haiti in 1820 under Jean-Pierre Boyer. This period also encompassed Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo from 1822 to 1844 creating a unified political entity on the island of Hispaniola. Although termed a republic, this period of was dominated by Boyer's authoritarian rule as president-for-life until 1843. The first Republic of Haiti ended in 1849 when president Faustin Soulouque declared himself emperor, thus beginning the Second Empire of Haiti. Background After the assassination of the Emperor Dessalines in 1806, the First Empire of Haiti collapsed and was divided in two between former generals of Dessalines. Initially, Henri Christophe was elected president with limited powers. After Christophe attempted to exert greater power, he ran up against the newly established Senate under Alexandre Pétion who defended the capital of Port-au- Prince. Christophe consolidated power in Cap-Haitien, in the north, and established the State of Haiti before declaring himself president-for-life in 1807. In the south, the Senate elected Pétion as President of the first Republic of Haiti. The two Haitis entered a stalemate between the State of Haiti in the north and the Republic of Haiti in the south. In 1811, the State of Haiti became the Kingdom of Haiti when Christophe declared himself King of Haiti. Pétion, through control of the Senate, declared himself president-for- life of the Republic of Haiti in 1816. On March 29, 1818, Pétion died and the title of president-for life passed to the commander of his guard, Jean-Pierre Boyer, won the gained support of the Senate. In the northern Kingdom of Haiti, Christophe suffered a severe stroke August 15, 1820 that left him partially paralyzed. Within weeks, dissent was cultivating in the Kingdom and Boyer used the opportunity to begin a march north with the Republic of Haiti's army. Abandoned by his guard and expecting the inevitable insurrection, on October 7, 1820, Christophe killed himself by gunshot. Boyer arrived in Cap-Haitien on October 20, 1820, and formally united the two Haitis into the Republic of Haiti without any further hostilities. History For the first 16 months after the reunification of Haiti, the Republic of Haiti controlled only the western portion of Hispaniola. =Unification of Hispaniola= In the eastern part of Hispaniola, José Núñez de Cáceres declared the independence of the colony as the Republic of Spanish Haiti on December 1, 1821, and applied for admission to the Republic of Gran Colombia. Nine weeks later, Haitian forces led by Jean-Pierre Boyer entered the newly-declared state and occupied Santo Domingo on February 9, 1822. The military occupation of Santo Domingo would last 22 years, until the fall of Boyer. =Reign of Boyer= Boyer (right) and Baron Mackau (left) negotiating the Franco-Haitian Treaty of 1825. After the annexation of Spanish Haiti, Boyer took full powers with the title of “Supreme Chief of the Nation” with the right to choose his successor. In the two decades that had followed the Haitian Revolution and the expulsion of the French colonial government in 1804, Haiti's independence had not been recognized by the world powers. In 1825, King Charles X of France decreed that his nation was to be compensated 150 million gold francs payable in five years in exchange for recognition of Haitian independence. Under threat of invasion, Boyer agreed and by 1826 Haiti was recognized by almost all world powers with the exception of the United States of America. In order to keep up with the payments to France, Boyer had to implement a special tax and negotiate a loan of 30 million to a French bank with an interest rate of 6%, while asking for a reduction of the debt. Charles X also demanded a 50% reduction in customs duties for products exported to France. The debt was reduced to 600 million payable in thirty years, in February 1838. During Boyer's reign, Haiti's economy shifted from primarily sugarcane to coffee exports. Portrait of Jean- Pierre Boyer. Boyer and his ministers, Jérôme-Maximilien Borgella and Jonathas Granville, were deeply involved in the mass migration of black Americans to Haiti. Loring D. Dewey of the American Colonization Society (ACS) had been an advocate of former slave migration from the United States to Haiti, as opposed to the more common ACS strategy of repatriating black Americans to Liberia. From September 1824, nearly 6,000 Americans, mainly free people of color, emigrated to Haiti in the space of a year. Due to the island's poverty and the Boyer administration's inability to help support new immigrants in transition, most black Americans returned to the United States after a short period of time. =Fall of Boyer= Boyer's authoritarian measures eventually lead to a loss of popular support in and in 1842 an insurgency arose in Praslin, not far from Les Cayes, headed by General Charles Rivière-Hérard. Boyer attempted to quell the revolt, but with a loss of support and no chance of victory, Boyer abdicated in 1843 and went into exile in Jamaica. =Return to Republic= Charles Rivière-Hérard would declare him self president-for life but his reign would only last until May 1844. In the month's following Boyer's departure, Santo Domingo took advantage of the chaotic political situation by expelling the Haitian military from the eastern portion of Hispaniola in 1844 during the Dominican War of Independence. During the final five years of the Republic of Haiti, the country would be limited again to the western portion of the island and no longer control the Spanish (now Dominican) side of the island. Following Rivière-Hérard, there would be four more presidents of the Republic of Haiti until Faustin Soulouque was elected president-for-life in 1847. =End of the Republic= On August 25, 1849, Soulouque was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti and the first Republic of Haiti was dissolved. At his coronation ceremony on April 18, 1852, Soulouque become Emperor Faustin I. The Emperor created a new class nobility to surround himself with and began a period of Haitian history known as the Second Haitian Empire.

He is better known for his effort towards decongesting several prisons, now known as correctional facilities, in Nigeria. During the earlier part of his career, Bello was, for official reasons, off and on the bench. In November 1984, he left private practice to become a state counsel at the Kaduna State Ministry of Justice and it took him until the following year to become a magistrate. He then left the bench after serving as a magistrate for two years. He was temporarily transferred and appointed as the Head of Legal Recovery department at the then Universal Bank of Nigeria plc between 1987 and 1989. In 1993, he joined the Board of River Basin Authority in Minna, Niger State, as a secretary and legal adviser. His stint as legal adviser to the board ended in 1995 and after this, Bello's stint as a federal attorney began following his appointment as a deputy chief registrar of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.  Early life  Ishaq Usman Bello was born in Zaria, Kaduna State, in 1956. He spent his earliest years at the St Bartholomew Primary Wusasa in Zaria in 1965 before moving to L.E.A Primary School T/Jukun Zaria, where he obtained his first school leaving certificate in 1972. After obtaining his certificate, he left for Katsina State, where he earned his West Africa School Certificate (WASC) in 1976. He then returned to Zaria following his admission into the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), where he graduated with an LLB (Hons) in 1982. He was called to bar in 1983. Bello holds a PhD (LLD Honoris Causa) from the Caribbean University.  Career  Ishaq Usman Bello began his legal practice at a private law firm, Umaru Yabo & co, in Sokoto State. After a year, he was appointed as a state counsel at the Kaduna State Ministry of Justice. Then he went on to become a state magistrate, a position he held between 1985 and 1987. Following his first temporary transfer which happened between 1987 and 1989, Bello returned to the bench in 1990 to serve as acting chief magistrate and then later as chief magistrate in 1992, after which he went on another temporary transfer to join the Board of River Basin Authority in Minna, Niger State, as a secretary and legal adviser. = High court judge (1997 – 2014) = Bello began his journey as a federal attorney in 1995 following his appointment as a deputy chief registrar of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. He served for another two years before he was then appointed as a judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in 1997. During this period, Bello presided over several high-profile cases, including the State vs Francis Okoye and Others following an assassination attempt on the life of the late Dora Akunyili, the then director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). He also presided over the “Apo Six” case starting from 2005. The case, which was called Nigeria's “most infamous case of extrajudicial killing” by the BBC, cost six young civilians their lives. In 2017, Judge Bello convicted two police officers over their involvement in the murder of two out of the six civilians. \\"The two defendants have no regard for the sanctity of human lives,\\" Judge Bello was quoted by AFP news agency as telling the court. \\"They are not only over-zealous but also extremely reckless.\\" = Acting Chief Judge of the FCT (2015 – 2015) = On the 31st of March, 2015, Bello was sworn in as the Acting Chief Judge of the FCT following the retirement of the former FCT chief judge, Justice Ibrahim Bukar. While conducting the swearing-in ceremony, the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Mahmud Mohammed challenged him to uphold the tenets of the court and make sure justice was properly administered to everyone, no matter their standing in the society. Justice Ishaq Bello's appointment as the substantive Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory was confirmed on the 28th of May, 2015. = Chief Judge of the FCT (2015 – present) = As the Chief Judge of the FCT, Bello paid attention to the de-congestion of prisons in Abuja. He started visiting prisons within his jurisdiction, releasing over forty awaiting trial prisoners in the process. By the end of October 2017, he was appointed as the chairman of the Presidential Committee on Prison Reforms and De-congestion, now Presidential Committee on Correctional Service Reforms and De-congestion, by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. The committee's responsibility was to lead the reform processes of the Nigerian prison system. Since the inauguration of the committee, over 3768 inmates have been released from 36 correctional facilities nationwide.  Influences  Bello created enforcement procedure rules for the Child Right Act in 2015. The provisions set out implementation guidelines for cases involving children, making court proceedings more humane and sensitive to the needs of children. He was also the head of the committee that came up with the Administration of Criminal Justice (ACJ) act, which has now been recommended for adoption by all states in Nigeria.  Accomplishment  Ishaq Bello was made Life Bencher by the Nigerian Body of Benchers in 2019.

The book is a compilation of various annals recording the acts of the kings of Israel and Judah by a Deuteronomic compiler in the seventh century BCE, with a supplement added in the sixth century BCE. This chapter records the events during the reigns of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, as well as of Joash, and his son, Jeroboam (II) in the kingdom of Israel. The narrative is a part of a major section 2 Kings 9:1–15:12 covering the period of Jehu's dynasty. Text This chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language. It is divided into 29 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Analysis This chapter as a whole (as many other parts of 1–2 Kings) functions as a ‘parable and allegory’, and in particular includes a ‘proverb’ given by Jehoash king of Israel to Amaziah king of Judah (). Some examples of the parabolic or allegoric style are provided in form of the ‘history repeating itself’. During the time of Rehoboam the son of Solomon, after the division of the kingdom of Israel (), Shisak the king of Egypt plundered the temple in Jerusalem () and this event has a similar pattern in this chapter when Jehoash the king of Israel plundered the temple and broke down a large portion of the walls of the city of Jerusalem (). Another parallel commences at the end of the chapter when another Jeroboam started to reign in Israel and the subsequent chapters reveal a ‘providential chronological and historical symmetry’ with the first Jeroboam. While Jeroboam I initiated the separation of the united kingdom to form the northern kingdom of Israel, Jeroboam II started the countdown to the end of this northern kingdom. There is an indication that the kingdoms were reunited briefly under Jehu's dynasty is supported by some details in Jeroboam II's reign: the Israel king extended the borders of his kingdom from Hamath in the north to the Sea of the Arabah in the south, far into the territory of the kingdom of Judah (), which ‘echoes the ideal boundaries of the original united kingdom’ (). can also be translated as “he recovered Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel” as if Jeroboam II recovered the territory of Judah back to “the kingdom of Israel”, forming a (semi)united kingdom. Amaziah, king of Judah (14:1–22) The historical records of Amaziah the king of Judah might be taken exclusively from the Judean annals. He took revenge for his father's murder (verse 5, cf. ; verses 6–7 are an educated scribe's addition according to , cf. also Ezekiel 18) only to fall victim to murder himself (verses 19–20). Amaziah also defeated the Edomites in the Arabah (\\"Valley of Salt\\", verse 7, cf. , also verse 22), highlighting a struggle between Edom and Judah at the time (cf. ; ). However, the most detail is about the war with Israel which Amaziah initiated but ultimately lost (verses 8–14). Amaziah outlived Joash by at least fifteen years, but his violent death in the reign of Jeroboam II, the son of Joash, (verses 15–16) probably still related back to the events of his defeat. Amaziah's successor, Azariah (later, Uzziah), was chosen by 'the people of Judah' (verse 21), probably meaning 'the people of the land', who had an 'increasingly influential role in Judean politics' since the end of Athaliah's reign. Azariah () managed to consolidate his father's conquest of Edom by claiming the port of Elath for Judah (cf. ). =Verse 1= :In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, became king MEV *\\"In the 2nd year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz\\": According to Thiele's chronology, following \\"accession year method\\", Amaziah the son of Joash of Judah became the 9th king of Judah starting between April and September 796 BCE, because the 2nd year Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, started in April 796 BCE. *\\"Jehoahaz\\": written in Hebrew as ‘’Joahaz’’ which is an alternate form of Jehoahaz.Note [a] on 2 Kings 14:1 in NET Bible *\\"Joash, king of Judah\\": (cf. ), a different person from Joash of Israel, the son of Jehoahaz, mentioned earlier in the verse.Note [b] on 2 Kings 14:1 in NET Bible =War between Israel and Judah= Historical records show that Adad-nirari III of Assyria claims a successful westward campaign in 806 BCE, defeating, among others, 'Omri-Land' (the name Assyrian uses for Israel) and also Edom (ANET 281-2). This might encourage Amaziah to wage wars against Edom and Israel. He was successful to defeat Edom, but he miscalculated the strength of Israel. Joash the king of Israel, had warned Amaziah, using a parable: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?\\"; 'Joash' is a variation of 'Jehoash'. The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Vol III, 1992. Freedman, David Noel., ed., New York: Doubleday. pp. 857-858 However, Amaziah insisted on the war. Joash's army defeated Amaziah's at Beth- shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, then plundered Judah's palace and the temple, also broke down 200 meters of the 'particularly sensitive northern wall of Jerusalem', leaving the city defenseless. Jeroboam (II), king of Israel (13:23-29) Jeroboam's reign outshines that of Joash, his father, as the northern kingdom enjoys a glorious period, when Aram-Damascus was ensnared between Israel and Assyria (cf. verse 28), that apparently allowed Jeroboam to control the territories northwards to Hamath on the Orontes, and also to the east and south as far as the Dead Sea (verse 25). This implies a hegemony over Judah, or at least the Jordan valley and the regions east of the Jordan, Gilead and Gad. The Book of Amos provides highlights to Israel's momentary political success: 'they were proud of the land they gained (), the higher classes at least enjoyed the incoming wealth (), the people believed they were God's favorites ()', although Amos prophesied that this period of happiness would be short. The prophet Jonah ben Amittai was active in Israel at the time and had forecast Jeroboam's successes, so this can be seen as God's will, like other previous political events, 'according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of...'

Despite the name saying that the whole route is a Parkway, the road is actually hybrid in character: The road (mostly on the northern section) is like an expressway as it has a mix of interchanges and not so many traffic light-controlled intersections, but like a parkway (hence the name) as the most of the northern section has landscaped design, the road is also like a boulevard (mostly on the southern section) as there is direct access to many of the adjacent properties and places such as, the Forsyth County Medical Center, Hanes Mall, Forsyth Tech, and Marketplace Mall. One section of the road is a short freeway. Route description The road starts at the Main Street intersection as a boulevard. The road then passes the I-40 interchange which only gives access eastbound. NC 150 (which is routed onto Peters Creek Parkway) then meets with Silas Creek Parkway at an at-grade intersection where NC 67 is now on the road. This intersection gives access to I-40 westbound. Bolton Street then intersects the road at a folded diamond interchange. The road then heads to the Hanes Mall & Forsyth Medical Center area before heading at another folded diamond interchange with US 158 (Stratford Road). The road then downgrades to a freeway, passing the US 421 (Salem Parkway) cloverleaf interchange. The road then shortly downgrades back to a boulevard passing the Country Club Road folded diamond interchange. The road then passes the Nottingham Road grade-separated interchange (via Sherwood Forest Road). The road then meets Robinhood Road at an interchange. The road then passes the Reynolda Road and Polo Road grade-separation via (Wake Forest Road which gives access to Reynolda Road and Wake Forest University, Sunnynoll Road which gives access to Polo Road, and Fairlawn Drive which gives access to Reynolda Road) where NC 67 leaves the road and is now routed onto Reynolda Road and where the road becomes an expressway. The road ends at the North Point Boulevard/Bethabara Road which is near the Bethabara Historic District. HistoryBeginnings= On October 5, 1959, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (known as the State Highway Commission at the time) approved spending $500,000 to build a beltway on the outskirts of Winston-Salem. It would run between the what was then the new Forsyth Memorial Hospital and the Western Electric Company plant at Reynolda Road. The name of the project was Silas Creek Parkway. The parkway would be ushering in suburban development on the western side of the city and pushing the city's borders west. The parkway opened on November 4, 1961. By 1963, the parkway was being widened to four lanes all along its route. In 1968, the Bolton Street interchange was built. =New Expressway extension= In 1985, The Polo Road-Reynolda Road Area Plan, prepared by the City-County Planning Board was adopted by the city-County Planning Board and the Winston-Salem Board of Winston-Salem Board of Aldermen following a public hearing. There was an endorsement of the proposed full extension of the Silas Creek Parkway adopted from the 1983 study, with a 1991/1993 implementation date. The extension was to bypass Wake Forest University It was also planned to build a new interchange with Reynolda Road on the extension. The extension was completed in 1991. The extension had an expressway grade with new bridges and a new interchange with Reynolda Road like planned. The old northern terminus became another interchange to Reynolda Road. The new northern terminus was at the at-grade intersection with North Point Boulevard and Bethabara Road near Historic Bethabara. In 1994, NC 67 was rerouted onto Silas Creek Parkway between the Reynolda Road interchange and the Peters Creek Parkway intersection.

It was built in 1830–32 by Peter Mowry, a physician, and was originally part of a large estate that was subdivided into residential lots in 1872. The house is notable as a rare example of relatively well preserved Greek Revival architecture in Pittsburgh, and exemplifies the typical pattern of development in Lawrenceville in the mid to late 19th century. In 2020, the building was nominated as a Pittsburgh historic landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh, which stated that the mansion \\"is one of the last remaining and most significantly preserved regional ribbon farm dwellings from its period of construction.\\" History The house was built in 1830–32 by Dr. Peter Mowry (1770–1833), one of Pittsburgh's most prominent physicians during the first third of the 19th century. Like other nearby properties, Mowry's estate was a \\"ribbon farm\\", a long, narrow strip with a short section of riverfront allowing each farm access to the Allegheny. Mowry died shortly after the house was completed, but his widow Eliza Addison Mowry lived there until her own death in 1871. She sold the riverfront section of the estate for industrial development by the Lucy Furnace Company and Keystone Bridge Company. After her death, the property was sold to a partnership called Carnegie & Co., which divided it into about 244 residential lots and offered them for sale starting in 1872. The neighboring ribbon farms between 52nd and 55th Streets were similarly subdivided around the same time. The Carnegie & Co. lots were gradually filled in with rowhouses between the 1870s and early 1900s. Most of the other old houses in the area were demolished during this period as they did not fit conveniently into the new plats, but the Mowry- Addison mansion remained standing on a five-lot parcel. From 1921 to 1973, the mansion housed the Slovenian Eagle Society, a mutual aid organization for Slovene Americans. The Slovenian Eagle Society's ownership of the mansion comprised the longest period of ownership, exceeding the Mowry ownership by ten years. After this, it housed the Pittsburgh Electric Club until 2004, when it was purchased by Carnegie Commons LLC for use as architectural offices. Architecture The Mowry-Addison Mansion is a 2 1/2 story vernacular Greek Revival style house with a side-gabled roof. It is constructed from American bond brick set on a raised stone foundation. The front elevation is symmetrical and five bays wide, with a three-bay porch. Most of the windows are 6-over-6 wooden sash windows with stone sills and lintels. The lintels are ornamented with rosettes; other decoration includes dentil cornices and a porch frieze. The lower portion of the porch is a different type of brick and was a later addition. The rear elevation is also five bays wide with a partially enclosed porch. Although other structures in the Greek Revival style can be found throughout Pittsburgh (such as the Burke Building Downtown and various residential structures on the North Side), these structures are far more modest in scale compared to the Mowry-Addison Mansion.

Pir Mansûr was a descendant of Prophet Mohammed and settled in the area from Hakkâri (around Sinjar Mountains) in 1049. The descendants of Pir Mansûr would rule Eğil for nearly eight centuries. During the rule of Emir Muhammed, the principality had expanded southward to Karaca Dağ, Palu and Elazığ northward, Çermik to the west and the area between Hani and Lice to the east. History During the reign of the Marwanids, Kurds from the Humeydiye, Beşneviye and Zuzaniye tribes settled in Eğil changing the composition of the area to the detriment of the Armenian-speaking Greek-speaking and Syriac-speaking population. It was during this period that Pir Mansûr settled in the town of Dicle which was populated by Kurds of the Mirdesan tribe. Pir Mansûr ultimately became their leader due to their admiration of him. Pir Mansûr would also become a murshid, a status his son and successor retained. It was during the next two rulers – Pir Musa, son of Pir Mansûr and his grandson Pir Bedir, that the Principality of Eğil was established. This is attributed to the support received from various tribes including the Mirdesan and their leadership on Sufism. However the rule of Pir Bedir was short since he got killed during the Seljuk siege of the territory in 1087. He was succeeded by his son Emir Bulduk who was birthed after the death of Pir Bedir in exile. The mother of Bulduk died after giving birth and he was raised by the Mirdesan tribe. By the time the Emir of Eğil was Ibrahim the Mirdesan abandoned the title \\"Pir\\" for \\"Emir\\". After the death of Emir Ibrahim, the principality was shared between his three sons. The principality and Aq Qoyunlu had friendly relations. The principality was subsequently captured by the Safavids, which then lost it to Selim I. The Ottomans allowed the locals of the principality to govern themselves and would not interfere and it was exempted from the timar system. However, when the Ottomans began losing land on the Balkan peninsula, it started recruiting men from Eğil ultimately ending its special status. In 1864, all of its privileges were abolished and the emirate dissolved. Lala Kasim Tomb built in 1566.

He served as president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1942 to 1945, and was president of the Dominion Curling Association (DCA) from 1965 to 1966. He was the first person to be elected to more than two terms as CAHA president, and the first to be president of two national amateur sporting associations in Canada. Sargent served as a Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association executive for 27 years, including two terms as its president. He served on the CAHA committee to negotiate professional-amateur agreements with the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1938 to 1955, and helped negotiate recognition each organization's authority over the game, payments from professional clubs to amateur clubs for developing hockey players, and common usage of the ice hockey rules. He sought for enforcement of rules to ensure fast, clean play without injuries, and disliked the increasing physical style of the game. His time as president of the CAHA coincided with World War II, and he supported the purchase of Victory bonds to assist the war effort, and facilitated the supply of players to fill NHL rosters lacking numbers due to military service. Under his leadership, junior ice hockey profits from the Memorial Cup were reinvested into the development of minor ice hockey in Canada; but senior ice hockey struggled with the loss of Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force teams, which led to his decision to cancel national playoffs for the Allan Cup in 1945. Sargent served multiple terms as president of the Port Arthur Curling Club, and led its effort to affiliate with the Manitoba Curling Association. He later assisted in founding the Northwestern Ontario Curling Association, became its inaugural president in 1947, and sought for recognition as its own branch within the DCA to compete for The Brier national championship. He played second on the rink that won the 1953 Northern Ontario Men's Provincial Curling Championship, and placed third at the 1953 Brier championship. As a member of the DCA executive, he assisted in establishing both the Canadian Mixed Curling Championship and the Canadian Senior Curling Championships in 1964. He was an original member of the senior championship committee, and believed the event would attract former Brier competitors and give seniors place to compete which had not existed. Sargent's career in sports was recognized with the Canadian Centennial Medal in 1967, and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. He also received awards, citations and life memberships from multiple sporting and service organizations; including life membership of the CAHA in 1946 and life membership of the DCA in 1967. When hockey and curling established a Hall of Fame for their respective sport, he was named to the selection committees to choose the inaugural group of inductees for each sport. He was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1974, and inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1982. Early life alt=Shops in downtown Fergus Frank Forest Sargent was born on July 6, 1902, in Fergus, Ontario. His father Lewis was a livery yard keeper, and his mother was Matilda Sargent (née Alexander). He grew up in a family of three children, with a sister Ruby and a brother Arthur. Sargent began curling in Fergus at age 12 with his father. He participated in his first bonspiel at age 14 in Hamilton. He also played lacrosse in Fergus as a youth, and played junior ice hockey for Guelph in the Ontario Hockey Association. Sargent played senior lacrosse in Orangeville, and won two Ontario titles, and one national title. He later played lacrosse in Hamilton, and was roommates with future professional hockey players Hap Day and Carson Cooper. While playing for Hamilton, Sargent body checked against Lionel Conacher who then fell across Sargent's legs. Sargent spent four weeks in the hospital recovering from the injury which shortened his career for contact sports. He later lived in Renfrew, Ontario, then moved to Port Arthur in 1923, and played one season of intermediate level senior ice hockey. Business career alt=Building exterior In 1923, Sargent began working for Thompson and Sargent, a funeral home co-founded by his father Lewis Sargent. Sargent apprenticed in Winnipeg with Clarke-Leatherdale, then graduated from the Canadian School of Embalming with honours in 1926, to become a funeral director. Lewis Sargent bought out his partner, then Frank Sargent assumed management of the family's funeral home business when it was renamed Sargent and Son. He became a member of the Ontario Funeral Service Association and the Northwestern Ontario Funeral Service Association, then took over the family business upon his father's death in 1946. Hockey careerEarly involvement= Sargent led a group of five investors in 1928, who sought a junior hockey team based in Port Arthur to compete for the Memorial Cup. The Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association (TBAHA) feared that the plan to group the best players on one team would weaken the local junior league and did not approve the endeavour. Sargent was subsequently elected to the TBAHA executive in 1929, and served continuously until 1955. He was vice-president of the TBAHA from 1935 to 1936, and president from 1936 to 1938. He oversaw the Thunder Bay District Senior Hockey League which had four teams in Canada, and also played games against teams from Minnesota. He coordinated Allan Cup playoffs for the Canadian teams. He gave approval for the Kenora Thistles to continue playing as a senior team under the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association umbrella instead of the TBAHA, since they had done so as a junior team. =CAHA second vice- president= Sargent was scheduled to attend the 1940 Winter Olympics hosted in alt=Aerial view of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany Sargent was elected second vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) on April 18, 1938. He became a member of the CAHA rules committee. He also served on the CAHA committee to negotiate professional-amateur agreements with the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1938 to 1955, along with W. G. Hardy and George Dudley. In August 1938, the CAHA and the NHL reached a new working agreement. Stipulations included the recognition each other's suspensions, use of the same playing rules, the NHL would not sign players without CAHA consent during the season, and the CAHA would deny international transfers to amateurs who were on reserve lists for NHL teams. Sargent accompanied the Port Arthur Bearcats to the 1939 Allan Cup championship, which they won versus the Montreal Royals in four games. Sargent was re-elected second vice-president on April 12, 1939. The Port Arthur Bearcats were chosen to represent the Canada men's national ice hockey team at the 1940 Winter Olympics, and Sargent was placed in charge of the upcoming tour of Europe and was expected to travel with the team. The CAHA approved C$5,000 towards travel expenses overseen by Sargent, and the team would receive any profits from exhibition games played while in Europe. The Bearcats requested a guarantee from the CAHA against financial loss, and Sargent expected a meeting to decide on the travel demands. The 1940 Winter Olympics were ultimately cancelled after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. =CAHA first vice-president= alt=Canadian Victory bonds poster Sargent was elected first vice-president of the CAHA general meeting on April 17, 1940. At the same meeting, the CAHA updated its constitution to define an amateur as \\"one who either has not engaged or is not engaged in organized professional hockey\\", and permitted its teams to sign players to binding contracts. The CAHA and the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) agreed to an alliance and formed the International Ice Hockey Association to govern international hockey relationships. Sargent explained that in the new definition of amateur, the CAHA was only concerned whether a player was a professional in hockey, and not in any other sport. At the same time, the CAHA declined an invitation to re- affiliate with the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada due to differences in what constitutes an amateur. The CAHA reached a new agreement with the NHL in November 1940, which included payments to junior or senior clubs for developing players signed by professional teams. Sargent and W. G. Hardy became responsible to distribute the money proportionate to the player's service time. The new agreement also stipulated that players and teams would be suspended for improper transfers, and gave Sargent an $800 honorarium to cover expenses as an executive. Sargent oversaw schedules for playoffs in Western Canada, and stated that schedules might be altered to generate more attendance and profit. Sargent was re-elected first vice-president of the CAHA on April 16, 1941. He stated that the CAHA would take measures to ensure faster and cleaner hockey, and that proposals would be forthcoming at the upcoming meeting with the NHL to eliminate high-sticking, boarding and body checking injuries. He was subsequently named chairman of the resolution committee for the next CAHA general meeting. The CAHA adopted new rules in 1941, to assist in finding replacement players during wartime conditions; and sought for temporary reinstatement of professionals as amateurs, who were unable to travel to the United States during the war. Sargent was committed to do everything possible to expedite in reinstating professionals as amateurs under CAHA jurisdiction. =CAHA president= alt=Building exterior First term Sargent was elected president of the CAHA on April 21, 1942, to succeed George Dudley. He announced that the CAHA had profited nearly $15,000 from the 1942 playoffs, which he distributed to teams based on games played. The CAHA generated most of its playoffs profit from the 1942 Memorial Cup, more than three times the profit compared to the 1942 Allan Cup. The CAHA also approved grants to each of its provincial branches for the development of minor ice hockey, and agreed to distribute funds according to a survey of minor ice hockey organizations completed by W. B. George of the Ottawa District Hockey Association. The CAHA later allocated $9,000 towards promotion of minor ice hockey. In August 1942, the CAHA was requested to submit a brief to military service selection officials with the Government of Canada, to summarize the current participation numbers and its future plans. Sargent issued instructions to teams in the CAHA to arrange for games not interfere with the war economy, and accommodations must be made for any players who also worked at jobs contributing towards the war effort. He reported that registrations dropped from 26,000 in 1939, to just 13,000 in 1942, and he expected to lose more players to military services. Despite declining registration, he felt that prospects across the CAHA looked bright and was committed to have hockey to continue for the morale of Canadians. The CAHA and the NHL agreed in principle that a junior-aged player could become a professional whenever he wanted, to make a living under wartime conditions. They expected that NHL clubs would rely on junior-aged players as replacements due to military enlistments. In October 1942, Sargent announced a new professional-amateur agreement was reached. NHL teams were permitted to sign junior-aged players if the junior club was contacted first, and agreed not to sign any other junior-eligible players who had not yet played for the CAHA. The NHL continued to pay the CAHA for developing players, and contributed $17,000 towards junior teams during the 1941–42 season, compared to $6,000 during the 1940–41 season. During the playoffs for the 1942–43 season, Sargent sought for more strict enforcement of rules by referees in the interest of player safety. He was particularly concerned with increasing trend of rough play as opposed to \\"good clean hockey\\". Second term alt=Photo of trophy Sargent was re-elected president of the CAHA on April 27, 1943. He stated that his first term as president had been the most financially successful for the CAHA to date, with a profit near $60,000 and the ability to put $10,500 towards minor hockey grants. He chose to host the 1943 Memorial Cup in Toronto instead of Winnipeg to maximize profits. Attendance in Winnipeg had shrunk during the war, but remained strong in Toronto. Sargent recommended increasing the maximum roster size from 12 to 13 players due to the war. He later announced restrictions on transfers for minors and junior-aged players between regions in Canada. The CAHA registration committee wanted to protect against a region losing to many players, but chose to make exceptions when the player continued to reside with his parents who relocated or for a student living away from home and attending a post-secondary institution. In April 1943, the CAHA implemented rules to prevent delays of game to fix equipment, and a penalty shot if a goaltender injured or attempted to injure an opposing player. The CAHA also approved a recommendation for a centre ice red line which would allow forward passes to open up the play, instead of the existing offside rule. In August 1943, the joint rules committee of the CAHA and NHL adopted the forward pass to the centre ice red line. Sargent and Dudley met with officers from the Canadian Army in June 1943, to discuss possible arrangements for military sports in the CAHA. Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) teams agreed to join CAHA leagues for the 1943–44 season, provided that schedules did not interfere with military service. Playoffs were shortened to two rounds or less due to time restrictions. Sargent advised CAHA teams that a junior-aged player who enlisted would be required to return to his previous club after completing military service. RCAF teams pulled out of hockey on January 6, 1944, due to military commitments. Sargent did not question the decision and wished to co-operate with the war effort. Canadian Army teams later withdrew from CAHA national playoffs, but were permitted to play in local and intramural sports leagues with other garrisons. Several leagues in Canada folded as a result, and other leagues withdrew from the upcoming 1943 Allan Cup playoffs. The CAHA later allowed teams to have four replacements in playoffs due to wartime enlistments, in addition to the normal four players added for reinforcement of teams. Sargent attended a meeting between the CAHA and the NHL in September 1943, and accepted a proposal from a group in Kingston, Ontario, to establish a Hockey Hall of Fame. In February 1944, he was named to selection committee to choose the inaugural group of inductees for the Hall of Fame. Third term alt=Photo of trophy Sargent was re-elected to a third term as president of the CAHA on April 13, 1944, and became the first person to be elected to more than two terms as president. He supported rule changes to promote on-ice safety and prevent injuries within and near the goal crease and players' benches, and planned to publish a common book of rules in co-operation with the NHL. In April 1944, the CAHA voted to sever relations with the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG), and reaffirmed its relationship within the International Ice Hockey Association to strengthen ties with the AHAUS and the British Ice Hockey Association. Sargent hoped for the return of military teams to CAHA competitions for the 1944–45 season, but no applications were received. Despite the wartime conditions, registration had increased from 17,167 during the 1942–43 season, to 27,271 players in the 1943–44 season. The CAHA used the growing profits to increase grants by $1,500 to promote minor ice hockey. The CAHA gave approval for a new international senior hockey league to include teams in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. The league was organized by Al Leader, who wanted to rebuild amateur hockey which had suffered from the collapse of military teams. The Pacific Coast Hockey League began operating in the 1944–45 season, and Sargent received complaints about junior-aged players being offered contracts. He sought to follow proper international transfers to limit the number of junior-aged players leaving Canada; and for an AHAUS decision on its affiliation, professional status and whether the existing professional-amateur agreement applied. The CAHA was also faced with limited growth prospects of junior hockey in Western Canada due to the number of rinks available and not enough ice time. Sargent wanted to stop the migration of junior-aged players to Eastern Canada, and maintain registration numbers and competition in Western Canada. He decreed that such transfer requests must include a valid reason besides hockey. He cautioned that the western branches of the CAHA would be fighting to have the clause removed from the constitution which allowed exemptions for preparatory school transfers. He also announced the 1945 Memorial Cup would return to Maple Leaf Gardens to maximize profit for the CAHA. Sargent proposed hosting the 1945 Allan Cup in Vancouver. In February 1945, he questioned the viability of inter-provincial playoffs for senior hockey in 1945. While there was ample support for senior hockey in Vancouver, he was concerned about the reluctance teams from Quebec to travel west for the Allan Cup during wartime conditions. The Montreal Royals and Valleyfield Braves who appeared to be the strongest teams in Eastern Canada, and both declined to travel across the country due to their players' need to make a living rather than play hockey. In February 1945, Sargent announced the cancellation of the 1945 Allan Cup playoffs. It was the first season in which the trophy was not contested since the inaugural 1909 Allan Cup. The CAHA later vetoed an offer by the Quebec Aces to defend their 1944 Allan Cup championship against a challenger. Sargent did not want to see weaker teams challenge for the Allan Cup in lieu of a proper national playoff. =CAHA past-president= alt=Building exterior Sargent was succeeded as president by Hanson Dowell, then served as past-president of the CAHA from 1945 to 1947. Sargent stated he was relieved to let another person take over as president, since the duties were getting too much to handle as a volunteer. He felt that a full-time position would be necessary soon, but anticipated he would remain heavily involved as past-president. Sargent was immediately elected second vice-president of the International Ice Hockey Association, and was part of the CAHA delegation to discuss international hockey relations. He felt that Canada might be excluded from ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics if the International Olympic Committee did not accept the new Canadian definition of amateur, updated since the last Winter Olympics in 1936. Sargent supervised the Western Canada junior and senior playoffs, and believed that Maple Leaf Gardens should be the permanent home of the Memorial Cup finals, with arrangements made to compensate Western teams for travelling east. Sargent helped negotiate a new professional-amateur deal in 1946, where the NHL offered a $20,000 flat fee to sign junior-aged players. He noted that relations with the NHL had been friendly over the years, but the CAHA sought a larger lump sum or amount per player. After a stalemate, the CAHA ultimately accepted the $20,000 lump sum payment. =Later involvement= Sargent returned to his previous role as vice-president of the TBAHA from 1947 to 1951, and served as its president again from 1951 to 1953. During his involvement, he sought to establish a local senior ice hockey league involving teams from Winnipeg, and saw the Fort William Gardens open in 1951 to host games in the Thunder Bay Senior Hockey League. alt=Team photo Sargent supported the practice of allowing less-populated districts in the CAHA to add players from other teams for the playoffs, to make them more competitive. After the Port Arthur Bruins from the TBAHA won the 1948 Memorial Cup, the more-populated Ontario and Manitoba associations wanted to reverse the practice. In a 1950 Memorial Cup playoff series between the Kenora Kinsmen and the Port Arthur Bruins, Sargent awarded the series to Port Arthur after the first two games were won by 10–3 and 12–0 scores. In 1952, Sargent helped negotiate an agreement with the NHL for call-ups to be made to professional teams, but not interfere with playoffs in the CAHA. A January 15 deadline was agreed to, unless there was an emergency due to injuries. Sargent represented the CAHA at 1951 general meeting of the IIHF in Paris, and accompanied the Lethbridge Maple Leafs on their European tour and victory at the 1951 Ice Hockey World Championships. He felt the Lethbridge Maple Leafs were the best goodwill ambassadors the Canada could have had, describing them as gentlemanly and well-behaved. Sargent retired from hockey and resigned from the TBAHA on September 12, 1955, after 27 years on the executive. He expressed a growing dislike for the physical style of hockey being played, and had hoped to reintroduce rules for less contact and to prevent injuries. He also felt that the rising cost of operating a junior team, had decreased the number of teams which could compete at a high level. Curling careerEarly involvement= alt=Building exterior Sargent was a member of the Port Arthur Curling Club from 1924 onwards, and served as the club's president from 1934 to 1936. Membership grew to more than 30 curling rinks during this time, and he led discussions for the club to become affiliated with the Manitoba Curling Association (MCA). Sargent travelled to Manitoba representing his club, and participated in at least five MCA Bonspiels. He was a member of the rink which won the doubles championship at the Winnipeg Bonspiel in 1936, and won the Port Arthur Curling Club championship five times. He also won the Royal York Trophy at the 1946 bonspiel in Toronto. He won the annual 1947 and 1948 Lakehead Bonspiels with an undefeated record in both events. =Northwestern Ontario curling= Sargent assisted in founding the Northwestern Ontario Curling Association (NWOCA) in 1946. He was elected its first president in November the same year, and sought recognition as its own branch equivalent to other provincial associations within the Dominion Curling Association (DCA), and to compete for The Brier as national champions. The DCA granted branch status in 1949, and Ontario became the only province in Canada to have more than one nationally recognized branch. He was re-elected president of the NWOCA in February 1949, and was named to the executive committee of the DCA. alt=Photo of trophy Sargent won the 1950 NWOCA playoffs with eight consecutive victories, and advanced to the Northern Ontario finals in Sudbury. He was skip of the Northwest Ontario rink which lost to the Tom Ramsay rink that went on to win the 1950 Macdonald Brier. Sargent played second on the rink skipped by Grant Watson which won the 1953 Northern Ontario Men's Provincial Curling Championship. It was the first rink to represent Northwestern Ontario at the Brier. They competed at the 1953 Macdonald Brier in Sudbury with a record of seven wins, three losses, and finished in a tie for third place. Sargent served as president of the Port Arthur Curling Club again from 1950 to 1955, and led the club's effort to install the first indoor artificial curling sheet in the Lakehead area. Construction was funded by a combination of loans and profits generated by the club itself, which were $7,100 in the 1950–51 season. He later assisted in co-ordinating hosting duties of the 1960 Macdonald Brier by the Port Arthur and Fort William curling clubs. =Dominion Curling Association= Sargent was elected third vice-president of the DCA in March 1962, which enacted residency rules for its curlers in the Brier to prevent teams switching associations in its playoffs. He was elected second vice- president of the DCA in March 1963. He sat on the committee to review recommendations to update the code of ethics for professionalism in curling. The amateur eligibility issues had been unresolved since 1959, and opinions varied between Eastern and Western Canada. He began efforts to establish a national championship for mixed curling which was popular in Eastern Canada, but Western Canada showed little interest due to lack of ice time. alt=Curling action photo Sargent was elected first vice-president of the DCA in March 1964. The Canadian Mixed Curling Championship was established the same year at the Royal Canadian Curling Club in Toronto, with Canadian Breweries as the event's sponsor and Sargent as its committee chairman. Proposed updates to the code of ethics were rejected by the DCA in 1964. Western Canada delegates felt the proposed restrictions would have prevented the best curlers in the country from participating in DCA events, and put Canada at a disadvantage against other countries. Proposals limited the top bonspiel prize to $800 per rink or $200 per curler, which would have allowed only the independently wealthy to take time off and travel to the national events. The Canadian Senior Curling Championships was established in October 1964. Sargent was an original member of the senior championship committee, and believed the event would attract former Brier competitors and give seniors place to compete which had not existed. Sargent was elected president of the DCA in March 1965, at the general meeting held at the Bessborough Hotel in Saskatoon. He became the only person to hold the positions of CAHA and DCA president, and the first person to be president of two national amateur sporting associations in Canada. The inaugural Canadian Seniors Curling Championship was hosted in Port Arthur in March 1965. It used a minimum age of 55 for competitors, and had the Seagram Company as its title sponsor. Sargent was succeeded as president by Gordon Lockhart Bennett in March 1966. Sargent remained chairman of the national mixed curling championships. In 1969, he revealed that a new sponsor was needed since Canadian Breweries would pull out after the 1970 event, and was concerned about the event's viability without financial assistance. In March 1973, Sargent sat on the nomination committee to select the first group of inductees into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame to be established in Winnipeg. Personal life alt=Gravestone Sargent married Florence Helena Jones on September 25, 1935, and they resided in Port Arthur. The couple later raised two sons and one daughter. He was a member of the Loon Lake Campers' Association, and participated in local service clubs. He was a member the Gyro International Club of Port Arthur, and the Port Arthur Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He was a Freemason in the Scottish Rite Thunder Bay Lodge A.F. and A.M., and was a member of the Shriners as part of the Khartum Temple of the Shrine. Sargent served as president of the Port Arthur Golf Club from 1939 to 1941, and was a member of the Portage la Prairie Country Club. He won the Port Arthur Country Club championship three times, won the Thunder Bay District championship once, and was twice a runner-up in the district. He played badminton in Northwestern Ontario regional competitions. He won the men's championship twice, the men's doubles championship twice, and the mixed championship three times. He also participated in and won local horseshoes tournaments. His other hobbies included waterfowl hunting and skeet shooting. Sargent's wife Florence died on September 10, 1986. Sargent died on September 28, 1988, at his residence in Port Arthur. He was interred in the family plot at Riverside Cemetery in Thunder Bay. His son James subsequently assumed leadership of the family's funeral business. Honours and awards alt=Hall of Fame building exterior Sargent received awards and citations from multiple organizations.

In 1950, he received the AHAUS citation award for contributions to ice hockey in the United States. He received the Ontario Hockey Association Gold Stick Award in 1953, for contributions to ice hockey in Ontario.

It has affiliated national chapter members in seven countries. It has global partnerships with UN agencies and international organizations such as UNICEF's Education Cannot Wait (ECW), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Sister Cities International (SCI), Junior Chamber International (JCI), Association of Medical Doctors of Asia (AMDA) and others.  History  The organization was initially formed when Shin Koyamada and TEDx Talk Speaker Nia Lyte shared their passions of supporting youth, humanitarian aid and cross-cultural activities in the United States. They first begun providing relief foods and drinks to underprivileged families and individuals in Downtown Los Angeles with a group of friends and promoting cultural exchange activities across the United States. To benefit KIF's martial arts scholarship program that sponsored underprivileged youth to enroll in a martial arts school in the United States, KIF organized an international martial arts event United States Martial Arts Festival (USMAF), with over 1,000 participants representing 10 different countries and a group of world's renowned martial arts grand masters, including Fumio Demura, Tadashi Yamashita, Takayuki Kubota and businessmen who share similar international visions for the martial arts community, in Redondo Beach, California in 2010 and 2011. KIF signed a historic global partnership with its first UN agency named United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on women's empowerment and gender-based violence in December 2019, followed by second UN agency partnership with UNICEF's Education Cannot Wait (ECW) on education in emergencies in May, 2020.  Causes  There are 6 global causes that KIF and its all national chapter member organizations focus on in implementing programs, projects and activities catered to their communities and countries. For national causes, each national chapter prioritizes what it wants to focus on from the global causes to align all causes in all chapters, and create and carry out a new program or project based on the needs of its communities and territory. = Fostering youth leadership = To cultivate global mindset and youth leadership, KIF's national chapter member organizations have partnered up with many high schools and universities, embassies and consulates, and local governments and its board of education to organize a series of global speaker's programs for their youth students in Japan, Colombia, Kenya, United States and other countries where KIF's national chapters are based. KIF's President Nia Lyte participated as a closing keynote speaker addressing the importance of youth and women's empowerment and leadership at Junior Chamber International (JCI)'s global partnership summit at the United Nations Headquarters in New York in 2018. In addition, KIF has participated numerous JCI's regional events with its global members to collaborate on youth leadership events in the United States and Asia Pacific region. In the following collaborations for a year, KIF and JCI signed a global partnership in February 2019 to continue the important efforts on fostering youth leaderships in different regions. = Empowering girls and women = KIF empowers all girls and women to be, do and achieve whatever they strongly believe they want to be, do and achieve in their lives. KIF national chapters have organized series of speaker's programs targeting over 300 women leaders per event to exchange dialogue on women's leaderships. In December 2019, KIF has partnered with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on a new women's empowerment and gender-based violence initiative as part of the pledges KIF has made during the 25th International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) held in Nairobi, Kenya in November 2019. = Assisting disaster relief = In emergency response to 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, KIF started a disaster relief program and its first national chapter organization KIF Japan in Tokyo to help victims affected by the natural disaster, by providing them the relief funds of over $120,000 raised through fundraisers as well as shipping 20-foot container filled with relief goods and items, which KIF's volunteers collected in Southern California. In 2019, KIF has partnered with Association of Medical Doctors of Asia (AMDA) to assist AMDA in providing emergency medical aid to people affected by natural as well as man-made disasters in Asia and other regions. AMDA is an international NGOs with General Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic & Social Council and with an international network of 30 chapters and 47 collaborating organizations around the world. In May 2020, KIF has partnered with UNICEF's Education Cannot Wait (ECW) to support ECW's comprehensive education programmes for children and youth affected by conflicts, natural disasters and displacement, right from the onset of crisis through recovery phases through KIF's national chapters in Latin America and Africa. = Building people-to- people connections = To promote mutual understanding and respect, KIF's national chapters have mobilized the series of grassroots cross-cultural networking events in partnerships with a number of different government agencies, embassies and consulates, and local nonprofit organizations in different countries. In 2013 and 2014, Hollywood celebrities Dylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse from Disney Channel's Suite Life traveled to Japan for the first time ever for a KIF's new program United States-Japan Discovery Tour to exchange dialogue with thousands of Japanese youth on the importance of pursuing a higher education and interact with them on cross-cultural activities for two weeks. During the tour, the activities were shared to millions of followers and supporters on social media. To strengthen citizen diplomacy and people-to-people activities, KIF and Sister Cities International (SCI) have partnered up to develop new bilateral summits in the United States and other countries in January 2019. In March 2019, KIF and SCI have organized the Japan-Texas Leadership Symposium, hosted by City of San Antonio and supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan to strengthen friendships between people of the United States and Japan and advance cultural and economic exchanges between two nations. = Reducing extreme poverty = As part of extreme poverty reduction cause, KIF begun providing relief beverages and clothing to homeless people in Downtown Los Angeles through its partner organization. In the following year, KIF created a new homeless relief project named 1000 Ways To Give and continued its efforts annually with a group of new volunteers. = Advancing sustainable development = On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets for the 17 goals. KIF has been involved in promoting and advancing SDGs through its causes with its global partners and national chapter members. At the United Nations Headquarters in New York, KIF President Nia Lyte, who is originally from Colombia, was invited by Ambassador María Emma Mejía Vélez, the Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations to participate and speak with U.N.

Structure  KIF is an international umbrella organization consisting of its board of directors, management leaderships, standing committees and affiliated members of national chapter organizations based in different countries. = Global committees = There are 11 global committees consisting of individual members who are national committee chairs of national chapter member organizations. The global committees are divided in three types; one is executive committee, second is for regions and third is for specific tasks. The committees for regions have five different regional committees such as Asia Pacific Committee, North America Committee, South America Committee, Europe Committee and Africa & Middle East Committee. Members of each regional committee are active national chairs of national chapter member organizations representing their regions. Each regional committee is inclusively organized to mainly oversee its region, increase the regional visibility and quality of each national chapter member, help establish a new national chapter member in a new country, and share resources and networks. The committees of specific tasks are set up in five different committees on global programs, memberships, governance, finance and public relations. All members of the committees are committee chairs of a specific national committee of a national chapter member. = National chapter members = Each national chapter member is an independent nonprofit organization exclusively licensed to operate in a specific country, governed by its own national boards and officers with national committees, and funded by its supporters and contributors of a designated country. All members of national chapters are local chapter member organizations and individual and corporate members.  Partnerships  To support and achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), KIF is committed to enhance strong global partnerships and cooperation with UN agencies and leading international organizations on global programs, advancing mutual interests and aligned purpose. For each KIF's global cause, KIF strategically collaborates with a global partner to design and plan a specific global program targeting specific regions or countries and carry it out in partnerships with KIF's national chapter members that also work closely with the partner's country office. KIF's current global partners are as follows: = UN agencies = * United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) - Gender-based violence, women's empowerment, gender equality * UNICEF's Education Cannot Wait (ECW) - Education in emergencies = International NGOs = * Sister Cities International (SCI) - Citizen diplomacy and bilateral summits * Junior Chamber International (JCI) - Youth leadership * Association of Medical Doctors of Asia (AMDA) - Disaster relief * Union of Russian Cities (URC) - educational and cross-cultural activities * Green Hope Colombia Foundation (GHCF) - Amazon reforestation  Goodwill ambassadors  Celebrities Dylan Sprouse and Cole Sprouse joined KIF as Goodwill Ambassadors in 2013.

A native of Houston, Texas, Schwinger committed to play for Rice on a full athletic scholarship in his junior year at John H. Reagan High School. He entered the school in the fall of 1950. Due to NCAA rules at the time, freshmen were ineligible to compete for varsity sports, so Schwinger's college basketball career began as a sophomore in 1951–52. His three years as a Rice Owl proved to be one for the record books. At the time of his graduation, the 6'6\\" forward held four school records (all since eclipsed): points and rebounds in a single season (604 and 344), and points and rebounds for a career (1,328 and 810). He was twice a first-team All- Southwest Conference selection while leading the league in points per game both years. In all three seasons he led Rice in scoring and rebounding. As a junior in 1952–53 Schwinger was named a second-team All-American by the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and as a senior in 1953–54 the Associated Press named him an honorable mention All-American. In 1953–54 he led the Owls to a share of the Southwest Conference regular season title and a berth in the 1954 NCAA Tournament, where the team finished in third place in their region. In the spring of 1954 Schwinger was selected by the Minneapolis Lakers in the NBA draft. He was taken in the fourth round (36th overall). Schwinger opted instead to pursue a career in business, bypassing the NBA. He attended Harvard Business School and earned his Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1959. Schwinger spent his business career in various roles within banking, securities trading, and investment firms until his retirement in 2003.

The Official Record Store Chart is a weekly music chart based on physical sales of albums in almost 100 independent record stores in the United Kingdom, such as Rough Trade, Rounder Records, Jumbo and Sound It Out. It is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), and each week's number one is first announced on Friday evenings on the OCC's official website. The chart's launch was first announced by the OCC on 17 April 2012 – at the time, British record stores were selling 4.5 million albums per year, and were contributing towards 95 per cent of the country's total vinyl sales. However, music downloads held a considerable share of the albums market, leading to a decline in the number of outlets. In promoting the chart, Martin Talbot, managing director of the OCC, remarked that he could see the benefits to both digital and physical album sales, but that there was \\"nothing nicer than the smell and feel of a nice chunky vinyl\\". The Official Record Store Chart was first broadcast by British DJ Steve Lamacq on his eponymous radio programme on BBC 6 Music; the first number one was Boys & Girls, the debut studio album by American band Alabama Shakes. Geoff Travis, founder of Rough Trade, the label that distributed Boys & Girls, stated that he was \\"very proud\\" that his label had achieved this feat. The first Official Record Store Chart was announced on Friday 20 April 2012, five days later than normal, to coincide with the eve of the UK's fourth annual Record Store Day, an international initiative founded to encourage purchases at record shops.

The approximately park lies adjacent to Peachtree Creek, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River. The park is a memorial to those who died in the Battle of Peachtree Creek, which took place on parts of this park and nearby Tanyard Creek Park.  History  The park's location along Peachtree Creek had been the site of the Battle of Peachtree Creek, a major battle in the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. In 1929, former Georgia Governor M. Hoke Smith and others donated the land to the city of Atlanta for the purposes of creating a park. An adjoining golf course, named after Bobby Jones, was built in 1931, while construction on the park began in 1933. The park's location on the creek's floodplain makes it susceptible to occasional flooding.

It was written by Derek Holton and John Sheehan, and published in 1993 by the Cambridge University Press as volume 7 in their Australian Mathematical Society Lecture Series. Topics The Petersen graph The Petersen graph is an undirected graph with ten vertices and fifteen edges, commonly drawn as a pentagram within a pentagon, with corresponding vertices attached to each other. It has many unusual mathematical properties, and has frequently been used as a counterexample to conjectures in graph theory. The book uses these properties as an excuse to cover several advanced topics in graph theory where this graph plays an important role. It is heavily illustrated, and includes both open problems on the topics it discusses and detailed references to the literature on these problems. After an introductory chapter, the second and third chapters concern graph coloring, the history of the four color theorem for planar graphs, its equivalence to 3-edge-coloring of planar cubic graphs, the snarks (cubic graphs that have no such colorings), and the conjecture of W. T. Tutte that every snark has the Petersen graph as a graph minor. Two more chapters concern closely related topics, perfect matchings (the sets of edges that can have a single color in a 3-edge- coloring) and nowhere-zero flows (the dual concept to planar graph coloring). The Petersen graph shows up again in another conjecture of Tutte, that when a bridgeless graph does not have the Petersen graph as a minor, it must have a nowhere-zero 4-flow. Chapter six of the book concerns cages, the smallest regular graphs with no cycles shorter than a given length. The Petersen graph is an example: it is the smallest 3-regular graph with no cycles of length shorter than 5. Chapter seven is on hypohamiltonian graphs, the graphs that do not have a Hamiltonian cycle through all vertices but that do have cycles through every set of all but one vertices; the Petersen graph is the smallest example. The next chapter concerns the symmetries of graphs, and types of graphs defined by their symmetries, including the distance-transitive graphs and strongly regular graphs (of which the Petersen graph is an example) and the Cayley graphs (of which it is not). The book concludes with a final chapter of miscellaneous topics too small for their own chapters. Audience and reception The book assumes that its readers already have some familiarity with graph theory. It can be used as a reference work for researchers in this area, or as the basis of an advanced course in graph theory. Although Carsten Thomassen describes the book as \\"elegant\\", and Robin Wilson evaluates its exposition as \\"generally good\\", reviewer Charles H. C. Little takes the opposite view, finding fault with its copyediting, with some of its mathematical notation, and with its failure to discuss the lattice of integer combinations of perfect matchings, in which the number of copies of the Petersen graph in the \\"bricks\\" of a certain graph decomposition plays a key role in computing the dimension. Reviewer Ian Anderson notes the superficiality of some of its coverage, but concludes that the book \\"succeeds in giving an exciting and enthusiastic glimpse\\" of graph theory.

Hardin was born in Russellville, Kentucky, and grew up in Kentucky while being raised by Shakers. He participated in the California Gold Rush and American Civil War before moving to the western United States. He became active in Colorado, with a job at the United States Mint and serving as a delegate to the 1872 Republican National Convention, but later moved to Wyoming after bigamy allegations resulted in him being fired. In Wyoming, he was elected to the Territorial House of Representative. After leaving Wyoming he lived in Utah until his suicide in 1889. Early life William Jefferson Hardin was born around 1831, in Russellville, Kentucky, to a white father and a half-black mother. He claimed to be the nephew of Benjamin Hardin, but his claims were never proven. He was raised by Shakers in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and began teaching free black people in 1849. On June 15, 1850, he married Caroline Catherine Butcher, the daughter of a black mother and half-Native American and half-white father. From 1850 to 1855, he prospected for gold in California while his wife moved to Ontario, Canada, due to fears of being sold into slavery. In December 1862, he became a second lieutenant in the 3rd Louisiana Native Guard Infantry Regiment, but resigned in February 1863, in protest of white commanders not wanting black people in the regiment. After leaving the army he moved to the western United States by traveling through Wisconsin, Iowa, and Nebraska before arriving in Denver, Colorado Territory. CareerPolitics= In 1872, he was selected to serve as the delegate-at-large for the Colorado Territory at the Republican National Convention. In 1873, he started working for the United States Mint and later married Nellie Davidson, a white woman. However, Caroline Catherine Butcher arrived in Denver and accused Hardin of being a bigamist, moving to the western United States to avoid being drafted into the army, and of being the father of Mary Elizabeth, who was born in 1858. Hardin claimed that he was a minor and she was a slave at the time of the marriage making it illegal. Although he was not charged with bigamy he was fired from his position at the mint. In 1873, he and Davidson moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. =Wyoming Territorial House of Representatives= In 1879, he was elected to Wyoming's Territorial House of Representatives after placing third as a fusion candidate with the Democratic and Republican nominations, thus becoming the first black member of the Wyoming Legislature. In 1880, he was reelected, although he had attempted to have his name removed from the ballot, after finishing eighth with 1,277 votes and became the only member of the House to serve in both the sixth and seventh sessions. On November 4, 1879, he introduced Speaker H. L. Myrick and was selected to serve on the Indian and Military Affairs committee and on the two- member Joint Standing Committee on Printing. Later life In 1882, he and Davidson moved to Ogden, Utah Territory, where he opened a barbershop with David L. Lemon. Davidson later left him to marry another man. In August 1883, he moved to Park City, Utah, where he opened another barbershop. In 1889, he found Davidson in Seattle, Washington, and attempted to convince her to return to him now that she was a widow, but he failed. On September 13, 1889, he committed suicide in Park City, Utah, by shooting himself in the heart.

The record celebrates family, unity and the city Nile has called home since the early 1970s.  Background  Nile says the idea for the name, New York at Night, came to him one Friday night in the summer of 2018, when he was walking alone near Times Square to catch a subway. When he got on the train he saw a man all covered in thick whipped cream. After he exited the train he saw all sorts of characters on the street in Greenwich Village. As he continued his walk home, he thought \\"New York at night, wow, what a name for a song\\". After he got home he picked up his guitar and wrote the song. Most of the songs are New York inspired but it is not a concept album. Nile says \\"What all the songs on this album have in common is that they reflect my life and experiences living in New York.\\" Nile recorded \\"Run Free\\" in 2003 with his band, at the time, The Worry Dolls, but it was never previously released. \\"Surrender the Moon\\" is a song started by Nile's brother John Noonan who died a year after starting the song in 2007. Nile finished the song for this album. Nile co-wrote \\"New York is Rockin'\\" with Curtis Stigers for Stigers' 1995 album Time Was. In February 2020 Nile announced plans to release his 13th studio album in 2020. On his own website he took advance orders for digital downloads, CDs, signed lyrics and other merchandise to raise funds to produce the album. In a March 2020 interview by Jam Band News, Nile said \\"“I like the independent world.\\" “There are no constraints and you can work at your own speed. I’ve no complaints about having been on major labels. I was on two of them and I was able to do what I wanted to do. But things have changed so much in the music business that being independent allows for so many more options.\\" Nile has employed similar crowdfunding campaigns for five of his previous albums. The release of New York at Night coincides with the 40th anniversary of Nile's self-titled debut album, which was released in 1980.  Critical reception  In the United States = * Hal Horowitz, of American Songwriter, says of Nile; \\"His rugged outside shell is just a leather jacket over the soul of a sensitive and honest musician with an enthusiasm for rock and roll that beats like the jackhammers punctuating the air of the city he loves\\". * In AllMusic, Mark Deming wrote; \\"it's smart, exciting, and hot-wired rock & roll from a guy who clearly knows plenty about his city and his music, and it's a reminder that he's one of the best rockers New York has left.\\" * Lou Montesano reports in Elmore Magazine; New York at Night is a tribute to the city's strength, energy and will to endure—just like Willie Nile himself. * John Moore in his Glide Magazine review of the album says; \\"Nile has stuck to a template of rock, shunning all prefixes, and dodging musical trends that puts him up there with Springsteen and Dylan.\\" * Pablo Gorondi of Associated Press says \\"albums like New York at Night show that Nile still has all it takes to be a radio star, and more.\\" * Rock & Roll Globe's Katherine Yeske Taylor wrote; \\"Nile and his band are known for putting on extraordinarily energetic and uplifting concerts, and they’ve managed to capture this same vibe on New York at Night\\". * PopMatters says Under This Roof is \\"a tender ballad that exhibits Nile's knack for embracing the human condition....an anthem for belonging in an era of isolation\\". * New York City music host Paul Cavalconte of WFUV says; \\"A rockin’ new Willie Nile album!

Alternately varied with power ballads. In those ballads it is striking that Nile has mastered the Dylanesque singing well, including a rhyme scheme cast in concrete. That link to Dylan is not surprising, because in 2017 Nile already made a beautiful album with Dylan covers. Nile has a good pen for writing anthems, nice, \\"big\\" songs, with a high content of catchy sing-along pieces.

It was designed in 1957 by Peter Womersley for the textile artist Bernat Klein and his wife Peggy, and completed in 1958. The interior was decorated with exotic woods, and with fabrics specially designed by Klein. The house, with its clear and coloured panes of glass within a wooden structure, and its woodland setting, has been described as like \\"a Mondrian set within a Klimt\\". Womersley designed a separate studio for Klein in 1969, which was completed near the house in 1972. The strong horizontal and vertical concrete structure of the studio are reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater. The house and the studio, two largely unaltered examples of Womersley's modular Modernist architecture, are separately listed in Category A, as \\"buildings of national or international importance\\". Background The house was commissioned in 1956, after Klein and his wife saw the Modernist Farnley Hey, designed by Womersley and built in 1954 south of Huddersfield. Farnley Hey was awarded a RIBA bronze medal: it was given as a wedding present to Womersley's brother John, and is now listed at Grade II. Klein admired its rough stone walls and large windows, although the stone elements were omitted at High Sunderland to reduce costs. Its modular design has been described as a forerunner to Benjamin's Mount, a 1967 house by Ernő Goldfinger in Windlesham and now Grade II* listed. The single-storey house was designed for a woodland site that Klein had acquired in the grounds of Sunderland Hall, an 1850 Scottish Baronial mansion designed David Bryce and now itself Category B listed. The estate lies near the confluence of Ettrick Water and the River Tweed, south of Galashiels, where Klein had acquired a mill to make the fabrics that he designed. Womersley had himself moved to the Scottish Borders in 1957, where he built The Rig, his home and studio in Gattonside near Melrose, also Category B listed. A decade later, in 1969, Womersley designed a separate studio for Klein near High Sunderland. Strongly reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, the studio remains one of Womersley's best-known buildings. High Sunderland and the Bernat Klein Studio are separately protected as Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a building in Scotland, for \\"buildings of national or international importance\\". House The main house is large, low rectangular building with a flat roof, constructed in Modernist style in a clearing on a sloping woodland site beside the A707 about north of Selkirk, looking east over the Ettrick Water towards the triple peak of Eildon Hill. It was originally intended for use as Klein's design office as well as his family home. The single storey structure was made from Makore wood on a concrete raft, with 14 bays by 5 bays on a grid. The exterior bays are largely filled by clear plyglass glazing separated vertically by the wood structure, and horizontally by two white horizontal strips, a base course band with a higher clerestory band, and then topped by a white facia at the eaves with aluminium trim. The separate internal areas for living, bathing and sleeping are denoted by panels of laminated glass (coloured vitroslab), with some bays filled with vertically boarded Makore. An area, 2 by 7 bays to the southwest corner, forms an open car port. An entrance screen on the south façade has five horizontal panels containing tile mosaics added later by Bernat Klein. An open area left as a courtyard and pond at the northeast corner was later filled in. The boundary of the property is marked by drystone walls and gateposts. The open plan interior retains its original design scheme, with bespoke fitted furniture and light fittings, travertine and tiled flooring, and ceilings of polished obeche wood. The décor includes textiles were specially designed, dyed and woven by Klein. Space was maximised by reducing circulation spaces, with cupboards installed as dividing walls with flat concealed doors, using walnut and exotic woods such as idigbo and rosewood. The main living space has a sunken floor. An open plan playroom with sleeping alcoves was designed to be divided into separate bedrooms later. The modular design was intended to permit further extension: part of the courtyard and pond were used to create an office space when the separate studio building was sold in 1982. Buildings taking inspiration from High Sunderland include Benjamin's Mount, designed by Ernő Goldfinger in 1967 and now Grade II*, which also adopts a modular flat-roofed open-plan design, but has two separate wings. The house was listed in Category A in 2007. After Klein died in 2014, the house was marketed for sale in 2015, at an asking price of £795,000. Klein's daughter, Shelley Klein, published a memoir, The See-Through House, in 2020. File:High Sunderland, General View.jpg File:High Sunderland.jpg Studio The studio is separate rectangular two-storey building, also in Modernist style, on a sloping woodland site about south of the main house. It was designed in 1969 and completed in 1972. Its design incorporates elements of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, combining the horizontal modular glazing adopted by Womersely in the main house at High Sunderland and for his own house at The Rig, with the concrete elements that Womersley used at the Gala Fairydean stadium at Netherdale in Galashiels and his 1963 Nuffield Transplantation Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital. It was constructed using deep horizontal concrete beams supported by four main concrete columns, and with glazing in anodised aluminium frames. It stands on a brick plinth, with an overhanging upper floor, and a central brick service core extending through to the flat roof. A concrete bridge provides access directly to the upper floor from the rising ground to the north. The open plan interior studio is arranged on two floors around the stairs and services in the central brick core. Kitchens were added to both floors in 2006. The studio won a RIBA award in 1973 for its design and use of materials, and the same year it also won the Centenary Medal of the Edinburgh Architectural Association. It was listed in Category B in 1994, and upgraded to Category A in July 2002. With Klein's business in financial difficulties, the studio was sold in 1982 and used by Borders Enterprise for a short time as Textile Information Centre. It was sold to a private owner in around 2000, and permission was given in 2006 to convert the studio to residential use, including adding a new structure to the roof, but it remains unused and in poor repair. It has been on the Buildings at Risk Register since 2002.

A Swedish naval force under the command of Major C.F. von Hauswolff was ordered to cut off the northward retreat of a Russian force under General Nikolay Kamensky which had been defeated by the Swedes five days earlier at Ratan. The Swedish attempt to hem in the Russians was rebuffed as the Russian victory became the last battle which took place on Swedish soil during the war, and remains today the most recent battle to have taken place in Sweden.  Background  On 20 August 1809, the Russian army had been defeated by the Swedes at the village of Ratan, north of Umeå, and had afterwards retired northwards in the direction of Piteå. The Russians were tailed by a naval force of Swedes that had departed from Ratan on 23 August under Major C.F. von Hauswolff, who was the leading officer aboard a Swedish frigate, the Jarramas. This ship, accompanied by six ‘cannon sloops’, was tasked with the mission of cutting off and trapping the Russian force, by taking up positions on the northern shore of the Pite River near Pitsund, and destroying the bridge that crossed it, thus cutting off the Russians’ escape route northwards and forcing them to face the main Swedish force which was still further to the south.  Battle  The Swedish naval squadron, which was also tasked with capturing any Russian vessels which they found sailing northwards, arrived south of Piteå, at the island of Pitholmen on 25 August. The Swedes found stationed on the island a Russian infantry battalion accompanied by some cossacks, under the command of General Nikolay Kamensky. The Pite River Upon seeing the Swedes, a Russian soldier was ordered to ride quickly on his horse to spread news of their sudden arrival, but was killed by fire from one of the Swedish sloops. The bridge that the Swedes were meant to destroy was clearly visible from the water and it was determined that it could be destroyed easily by a cannonade from the sloops. Major Hauswolff, however, thought it more appropriate to destroy the bridge personally, and resolved to row on a launch in the direction of the bridge. Predictably, he quickly came under fire from the Russian pickets on the beach and was badly injured. Command fell to Georg Samuel von Gegerfelt, who decided to take the Swedish ships into the narrow strait towards the bridge, but was quickly beset on both sides by Russian infantrymen. A desperate Swedish attempt to reach the bridge was initiated by a Lieutenant Everlöf in particular who advanced under the guard of some sloops, but he and the men accompanying him were shot down by the Russians who had the high ground, and a retreat was deemed necessary. The Swedes quickly determined that a landing would likely not be possible given the strong positioning of the Russian forces, but were still determined to try. However, the squadron then spotted a force of thirteen Russian transport vessels incoming from the South, intent on resupplying the Russian land forces, so two Swedish sloops were sent out to initiate an attack on the enemy ships. These two vessels were forced to retreat back to the Jarramas, however, upon seeing that the transport ships were being escorted by two heavily armed cannon boats. The Swedish squadron quickly retired southwards upon realizing the hopelessness of their situation.  Aftermath  The battle saw six killed and nineteen injured on the Swedish side and thirteen killed, twenty injured, and seven captured on the Russian side, numbers that make clear the limited extent of the Russian victory. The somewhat pyrrhic nature of this victory for the Russians did not, however, prevent them from taking to Piteå and plundering it following the engagement. In 1999, a commemorative marker was placed upon the site of the battle to recognize its significance as the location of the last engagement of the war on Swedish soil. In 2009, Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf laid a wreath by the marker, as did the Russian ambassador to Sweden, Alexander Kadakin.

Pavlichenko is the Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of PionEar Technologies, a medical device company that develops intelligent technologies for treating ear and hearing disorders. The tympanostomy technology she invented for treated recurrent ear infections has been nationally recognized for its innovative design which addresses many of the limitations of current ear tubes.  Early life and education  Pavlichenko was born in Azerbaijan. Pavlichenko completed her Master's of Science in Physics at the Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia, graduating summa cum laude in 2010. Working under the mentorship of Aziz M. Muzafarov, Pavlichenko pioneered the design of novel multi-arm star-like polymethylsiloxane polymers. They explored the behavior and characterized the properties of these nano-sized molecules at the air-water interface. At the completion of her Master's, Pavlichenko won the IDK-NBT fellowship which she used to pursue her graduate training in Inorganic Chemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. During her time at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research at LMU, Pavlichenko studied under the mentorship of Bettina V. Lotsch and worked to develop novel highly sensitive photonic crystals that could detect chemical and physical stimuli. Photonic crystals are incredible structures that reflect only highly specific wavelengths of light due to the periodically arranged nanostructure of the photonic crystals. Since the structure is at the sub-nanometer scale, small changes are detected as dramatic changes in the colour of light reflected. Pavlichenko and her team harnessed this unique property of photonic crystals and began to design them such that they would absorb specific types of molecules and thus act as sensors for the presence of these molecules in the environment. One type of sensor she designed was a thermally tunable and environmentally responsive 1D photonic crystal. The mesoporous structure led to highly sensitive changes in refractive index based on humidity and was capable of producing a dramatic spectral shift within a humidity range of 25% to 55%. The opportunity to create a sensing platform with an optical readout would revolutionize the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and detection and potentially be more affordable than current sensor technologies. Pavlichenko's thesis was titled “Stimuli-responsive photonic sensors: Towards an integrated electrophotonic detection platform”.  Career and research  After completing her graduate training in 2014, Pavlichenko began her postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University in the lab of Joanna Aizenberg at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. During her postdoc, Pavlichenko developed novel biologically inspired medical devices and was the co-inventor on several patents. She began her time in the lab applying her knowledge of AI-based photonic sensors towards the development of novel medical devices. Point-of-care diagnostics are an important focus of healthcare innovation as they provide rapid testing and results to enable more informed care and speedier recovery. Photonic crystals can be incorporated in the development of point-of-care diagnostics as they can be designed to provide optical outputs in the presence of specific analytes. In 2018, Pavlichenko co-founded PionEar, a medical device company that creates liquid- infused tympanostomy tubes that can help to relieve inflammation, fluids, infection, and pain in the middle ear due to ear infections. Pavlichenko was inspired to create these devices as her young daughter was suffering from recurrent ear infections, like many young children do, and she wanted a better solution compared to the often ineffective ear tubes that physicians are limited to using to treat earn infections. Typical ear tube technology often gets infected, the tubes are pre-maturely extruded from the ear, can become clogged, and re-insertion often lead to scarring later in life. Her technology addresses the limitations of current ear tubes in that it is customizable, can be used to administer drugs yet does not let in water and fluids that might cause infection, and due to its liquid-filled polymer based fabrication it has reduced biofouling. Since their technology is 3D printed to fit each ear, it stays in the ear and the patient suffers less scarring from re-implantation. Pavlichenko and her team used the support of the Harvard University Innovation Labs (iLabs) in order to support their entrepreneurial endeavours and now, Pavlichenko is dedicated to continuing entrepreneurial work. Pavlichenko was promoted to Technology Development Fellow at the Wyss Institute at Harvard and is the Chief Executive Officer of PionEar. After winning the Bertarelli Prize, along with several other Massachusetts and Harvard-based innovation prizes, Pavlichenko and her team will soon begin to commercialize the technology and begin its testing in animals and then patients.

The first tornado to cause casualties on February 26 was a short-lived, but strong F2 tornado that injured two on the south side of Hosston, Louisiana. Three destructive tornadoes then struck Mississippi. The first one was a long-tracked F3 tornado that moved directly through Downtown Jackson, killing eight and 26 injuries on its 69.7 mile path. Just 10 minutes after that tornado touched down, an even longer-tracked F3 tornado touched down further to the east, striking Harrisville, Piney Woods, Walnut Grove, and Madden, killing one and injuring 34 on its 71-mile-path. Further to the south, an F2 tornado pummeled the towns of White Sand, Hillsdale, and Eastern Lumberton, injuring nine. Later that evening, another F2 tornado tracked through Gulf Hills, Vancleave, and Hurley, Mississippi, injuring one. A catastrophic F3 tornado then tore through the rural Mississippi counties of Perry, Greene, and Wayne, killing four and injuring 20. The final strong tornado of the event took place just before midnight when a brief, but destructive F3 tornado hit Savannah, Tennessee, although there were no casualties.

Another F3 tornado hit Stoneburg, injuring one. After minimal tornado activity from April 3-4, a deadly outbreak of 17 tornadoes struck the Midwest and Alabama on April 5. It started with a long- tracked late-morning F1 tornado that struck Remsen, Eastern Alton, and Western Newkirk, Iowa, injuring one on its 37-mile path. That afternoon, a deadly, long-tracked F3 tornado tore through New Athens, Fayetteville, New Memphis Station, Damiansville, Breese, Hagarstown, and Western Vandalia, Illinois, killing one and injuring eight on its 60.5 mile path. An F1 tornado then injured one in rural Perry County, Missouri. Back in Illinois, another F3 tornado struck Vergennes, the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds in Southern Du Quoin, and Sesser, injuring 11. As tornado activity wound down in the Midwest that evening, it quickly began to pick up in Alabama. An F2 tornado struck Leighton, Wheeler Darn Village, and Rogersville, killing one and injuring another. Later, another F2 tornado passed through just east of the killer tornado, causing mostly heavy tree damage in rural Lawrence and Limestone Counties. Just after midnight on April 6, the final strong F3 tornado of the outbreak sequence tore through Albertville, the west sides of Hustleville, Asbury, and Grove Oak, and Section, injuring one. The outbreak ended later that afternoon when a weak, but damaging F1 tornado moved through Hampton, Virginia, although it caused no casualties. Overall, the tornadoes killed three and injured 40. =April 15= An intense, localized outbreak of five tornadoes hit Florida and Georgia. It started with a brief, but violent F4 tornado striking Bereah, Florida (although some experts rated it as an F3 tornado due to poor construction of the structures), injuring seven. Later, an F3 tornado (some experts rate it as an F2 tornado) tore through Northern Anastasia Island, Florida, injuring nine. Another F3 storm then became the most damaging tornado of the day when it moved directly through Anglevillas and Fort Pierce, Florida, injuring 20. Overall, the outbreak injured 36. =April 21–22= An outbreak of 11 tornadoes impacted the Southern Plains and the Southeast. On April 21, a disastrous, .25-mile-wide F2 tornado hit the Southern Dallas suburbs of Midlothian and Forreston, injuring 18.

It then tracked 15.1 miles southeastward through the eastern suburbs of Withrow, the west sides of Stillwater, Oak Park Heights, and Bayport, and Northern Lakeland, injuring six. It then crossed the St. Croix River into Wisconsin, where it tracked 44.3 miles, striking the towns of Southern Hudson, Northern River Falls, Lawton, El Paso, Waverly, Exile, and Arkansaw, injuring an additional six before dissipating. In total, the tornado traveled 59.4 miles and injured 12. April 25 saw two stray, but strong F2 tornadoes. The first one caused heavy damage to Will Rogers World Airport in Southwest Oklahoma City. The second one was brief, but it struck Decatur, Alabama, injuring one. Overall, the three tornadoes injured 13. =May 27–June 2= A modest outbreak sequence of 23 tornadoes hit areas from California and Illinois. The first major tornado occurred on May 30 when an F3 tornado tore through rural Benson County, North Dakota. Right at midnight on May 31, an F1 tornado injured one in Kampville, Missouri north of St. Louis. Later, an F2 tornado injured two in Rolling Prairie, Indiana. In Kansas, an F3 tornado hit areas northwest of Labette. June 1 saw a rare F2 tornado track 15 miles through Valley Ford and Fredericks, California, causing major damage, but no casualties before dissipating southwest of Roseland and Santa Rosa. The final tornado of the outbreak was an F1 tornado in Columbia, Alabama. In the end, the outbreak sequence injured three. June There were 128 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. =June 4= A violent outbreak of 10 tornadoes struck the Upper Midwest. It started when a large F2 tornado passed through Avon and Collegeville, Minnesota just west of St. Cloud, injuring two. At the same time, a brief F1 tornado injured one west of St. Martin, Minnesota. The worst tornadoes later occurred in Wisconsin. A large, violent, long-tracked, half- mile wide F5 tornado (some experts rated it as an F4 tornado) tore through Wildwood, Southern Knapp, Cedar Falls, Tainter Lake, and Northwestern Colfax, killing 21 and injuring 74. Another large, violent, wide F4 tornado then hit Chippewa Falls northeast of Eau Claire, killing four and injuring 50. After that, an F3 tornado injured three in Cadott. Later, another violent, long tracked, half-mile wide F4 tornado struck Fall Creek before moving through rural Eau Claire, Clark, and Marathon Counties, killing four and injuring three. The final tornado, which was rated F2, then touched down and caused mostly tree damage, although some barns were destroyed, in rural Rusk and Sawyer Counties. In the end, the outbreak killed 28, all in Northwestern Wisconsin, injured 133, and caused $83.275 millon (1957 USD) in damage. =June 10= A small, but deadly outbreak of five tornadoes impacted Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas. The only tornado to cause casualties was a violent F4 tornado (which may have reached F5 intensity) that struck Northern El Dorado, Kansas, damaging or destroying numerous brand new homes, including some that were leveled and completely swept away, leaving only a bare slab. A total of 15 people were killed and five others were injured. An F2 tornado also caused heavy damage in the Northwestern St. Louis suburb of O'Fallon, Missouri. July There were 121 confirmed tornadoes in the US in July. =July 1= A deadly F1 tornado struck Leander Lake, Minnesota, killing one and injuring two. Five other tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Nebraska, including an F2 tornado that hit Lodgepole and Western Sedgwick, Nebraska. =July 10–11= A damaging outbreak of 22 tornadoes struck the Great Plains, Great Lakes, and New England.

Back in Chile, she returned to the PUC, and in 2006 she became a member of the Children's Council created by President Michelle Bachelet in her first government. In that role, Molina joined the Ministry of Health, where she served as head of the Division of Health Policies and Promotion in the Undersecretariat of Public Health from 2006 to 2010, and from 2008 to 2010 she was executive secretary of , a public policy initiative for child protection. From 2005 to 2008 she was a member of the Knowledge Network on Child Development, within the framework of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Political career Molina (left) with Michelle Bachelet and Claudia Pascual =Minister of Public Health= In January 2014, Molina was appointed Minister of Public Health by the then President-elect, Michelle Bachelet, for her second government. She assumed the Health portfolio on 11 March 2014. On 30 December 2014, in an interview given to the evening paper La Segunda, she said that \\"in all ' [private, in pejorative terms] clinics, many conservative families have gotten their daughters abortions,\\" pointing out a double standard where access to abortions was available to rich citizens but prohibited for the poor. This sparked a controversy, which led the government to issue a communiqué stating that the minister's statements were strictly personal. On the same day, Molina presented her resignation from office, which was accepted by the president. =2016 mayoral candidacy= During May 2016, Helia Molina entered the municipal primaries for mayor of Ñuñoa for the New Majority.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Events 1957 was the most active tornado season on record at the time as multiple tornado outbreak repeatedly hit the same areas. Texas was especially hard hit throughout the year. April and May both saw a record- breaking 200+ tornadoes with numerous outbreaks throughout the months. =United States yearly total=January There were 17 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. =January 21–22= A tornado outbreak sequence of 16 tornadoes struck the US. The outbreak started on January 21, when a rare and destructive F1 tornado moved through areas north of Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. The next day, a large, long-tracked .25 mile wide F2 tornado moved through St. Louis, Wewoka, Wetumka, Weleetka, Henryetta, and Schulter, Oklahoma causing major damage along its 63.7 mile path. Later, a brief, but large, violent .5 mile-wide F4 tornado tore through the northeast side of Gans, Oklahoma, killing 10 and injuring 20. Another .5 mile-wide F2 tornado then tore through areas north of Bismarck, Arkansas. After that, an F3 tornado tore through areas northeast of Princeton, Louisiana in east-northeastern suburbs of Shreveport killing three and injuring nine. An F1 tornado then hit Kennett, Missouri, injuring one. The last tornado to cause casualties was an F2 tornado then tore through areas just south of Downtown Nashville, hitting the suburban town of Belle Meade, Tennessee near the beginning of its path, injuring four. Overall, the outbreak killed 13 and injured 31. February There were 5 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. March There were 38 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. =March 17= An outbreak of eight tornadoes hit the Southeastern Greater Houston and Beaumont-Port Arthur metropolitan area.

A large, 1000 yard wide F1 tornado struck areas northeast of Laplace. Another F1 tornado injured three in Boothville-Venice. In Alabama, an F1 tornado moved off of Mobile Bay and into the Eastern Mobile and Spanish Fort, injuring four. The next day, a brief, isolated, but strong F2 tornado hit the south side of Medon, Tennessee. In the end, a total of nine people were injured as a result of these tornadoes. April There were 216 tornadoes confirmed in the US in April. This was the first time that over 200 tornadoes were confirmed in a single month in the US. =April 2–5= Yet another tornado outbreak hit Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee. However, this time it was part of a violent, destructive, and deadly outbreak sequence of 72 tornadoes that struck a large portion of the Midwest and the Southeast. On April 2, the first major tornado of the outbreak occurred in rural Grayson County, Texas, where a brief, but strong F2 tornado injured two. Later, an F3 tornado hit the west side of Melissa and Van Alstyne injuring four. This was followed by a well- documented multi-vortex F3 tornado that hit the north side of Dallas. The tornado was highly visible and hundreds of photos and videos were taken of it, allowing meteorologists to get a first-hand look at the characteristics of tornado like they had never seen before, making it one of the most studied tornadoes ever at the time. Unfortunately, it came at a heavy price; 10 people were killed, 200 were injured, and damages were estimated at $4 million. The 1957 Dallas tornado with multiple vortices observed at the time as it approached the city Tornado activity continued into Oklahoma. A large, 600 yard wide F2 tornado killed one and injured two in rural Murray County. A violent F4 tornado then hit Lake Texoma State Park east of Kingston and south of Cumberland, killing two and injuring six. Another violent F4 tornado then tore directly through Calera and Durant, killing three and injuring three. Back in Texas, a F3 tornado injured one in rural Wise County and a brief, but fatal F2 tornado killed one and injured two west of Roxton. Tornado activity continued into April 3. An F3 tornado hit Bono, Arkansas early that afternoon. Later, an F2 tornado hit Future City, Urbandale, and Golden Lily, Illinois, injuring five. An F1 tornado also injured four in rural Washington County, Mississippi. April 4 saw fewer, but a return of deadly, tornado activity. Just after midnight back in Mississippi, a long-tracked F2 tornado hit Brooksville and Deerbrook, injuring four on its 40.7 mile path. This was followed by an even stronger F3 tornado that tore a path of destruction 40.2 miles long, hitting the towns of Magee and Montrose, killing one and injuring 75. Later, another F3 tornado hit Eastview, Tennessee, injuring 11. April 5 saw a final day of weaker, but still deadly, tornado activity mainly during the early morning hours. A large, long-tracked F2 tornado hit Ellaville, Ideal, Garden Valley, Fort Valley, Powersville, Byron, Antebellum North, Northwestern Warner Robins, Avondale, Huber, Far Southeastern Macon, Southern Dry Branch, and Southern Gordon, Georgia, killing two and injuring five along its 75-mile path. This was the fourth destructive tornado to hit this region during the 1950s with two of them occurring in 1953 while the other was in 1954. Later, another F2 tornado moved through the Southeastern Summit, Gilbert, and Northwestern Lexington, South Carolina, injuring two. A brief F1 tornado injured one in rural Ware County, Georgia. North of East Stone Gap, Virginia in Northeastern Big Stone Gap, three people were injured by another brief F1 tornado. Another brief, but strong F2 tornado injured one southeast of Middletown, Indiana. The final tornado of the outbreak was an F1 storm that injured one southeast of Horneytown, North Carolina north of High Point. In the end, the outbreak killed 21 and injured 338. However, the Dallas tornado led to revolutionary changes in the radar system and the engineering of structures to withstand the high winds of tornadoes. At the time, winds in the strongest tornadoes were estimated to be up to 700+ mph. The footage of the Dallas tornado, as well as wind engineering, not only disproved this, but also helped to formulate more accurate wind speeds in tornadoes. This eventually led to the creation of the Fujita Scale to rate tornadoes. =April 7–8= Another violent outbreak of 19 tornadoes struck the Southeast and Nebraska. It started on April 7, when an F2 tornado tore through Northwestern Waldron, Arkansas. The next morning in Alabama, a long-tracked F3 tornado hit Hamilton, Southern Haleyville, Ashridge, Grayson, and Southwestern Andrews Chapel, although there were no casualties along the 51.4 mile path.

In the end, the violent outbreak caused 14 fatalities and 199 injuries. =November 16–19= Another large outbreak of 32 tornadoes struck the Southeastern United States before moving into the Northeast. It started early on November 16, when an isolated but strong F3 tornado injured one in rural Sabine Parish, Louisiana. The next day, five tornadoes touched down, almost all of which were significant. An F2 tornado caused severe damage in Brooksville, Mississippi, killing two and injuring two. This came just under five months after Hurricane Audrey produced an F3 tornado that killed one and injured 10 in the same area. Later, a violent F4 tornado, which moved in an odd west-northwest direction, tore through areas north of Manchester, Alabama, killing four and injuring 15. An F1 tornado then injured three in rural Cullman County, Alabama before an F2 tornado hit Southern Fort Worth, injuring two.

Another F2 tornado then injured two on the southeast sides of Errata and Sandersville that afternoon. Later, an F3 tornado caused severe damage in De Soto. In Alabama, an F1 tornado struck the towns of Forkland, Sawyerville, and Havana, injuring five. Another F1 tornado injured one in rural Cullman County. Tornadic activity became more severe and deadly into the evening hours. An F2 tornado slammed through Pickwick, Cheraw, Natcole, and Columbia, injuring two. A disastrous F2 tornado then hit the Northeastern Birmingham suburbs of Fultondale and Southern Center Point, Alabama, killing one and injuring 35. Another F2 tornado injured two in rural Fentress County, Tennessee. Later, a violent F4 tornado tore through Susan Moore, Snead, Douglas, Horton, and Albertville, Alabama, killing three and injuring 12. The next day, which would be the final day of the outbreak, featured three tornadoes in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The strongest one was an F2 tornado that hit Palmyra, Pennsylvania. In all, nine states were impacted during this outbreak. A total of 10 people were killed and 84 others were injured. =November 20= Just a day after the previous outbreak ended, an isolated, but strong F3 tornado tore through Highland Park, Michigan north of Detroit, killing one and injuring 12. December There were 38 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December. =December 18–20= The final 37 tornadoes of the year came in an unusually intense December outbreak sequence in the Midwest and South with Missouri and Illinois bearing the brunt of the destruction. It started in Missouri on December 18, when an F1 tornado injured one in Truxton. This was followed by fatal F2 tornado that killed one and injured another northeast of Knob Lick. Later, in Illinois, three straight tornadoes, an F2 storm on the north side of the Northeastern St. Louis suburb of Roxanne, a brief F1 twister in Mason City, and an F3 tornado in rural Perry County, each injured one. Tornado activity became much more violent going into the mid-afternoon hours. Following the previous Illinois F3 tornado, an F2 tornado moved through areas north of Boyd before striking Southern Dix, injuring two. A violent F4 tornado then tore directly through Mt. Vernon as well as Camp Ground, killing one and injuring 45. Later, an extremely violent F5 tornado obliterated Sunfield, killing one and injuring six. The damage was so severe that the town essentially vanished and was later rebuilt south of its original location. Next, a violent and deadly F4 tornado struck Gorham, Southeastern Sand Ridge, Murphyboro, De Soto, Hurst, Bush and Southwestern Plumfield, killing 11 and injuring 200. The path of this tornado was eerily similar to the 1925 Tri-State Tornado. Strong tornadoes continued to wreak havoc in the two states going into the evening hours. At the same time the F4 tornado was down, a large, 700 yard wide F2 tornado tore through Millersville and Pocahontas, Missouri, injuring one. An F3 tornado then moved through rural Wayne and Clay Counties before striking Southern Clay City, Illinois, injuring one. Later, a destructive, F2 tornado killed three and injured one in Chaffee, Missouri. Another F2 tornado then tore through Carbondale, Illinois, injuring five.

Tornado activity continued into December 19, with 10 more tornadoes touching down. A violent F4 tornado tore through Northwestern McNeil and Spring Hill, Arkansas, killing two and injuring nine. A brief but destructive F1 tornado injured two in Milan, Tennessee. The final tornado of the day, as well as the last one to cause casualties, was another brief but strong F2 tornado that injured seven in Littleville, Alabama just before midnight. Two additional weak F1 tornadoes touched down in Alabama during the early morning hours of December 20 before the outbreak sequence came to an end. In the end, five states were impacted by tornadoes, with 28 of them occurring in Missouri and Illinois alone. A total of 19 people were killed and 291 others were injured as a result of this outbreak.

It is located between lanes of the Francisco Fajardo freeway next to the University City campus of the Central University of Venezuela, in Caracas. The original, which is currently located in a university warehouse, was created by Alejandro Colina in 1951 to sit outside the stadium for that year's Bolivarian Games. In its place on the highway is a cast made by Silvestre Chacón in 2004; the replacement has received negative reactions, and its construction damaged the original. Colina often depicted indigenous figures like María Lionza, and it is said to be his most famous sculpture. In the statue, the goddess is shown nude, which is unusual for representations of her. Nevertheless, the statue, and versions of it, are worshiped by her followers. Background An altar to María Lionza; she is depicted centrally as a mestizo queen. The statue is of Venezuelan goddess María Lionza, a cult figure and nature goddess from Yaracuy; the artist, Alejandro Colina, made many sculptures based on indigenous folklore. In the 1920s he spent eight years living in some of western Venezuela's indigenous communities, and later chose to depict related iconography in his monumental sculptures. According to Venezuelan folklorist Gilberto Antolínez, in the 1940s Colina was also involved in a movement to mythologize María Lionza. Antolínez recalled: \\"In 1939 we created a social movement aimed at extolling the ancestral values of Venezuela. I myself, the sculptor Alejandro Colina, and the architect Hermes Romero joined together in a group [...] We organized a series of conferences and popularizing events and [...] used such occasions to 'mythologize' María Lionza, both in her legend and in the sculpture that nowadays stands on the main Caracas highway\\". Social anthropologist Roger Canals, who directed the 2016 film A goddess in motion: María Lionza in Barcelona, noted that in the religious cult of María Lionza, idols were not traditionally used, with most worship occurring in natural spots up to the early 20th century. María Lionza's followers grew in number the 1950s, and so depictions of her increased. Though the depictions of her in rituals and on altars vary, the most common are either that of her face, showing a fair-skinned mestizo queen, or an image based on Colina's statue, depicting an indigenous Venezuelan. Construction and locationOlympic Stadium= The newly-completed Olympic Stadium at the outset of the 1951 Bolivarian Games. The monumental statue was originally made to sit outside the Central University of Venezuela (UCV)'s Olympic Stadium for the 1951 Bolivarian Games; during the Bolivarian Games, the Olympic flame was held in the pelvis at the top of the statue. There is another monumental statue, Francisco Narváez' El Atleta, that is also located by the Olympic Stadium and was made in 1951. Unlike the other works of art at the university, which were part of the modernist Synthesis of the Arts movement under the design of architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva, the statue of María Lionza was commissioned by the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, who wanted to make her a symbol of Venezuela. =Francisco Fajardo freeway= The replica alongside the highway in 2012. In the years after the Bolivarian Games, with the expansion of the city, the road system was made larger and the new Francisco Fajardo freeway passed closely around the campus near the stadium. In 1953 the statue was moved a short distance to its prominent location on the highway. The university had been asking for it to be removed, aware of the growing cult status of María Lionza and fearing that rituals would begin to be performed by her followers on campus grounds. Pérez Jiménez shared the concern: though he had elevated her to a national symbol, his dictatorship followed the Catholic Church and heavily persecuted other belief systems under a law enacted against paganism. As he did not want the symbol of María Lionza to become an icon of a religious cult, he ordered the statue to be moved to what was believed to be an inaccessible and dangerous location, between lanes in the center divide of the busy highway. The Guardian reported in 2019 that while the Catholic Church of Venezuela still disapproves of the indigenous religion, it \\"has long since abandoned its attempts to suppress it\\". Though located just outside of the university, the statue is generally seen as part of the campus environs. It is under the authority of the university, and is protected as part of the campus World Heritage Site. Appearance Front detail in 2007 The statue depicts the indigenous Venezuelan fertility goddess María Lionza nude and holding a woman's pelvis in both hands high above her head while riding astride a tapir that stands on a snake. The faux stone statue stands at 5.9 × 1.2 × 3.74 metres (19' 4.25\\" × 3' 11.25\\" × 12' 3.25\\"), excluding the pedestal. Followers of María Lionza believe that Colina did not artistically create the image of the goddess on the tapir for the statue, but that he \\"had a vision\\" of her in this position and, \\"during the vision, the goddess gave him the mission of creating a statue reproducing her appearance\\". The Chicana/o studies professor and ethnologist Maria Herrera-Sobek explains that the statue draws on the 'Yara' identity of the goddess (who is known by different names with different stories), representing fertility. Discussing the iconography of the statue, she wrote that the depiction in nude and riding the tapir \\"represents female strength and courage, the essence of a woman warrior\\". Canals wrote that other depictions of María Lionza, those used in public rituals and often made from mannequins, are typically fully clothed and are given much make-up and careful hair styling. He said that these clothed depictions are designed to emphasize María Lionza's sexuality and make her look like a fairy tale princess, contrasting them with Colina's statue. According to him, the statue is more sensual and erotic than the depictions of María Lionza as the mestizo queen, due to the nudity, and deliberately contrasts the feminine María Lionza with the masculine represented by the tapir, but still shows \\"a woman with a serious face, an athletic body with powerful legs and strong arms\\". Replacement The work is protected by the university's artwork commission for the University City of Caracas campus World Heritage Site. In 2004, a replica was commissioned by the council of the City of Caracas so that the original statue could be protected. The replica was made by Silvestre Chacón. However, during the process of casting the replica, the original was significantly damaged; it has since been repaired by restorer Fernando de Tovar, who described the replica as \\"ridiculous\\". Despite the repair and calls to put the original back on display, it is still kept locked in a workshop at UCV. The Institutional Assets and Monuments of Venezuela project wrote that objections to the replacement suggest that because the original statue is the one that holds heritage value, it is the one that the public should be able to appreciate. Followers of María Lionza also debate the benefits of returning the statue to its original location on the campus; some members of the university and the government would instead like to move the statue further away from the city center. Another replica was installed at Chivacoa, near Sorte mountain, a spiritual home of the religion, in 2006. Legacy The statue in 2003, decorated with tributes. The statue quickly became an icon of Caracas, impressing both the elite of the city and its artistic circles, as well as María Lionza's followers. The followers began leaving tributes at the statue in the 1960s, and many copies are made in miniature to be placed on altars. Even as a replica, it is still given many tributes: in 2012, Herrera-Sobek wrote that \\"no day passes without lit candles and flowers appearing at the bottom of the sculpture\\", though it is dangerous to place them there due to the busy highway. In discussion of the miniature replicas created by María Lionza's followers, Canals said that these idols are less detailed but also more erotic, which he explained is part of a process of goddess sexualization (done by exaggerating typically feminine features) seen in many religious cults. Clothes are also put on them in some instances out of respect for the divine, though Canals writes that this explicitly acknowledges the sexual nature by shrouding it. In popular culture, the statue has been the inspiration for works of literature. In the 1990s, the statue was used as the cover for a series of poetry collections called The Goddess, with each edition containing a dedication to María Lionza and \\"her metaphor – a queen, naked, exuberant, who roams the countryside mounted on a tapir\\". The statue also forms a major symbolic plot point in the 2009 Margaret Mascarenhas novel The Disappearance of Irene Dos Santos. In 2001, it was the inspiration for distinguished poet 's poem \\"The pelvic bone\\"; in the poem, the narrator travels into Caracas for a protest and sees the statue. The image of the pelvis – its \\"most notable feature\\" – stays in the narrator's mind, and the poem goes on to address the statue directly. In their book, Venezuela experts David Smilde and Daniel Hellinger write that, in Pantin's poem, the statue is seen to represent María Lionza as the mother of the nation, and the pelvis represents its symbolic birth. They also note that the narrator is a non- believer in terms of María Lionza, but is still drawn in by the statue and refers to it with familiarity, as well as speaking collectively, suggesting that all Venezuelans see her as their goddess and a symbol of hope in a broken nation. This imagery is reiterated later in the poem with a ray of light shining through the pelvis onto the protesters.

Biography  Yves Ramousse was ordained a priest on April 4, 1953 for the Foreign Missions of Paris and sent for the mission to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Appointed vicar apostolic of Phnom Penh in Cambodia on November 12, 1962 with the title of bishop in partibus of Pisita, he was consecrated on February 24, 1963 by his predecessor, at the age of 35 making him the youngest bishop in the world at that time. He participated in Sessions 2, 3 and 4 of Vatican Council II, of which he was one of the youngest participants. = Khmer genocide = As the political situation decayed in Cambodia, Ramousse tried his best to promote initiatives of peace and reconciliation in line with the encyclical Pacem in Terris of Pope John XXIII and initiatives of Pope Paul VI in the wake of the Cold War. However, he was accused of being incapable of making any decisions, though the aftermath shows how complicated the situation actually was. Following the Cambodian civil war, he resigned from his duties on April 30, 1976 in favor of a Khmer priest Joseph Chhmar Salas whom he secretly ordained bishop in Phnom Penh shortly before the expulsion of Western nationals by the Khmer Rouge. Salas, who was the first native Khmer bishop, would shortly after die a martyr in the killing fields of Pol Pot. With many others after the Khmer Rouges had entered Phnom Penh, Ramousse was locked up at the Frech Embassy for 12 days before being expelled from Cambodia along with all foreign nationals. He took refuge in Indonesia and obtained on January 6, 1983 from the Congregation for the evangelization of peoples the creation of an Office for the promotion of the apostolate among the Khmer people of which he became the first director.  Later years  On February 21, 1992, Yves Ramousse was granted an audience by King Sihanouk in which he was encouraged to develop the work of the Catholic Church in Cambodia. He was again appointed vicar apostolic of Phnom-Penh on July 6, 1992 by Pope John Paul II following the appeasement of the conflict and the return of some missionary priests to Cambodia in 1990. He also assumed the mission of apostolic administrator of the Battambang Apostolic Prefecture, until the appointment of Archbishop Enrique Figaredo Alvargonzález on April 1, 2000. He led the Church of Cambodia through its resurrection, after years of persecution, but many considered him tired and used out by his many trials. His missionary efforts in favour of the Church and the people of Cambodia were acknowledged by Pope John Paul II during his ad limina visit in Rome on February 11, 1999. = Resignation and retirement = He resigned for reasons of age on April 14, 2001, giving way to another French bishop of the Foreign Missions of Paris, Emile Destombes, his coadjutor since 1997. He is retired to France, living at the retirement home of the Paris Foreign Missions Society in Montbeton.

They are usually printed on small leaflets, and often involve advice from individuals or authorities. In contrast to Fatwa, Tafsir, or Fiqh, Nasîhat and advice literature can come from secular, non-Ulama (scholars) too. Unlike Fiqh, Tafsir, Fatwa, or Nasîhat based on them, advice can go beyond religious scriptural realm or even seen to take support of otherwise not easily admissible Hadith or religious rulings in order to make normative pleas. According to Gudrun Krämer, individuals in Muslim societies may urge religious and moral advice, and individuals may be passionate in providing their advice on far-reaching topics. These topics may be mundane — for example, whether or not it is okay to wear a wig according to the norms of their community. Hence, according to Marzieh Bashirpour, social behavior of Muslims is deeply influenced by advice literature.  Means of providing advice  Means of providing Islamic advice includes traditional as well as modern technologies. In Egypt, Al-Azhar University did set up 'advice / fatwa kiosks' at subway stations. In 2000 Al-Azhar University introduced a phone-in advice service called \\"Dial-a-Sheikh\\"  Islamizing the Islamic State  According to Luke Yarbrough, early Islamic state (Caliphates) heavily depended on non-Arabs, frequently non-Muslim civil, officials specially by the late Umayyad and early 'Abbasid states. The situation started to change in the 8th century as Muslims began to compete for social and economic benefits by using religious leverage. By the 9th century, Islamic jurists began to oppose employment of non-Muslims with little influence but major formal shift started coming by the 12th century, when independent advice literature campaigned for dismissal of non-Muslim civil officials. Jennifer A. London looks at then scholarly import and presentations of medieval fables as part of advice literature which spoke about political thoughts through characters employed in those literature as mirror for princes. According to Sami Helewa, prophetic anecdotes about Joseph, David and Soloman called \\"'Qisas' al-anbiya\\" by 9th century AD Persian Islamic scholar Al-Tabari and subsequently 11th century AD scholar Al-Tha'labi served as advice literature to medieval Islamic rulers.Thesis Title:Title: The advisory function of the Tales of the Prophets (Qiṣaṣal-anbiyāʾ) The University of Edinburgh March, 2012; Retrieved 2020 May 27 Helewa Sami S.J.'s] A 10th-century anonymous Arabic manuscript is seen giving advice to rulers through the rhymes like \\"an: yasüsu I- 'âmmata bi- siyâsati l-qur'ân, wal- khàssa bi-siyàsati l-zamán\\". (Translation: (Ruler/administrator) must rule over the general public; ['ámma] according to the policy of the Qur'an and over the elite [khâssa] according to the policy [suitable at the given] time') with a religious undertone. At times, advice goes beyond religious and suggests administrative policies through rhymes like \\"ba: ya'taqilu gundahu bil-raghba, là bil-rahba\\" (translation: \\"The ruler must bind the army to him through [exciting] their desires, not through [playing on] their fear\\"). Karakhanid writer Yusuf Balasaghuni wrote Islamic advice literature in Kutadgu Bilig (The Wisdom of Felicity), the only known literary work written in Turkic from the Karakhanid period. Ebrahim Moosa and Nicholas Roberts, in \\"Expressions of Political Quietism in Islamic History\\" in Political Quietism in Islam: Sunni and Shi’i Practice and Thought (Saud al- Sarhan, ed.), state that in medieval times, despite the backdrop of power of Muslim empire in which political quietism became a virtue of ideal citizens, the genre of Nasîhat and advice literature started thriving. According to Moosa and Roberts, the goal of advice literature then in those times was to help preserve political authority as part of pragmatic quiet activity. al- Sarhan further states that while Siyasat nama by Nizam al-Mulk (1092 AD), Nasihat al-Muluk by al-Ghazali (1111 AD), al-siyasa al-shar'iyya by ibn Taymiyya while epitomizing political activism on one hand very much gave into the divinely sanctioned absolutism of the caliphs on other hand. Strategy through advice literature was subtle expression of political activism calling for equitable and sound governance within four corners of religious diktats while continuation of pragmatic obedience to authority in power. But to quote suitable advice literature explores from beyond religion, for example one political theorist of 11th century al-Mawardi attributes a pre-Islamic 6th- century quote of al-Afwah al-Awdi: \\"There is no benefit in leaderless people when disorder reigns, and they will never have a leader if the ignorant amongst them leads.\\" Moosa and Roberts say that first half of quote conforms to political quietism as labeled by modern scholars same time second half matches with expectations of obedient religious Muslim citizen of a just and sharia compliant rule. Giving example of Zoroastrianism becoming invisible post-8th century AD from Persian literature, Ali Pirzadeh says that Islamic literature and Islamic advice literature wipes out most traces of local culture and heritage by giving exclusive prominence to Arabic narratives. Ali Pirzadeh further says that Iranian empire encouraged advice literature to hide their incompetence caused due to hereditary succession and to retain servitude of vested interests. = Social Islamization = In early and medieval centuries Sufi literature including their advice literature played a substantial role in spreading Sufi Islamic values among Muslim masses. In early Turkish classical advice literature Yunus Emre a (probable) 13th century poet's Risâletü'n-Nushiyye, Feridüddin Attar's Pend-nâme, Sa'dî's Bostan and Gulistan, and Mesnevi of Mevlana, Ahmed Fakih's Çarh-nâme (794–798) played substantial role among Turkish Muslim culture and masses. According to Agnès Nilüfer Kefeli borders between high and popular Islam are often blur; since Arabic was not easily accessible to commoners folk tales were used as popular method of instructions of Islam that included sufi books. = Persecution of dissent = Medieval monarchs and caliphs could persecute most kind of dissent which did not suit them: ibn Taymiyya was jailed six times in the early 14th century when he wandered from then a popular saying \\"Sixty years of unjust ruler are better than one night without a ruler\\".  Gender  Ashraf Ali Thanwi's Bihishti Zevar, published in 1905, influenced the continuation of traditional patriarchal gendered role narratives among south Asian Muslims. Marzieh Bashirpour theorizes that Urdu advice literature's emphasis on adab politeness in interaction molded class differentiation between the literate and non illiterate and thereby validated discrimination toward the lower classes. Late 19th century and early 20th century revival reformists promoted women's education, but their advice literature centered on making women better mothers equipped for better household management.

The first fatal tornado then occurred in rural Sabine Parish, Louisiana, where an F2 tornado killed one and injured six. Later a long- tracked F4 tornado, the first violent tornado of the outbreak, touched down north of Cedar Rapids, Iowa and proceeded through four mostly rural counties in Iowa with no casualties. May 1, was the most violent and the deadliest day as a tornado outbreak struck Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The tornado activity began with a violent, long-tracked .25-mile wide F4 tornado that traveled 68.6 miles through Vernon, Texas and Manitou, Oklahoma, injuring two.

It has flaky bark, crowded, lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, relatively large white flowers and fruit that remain on the plant when mature. It grows on river banks in rainforest. Description Leptospermum riparium is a straggly shrub that typically grows to a height of or more and has flaky bark. The leaves are mostly glabrous, lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, usually long, wide, the base tapering to a thin petiole. The flowers are white, wide and arranged on the ends of leafy side branches. There are reddish-brown bracts and bracteoles at the base of the flower buds but that usually fall off before the flower opens. The floral cup is about long with triangular sepals about long. The petals are long and the stamens about long. Flowering mainly occurs in January and the fruit is a capsule wide with the remains of the sepals attached and that remains on the plant at maturity. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum riparium was first formally described in 1974 by Tasmanian botanist Dennis Ivor Morris in Records of the Queen Victoria Museum, based on specimens he collected near the bridge over the Huon River in the Tahune Forest Park. The specific epithet (riparium) is from a Latin word meaning \\"inhabiting river banks\\".

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. This was the first year to record an F5 tornado in the US. Events Despite not many tornadoes being documented, 1953 was an extremely deadly season. The first six months of the year generated several large outbreaks and outbreak sequences that killed over 400 people. Activity abruptly slowed after that before another outbreak sequence in December killed 49. Many of fatalities were caused by the unusually large number of violent tornadoes that were recorded that year. This included five F5 tornadoes, the first F5 tornadoes recorded in the US tornado database created in 1950. In all, there were 523 tornado-related fatalities in the US alone in 1953, the most since 1925. This high a death toll would not be repeated until 2011. There were 5,131 injuries recorded throughout the year as well. 1953 is also the only year since 1950 to have three tornadoes kill over 90 people and to have two tornadoes kill over 110. On a positive note, major changes were made to improve both the warning and radar systems. These changes were successful and since 1953, only one tornado, the 2011 Joplin tornado, has killed more than 100 people. =United States yearly total=January There were 14 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January.

On March 21, a large F3 tornado moved through Bancroft, Iowa, although there were no casualties. This was not the case in Minnesota, where a brief but strong F2 tornado killed one and injured three east-northeast of St. Cloud. The next day, an extremely long-tracked F2 tornado traveled 234.7 miles through Louisiana and Mississippi (although this was more than likely a tornado family rather than just a single tornado).

May There were 94 tornadoes confirmed in the US in May. =May 9–11= Path of the Waco tornado A violent outbreak of at least 33 tornadoes struck the Great Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley in Early- May just a week after the previous outbreak ended. On May 9, a large, long- tracked, .5 mile wide F3 tornado hit Milligan, Friend, and Milford, Nebraska, killing five and injuring 82. May 10 saw three F4 tornadoes strike Iowa. The third F4 twister ended up being an extremely long-tracked tornado family that moved through Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin on a path. It struck the towns of Chester, Iowa, Wykoff, Dover, St. Charles, Crystal Spring and Minneiska, Minnesota, and Cochrane, Waumandee, Lookout, Strum, Foster, Ludington, Edson, Stanley, Brownsville, and Gilman, Taylor County, Wisconsin. This family consisted of at least five tornadoes, killing two and injuring 24. Tornado activity on May 11 began with a .5 mile wide F4 tornado striking areas between Grape Creek and San Angelo, Texas, killing 13 and injuring 159. Later that day, the first officially rated F5 tornado in US history obliterated Downtown Waco, destroying or collapsing many of the structures and tossing numerous vehicles. 114 were killed and 597 were injured, making it the deadliest tornado in Texas history. Overall, the outbreak killed 144 and injured 895.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/outbreaks/the-waco-tornado- outbreak-1953 =May 16–19= Widely scattered tornadoes struck numerous areas across the US. On May 16, an F3 tornado struck Cooper, Texas, killing one and injuring eight. This tornado was unusual because it moved in west-northwest direction. On May 17, a long-tracked F3 tornado moved through Rayville, Epps, and Wilman, Louisiana, injuring 17. On May 19, another rare F2 tornado struck California. It moved through northeast side of Orland, although there were no casualties. Overall, the 17 tornadoes during the period killed one and injured 30. =May 20–21 (United States and Canada)= Aftermath Three intense tornadoes struck Iowa, Michigan, and Ontario over the course of two days. On May 20, two long-tracked F3 tornadoes struck Iowa, killing one and injuring seven. The next day, a violent long-tracked F4 tornado struck the cities of Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario, killing seven and injured over 68. At least nine more tornadoes were reported in Ontario, but none were confirmed. Overall, the outbreak killed eight and injured 75. =May 29= An outbreak of nine tornadoes struck the Great Plains.

June There were 110 tornadoes confirmed in the US in June. =June 7–9= Just under one month after the deadly Waco outbreak, an even deadlier tornado outbreak sequence struck the Great Plains, Great Lakes, and even New England in Early-June. It started on June 7, when a tornado outbreak spawned 34 tornadoes across the Great Plains. The strongest and only fatal tornado of the day was a wide F4 tornado that struck areas near Arcadia, Nebraska. It injured no one, but killed 11, including an entire family of 10 at a swept away farm. In Iowa, a wide F2 tornado traveled , destroying several barns, but causing no casualties. In all, tornadoes on June 7 killed 11 and injured 19. An F4 tornado near Erie, Michigan. Photo courtesy of NOAA. June 8 had way fewer tornadoes than the previous day, but the nine tornadoes that hit Michigan and Ohio that day were way stronger and deadlier. The first fatal tornado of the day was an F4 tornado that struck Temperance, Michigan before moving through areas south of Erie, killing four and injuring 17\\\\. The only Ohio tornado of the day then touched down and became a long-tracked F4 tornado family (which may have reached F5 intensity in Cygnet, Jerry City, or both) that struck the cities of Fremont, Sandusky, Elyria, and even Western Cleveland, causing catastrophic damage, killing 17, and injuring 379 on its path. Back in Michigan, an F3 tornado killed one and injured five between Sharon Hollow and Ann Arbor. At the same time, another F3 tornado struck Highland Charter Township, injuring 11\\\\. A massive, wide F2 tornado then hit the north side of Oscoda, killing four and injuring 13\\\\. An F3 tornado then touched down and caused considerable damage on the south side of Spruce, although it was the only significant (F2+) tornado of the day to not cause casualties. The strongest and deadliest tornado then touched down and struck the northern suburbs of Flint, Michigan in the community of Beecher at F5 intensity with little to no warning. The large wide tornado obliterated and swept away many homes and a staggering 113 people lost their lives in the town alone. The tornado killed a total of 116 people and injured 844 othrtd. After that tornado lifted, the same cell produced the final tornado of the day. The large, long tracked, wide F4 tornado carved a path of destruction through rural Lapeer and St. Clair Counties, injuring 23, thus becoming the only violent tornado of the outbreak sequence to not cause any fatalities. In all, 12 tornadoes touched down on June 8, killing 142 people and injuring 1,293 others. Damage in Beecher, Michigan June 9 produced a small, but unusually intense outbreak of four tornadoes in New England. Despite knowing that there was the possibility of tornadoes that day, the National Weather Service in Boston had only issued a Severe Thunderstorm Watch, fearing that the mention of a tornado threat would cause widespread panic.June 7-9, 1953 — The Flint – Worcester Outbreak This proved to be a fatal mistake when a violent, wide F4 tornado struck Worcester, Massachusetts with no warning. The hardest hit area was Assumption College (building is now the Quinsigamond Community College), and its surrounding neighborhoods, where 42 people were killed. The college building was reduced by three floors and numerous homes were obliterated, leaving some to speculate that the tornado reached F5 intensity in this area. A tornado warning was not issued until the tornado was lifting 80 minutes after it had touched down. By then, 94 people were dead and 1,228 others were injured. In the end, the tornadoes of June 9 in New Hampshire and Massachusetts killed 94 and injured 1,250. Overall, at least 50 tornadoes touched down, including six violent tornadoes. The outbreak injured 2,562 people while killing 247, accounting for a little over 47% of the fatalities from 1953 alone. Many revolutionary changes were made to improve both the warning and radar systems as a result of this outbreak.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/outbreaks/the-flint-worcester- tornado-outbreak-1953 =June 27= A small, but damaging outbreak of five tornadoes struck Iowa and North Dakota. The worst tornado was a brief, but violent wide F5 tornado that destroyed four farms east of Anita, Iowa, with virtually nothing left at one of them. Heavy machinery was thrown hundreds of feet, and boards were driven into trees. One person was killed and two others were injured. The tornado track was only , the shortest track of any F5/EF5 tornado in the US since 1950. As a whole, the outbreak killed one and injured five.

December There were 21 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December. =December 1–6= 1953 Vicksburg Tornado Memorial Plaque. Although usually a quiet month, the first six days of the December were extremely destructive and deadly as a series of single damaging tornado days and small outbreaks combined into a tornado outbreak sequence of 19 tornadoes across the South. On December 2, a brief, but strong F2 tornado killed two and injured five west of Navasota, Texas. The next day, a wide, violent F4 tornado tracked through four Parishes in Louisiana. Passing northwest of Alexandria, the tornado killed nine and injured 50. The worst day of the outbreak sequence occurred on December 5, when four strong to violent tornadoes struck the Lower Mississippi Valley. The strongest and deadliest tornado was a wide violent F5 tornado that struck Vicksburg, Mississippi. Many buildings were leveled, although most were frail in nature, causing some experts to rate this as an F4 tornado. Regardless, 38 people were killed and 270 others were injured along the path of destruction. In fact, tornadoes on this day killed 38 and injured 292 people alone. In the end, the outbreak sequence killed 49 and injured 404.

Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Events Although fewer tornadoes were confirmed than the previous year, 1952 had an exceptionally high number of F4 tornadoes. There was 18 tornadoes that had this rating, mostly due to an unusually intense Mid- March that produced 11 of them along with 11 F3 tornadoes. This outbreak is also what drove the death toll to well over 200 that year. Despite this, no tornadoes were rated F5, leaving the US without an official F5 tornado until the next year. =United States yearly total=January There were 12 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January.

The towns of Linwood and Edwardville were particulary hard hit, as dozens of homes were destroyed, including the home of a bank president that was leveled. Tornado researcher Thomas P. Grazulis indicated that there the tornado, which injured three people, may have reached F5 intensity as well. An F2 tornado then struck Lake Lotawana near Lee's Summit and Lone Jack, Missouri southeast of Kansas City, Missouri, injuring another person.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. This was the first year where tornadoes were documented by the U.S. Weather Bureau, which would later become the National Weather Service. It was the least active tornado season ever recorded. However, tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. In subsequent years, the documentation of tornadoes became much more widespread and efficient, with the average annual tornado count being around 1,253. Events A major milestone in weather history, 1950 marks the first public tornado warning and use of radar to track storms. With this, tornado records began to be kept and a database was started. However, tornadoes were not given ratings until the Fujita scale came into effect in 1973. 1950 had an early and violent start to the year with the first tornadoes touching down on January 3\\\\. Two F3 tornadoes and one F1 tornado touching down. One of the F3 tornadoes struck the northern suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri and caused almost $3 million in damage. The first killer tornado of 1950 was a lone F3 tornado on January 13 which struck Polk County, Arkansas killing one and injuring another. A rare F2 tornado also touched down in Northeastern Illinois on January 26\\\\.

It was published in 1830 and is one of the Études philosophiques of La Comédie humaine. Plot summary The story starts in 16th century Ferrara in Italy. Don Juan Belvidero, the spoiled young son of wealthy nobleman, Bartolommeo Belvidero is having dinner with friends in the family palace, when he is told by a servant that his father is dying. He goes to his father's room. There his father tells him to fetch a phial of liquid from one of the drawers. His father orders Juan to rub this liquid over his body after he is dead, saying that it will restore him to life, and make him young again. Bartolommeo then dies. Juan does not immediately obey his father. After informing his guests of his father's death and seeing them off, he returns to his dead father's room, and puts one drop of the liquid from the phial on his father's eye. The eye comes back to life. After his initial shock, Don Juan kills his father's eye. Having inherited his father's wealth, Juan continues his life of debauchery. He also secretly becomes an atheist. In his 60s, he settles down in Andalusia in Spain, and marries Dona Elvira, and they have a son, Felipe. He also chooses the Abbot of San-Lucar to be the confessor of his wife and son, and Felipe is raised to be religiously devout. On Juan's death bed, he tells his son Felipe about the phial of liquid, claiming that it is holy water. He orders his son to pour it over his body after he is dead. Felipe follows these orders, first pouring the liquid on his father's head, then on one of his arms. Juan's now living arm then grasps Felipe by the throat. A shocked Felipe faints, and the phial drops to the floor and breaks and all the rest of the liquid is lost. People rush into the room when they hear the noise, and see Don Juan's body with the head and one arm bought back to life and youth, and the rest still dead. They proclaim it to be a miracle. The Abbot of San-Lucar claims that the miracle means that Don Juan is to be canonised as a saint. The half living body of Don Juan is then taken to the abbey church, and put into a reliquary. The Abbot celebrates a mass for Don Juan which is attended by many people. The angry head of Don Juan shouts blasphemies during the mass, detaches itself from the body, and then kills the Abbot by biting deeply into his head. Source According to an introduction added to the story by Balzac, the idea for the story came from a friend of his who had read it in a short story collection. Balzac was not certain who the original author was, and thought that it may have been E. T. A. Hoffmann.

She is the Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers University. She is also a Distinguished Lecturer of the Organization of American Historians, and the 2019–2021 National Publications Director of the Association of Black Women Historians. She is an expert on the experiences of African American women in the United States criminal justice system in the late 1800s and early 1900s. She has written about how these experiences reflect the roles of race and gender in late nineteenth-century urban America, particularly Philadelphia. Education and positions Gross attended Cornell University, where she graduated with a BA degree. She obtained an MA and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. She then spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, after which she joined the history faculty at Drexel University, where she became the Director of the Africana Studies Program. In 2007 Gross was a scholar-in- residence at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. In 2014 and 2015, she was a Public Voices Fellow for The Op-Ed Project. She became a professor at Rutgers University in 2017. Gross was the National Publications Director for the Association of Black Women Historians during 2019–2021, and a Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians. Research In 2006, Gross published the book Colored Amazons: Crime, Violence, and Black Women in the City of Brotherly Love, 1880-1910. In Colored Amazons, Gross studies the crimes, persecution, and incarceration of African American women in Philadelphia at the end of the 20th century, in the period 1880 to 1910, using historical records like incarceration data and trial transcripts. Gross argues that ideas of black women's crimes and their motivations were constructed both by perpetrators of crimes and by the state; some African American women broke the law as a means to gain personal autonomy, while the state promoted ideas about crimes by black women to reinforce the position of the white middle-class in Philadelphia. Gross studies how African American women who broke the law in this period often used crime as a method to resolve restrictions or violence that they faced due to racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or the interaction between those forces. She also traces the construction of white supremacist stereotypes that portrayed African American women as being inherently inclined towards criminality or violence (the \\"Colored Amazons\\" stereotype for which the book is named), and she examines the role of Cesare Lombroso's theories about the heritability of criminality in promoting those stigmas. Gross connects these stereotypes to the burgeoning feminist discourse of post-Reconstruction America, and she shows that racial antagonism was prevalent in Philadelphia despite the egalitarian Quaker and liberal democratic founding ideals of the city. Colored Amazons was reviewed as being a timely contribution to an under- studied historical narrative, because when it was written African American women were over-represented in the American criminal justice system, and were the fastest-growing prison population in the United States. Colored Amazons received the 2005 John Hope Franklin Center Manuscript Prize, and the 2006 Letitia Woods Brown Memorial Book Award from the Association of Black Women Historians. Gross was also the author of the 2016 book Hannah Mary Tabbs and the Disembodied Torso: A Tale of Race, Sex, and Violence in America. In Hannah Mary Tabbs and the Disembodied Torso, Gross uses archival sources to reconstruct the details of the sensational 1887 murder trial of Hannah Mary Tabbs and her neighbor George Wilson, and to more deeply understand the racial and gender dynamics that were at play in the case and in how it was publicly covered. After an unknown victim's torso was discovered and Tabbs and Wilson were identified as murder suspects, the case became a national news story. Gross argues that the case received national interest partly because the racial identity of the victim was not immediately obvious (the victim was later revealed to be Silas Wakefield Gaines, who was a multiracial person), and so the case did not fit neatly into certain prevalent racial narratives about violent crime. Gross uses the murder case to investigate the social history of Philadelphia in the 1880s, producing what the historian Georgina Hickey called \\"a nuanced exploration of the meaning of race and gender in late nineteenth-century urban America\\". Hannah Mary Tabbs and the Disembodied Torso won the 2017 Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction from the Hurston/Wright Foundation. In 2020, Gross and her coauthor Daina Ramey Berry published the book A Black Women's History of the United States. The book examines the history of African American women through the narratives of eleven women who either had a significant impact on the history of the United States or whose lives reflect something about Black women's lives in American history. Two theses of the book are that African American women have been under-recognised for their core role in American history, and that the rights that have been won by African American women were gained primarily through their own struggle and activism. Specifically, Gross and Berry argue that political acts by African American women have crucially clarified the idea of liberty in American politics, exposed failures in mainstream approaches to democracy, and demonstrated how to correct those failures. Gross and Berry selected stories about historical figures who are not well-known, in what was described in Kirkus Reviews as a \\"wide-ranging search-and-rescue mission for black female activists, trailblazers, and others who have left a mark\\". A Black Women's History of the United States was listed as one of \\"the 10 books to read in February\\" of 2019 by The Washington Post, as well as one of \\"the 22 most anticipated books of February 2020\\" by Bustle magazine. Gross's work has been cited, or she has been interviewed, in media outlets including The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, WNYC, and Time.

It was introduced during 1985 Summer NAMM industry trade show in New Orleans.  Features  The Roland DDR-30 Digital Drum module is designed to pair with PD-10 and PD-20 pads to form the Alpha Drum System, or via MIDI controller (e.g. Roland Pad 8). The DDR-30 and Alpha Drums was the first-generation of Roland electronic drum sets. = Hardware = The Roland DDR-30 measures 3.5\\"x 19\\"x 12\\" (H x W x D) and it's two units tall. The module sports a large VFD display window. All patch data is shown here from selected voice to parameter information. Below the window are a series of buttons for Edit write, Set write, Bank select, and then eight drum set buttons. Next to these are rocker switches for Instrument Select (up and down) and Patch Select. To the right of these are six edit buttons, arranged in two rows, including: Forward; Back; Voice; Gate; Pitch; and EQ. Next to these are four more to control Pad sensitivity, Cartridge operations, Copy button and MIDI settings. Next to these we have a large Alpha Dial to modify voice parameters. Finally we have a memory cartridge slot, a MIDI message light, and a Power button.  1985 Prototype  Early prototype DDR-30s included six rotary potentiometers to the right of the Alpha Dial. The function of these pots is individual volume adjustment for the six voices. Knobs are labeled Bass, Snare, Tom 1, Tom 2, Tom 3, Tom 4 These were later removed when the module was released to public. = Voice Synthesis = The Roland DDR-30 has 6-voices: a bass, a snare, and four toms. Each voice has four 12-bit PCM digital sampled sounds. These sounds can be modified by 16 parameters, saved as drum patch presets, and combined into drum kits. The parameters are combined into edit groups, including Attack, Decay, Pitch, EQ, Bend, and Gate. You are limited to only the factory PCM samples. ROM chips are not swap-able (i.e. Simmons or DMX) and no external sample cartridges were available. = External Control = Unlike the Roland PM-16 Trigger-to-MIDI module, the DDR-30 is both a tone generator and trigger module. The DDR-30 includes six XLR input jacks for connecting the Roland PD-10 drum pads and PD-11 kick drum. The DDR-30 is not compatible with modern Roland triggers (e.g. PD-21, PD-31, PD-8, etc..) which use 1/4 inch TRS cables. It however can be triggered via MIDI messages from a wide variety of controllers (keyboard, drum machine, sequencer, computer, or percussion controller)Roland Corporation (1985). DDR-30: Owner's Manual. Osaka Japan: Roland Corporation.. During 1985, Roland released the Pad 8 percussion controller, which could control the DDR-30 digital drum module over MIDI. = Audio Output = The DDR-30 includes stereo main unbalanced audio mix outputs. The right main output doubles as mono output. Audio mix parameters include volume, treble, and bass for all voices. There is not a parameter to adjust voice panning or to exclude voices from main mix output. However, the module does have six unbalanced individual outputs for each voice. = Memory/Storage = Patches and Kits can be saved into internal memory and optional M-16C memory cartridge. 48 patches (8 per voice) and 32 kits can be saved to internal memory . The M-16C can store an additional 64 patch presets.Roland Corporation (1985). DDR-30: NAMM Product Sheet. Osaka Japan: Roland Corporation.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in 1931. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by George Kitson and directed by Kevin Tancharoen. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode begins where the sixth season ended, with the characters traveling to the 1930s. Filming took place in California beginning in February 2019, with authentic period costumes designed for the season and visual effects used to help create the period setting. Patton Oswalt guest stars as an ancestor of his Koenig characters while Darren Barnet portrays the father of Gideon Malick, another character from previous seasons. \\"The New Deal\\" originally aired on ABC on May 27, 2020, and was watched by 1.82 million viewers. The episode received positive reviews, with critics highlighting Gregg and his return to the Coulson character after portraying a different character in the sixth season. Praise also went to Oswalt's guest appearance as well as the episode's story and pacing. Plot In 1931 New York City, a group of aliens called Chronicoms steal the faces of three police officers and kill a contact from a local speakeasy. Meanwhile, having just arrived in the past to stop the Chronicoms from changing history, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jemma Simmons introduces Director Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie and Agent Daisy Johnson to an LMD version of the late former Director Phil Coulson, who struggles with his existence and two years' worth of adventures that S.H.I.E.L.D. went through that he was not around for. Taking on period appropriate disguises, Johnson and Agent Deke Shaw investigate the faceless officers and are attacked by the Chronicoms, though they overpower one and take him back to their mobile headquarters, Zephyr One. Concurrently, Coulson and Mack investigate the speakeasy since it will become a future S.H.I.E.L.D. asset and meet its owner, Ernest \\"Hazard\\" Koenig, who reveals that the police officers were providing security for a function in honor of Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents go undercover to protect the future president, believing the Chronicoms will target him since he will found S.H.I.E.L.D.'s predecessor, the Strategic Scientific Reserve, in the 1940s. However, when Simmons overloads the captive Chronicom's mind, she forces it to reveal their actual target: Koenig's employee, Freddy Malick, father of future Hydra leader, Gideon Malick. Realizing that they have to save Hydra to ensure S.H.I.E.L.D.'s future, the team rescues Freddy from the Chronicoms just after he received a job to deliver a package from a Hydra contact, though they get separated in the process. Aboard Zephyr One, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Chronicom ally, Enoch, helps heal Agent Melinda May from injuries she sustained during the team's previous mission, but she wakes up earlier than expected and evades him. ProductionDevelopment= In November 2018, ahead of the release of its sixth season, ABC renewed Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a seventh. Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb revealed in July 2019 that this would be the series' last season, and stated that it had been designed to \\"tie up any threads\\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story. The season's story features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and \\"look back at everything we’ve done\\", beginning in 1930s New York prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D. In August, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"The New Deal\\" and written by George Kitson. It was confirmed to be the first episode of the season in May 2020, when Kevin Tancharoen was revealed to have directed it. =Writing= The episode picks up from the sixth season's cliffhanger ending, which showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, as well as the series' writers, were able to plan since the seventh season was ordered while they were working on the sixth. Whedon explained that the time travel story for the season begins in the 1930s because the writers wanted to start \\"back at the very origin of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\", and to create a challenge for the series' crew who had to reinvent the costumes and sets of the series each season. Tancharoen acknowledged that the period setting created \\"something for every department to sink their teeth into\\" despite there being no increase to the series' budget for the final season. The episode introduces the season's rules for time travel with the mantra \\"let's make ripples, not waves\\", and also sets up a twist where the characters have to save Hydra in order to save S.H.I.E.L.D. The latter was devised as complex moral decision for the agents to debate that would create conflict within the team. Bell compared the decision to the question of would one kill baby Adolf Hitler if they could. The episode also introduces a theme of exploring reactions to the series' diverse cast in past time periods. Darren Barnet was not familiar with the series, which he felt helped in his portrayal of Freddy Malick, because Freddy \\"has no clue to what's going on\\", but did watch the season three episodes featuring Gideon Malick. Barnet also listened to music from the 1930s and 1940s, particularly of his grandfather, Charlie Barnet, who was a musician in the 1930s in New York City, and old radio interviews to help him with his New York accent, which he \\"tweaked\\" a little. He described Freddy as \\"a kid who's been dealt a bad hand and he's on this interesting cusp of deciding if he's going to be good or bad\\", which the actor felt was an interesting character arc to portray. =Casting= Guest star Patton Oswalt portrays a new member of the Koenig family in this episode, Ernest Hazard With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. In May 2020, Patton Oswalt was revealed to be returning for the season, portraying Ernest Hazard Koening. He previously played various present-day Koenig siblings in previous seasons of the series. Also in May, Darren Barnet was revealed to be guest starring in the season, portraying Wilfred \\"Freddy\\" Malick, the father of Gideon Malick who was portrayed by Powers Boothe in previous seasons. Barnet original auditioned to play one of the cops in the episode, before being called back to read for Freddy and ultimately got cast in the role. Joel Stoffer was also confirmed to be reprising his recurring role of Enoch in the seventh season. They guest star alongside Tobias Jelinek as Luke, Joe Reegan, Nora Zehetner, Greg Finley, and Luke Baines. Additionally, Joseph Culp appears in the episode as Franklin D. Roosevelt. =Design=Costumes Costume designer Whitney Galitz did extensive research on 1930s clothing for the season, using material from her college studies as well as photographs and other primary references. She felt this research was often overlooked by other television series designing period costumes on a limited schedule. Galitz wanted to ensure that the costumes were appropriate to the period, including authentically portraying vintage police uniforms, and that they were worn as they would have been at the time (down to the correct underwear). Imogene Chayes of Marvel's Visual Development group provided concept art for the costumes. The opening scenes of the episode required almost 200 different costumes for background actors, and the series' costume department had two weeks to design and create these. Galitz had dedicated teams working on the background actors for the opening exterior scenes, and Franklin D. Roosevelt's event. Due to the large number of costumes, High Society Custom Tailor provided custom suits that the series' in house tailor was unable to make, and Galitz worked with Western Costume for the vintage police uniforms. She also had to source 60 period black tuxedos for the FDR event, which she called \\"pretty difficult\\", since many they found were either deteriorating or did not fit modern-day sizing standards. Daisy's purple dress and green gown were custom made, as were many of the other costumes used in the various stunt sequences since vintage pieces would have been difficult to find multiple of. Galitz estimated that 50 costumes were built for this episode and the next's, \\"Know Your Onions\\". Yo-Yo Rodriguez continues to wear pants in the episode rather than dresses or skirts, a decision that was made by Cordova-Buckley and the wardrobe department. This was part practical and part staying true to the style of the character, with Cordova-Buckley saying, \\"There's a very modern woman in that [choice.] It's never about looking pretty... It's always about, 'This is who I am, and this is how I can be the best version of who I am.'\\" Despite this, the character does wear high heels rather than her normal boots since the latter would have exposed the team. Barnet was originally given hightop shoes to wear, but he suggested boots as an alternative, and ended up with \\"big, thick boots with steel plates on the bottoms\\". Hair Head of hair and makeup Shay Sanford used the break between the end of season six filming and starting on season seven to prepare for the 1930s setting, \\"just to see what the vibe\\" of the era was. When work on the episode began in earnest, Sanford was concerned about many of the actors having long hair, since that was not a style in the 1930s. Sanford described women of the era as becoming \\"more vibrant looking\\" because of the advent of feature films and the end of the Great Depression, and wanted the actors to look this part, while hiding the length of their hair. To achieve this, Sanford used a mixture of braiding and curling to \\"anchor everything together\\". Since many of the background actors also had long hair, Sanford used \\"cheaper\\" wigs to hide their hair. Oswalt was given a side part for his hairstyle, along with a small tooth comb to style his hair. Sanford said giving men a side part \\"changes everything\\", sometimes avoiding the need for a hair cut. Title sequence The episode introduces a new \\"old-style noir\\" title card with a cursive, angled font, reflecting the 1930s setting of the episode. It also includes \\"Marvel Presents\\" above the logo, and the copyright boilerplate with Roman numerals below it, resembling older film titles. Ian Cardona of Comic Book Resources called the title card \\"a perfect throwback\\" given the setting of the episode, and combined with the episode's music it \\"lets viewers know, right off the bat, what type of aesthetic this new season will adhere to\\". He also noted that in addition to being an old film reference, the inclusion of \\"Marvel Presents\\" was an homage to Marvel Comics that often feature a title page stating 'Marvel Comics Presents'\\". =Filming and visual effects= Production for the season began at the end of February 2019, in Culver City, California. The day before filming began, actor Jeff Ward broke his toe and for three weeks until it healed he wore modern running shoes with his 1930s costume whenever his feet were not on camera. Scenes on the streets of New York City were filmed on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, with visual effects vendor Digital Domain extending the set by adding the skyline of 1930s New York as well as digital cars and crowds in the background. The time-traveling aircraft Zephyr One was created digitally by FuseFX, while CoSA VFX provided the effects for the Chronicom's face scanning device and the body repair machine that Enoch uses on the injured Agent May. The faceless police officers were primarily created with practical makeup, though visual effects were used to blend the seems, remove eye holes, and flatten the actors' noses. The melting effect on the captured Chronicom was created by CoSA using practical elements filmed by the series' special effects team, and was designed to look like spontaneous human combustion. The appearance of Chronicoms without human faces was created by CoSA based on the small view inside Enoch's face from earlier in the series. Their eyes were designed as an homage to the character Lucifer in the television series of the same name. =Music= Beginning with this episode, Jason Akers is credited as co-composer alongside Bear McCreary. Akers had contributed additional music to earlier seasons, and McCreary said he \\"knew the show like an encyclopedia\\". The pair were able to introduce a new style of music with the episode due to its period setting, which McCreary described as \\"1940's noire saxophones\\" which were blended with the series' \\"pre-established classic orchestra and contemporary electronics\\" and existing musical themes. Release \\"The New Deal\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on May 27, 2020, following a broadcast of the MCU film Thor: The Dark World (2013). ReceptionRatings= In the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.82 million viewers, steady with the average number of viewers for the sixth season. Within a week of its release, \\"The New Deal\\" was watched by 2.97 million U.S. viewers. =Critical response= Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McLevy praised the episode and graded it an \\"A-\\", feeling that it did \\"everything right\\". He highlighted the story, pacing, and direction, especially commending the series for not trying to catch up new viewers given how much exposition would be required to explain the events of the previous seasons. He was positive of the characters and their interactions, praising Gregg in particular with his return as a version of Coulson after playing a different character in the previous season. McLevy also felt that one of the series' biggest issues, its \\"dull visual palette\\", was not an issue in the episode due to the execution of its period setting. Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" score of 7 out of 10, describing it as a \\"fun and charming adventure\\" but also \\"more dopey than dangerous\\", highlighting the period setting and the main cast's chemistry. Writing for Bam! Smack! Pow!, Wesley Coburn game the episode an \\"A\\", calling it \\"a winner\\" and \\"a strong start to this season’s time-traveling adventures\\". Syfy Wires Trent Moore called the Hydra threat \\"full circle\\" for the series, \\"considering just how many seasons they spent trying to stop Hydra\\", and enjoyed the twist of needing to save Freddy Malick. Christian Houlb of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a \\"B\\", highlighting the period costumes and Oswalt's appearance. Michael Ahr at Den of Geek scored the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, feeling that the series was more comfortable in the episode than it had been in the sixth season despite the new period setting, and attributing this to Gregg's familiar performance as the LMD Coulson. He also praised the episode's explanation of the series' time travel rules, the inclusion of the Freddy Malick character tying the episode to previous seasons, and the return of Oswalt. At Hypable, Michal Schick praised the episode as \\"impactful\\" without losing the series' sense of humor. He focused on the lighthearted LMD Coulson, the scenes of the main characters not fitting in with the prejudices of 1930s New York, and the moral questions established for the rest of the season to answer. =Accolades= Clark Gregg was named as an honorable mention for TVLines \\"Performer of the Week\\" for the week of May 24, 2020, for his performance in this episode.

This cell phone remained active until April 2003, 15 months after the case. A neighbor surnamed Villanueva, who lived across the La Candelaria estancia, claimed that he had seen Mencho Gill on horseback on January 14. Luisa Eva Gill (sister of Rubén) made the initial police report at the Viale police station for the family's disappearance. The case was labeled as a \\"missing persons investigation\\" and was left to justice Jorge Sebastián Gallino, from Nogoyá. In mid-2015, it was transferred to judge Gustavo Acosta.  Investigation  In mid-2003, Justice Gallino ordered an investigation. No neighbor or relative was aware of what happened to the Gills, and that they had left on their own was unlikely: they had no vehicle of their own and Margarita, who had another job at the school in town, had not received her latest salary. In 2006, the Gill family's plaintiff lawyer, Elvio Garzón, stated that some police officers had intervened in their disappearance, who also provided services in police stations in the areas where the accountant Amado Abib and architect Mario Zappegno disappeared. This hypothesis was neither looked into nor recorded in the case file. In 2008, a raid was carried out on the La Candelaria estancia, where the floor was raised, wells were dug out and traces of blood were found using luminol. Three human blood samples, without the Gills' genetic pattern, although experts made it clear that over time the samples had been contaminated. Furthermore, the presence of flies, which hover over human corpses, was noted. The area was monitored with an echo sounder in order to find traces of disturbed soil, but none were detected. In that same year, a \\"psychological autopsy\\" was conducted, through which a forensic psychologist concluded that the Gills had no psychological or religious motives which could lead them to sever ties with loved ones, and that while the family had little contact with other families in the area, Rubén was \\"a happy, loquacious, sociable man, who never looked sad.\\" However, several witnesses reported that in the days before his disappearance, he had been \\"silent, thoughtful and very concerned\\". In November 2011, a search was performed on a well in the countryside, where the family resided. During the investigation, authorities investigated leads in different Argentine provinces, as well as in Paraguay and Brazil, but to no avail. Among the different hypotheses, there was talk of a forced disappearance, a confrontation with a field owner and a sentimental conflict. Neither of these led to anything conclusive. They have not appeared in any registry, neither labor, immigration, educational or social security (although, in 2010, the Gills' names appeared on the enrollment for Universal Allocation Per Child, which was later found to be an error). In 2015, the new justice, Gustavo Acosta, and prosecutor Federico Uriburu decided to restart the investigation. Uriburu made the following statement: The aim was to give more prominence to the case, as well as to involve police officers to work on it. Investigations were carried out in the Cordobán town of Porteña, a town of a 5,000 inhabitants where a community of rural workers from Entre Ríos was formed, but no clues were found. In addition, a drone flew over the area in August 2015, photographing the La Candelaria estancia and surrounding fields in search of disturbed soil. An attempt was also made to find the aerial photos of the area in 2002, so they could compare them with the ones taken from the drone. In February 2018, yet another search operation was carried out on the estancia, following a lead provided by rural contractor Armando Nanni, who said he had seen Rubén Gill complaining about the wells that he had been ordered to dig on January 14, days before his disappearance. A water well was also inspected, where only remains of animal bones were found. Likewise, Nanni indicated the existence of a stream on the land, which will be addressed when the budget is approved by the judiciary. A team of firefighters investigated it and indicated that perforations had been made in it, since the terrain was removed. Rubén's brother, Osvaldo, and Margarita's mother, Adelia, demand that the basement of the estancia be investigated, since they alleged that Goette had covered it and built it upstairs. = Alfonso Goette's statements = The owner of the estancia hinted at the possibility that the family might've gone to Santa Fe to visit relatives, or have migrated to the northeast in search of work. Goette claimed that the family had left all their possessions in the house, including money and documents, but when relatives of Gill visited the room, they couldn't find said belongings, but found that the mattresses were burned and blood was mixed with the dirt. According to Luisa Gill, Goette burned the mattresses because they were stained with blood. She also questioned the landlord's account, which claimed that he had given the Gills a vacation, since he had never given them more than ten to fifteen days before. In addition, the fact that Goette did not notice the Gills' disappearance until three months later and that some acquaintances declared that the relationship between them was not good, suspicions fell on the owner. However, no compromising evidence has been located thus far. Goette died in a car crash on June 16, 2016, at the age of 78. The truck he was driving steered out of control and overturned on Route 32, near the town of Seguí. With his death, the investigation of the death could be reopened. For this, a police commission has been formed.

Harry Humphrey Moore (21 July 1844, New York City - 2 January 1926, Paris) was an American painter; best known for his works depicting Japan, Spain and North Africa. Biography Gnawa Musicians His father, Capt. George Humphrey Moore, was a shipbuilder and a descendent of Ozias Humphry, an English painter of portrait miniatures.Biography @ Hirschl & Adler gallery He was either born deaf, or became so as a toddler. He initially attended the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford, America's oldest institution of that type, then transferred to the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, in Philadelphia. It was there he began taking art lessons from the portrait painter, Samuel Waugh. Through him, he met Thomas Eakins, and began taking lessons from him as well. Upon Eakins' recommendation, he went to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts with Jean-Léon Gérôme. He also studied with Adolphe Yvon.Biography @ AskArt Later, he took some courses in anatomy at a medical school in San Francisco, and would revisit that area frequently until 1907. After completing his basic studies, in 1869, he accompanied Eakins and the engraver, William Sartain, on a trip to Spain. He was very impressed, and remained there after his companions returned to Paris. He would stay for several years, mostly in Segovia and Granada, where he was especially fascinated by Moorish culture. Japanese Mother and Child In 1872, he married Isabella de Cistué y Nieto, from a prominent military family in Zaragoza, who knew sign-language because she had a childhood friend who was deaf. They went to live in Morocco, where they stayed for almost two years, travelling about painting; often with a military escort. He returned to New York in 1874 and opened a studio; participating in exhibitions at the National Academy of Design and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He also had two solo showings, in San Francisco, at the Snow & May Gallery and the Bohemian Club. It was there he met Katherine Birdsall Johnson (1834-1893), a philanthropist and art collector, who invited him and his wife to accompany her on a trip to Japan in 1880. He accepted, and became one of the first American artists to go there. He created over sixty paintings while visiting, which are now among his most familiar works. He spent most of his later career painting portraits of children, wealthy Americans and members of the European nobility. Shortly after World War I, he went to live in Europe and died in Paris.

Its title refers to a 1972 documentary about Bob Dylan. It was a National Book Award finalistNational Book Awards – 2006 National Book Foundation and won the Rosenthal Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Plot summary After a domestic bombing campaign against corporations involved in the Vietnam War goes awry in 1972, a leftist cell led by lovers Bobby Desoto and Mary Wainwright goes underground. Mary and Bobby split up and invent new lives for themselves. Mary changes her name, dyes her hair, and moves to Oregon to join a feminist collective. When her identity is discovered, she flees across the country, first to a lesbian commune in upstate New York, and then to Southern California. She ends up as Louise, a placid housewife in a suburb of Seattle raising a son, Jason, by herself after her husband dies in an accident. Jason grows to become an insular, intelligent teenager and aficionado of retro music. In a parallel plot, Bobby has become Nash Davis, an indifferent owner of an alternative bookstore in Seattle in the late 1990s who convenes ironic leftist discussion groups that never actually undertake the actions they plan. Nash is friends with a chronically ill man named Henry, who has all the symptoms of Agent Orange exposure despite never having served in Vietnam. Nash becomes romantically involved with a fiery young activist named Miranda, but loses her to Josh, an unassuming, calculating young man who, despite his apparent suburban normalcy, has a penchant for computer hacking to aid leftist causes. Josh executes a hack against a mega-corporation that ends up landing him a job there, which he takes for the sake of infiltrating them from the inside (or so he tells Miranda). Eventually, as Josh rises in the corporate ladder, his intentions are no longer clear, and Miranda leaves him. Meanwhile, Jason discovers his mom's secret, as well as Bobby's new identity, and confronts her. The reader learns at this point that a bomb planted by Mary in the home of an executive of a munitions company accidentally killed a maid instead. Jason gives her Bobby's information, and she meets with him for the first time since they went underground. She tells him that she has resolved to turn herself in, but Bobby urges her to turn him in to the authorities to reduce her sentence. She leaves without explicitly accepting his offer, but a few days later Bobby is arrested. Reception Writing in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani described the novel as \\"an elliptical narrative filled with musical leitmotifs and searing, strobe-lighted images of contemporary life\\" and notes that Spiotta tackled her chosen theme \\"with ingenuity, inventiveness and élan.\\" In The Guardian, Matthew Crow declared the book \\"a triumph\\" and praised Spiotta's dialogue and plotting. In a mixed review in The New York Times, Julia Scheeres called the novel \\"fascinating\\" but criticized its \\"collage of viewpoints\\" as distracting from the main storyline.

Early life Jules Gregory was born in New York City on August 3, 1920, one of two sons of Julius Gregory, a noted New York architect and Mary Lovrien Price Gregory, a painter, muralist, and cartoonist. His grandfather, Eugene J. Gregory was mayor of Sacramento from 1880–1881, and his great-grandfather emigrated from France, settling in northern California in 1850 for the Gold Rush. Jules Gregory graduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1938, and from Cornell University College of Architecture in 1943. During World War II he worked with construction in Alaska. With a Fulbright scholarship, Gregory studied architecture at the École de Beaux Arts in Paris from 1949 to 1950.http://content.aia.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/GregoryJules.pdf He married Nancy Shippen Bangert Eyerly of Pleasantville, New York, in 1945; the couple lived in Greenwich Village in New York City. In 1950 Gregory and his wife moved to Lambertville, New Jersey, where he partnered with Alan Blauth in the firm Gregory+Blauth, Architects. Gregory and his wife had two daughters, Kathe Gregory and Nicole Gregory.https://www.nicolegregorywriter.com/wp- content/uploads/2020/05/Living-for-Young-Homemakers-Magazine_Gregory- article_lr-1-1.pdf Architecture As a young architect, Gregory worked in five New York City offices: Harrison & Abramovitz; Ketchum, Gina & Sharpe; Sanders & Malsin; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; and the United Nations design team. During this time, he won two awards in a “Hidden Talent” in architecture competition, organized by The Museum of Modern Art and Architectural Record.https://assets.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/1293/releases/MOMA_1949_0007_1949-01-19_490119-7.pdf Gregory's first designs as an independent architect were private homes with a dramatic modernist style. He designed award-winning houses throughout New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. Owners included Jerome and Mrs. Chodorov, Herbert R. Axelrod, Frederic and Amelia Ramsey, Dr. David and Edith Rose, David, and Naomi Savage, Lee, and Mrs. Mendelson, Elizabeth and William Goryl, John E. Gombos, Edith, and Yosh Kawano and Donald Palese. Signature elements of these homes are soaring open, multi-level spaces framed by bent natural wood, white textured stucco, and walls of glass that let in sunlight and provided an intimate closeness with nature. His own home, built on a 10-acre wooded site outside of Lambertville, New Jersey in 1960, was featured in The American Home, winter 1963 edition, Architectural Record 1961, House and Gardens Building Guide, 1963, and more recently in The New York Times. Gregory's home featured a curved roof supported by one-foot-thick laminated wooden beams and high glass walls. Jules Gregory served as Director of the New Jersey chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) from 1966 to 1968, Chairman for Commission on the Environment 1967–68, Vice President from 1968–69 and became an AIA Fellow in 1969. He was affiliated with numerous organizations including the Architectural League of New York, the New Jersey Society of Architects, and the National Institute for Architectural Education. He was co-editor along with David Lewis of Process: Architecture, Community Design: By the People, December 1977 edition, which featured stories of citizen participation in urban design. Urban Planning In the late 1960s, Gregory was an advocate for creative solutions to urban crises. He coordinated the Regional Urban Design Assistance Team (R/UDAT). This was a constantly changing group of architects, urban planners, and engineers who traveled to more than 90 cities around the country. These R/UDAT teams created master plans and provided guidance to mayors and government officials on how to revitalize downtrodden areas and expand development based on the interests and needs of communities and local businesses. In 1983 Gregory won the Edward C. Kemper Award, the highest honor of achievement from the American Institute of Architecture, “For tireless service to his profession and to the enhancement of the urban life in America as a prime organizer and enthusiastic proponent of the Institute’s Regional/Urban Design Assistance Team Program, he has helped communities across the land redefine and shape themselves within the context of their own unique and precious values. His service, wisdom, and powers of persuasion have greatly enhanced the public’s understanding of its designers to America’s vitality.” Teaching Gregory mentored young architects throughout his life. An obituary that appeared in Progressive Architecture magazine noted that “Jules seldom lectured, he taught in architectural schools as a visitor,” including Columbia University, Princeton University, Pratt Institute, Rutgers University, Yale University, Ohio State University, and New Jersey Institute of Technology.https://usmodernist.org/PA/PA-1985-06.pdf Legacy The revived interest in the mid-century style has created a new market the homes designed by Jules Gregory. Gregory's community-driven urban design philosophy was posthumously acknowledged by an AIA Institute Presidential Citation, which stated that his “vision of ‘architects in service of society’ is now embedded in the AIA mission. More importantly, professionals around the world have answered his call to service by transforming their own communities through democratic design processes. His leadership legacy has had a singular impact on this field of work.” His obituary in Progressive Architecture magazine stated, “Here was an architect who had the courage to be a humanist in increased business and technological world, one who maintained—long before urban design was even a phrase in our vocabulary—that architectural responsibility must be broadened from individual buildings to buildings as city-making…Underlying his efforts was the belief that in every local urban situation there are reservoirs of citizen wisdom, that local people everywhere need and want the opportunity to debate the issues and establish comprehensive directions into which new buildings can fit meaningfully. He felt that no architect—indeed, no single individual—could ever grasp the intricacy of contexts alone. For Jules, the answer lay in teamwork.” Notable Projects Jules Gregory's own home, built-in 1960, featured a curved roof supported by one-foot-thick laminated wooden beams and high glass walls. In addition to private homes, Gregory designed many schools and churches that garnered awards and recognition. * Marlboro Middle School, Marlboro, New Jersey (awarded Special Jury Citation for Architectural Excellence) * Long Branch City Hall, Long Branch, New Jersey * William S.

He is the professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University in Republic of Korea and the CEO of Quantamatrix.  Education and early life  Sunghoon Kwon was born on 23 December 1975 in Seoul; he studied at Yeoksam Middle School and Sangmun High School; he studied at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Seoul National University to become a programmer because he was interested in computer programming since he was a child. In the third year of college, he was admitted to the hospital due to a serious traffic accident, and his dream changed to biomedical engineering as he saw electronic and electrical technologies such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) play an important role in medicine. Sunghoon Kwon studied medical devices mainly for doctors at the Department of Medical Engineering at Seoul National University and received a master's degree with the theme of developing a wireless mouse that moves according to eye movements for the disabled. Later, he entered the doctoral program at UC Berkeley, where he studied bio / optical MEMS and lab on a chip system for biomaterial analysis. In 2003, he completed his Ph.D. under the supervision of Luke Pyungse Lee.KWON, Sunghoon; LEE, Luke P. Micromachined transmissive scanning confocal microscope. Optics letters, 2004, 29.7: 706-708. in three and a half years and studied nanomaterials and nanoprocessing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Career  Ever since he was appointed professor of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, he always wanted to give tools or devices to life scientists and medical doctors that they needed in their cutting edges, to enable innovations. Therefore, for the last 14 years, he and his group have worked towards realization of personalized medicine under the motto: “helping life scientist with technology.” and have made technological breakthroughs in personalized medicine that resulted in 80 scientific literatures, 130 patents and 2 spun-off companies hiring more than 200 full-time employees. He focused on developing technologies for life scientists and medical doctors to improve personalized therapeutics to reduce the breakdown cost for disease treatment. Kwon's research includes work on multiplex bio assay platform, single cell analysis and algorithm for immune profiling = Awards and honors = Sunghoon Kwon was invited to deliver a Plenary Talk in IEEE OMN (2020) and delivered invited lectures in prominent international conferences including TEDx talk in Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) (2018), Plenary Talk in IEEE MEMS (the first Korean Plenary Talk in 31 years history of IEEE MEMS conference) (2017) and more plenary talks and invited talks. He was appointed as one of the eight SNU Creative Distinguished Professors (Similar to University Professorship, $660k) of the Seoul National University in 2012. He gained academic recognition of his excellence from both engineering and science by winning many awards including the Young Scientist Award, The Korea Academy of Science and Technology (2011), Korean Young Scientist Award ($100k) from the Korean President, presidential award given to 4 scientists under age of 40 (2012), IEEK/IEEE Joint Awards IT Young Engineer Award (2016), Young Engineer Award ($44k) from the National Academy of Engineering of Korea (2018) and Jin- Pok Kim’s Award for the Best Cancer Research in Korea from Korea Cancer Research Foundation (2019). Kwon is one of few scientists who has early career awards from both National Science Academy and National Engineering Academy at the same time. He is the first Korean winner of the 13th Pioneers of Miniaturization Lectureship, Lab on a Chip Journal (2018). Kwon is a member of NAEK, the National Academy of Engineering of Korea (2020) that appoints engineers who make remarkable contributions to the technological development, and a member of Y-KAST, young Korean Academy of Science and Technology (2017) that is given to innovative scientists under 45.

The house is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Griffins used Knitlock construction to build this, their first home, on land they owned on the Glenard Estate next door to that of his sister Genevieve and brother-in- law Roy Alstan Lippincott at 21 Glenard Drive, the Lippincott House, a house also listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Walter Burley Griffin with the builder David Charles Jenkins patented the Knitlock concrete units in 1917. The Knitlock system was designed as an economical, flexible and quick do-it- yourself construction system, with machine produced standard concrete tiles, or segments, which were fitted together on site. Few Knitlock buildings were constructed and Pholiota is one of a small number that survive. The house was a small, single storey house with square plan, containing a central room with a pyramidal ceiling, surrounded by alcoves. These alcoves contained the entrance and service areas and two bedroom alcoves. The floor was brick laid directly on the ground. Alterations and extensions in 1938, 1975 and the 1990s by subsequent owners have obscured the view of the original building from the street.

It was released in 1984 by Sunnyview Records. The group was formed originally as Positive Messengers following DJ shows in parks and blocks as Jam-On Productions. Positive Messengers' members were all Christian, which led to them creating songs with a message. Group member Ben “Cosmo D” Cenac attempted to bring some recordings made with Positive Messengers to music labels with little success. Following the lack of success, he was encouraged by a member of Jam On Productions to make a hip hop song, which led to the song \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\", a song Cenac described as an \\"anti-rap\\" song, as he felt hip hop music of the period was corny. After bringing the songs \\"Computer Age\\" and \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\" to Joe Webb, The group then renamed themselves Newcleus and Webb released the single re-titled as \\"Jam On Revenge\\" which was released on Webb's label May Hew Records in 1983. The group's music was then brought to Sunnyview Records by Webb, who requested a second rap song from the group, which led to them making another hip hop song titled \\"Jam On It\\". Following the commercial success of both single, Sunnview then suggested to record an album. Cenac and his crew signed a contract which led to them not getting any royalties from the record, while Cenac still managed to get publishing. As the records were developed, the group was locked out of the studio mixing sessions which were handled by Jonathan Fearing. ProductionBackground= Prior to producing music, a group called Jam-On Productions were doing music shows in Brooklyn performing DJ shows playing funk and disco music. These shows began ending around late 1979, which led to group member Ben “Cosmo D” Cenac to buy a cheap synthesizer and began working on songs with Lady E (Yvette Cook)). By 1980, Cenac along with Al T. (aka MC Harmony) joined Cenac and Cook and a few others to make a hip hop recording called \\"Freak City Rapping\\". Cenac sent the release to various labels who all ignored the tape as they had to leave it for them to listen to, which Cenac did not do as it was his only copy of the song. Cenac eventually went to a label called Reflection, where Joe Webb listened to the recording, stating that he heard something in the song, but it needed better sound quality. Following the response from Webb, Cenac borrowed money to buy a Tascam Portastudio, which led to collaborations with Bob Crafton who also went by the name Chilly B. This led to the origination of the group, Positive Messenger, a group Cenac described as \\"all deeply Christian, although in a much more spiritual than religious sense.\\" =Production= Two years later, the group had recorded \\"Computer Age\\", and felt they had a hit song on their hand, especially after hearing the success of \\"Planet Rock\\". The group was encouraged by Salvadore Smooth, a member of Jam-On Productions, to have the group record a hip hop track. Cenac was not a big fan of hip hop music of the time, finding it corny, but stated that he was going to make a record similar to that of Parliament and Funkadelic which was an \\"anti-rap\\" record that made fun of hip hop, which led to recording \\"Jam On's Revenge\\". \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\" was only included on the groups demo work as they had space to fill in at the end of their tape. Cenac sought out Webb again, only to find that Reflection Records had folded, but found Webb through a phone book. Cenac recalled that Webb enjoyed both songs, but particularly \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\". As \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\" did not reflect Positive Messenger's themes, the group decided to re-name themselves Nucleus as the members of the group all lived in the same house. Webb changed the spelling to Newcleus. \\"Jam-On's Revenge\\" was re-recorded in 1982 which Webb released the song on his own label May Hew Records, where the song was mistitled as \\"Jam-On Revenge\\" in 1983. As the song grew popular through DJ Jonathan Fearing playing it on weekends on WBLS. This led to Webb making a deal with Sunnyview Records who had Fearing edit the song to have it arranged similarly the ones played on the radio. When Sunnyview released the single, it was again mislabeled as \\"Jam On Revenge\\". After Fearing helped make \\"Jam-On Revenge\\" a hit, Cenac stated that the label \\"rewarded him by saying his touch is gold and gave him everything. The next thing we knew, he had complete control of our music—once it got in his hands.\\" Cenac recalled that Fearing was \\"good at mixing, he was fantastic with effects\\" noting \\"it's a blessing what he did with \\"Jam On It\\" and \\"Computer Age,\\" yunno, basically he left them alone but he mixed them well and added nice effects.\\" but that \\"He didn't understand hip hop, and we understood what the streets loved. He knew nothing about the streets; he knew what worked in clubs.\\" Cenac and the rest of Newcleus were not allowed in the mixing room. Cenac and his crew had also signed contracts which gave them no royalties for their music. The publishing was out of Joe Webb's hands, as it was between Cenac and Sunnyview, leading Cenac to attest that he \\"got songwriting [credits]. So that paid my bills for a long, long time.\\" The original plan was to have \\"Computer Age\\" be the group's second single, but Sunnyview requested a second hip hop song which led to \\"Jam On Revenge\\", a song adapted from rhymes adapted from the days when Jam-On played parties in parks. Following the success of \\"Jam On It\\", Sunnyview requested an album from the group. Cenac reflected on the album stating that \\"a lot of the stuff I wanted to put on the album, I didn't; the record company only wanted dance music.\\" Among the tracks added was \\"Where's the Beat\\" which Cenac stated \\"wasn't our song\\", as it was based on the Wendy's commercial that had the catchphrase \\"Where's the beef?\\", which led to Webb suggesting them to make the \\"Where's the Beat\\" song. Cenac regretting making the recording. Towards the end of production, Cenac recalled that the group felt \\"disgusted\\" about how they were treated by the label and cut themselves off from them. They were told by Sunnyview's owners Adam Levy and Henry Stone that they could not be Nucleus anymore but could still go out and produce music. Release Jam on Revenge was distributed by Sunnyview in 1984. “Computer Age (Push The Button)” was released in August 1984, followed by “I Wanna Be A B-Boy” and “Let's Jam”. The group's second album Space is the Place was released in 1985. Reception Brian Chin of Billboard stated the album was \\"quite an exemplary project\\" noting the range of songs, op[mining that the \\"atmosphere ranges from speedy (\\"Computor (sic) Age\\") to almost moody (\\"Destination Earth). Our favourite was \\"Auto Man,\\" sporting a tough beat and a good vocal; also check \\"Where's the Beat,\\" the one and only even the vaguely funny song of a whole bunch\\". Chin complimented mixer Jonathan Fearing who \\" gives the entire album an exceptionally glossy finish.\\" An anonymous reviewer in Cashbox declared the album \\"a monster debut LP\\" and that it \\"shows off simple and effective bass playing and rapping which made \\"Newcleus a distinctive new sound in a genre rapidly becoming overplayed.\\" Ken Tucker reviewed the album in The Philadelphia Inquirer, giving the album a three out of four stars rating. Tucker compared the group to The Gap Band and Afrika Bambaataa proclaiming that the group made \\"tuneful dance music, with a sense of structure and drama that too much dance music lacks.

The principality has its origins under the Ayyubid dynasty and was ultimately dissolved in 1799 by Abbas Mirza. During this period, the status of principality oscillated between autonomous and independent. History The principality under Emir Ibrahim Donboli (d. 1320) had good relations with Ghazan of the Ilkhanate and supposedly saved the Ilkhanate from destruction. Nonetheless, the successor of Ibrahim Donboli, Cemşid Dunbulî (d. 1341), died fighting the Mongolians. The successor Emir Behlül Dunbulî (d. 1359) ended the wars with the Mongolians. He subsequently died in Hakkâri. The leader of the Donboli tribe before the conquest of the region by the Aq Qoyunlu was Isa Beg. Under the administration of Aq Qoyunlu, Shaikh Ahmad Beg, a descendant of Isa Beg conquered territory around Hakkâri. When the Safavids captured the area, Haji Beg, the grandson of Shaikh Ahmad Beg was chosen as governor of Sokmanabad which now included Khoy. Haji Beg was also entrusted with the defence of the Safavid frontier in Van before he was assassinated in 1548 by the Governor of Van. This event worsened the relations between the principality and Shah Tahmasp I who sent a force to subdue the Kurds and a large number of the leaders were massacred. A nephew of Haji Beg fled to Qotur (then part of the Ottoman Empire) where he gathered the remnants of the tribe.

Early life and education Mildred Hoge was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of James Thornton and Fanny Stead Hoge. Her brother, Joseph Franklin Dix Hoge, was four years older. Later in her life, in the 1950s, Hoge compiled genealogies of a couple branches of her family, focusing on the descendants of Samuel Hogg of Wilmington, Delaware, and the Kunkel family, of Frederick, Maryland. Hoge's education included an A.B. in zoology from Goucher College in 1908, and an M.A. from Columbia University in 1912. In that year, Hoge published perhaps her first academic paper examining punishment and reward as motivators in animal models. Career As World War I was getting under way, Hoge discovered a fly gene, which she called \\"eyeless\\", because a mutation in the gene resulted in the dramatic loss of eyes. In her paper announcing the discovery of eyeless, she managed to breed the fragile and short-lived mutant flies, quantified and characterized crosses of eyeless with other known mutants, and determined from those interactions that the eyeless gene was located on the 4th of four fly chromosomes. She was trained by the Nobel-prize winning geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan and received her Ph.D. in genetics from Columbia University in 1914. A couple of her genetics papers including the one on the eyeless gene were referenced in Morgan's seminal book The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity. The other paper by her that Morgan referenced examined the effects of temperature on Mendelian trait development. Morgan and his students, like Hoge, used the common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to study how genes influenced observable physical traits. The work they did in the early 1900s established the fruit fly as a powerful model organism for genetic studies. In the century after Morgan's Fly Room was established at Columbia, fly genetics research has yielded numerous discoveries of basic biological mechanisms operating in species as diverse as single-celled yeast to humans. One example is the critical regulatory gene for the development of eyes in everything from simple marine worms to humans, which today we know as the transcription factor gene PAX6, discovered by Hoge. Dissection of Drosophila melanogaster heads with or without eyeless mutation Soon after receiving her Ph.D., Hoge worked as an instructor in zoology at Indiana University from 1914 to 1918, while her future husband taught at the University of Texas, Austin, and Wabash College during this period. It is not entirely clear where they met, but both had connections with the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory at the time. Hoge continued publishing on the genetics of the fly eye including a paper discussing genes on the 3rd chromosome that had an effect on eye color. Hoge had married Aute Richards in 1917, and in 1920 he moved to the University of Oklahoma, where he became professor and head of the department of zoology and held various other positions until he retired in 1950. They remained in Oklahoma through the depths of the Great Depression, and one of the Public Works Administration projects started in 1934 was the construction of a new Biological Sciences building which was named Richards Hall in his honor. She was unable to work at the University of Oklahoma, presumably because of nepotism rules, and was only able to secure an assistant professorship for a year before she retired in 1948. Hoge Richards remained active in genetics despite the career limitations in Oklahoma. In 1925 she published a paper on the anatomy of the fly eye with and without the mutation she discovered in 1914. This paper showcased her very fine dissections of the fly head and revealed the extent to which the eye and adjacent neural structures were disrupted by mutations in the eyeless gene. This work established the physical scope of the eyeless gene and its role in development of various eye structures. In 1933, Hoge published a paper examining the heritability of allergies, which at the time was associated with migraines. Personal life and retirement Hoge married Aute Richards on December 19, 1917. They had two sons. After Aute's retirement from the University of Oklahoma, the couple moved to Tucson, Arizona, where they lived out their lives. She died on September 6, 1968, in Tucson.

It broadcast from September 16, 1968, to February 21, 1975, and throughout its existence served as the NBC affiliate for the Lafayette area; the station closed due to financial difficulties. KLNI-TV broadcast from studios on the Evangeline Thruway in Broussard, halfway between the two towns, and a transmitter near Youngsville. History The Federal Communications Commission granted Southwest Louisiana Communications, Inc., a construction permit for a new commercial television station on channel 15 in September 1967. The permit was awarded on a 4–2 FCC vote; two commissioners dissented because of minimum mileage spacing concerns to a channel 14 allocation at Morgan City. Construction proceeded quickly, and KLNI-TV went on air a year later, on September 16, 1968. A week later, Leif Erickson was the featured guest at the station's open house. KLNI-TV operated from the first color-designed television studios in the state of Louisiana, which featured a viewing room to allow the public to watch program production and an outdoor patio for shows and commercials. Channel 15 brought full NBC network service to Lafayette for the first time; previously, no NBC station put a Grade A signal into Lafayette. KLNI-TV also aired Sesame Street beginning in 1970, as Lafayette was not served by a public television station at the time. However, channel 15 faced an uphill climb as a UHF outlet in a television market that had two VHF stations (KATC and KLFY-TV). In 1969, the station filed an unsuccessful protest with the FCC when then-NBC affiliate WBRZ in Baton Rouge sought to increase its tower height, saying it would cause a signal overlap for over 82,000 people, up from 5,300. In 1970, the station sued the American Research Bureau ratings agency, seeking $625,000 in damages for having been wrongfully dropped from the November 1969 ARB survey; the KLNI-TV claimed the omission caused a loss of advertising income and damaged its reputation. When KPLC in Lake Charles and WBRZ activated taller towers in 1970 and 1971, respectively, the western and eastern parts of the Lafayette market received Grade B coverage from VHF NBC affiliates. In 1970, Charles A. Castille, former president of a chain of pharmacies in the Lafayette area, bought stock in Southwestern Louisiana Communications; he was also elected president of the board. In November 1974, Castille was elected to the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education; his opponent in that election believed a recall petition could be made against him because, among other allegations, he believed Castille was about to try and sell KLNI-TV to the state to reduce his debt. At that time, KLNI-TV was described as \\"financially troubled\\". On February 21, 1975, channel 15 went dark: while it cited technical issues in the immediate aftermath of going silent, it noted \\"severe financial troubles\\" as the reason for its cessation of operations in an FCC filing. The three remaining board members, not including Castille, then made an attempt to sell the facility to the state-owned Louisiana Educational Television Authority; the state network opted not to purchase the facility, citing technical limitations and noting it may have taken as long as two years to begin operating. Channel 15 would not be used again in Lafayette until a new group activated it as KADN-TV, which began telecasting March 1, 1980. It would be more than 40 years before an NBC affiliate was launched again in the Lafayette market, when KLAF-LD affiliated with NBC on July 1, 2015.

The plant (Ribes nigrum) was introduced by English settlers at the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 and was cultivated on some scale, particularly in New York. The plant acts as a host for the white pine blister rust that threatened the timber industry. In 1911, the Federal government banned the cultivation, sale and transport of blackcurrants to protect the white pine. Government programs systematically destroyed blackcurrant plants by chemical spraying. The federal ban was lifted in 1966 though many states maintained their own bans. Research showed that blackcurrants could be safely grown some distance from white pines and this, together with the development of rust-immune varieties and new fungicides, led to most states lifting their bans by 2003. Blackcurrants are now grown commercially in the Northeastern United States and the Pacific Northwest. Because of the long period of restrictions, blackcurrants are not popular in the United States and one researcher estimated that only 0.1% of Americans have eaten one.  History  A wild blackcurrant The blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) is a woody deciduous shrub native to Europe and part of the genus Ribes, together with other currants (e.g. red and white currants) and the gooseberry. Its stiff upright branches (\\"canes\\") bear flowers and small, black berries. The plant was introduced to North America by English settlers at the Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1629 and by the late 19th century there were some of Ribes in cultivation. New York was a center of Ribes production, accounting for of fruit production out of nationwide. The blackcurrant was not widely popular, being eclipsed by the red and white currants, and in 1925 their taste was described in The Small Fruits of New York as \\"a stinking and somewhat loathing savour\\". White pine blister rust on a Ribes plant The blackcurrant, in common with other Ribes, is a telial (secondary) host of the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). The aecial (primary) hosts of the rust are the five-needle pines, including the eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). The Ribes are largely unaffected by the rust but it significantly affects the growth of, and can kill, pines. The blackcurrant, of all the Ribes species, is particularly susceptible to the rust. In the early 1900s there were few fungicides available to treat the rust, which threatened the American lumber industry. In response to concerns the federal government banned the cultivation, sale and transport of blackcurrants in 1911 and funded a program of eradication by chemical spraying, later often carried out by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The scientific advice changed over the following decades and it is now believed that the white pine is affected by the rust only where blackcurrants are grown in close proximity in moist conditions. The federal ban on cultivation was lifted in 1966, with the individual states left to decide on management of the blackcurrant. Varieties of blackcurrant immune to white pine rust became available in the 1970s. Some of these were grown commercially in New York and were tolerated by conservation officials, though they were still legally banned. The ban in New York was lifted in mid-2002 after a campaign by a farmer who wanted to expand cultivation of the fruit. Though the white pine is now rarely used for lumber, the relaxation of the ban led to protests by some in the forestry industry.  Current restrictions  By 2003 restrictions on Ribes cultivation had been lifted across most of the states, though some bans remained, particularly on the blackcurrant. As of June 2020, bans remain on the books in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Virginia. The blackcurrant is banned in parts of Michigan, and Ohio bans only non-immune varieties. In New York, immune varieties can be grown anywhere while non- immune blackcurrants, which include some varieties most valued for their color and flavor, are permitted in designated areas. State laws are enforced with varying degrees of efficiency and enthusiasm; in some states, officials effectively ignore the ban. Nationally, a prohibition on the import of blackcurrant plants from Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and several EU countries remains. A special permit is required to import it from Chile. Current cultivation and use  A cultivated blackcurrant Skittles are currant flavored in the United Kingdom The cultivation of Ribes was adversely affected by the long period of restrictions and current agricultural use is hampered by the remaining bans. The plant was rarely seen in the United States outside of bushes in back yards until the national ban was lifted; by 2019 it was grown commercially in the Northeastern United States and the Pacific Northwest. The United States Department of Agriculture does not keep records of commercial blackcurrant production but lists them as an introduced species in the following areas: *Connecticut: Fairfield, Hartford and New London Counties *Illinois: Lake County *Maine: Knox, Penobscot and Somerset Counties *Maryland: whole state *Massachusetts: Essex, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk and Plymouth Counties *Michigan: Houghton and Washtenaw Counties *Minnesota: Kandiyohi, Lake, Ramsey and St. Louis Counties. *New Hampshire: Coös and Strafford Counties *New Jersey: Bergen, Sussex and Union Counties *New York: Cattaraugus, Chenango, Columbia, Erie, Franklin, Fulton, Nassau, Oswego and Rensselaer Counties *Ohio: whole state *Oregon: Wallowa County *Wisconsin: Brown, Dane and Waupaca Counties The fruit is not used widely in the United States, except perhaps for the liqueur crème de cassis. This is because of the difficulty in obtaining the fruit during its period of restriction. Danny L. Barney, a professor of horticulture at the University of Idaho, said in 2009: \\"People simply forgot about them... there's ignorance about what they are, and there are so many fruits available from all over the world at the supermarket\\". Marvin Pritts, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University, asserts that less than 0.1% of Americans have likely ever eaten a blackcurrant. Their rarity in the United States contrasts with the situation in Europe, which produces 99.1% of the world's blackcurrant crop, and where blackcurrant is a popular flavor of squash (cordial). Two thirds of European blackcurrant production is destined for the squash industry. In the United Kingdom, where blackcurrant squash gained popularity during World War II as a source of Vitamin C, the situation is even more pronounced – 90% of all British blackcurrant production is sold to the Ribena company. There were few commercial pine tree plantations in Europe and the blackcurrant was a historically important crop; Ribes has never been banned in European states. Because of the effects of the ban, purple Skittles are grape- flavored in the United States, whereas they are blackcurrant-flavored in the United Kingdom and some European countries.

He makes site-specific or interactive installations and sculptures, which are often made out of discarded or reclaimed waste materials, like bamboo, rope, tar or trashed metal. In Waqif's 2012 The New York Times profile, he was quoted as saying: \\"Contemporary Indian art is so disjointed from the public. It’s elitist. I want to connect with the average person in India.\\" In March 2020, he was named one of the 10 Indian artists shaping contemporary art by the online art platform Artsy. Biography Waqif was born in Hyderabad, India, and trained as an architect at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi. After graduating, he worked as an art director for TV shows and then moved into producing documentaries and independent films, before ultimately dedicating himself fully to his art practice. Career Waqif's debut solo show in Europe was held at Palais de Tokyo in December 2012, titled Bordel Monstre or \\"Monstrous Mess\\". He used detritus from previous exhibitions and repurposed it to create an immersive installation. In a review of the installation, American artist Robert Barry wrote in the frieze magazine: \\"Bordel Monstre is a fascinating exercise in making use of things otherwise neglected: constructed in a corner of the Palais de Tokyo which hasn’t previously been used, made out of materials discarded at the end of the previous exhibition. And if its exterior form resembles the damage wrought by a force of nature, its construction was as spontaneous and unplanned as the weather.\\". In 2017, Waqif's large-scale site-specific immersive installation, Salvage, was mounted in downtown Vancouver, in association with the Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada. Architectural in nature, it was assembled using doors, windows, roofs, tiles and wall sections, which were either sourced from demolition sites or discarded materials from local buildings.

He achieved a place of prominence through his small scale paintings and drawings that push the limits of visual language. Early life and education Nozkowski spent his youth in the New Jersey suburbs, admiring New York culture from afar before moving there in 1961. His father worked in an Alcoa Aluminum factory and then as a postman. His mother worked in factories and as a bookkeeper. One of his aunts was a schoolteacher who gave him and his younger sister art supplies. When he was a senior in high school he won a scholarship to attend a painting class at New York University's School of Education, where he studied with Robert Kaupelis and Hale Woodruff. While he earned his BFA at Cooper Union, Nozkowski was making sculptures. He graduated in 1967. He later transitioned to painting, and exhibited some of his earliest works in group shows at the storied Betty Parsons Gallery. Career In the early 1970s, after several years of making large scale paintings Nozkowski reacted to the macho scale of both Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism, and decided to work small, and on the easel — initially painting on 16-by-22-inch pieces of art-store canvas board. By 1979, he had found an audience for his work in New York. Through a number of solo exhibitions at 55 Mercer Gallery and Rosa Esman Gallery in the 1980s, along with The Museum of Modern Art acquiring his work in 1982, his reputation for creating evocative drawings, prints, and paintings was solidified.https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/thomas-nozkowski/ For more than four decades, Nozkowski painted almost every day, often in his studio in upstate New York. He had over 80 one-person shows of his work, most recently at the Pace Gallery which has represented him since 2008. Among his significant exhibitions were surveys at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1987, Ludwig Museum in 2007 and Fisher Landau Center in 2008. Nozkowski appeared in the main exhibition at the 2007 Venice Biennale curated by Rob Storr. He was the subject of a retrospective of works on paper at the New York Studio School in 2003 and a career retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada in 2009. Other exhibitions include, 70 Years of Abstract Painting - Excerpts, 2011, curated by Stephanie Buhmann at Jason McCoy Gallery, New York.http://theholenyc.com/wp- content/uploads/2009/11/TheBrooklynRail_ABSTRACT-PAINTING-The-New- Casualists_June_2011.pdf His work was written about and admired by art critics including Peter Schjeldahl, Marjorie Welish, John Yau and Robert Storr.. Achievements Nozkowski's long career includes achievements such as a 1993 Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts, a 1999 award for painting from The American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 2008, the President's Citation of Cooper Union. In 2010, Nozkowski was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters.

These glands are structurally and histologically similar to the main lacrimal gland. Glands of Krause are located in the stroma of the conjunctival fornix, and the glands of Wolfring are located along the orbital border of the tarsal plate. These glands are oval and display numerous acini. The acini are surrounded, sometimes incompletely, by a row of myoepithelial cells. Animal studies suggest that the ducts of Wolfring glands have a tortuous course and open onto the palpebral conjunctiva. Like the main lacrimal gland, the accessory lacrimal glands are also densely innervated, but they lack parasympathetic innervation. These glands are exocrine glands, responsible for the basal (unstimulated) secretion of the middle aqueous layer of the tear film. 20 to 40 glands of Krause are found in the upper fornix, and 6-8 glands appear in the lower fornix. There are usually 2 to 5 Ciaccio's glands, and are found along the superior tarsal border of the upper eye lid. Popov’s glands are located within the substance of the caruncle. Function Previously it was thought that the Main lacrimal gland is responsible for reflex tear secretion and The accessory lacrimal glands of Wolfring and Krause are responsible for the basal secretion. But recent evidence suggests that all tearing may be reflex. The accessory glands account for approximately 10% of the total lacrimal secretory mass. History Ciaccio's glands are named after Italian anatomist Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio (1824–1901), who described these glands in 1874. They are sometimes called \\"Wolfring's glands\\" after Polish ophthalmologist Emilj von Wolfring (1832-1906), who described them during the same time period as did Ciaccio.

It follows their escapades such as the difficulties in getting the tree inside a public bus, on the back of a jeep, and carrying it through villages and rescuing it from a river. Directed by Jim Clark and written by Ed Harper and Michael Barnes, it stars William Burleigh, Kate Nicholls and Anthony Honour, with an early role for Brian Blessed as a policeman. Plot A trio of children are given the task of transporting a Christmas tree to a London hospital for Christmas. They narrowly manage to get it onto a bus, much to the disdain of other passengers and then it is carried on the back of a jeep while they hitch a ride on a motorcycle. They carry it through rural villages, and accidentally drop it in a river, leading them to rescue it. They hitch a ride in an American car, which turns out to be driven by robbers. Hearing a description of them over the radio, the children disperse the stolen money out the back door window while travelling through a village, leading to their arrest. The Christmas tree finds itself on a tank on military property, 30 miles from London before finally reaching its destination thanks to an army bus of soldiers and a truck. The film ends at St Vincent's Hospital with the children and a bespectacled Santa singing carols by the repaired and now well-decorated tree.

The hall is a Grade I listed building, and the adjacent earthworks are a scheduled monument. The building, within a moat, consists of a 15th-century gatehouse and a house of the late 19th and early 20th century. History The de Scales family had the lordship of the manor from the reign of Henry II in the 12th century. The gatehouse was built about 1455 by Thomas Scales, 7th Baron Scales. It is thought that a house was begun, adjacent to the gatehouse, by him and continued by his daughter Elizabeth Scales, 8th Baroness Scales and her husband Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers. Elizabeth died without issue in 1473: Woodville was executed in 1483 by order of Richard Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III). The manor was subsequently granted to John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth. Prints of drawings of the 18th and early 19th century show the gatehouse standing to full height but roofless, and fragments of a ruined building on its left. In 1856 the property was bought by Sir Lewis Whincop Jarvis (1816–1888), a prominent citizen of King's Lynn and head of the local bank Jarvis and Jarvis. Between 1864 and 1876 he restored the gatehouse and built an adjacent house. After his death the property was sold.\\"No 65: 1889 – 1896 (Lacon, Youell & Co.) (Edward A.

The first floor has a central oriel window and bears the coat of arms of Anthony Woodville. To the west of the gatehouse, on the south and west sides of the island, are the later buildings. There are earthworks east of the moat: two rectangular fishponds can be discerned about east of the moat, and north-east of the ponds is a rectangular platform, north to south by west to east, thought to be the site of a dovecote.

He was one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Party and its first president. Later he was the founder and president of the Popular Christian Party (PPC). He was a senator of the Republic on four occasions and once a constitutional deputy (1979). Early life He was born to Miguel Ángel Polar Vargas and Esther Ugarteche. He studied at the National College of American Independence and at the Arévalo Institute in his hometown, completing his secondary studies with honors. His higher studies were completed at the National University of Saint Augustine in Arequipa, where he graduated with a doctorate in Philosophy and Letters. From a very young age he devoted himself to teaching, teaching at various secondary schools in Arequipa (including the Colegio de la Independencia) and, later, at the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Universidad San Agustín. He played an important role in the birth of the National Democratic Front. At that time, he met Luis Bedoya Reyes and other future associates and co-thinkers, who were then members of the \\"Independent Youth\\", a civic movement that supported President Bustamante y Rivero. He was appointed economic and cultural adviser to the Peruvian embassy in Santiago, Chile (1946) and later was the adviser of economic affairs for the Peruvian embassy in Buenos Aires. However, his diplomatic career was cut short when President Bustamante and Rivero were overthrown by the 1948 coup. He returned to Arequipa, where he returned to pursue secondary and university education. He was also manager of the local chamber of commerce. In 1950 he resumed political activity as general secretary of the nascent Democratic League in Arequipa, which faced hardship during the dictatorship of Manuel A. Odría. He was accused of sedition; however, the judicial proceedings initiated against him did not move forward. At the end of 1955 he was the first general secretary of the Christian Democratic Movement formed in Arequipa, and following that, he participated in the Arequipa revolution of 1955, which caused the fall of the Minister Alejandro Esparza Zañartu, a fact that accelerated the end of the odriista dictatorship. When the Christian Democratic Party was founded in Lima on January 10, 1956, Mario Polar was elected as its president, with Luis Bedoya Reyes as secretary general. That same year he was elected senator for Arequipa (1956-1962). [1] He stood for reelection in 1962, but that year's elections were thwarted by the coup d'état of General Ricardo Pérez Godoy. New general elections were called in 1963, in which his party participated in alliance with Acción Popular, founded by architect Fernando Belaúnde Terry, which obtained victory. Polar was elected Second Vice President of the Republic and senator from Lima. When the Popular Christian Party (PPC) was born on December 18, 1966, split from the Christian Democratic Party, Polar became one of its main leaders, along with personalities such as Luis Bedoya Reyes, Ernesto Alayza Grundy, Antonio Espinoza Laña, Emilio Castañón Pasquel, Honorio Delgado, Juan Chaves Molina, Roberto Ramírez del Villar and others. He had a great affinity with Ernesto Alayza. During the military government from 1968 to 1980, he remained in opposition,calling for democratic elections, through articles published in the magazine Free opinion (1976-1980). He was elected deputy of the PPC to the Constituent Assembly of 1978, and served as one of the main writers of the 1979 Constitution, where he included the chapter referring to \\"Fundamental Rights and Duties of a Person\\". He was elected senator for the period 1980 to 1985,and was reelected for the period 1985 to 1990, but he died in office in 1988. References * Tauro del Pino, Alberto: Enciclopedia Ilustrada del Perú.

It replaced the existing 1865 Isle of Man Companies Act and closely follows a template based on the English Companies Act 1929. Although the original 1931 Act still contains the majority of the operative provisions, it has been amended and supplemented by various additional Companies Acts and other relevant legislation over the years. Companies in the Isle of Man can also be formed under the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 and the Isle of Man Limited Liability Companies Act 1996.  Introduction  As a result of its close relationship to the English Companies Act 1929, the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931-2004 follows the traditional English corporate framework for establishing companies. Companies formed under the 1931 Act can be limited by shares, limited by guarantee, be limited by guarantee and have share capital and have share capital with unlimited liability.  Background  Despite the enactment of the Limited Liability Companies Act 1996 and the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 - which is both more modern and flexible, the 1931 Act remains the Act of choice for most locally incorporated businesses in the Isle of Man. The principal reason for this is one of cost as unlike the other Manx companies acts the 1931 Act does not require the appointment of a professional Registered Agent who must be licensed by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority.  Incorporation  In order to incorporate a 1931 Act Company, it is necessary to file an Isle of Man Registry Form 1, a Memorandum of association and Articles of association at the Isle of Man Companies Registry together with the prescribed fee  General Provisions  *Private and Public Companies: 1931 Act companies are designated as either public or private companies. Private companies are not permitted to offer their shares or debentures to the public. * Corporate Form: 1931 Act Companies can be incorporated as (i) Companies limited by shares, (ii) Companies limited by guarantee, (iii) Companies limited by shares and guarantee, (iv) Unlimited companies with shares or (v) Unlimited Companies without shares * Company names: 1931 Act companies with private limited liability must have one of the following endings Limited or Ltd and public limited companies must be suffixed with Public Limited Company or PLC * Registered office: Every Company incorporated under the 1931-2004 Act is required to have its registered office in the Isle of Man. * Directors: Companies formed under the 1931 Act must have two or more Directors who must be natural persons. * Secretary: Companies formed under the 1931 Act must appoint a Company Secretary who may be a natural person or a corporate entity. * Corporate Capacity: The Isle of Man Companies Act 1986 amended the 1931 Act so that companies enjoy “all the rights, powers and privileges of an individual\\". * Members: Single member companies permitted. Shares may be issued fractionally. Shares of nil Par value and Bearer shares are not permitted *Annual General Meetings: Unless dispensed with under relevant regulations, s11 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931 requires every 1931 Act Company to hold an Annual general meeting within 15 months of incorporation of the company and then at least every calendar year. * Offering documents: Requirements relating to offering documents are set out in s34-38 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931 . Directors are required to ensure that any Offer fairly and accurately sets out all available material information that the intended recipients would reasonably expect to be included in order to enable them to make an informed decision as to whether or not to accept the Offer. * Capital Maintenance: There are various categories of non distributable reserves. * Accounting records: 1931 Act Companies are required to keep reliable accounting records, and to prepare annual financial statements, The detailed requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Companies Act 1982. * Filing Requirements: There are relatively complex filing requirements for 1931 Act companies. The following information is available on the public record maintained by the Isle of Man Registrar of Companies. This includes, but is not limited to (i) Names and addresses of Directors, (ii) Name and address of Secretary, (iv) Register of members, (v) Returns of allotments (vi) Register of Charges, (vii) Offering documents (viii) Financial Statements (public companies and subsidiaries only). * Corporate restructuring including transfer of domicile: Isle of Man Companies incorporated under the 1931-2004 Act Companies can re-register under the 2006 Act.

He represented the Hawke's Bay province and Auckland in rugby union before switching to rugby league in 1924. He was selected for the New Zealand team in 1925 becoming Kiwi number 174 in the process. His grandson was also named John Kirwan and he went on to become a famous All Black in the 1980s and 90s before also switching to rugby league.  Early life  Kirwan was born John Patrick Kirwan on 31 March 1896 in Reefton on the West Coast of the South Island. It was common at the time for ‘John’s to become known as ‘Jack’ and so John Kirwan was better known as Jack Kirwan throughout his life. His parents were Kate and Robert Kirwan. Kirwan had 3 brothers and 4 sisters; Michael, Ellen, Mary, Kate, Anastasia, Robert, and Edward. Kirwan was a telegraphist who worked in Tokomaru Bay on the East Coast of the North Island in 1914 when he was 18 years of age. He was then transferred to Napier. After serving in World War 1 he returned to New Zealand and began working at the Dannevirke Post Office.  Rugby beginnings on the East Coast  Jack Kirwan moved to Tokomaru on the East Coast of the North Island in November 1914 where he began working at the local post office. During the 1914/15 summer he played cricket for Tokomaru Bay and then began playing for the Tokomaru City rugby union team in the Turnbill Cup against Waima and Wanderers. He scored tries in games against Wanderers on 8 May, and Waima on 5 July. Kirwan was aged 19 by this time and in the match with Wanderers it was said that “a conspicuous feature of the game was the brilliant football played by Jack Kirwan (City). It was admitted by the most competent judges that a better exhibition had not been seen on this ground”. Kirwan was then selected for the Waiapu representative team to play against Tolaga Bay. In September Kirwan was fare-welled at a function in his honour at the Magnet boarding house. He had proved to be a very popular figure in the local Tokomaru community. He was being promoted and transferred to Napier.  World War I  World War 1 was well underway and Kirwan enlisted in the New Zealand Army on 26 June 1916 aged 20. He trained at the Featherston Military Camp before leaving New Zealand for Europe on 2 January 1917. Featherston Camp (1916) Around the time Kirwan was based there Kirwan managed to play some rugby while serving. He played for the South Island New Zealand Forces Army team against the North Island on 4 May 1919 in a match his side won 10–6. Kirwan was stationed in Western Europe, predominantly France serving in the New Zealand Field Artillery. In December 1918 he was promoted to Bombardier. Tragedy struck Kirwan and his family in early January 1919 when his sister Anastasia passed away after contracting influenza during the tail end of the 1918 pandemic. She had been caring for the sick during this time and was aged just 24. Kirwan was promoted again to corporal on 15 January after fighting in the war had ceased. While the New Zealand troops remained in Europe, Kirwan played rugby games for some of the NZ army teams which traveled around playing matches. One such match was played for the New Zealand Army team stationed at Sutton against the New Zealanders from Brocton in early April and he scored a try in a 22–0 win. On 16 November 1919 he boarded the Arawa to return to New Zealand, arriving home on 16 December 1919. He was then discharged having served for 3 years and 174 days in total including 2 years and 321 days overseas. Kirwan received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Playing careerMove to Dannevirke and Hawke’s Bay rugby side= After being discharged Kirwan went immediately to Dannevirke where he resumed his career working in the Post Office as a telegraphist. He played for the Dannevirke Old Boys rugby club throughout the 3 years he was to spend there. He was selected to play for Southern Hawke's Bay against Northern Hawke's Bay on 10 July. In a description of the match Kirwan was said to be a “prominent member of the backs” in a match his side lost 6-0 before being selected to make his Hawke's Bay debut against Taranaki. The match was played on 22 July, 1920 in New Plymouth with Hawke's Bay winning 8–6. In 1921 Kirwan played further matches for Hawke's Bay against Wairarapa on 2 July and Manawatu on 6 July. He was then selected in the combined Hawke's Bay-Poverty Bay team to play against the touring South African international side. The match was a hard-fought one on 3 September at McLean Park in Napier before a crowd of 7,500. Kirwan played in the centres in a 14–8 loss. Playing alongside Kirwan was Bill Te Whata who would also like Kirwan switch to rugby league and represent New Zealand. In 1922 Kirwan played 7 matches for the Hawke's Bay side. The first was against Wairarapa which was won 17–3. Kirwan then appeared in their famous 19-9 Ranfurly Shield win over Wellington on 10 August. Kirwan scored 2 tries in the win. He was selected for the Hawke's Bay southern tour which involved matches against Otago, Southland, and Canterbury. They lost to Otago 11–8 at Carisbrook before a crowd of 11,000 though the Ranfurly Shield was not on the line for any of these matches. Hawke's Bay lost again 11–3 to Southland with 4,000 spectators looking on in Invercargill. Before finishing the tour with a 29–3 win over Canterbury. He finished the representative season off with a defence of the Ranfurly Shield against Bay of Plenty at Nelson Park in Hastings which they won narrowly 17–16. This was followed by another defence against King Country at McLean Park, Napier. In front of a crowd of 4,000 they won easily 42–8 with Kirwan scoring a try. In 1924 Kirwan played in a 6–0 loss to Wairarapa on 21 July, and then a 10–6 win over Wellington in their second shield defence of the season at McLean Park in Napier before a crowd of 6,000. Kirwan was playing in the three-quarters outside George Nepia who was five eighth along with Lui Paewai. Kirwan then missed a Southern Hawke's Bay match with Manawatu and a Hawke's Bay match with Poverty Bay as he was battling the flu before being selected to play against the touring New South Wales side. The team Kirwan was in was a combined East Coast-Poverty Bay-Hawke's Bay side and they won comfortably by 32 points to 15. Kirwan then finished his season by playing in the Ranfurly Shield defences over Horowhenua on 8 September which they won 38–11, and over Auckland which was won 20–5. The match with Auckland was played in front of a huge crowd of 10,000 and Kirwan was heavily involved in several attacking raids. It was Hawke's Bay's last shield defence of the year. Two weeks later Kirwan traveled with the Hawke's Bay team to Auckland to play a return match at the Auckland Domain. The crowd numbered 22,000. Auckland reversed the earlier result winning by 17 to 9 in a match which raised £1000 for the construction of the nearby Auckland War Memorial Museum which had construction on it begin in 1929. Following the conclusion of the season Kirwan was transferred from the Dannevirke Post Office to the Auckland Chief Post Office located at the present day Britomart in the Auckland CBD. =Move to Auckland, Marist Old Boys rugby and Auckland debuts= Kirwan joined the Marist Brothers Old Boys rugby club who played in the Auckland Rugby Union competition. He debuted for them on 26 April in a match with College Rifles which his side won 6–3. He was then selected in the Auckland Provincial team to play his former Hawke's Bay side. The match acting as a trial for the All Blacks side. The match was played at Eden Park before a crowd of 12,000. Kirwan set up the Auckland Province side's first try with a reverse pass to Bert Cooke who scored under the posts. He did the same later in the match, reversing a pass back to Bill Wright who scored to make the score 15–6 with his team going on to win 18–9. Kirwan then gained a place in the North Islands Probables v Possibles match which was played in Wellington on 21 May. The rest of the first half of Kirwan's season was spent playing for his Marist side in the local club competition. In total he played 7 matches for them and scored 2 tries and games against Grafton and College Rifles. On 23 July he went back to his family in Reefton due to “family affairs” and after he returned he played in 7 matches for the Auckland representative side through August and September. They were against Waikato (9-5), North Auckland (11-8), Hawke's Bay (6-23), Wairarapa (18-15), Wellington (9-8), Wanganui (8-10), and Taranaki (17-12). The match against Hawke's Bay was a Ranfurly Shield challenge with Kirwan kicking a drop goal on his old ‘home field’ of McLean Park, Napier. Kirwan was reportedly unhappy with the lack of compensation provided for players in the representative team who often had to take time off work to play thus resulting in a loss in wages. This is cited at one of the main reasons Kirwan then transferred to the rugby league code which was much more proactive in compensating its players for any loss in wages through playing the game. =Switch to Rugby League= In mid to late September Kirwan switched codes and joined the Marist Old Boys rugby league team. He made his debut for Marist in the championship final against Devonport United. The move caused some controversy with a New Zealand Herald article stating that “his inclusion was the source of a good deal of comment, and it is thought by many that, in the circumstances, the fact that he took part in a game with a direct bearing on the championship, was not according to the ethics of true sportsmanship”. Kirwan scored a try in a 20–17 win on Carlaw Park in front of an enormous crowd of 17,000 which was a club record for Auckland Rugby League at that time. It was said that Kirwan's “presence was probably the deciding factor in giving Marist their narrow win”. His try helped give Marist a 10–7 lead after he received a pass from Lyall Stewart and scored in the corner. The Auckland Star further discussed the controversy saying “the sole topic of conversation in … both League and Rugby since Saturday last has been the playing of Kirwan in the Marist Bros. team, and while the majority of followers hold the opinion that it was hardly the fair thing that Kirwan should be played…, others again hold that the Tykes were not only entitled to do so, but did what any other team would have done had they been similarly placed…”. The club freely admitting “that for some time they had been endeavouring to get Kirwan to come over to League.” Devonport were also trying to secure rugby players to join their side including Tonkin, Matson (Ponsonby) and Neil Ifwerson (Grammar). Kirwan played two more matches for Marist before the season end. A loss to Devonport in the Roope Rooster competition and a 10–10 drawn match with City Rovers as part of the Labour Day celebrations. In 1925 Kirwan appeared in nine matches for Marist Old Boys scoring 5 tries. The Marist season was over shadowed by the death of Bill Stormont who passed away after battling rheumatic heart disease. At the end of the season Marist played for the newly created Stormont Shield to memorialise Stormont which is still played for today. Kirwan scored a try but it could not prevent a Marist lost 23–22 to Ponsonby United. In June Kirwan was selected to play for the North Island team against the South Island. North Island won 27–9 and following the match, which was part of a series of trials at Carlaw Park on the same day, Kirwan was selected in the New Zealand side to tour Australia. He was chosen in the three quarters along with Lou Brown, Hec Brisbane, Frank Delgrosso, and Jim Parkes. New Zealand played 12 matches on the tour with Kirwan playing in 7 of them. He was part of the side which lost to New South Wales 4–7 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 24,000 spectators. He was on the losing side again when New Zealand went down to an Australian Universities XIII 13–15. Kirwan scored a try in a 31–20 win over the Far North Coast side in Lismore before playing in the 20–29 loss to Queensland in Brisbane before a crowd of 10,000. His other three matches were in a 14–16 loss to Toowoomba, an historic 19–18 win over New South Wales, and a 25–26 loss to a Southern Division side in Cootamundra where he scored two tries. The match with New South Wales was before a crowd of 15,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground who saw Kirwan make a break and sent Jim Parkes in for a try which gave New Zealand the lead. Kirwan arrived back in New Zealand on 25 August on board the Moeraki and 4 days later played for New Zealand against Auckland. New Zealand won before 15,000 by 41 to 17 at Carlaw Park. The Queensland side that New Zealand had met on tour had arrived in New Zealand to play 11 matches of their own. Kirwan played against them for New Zealand at Carlaw Park on 5 September with New Zealand winning 25–24. On 9 September he wore an Auckland jersey against the tourists. This was his first ever appearance for the Auckland league representative side and the match was drawn 18–18. He again played Queensland for New Zealand but this time they were well beaten 35–14. Kirwan crossed for a try after making a break, kicking ahead, and winning the race to the ball. He was later awarded an “obstruction try” after Craig tackled a player without the ball after a break had been made a certain try would have been scored. In 1926 Kirwan played 8 matches for Marist scoring 5 tries though the key focus for the representative players this year was in gaining selection for the New Zealand tour to England. Kirwan played in a match for Auckland against South Auckland on 26 June which Auckland won easily 49–15. He was then chosen for the North Island team to play the South Island a week later on 3 July. Kirwan scored a try after bursting straight through to score under the posts and give the North a 16–9 lead. He threw the final pass for Ben Davidson to score and he did the same for Bert Avery. He then played for the New Zealand Probables against the New Zealand Possibles with his side losing 15–32 though the Herald noted that he “was the soundest of the inside backs”. =1926–27 New Zealand tour of England= Kirwan was named in the New Zealand team to tour England though there was an issue with him securing leave for the tour. This was eventually resolved however and he departed with the team on 3 August on board the Aorangi. The tour stopped off in Fiji where during a training session Kirwan lost a large amount of skin from his wrist and elbow on the dirt fields there which was requiring daily treatment to heal. Unfortunately for Kirwan and the New Zealand team the tour was plagued by issues between management and players throughout. A group of 7 forwards went on strike during the tour over issues regarding their treatment off the field, selection issues, and a poor relationship with coach Ernest Mair. New Zealand played 34 matches in total with Kirwan playing in 18 of them. He played in the tour opener against Dewsbury which was a 13–9 win on 11 September in front of 16,000, before appearing again against Halifax 7 days later with New Zealand losing 13–19. He was not selected for the next four matches before playing against York on 9 October. Kirwan scored a try in a 19–11 win but he injured a muscle and was out for 4 weeks and 7 matches while he recovered. The selectors decided to rest captain Bert Avery and chose Kirwan to lead the side in their match with Salford on 3 November. New Zealand won the match by 18 to 10. Kirwan scored a try in an 8–10 loss against Huddersfield on 6 November before being selected to play in the centres against England in the second test at Hull. Kirwan was said to have played well though New Zealand went down 21 to 11 meaning they had lost the series after losing the first test earlier. He played in games with Wigan Highfield and Batley won 14–2 and lost 17–19 respectively. His next appearance was off the bench in the test with Wales on 4 December at Pontypridd. New Zealand was soundly beaten by 34 points to 8. Kirwan was part of the side which went down 12–22 to St Helens before a big 36–15 win over Wigan though Kirwan had to leave the field injured. He had earlier switched to the fullback position after Charles Gregory was injured and Kirwan's own injury occurred when he was tackling Sullivan as he scored. He was badly cut over the right eye and was “bleeding profusely” having to leave the field to receive 3 stitches. He missed the next two matches but with a large number of New Zealand's players on strike or injured by this point of the tour he was again selected to play against Pontypridd on Christmas Day. The tour was 27 matches and 14 weeks old prior to the Pontypridd match and he was to played in the final 6 matches of the tour including the 3rd and final test against England on 15 January in Leeds. New Zealand lost 17–32 in wet conditions in front of 8,000 spectators. The tour was now at an end and the team returned to New Zealand, arriving in Auckland on 1 March 1927. =Return to Marist and Auckland= Less than a month after arriving home from a rugby league season which had effectively lasted 9 months Kirwan was picked to play in a New Zealand team composed of the Auckland members of the touring side minus Kirwan's Marist teammate Arthur Singe who had been banned for life for his role in the strike on tour. Kirwan's side was to play against the local Auckland team at Carlaw Park and before a large crowd of 14,000 the ‘New Zealand’ side lost 21–24. By now Kirwan was aged 32 and the match against Auckland was to be the last representative match of his career. The Marist team of 1928 who won the Roope Rooster, Stormont Shield and Labour Day Cup. Jack Kirwan is third from the left in the middle rowHe played 12 games for Marist in the 1927 season. In March 1928 at the Marist annual general meeting he was elected auditor and assistant secretary for the club. He had retired from the playing field and said “I think we have done our bit… and the aim of the club now is to give the most promising of the juniors a chance.” At a dinner for the touring England team on 4 August Kirwan was presented with a medallion for being a “loyalist” on the 1927–27 tour of England. Weeks later Kirwan decided to pull on the green and gold Marist jersey once again and he played in a match against City Rovers which Marist won 14–10. He then played in Marist's successful Roope Rooster campaign where they beat Richmond Rovers 14–9, Devonport United 10–5, and Ponsonby United to claim the title. He then played 4 further matches in the Labour Day competition which stretched over two weekends. Marist won all 4 matches over Huntly, Ellerslie, City Rovers, and Richmond Rovers to win the tournament. He now permanently retired from playing. Rugby league retirement and personal LifeCoaching and administrative career= The 1932 Marist team who won the Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield with coach Jack Kirwan seated front right and his son Patrick who was the team mascot on the floor At the end of the 1928 season Kirwan permanently hung up his boots. He was elected to the Marist board throughout the 1930s and 40s in the secretary and honorary secretary position. In 1932 he coached the side to the Stormont Shield and Roope Rooster. In 1945 he was chosen to be an Auckland representative selector along with J Clark and Dougie McGregor. =Personal life and death= Kirwan was a member of the Roman Catholic church. He married Morven McDonald Fergus on 10 October 1925. Jack Kirwan died aged 72 on 20 October 1968. His next of kin was named as Mr. Patrick Kirwan (his son) of Mangere. Jack Kirwan's grandson John Kirwan played 142 times for the Auckland rugby team and 63 times for the All Blacks before switching to rugby league in the mid 1990s. He then played for the New Zealand Warriors 35 times and later returned to the rugby code coaching Italy, Japan, and the Blues team in the Super Rugby competition.

Her contemptuous attitude towards the fascist regime earned her repeated admonishments at school and interrogations at the police headquarters. Following school, Terradura studied law at the University of Perugia.

They are composed of multiple species of moss and can also host other species, such as nematode worms, springtails, and water bears. Although what preconditions are necessary for glacier mice to form has yet to be determined, they have been observed in Alaska, Chile, Iceland, Svalbard, and Venezuela. In at least some cases, glacier mice apparently reproduce asexually due to the effect of the harsh glacier environment on traditional moss reproduction strategies. Glacier mice are notable for their movement across the ice, which appears to be non-random, taking the form of herd-like behavior. This movement is as yet unexplained, and does not appear to be solely the product of wind, or the direction of a slope. The use of accelerometers has demonstrated that glacier mice do in fact rotate and roll, rather than simply sliding across the ice, over time exposing all of their surfaces. Measurements of glacier mice show that they retain heat and moisture, creating a suitable ecosystem for microorganisms that otherwise could not live on a glacier. Glacier mice were first described in 1950 by Icelandic meteorologist Jón Eyþórsson, who referred to them as jökla-mýs, which is Icelandic for \\"glacier mice.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:Glaciers Category:Mosses ","title":"Glacier mice"},{"id":"64060845","text":"A negotiation class is a newly proposed procedural device intended to encourage settlement when there are large numbers of plaintiffs with claims against the same defendants. It is a type of class action and, as such, requires judicial approval before it can be used.  Description  The negotiation class was recently developed and proposed by scholars Francis McGovern and William Rubenstein in their article \\"The Negotiation Class: A Cooperative Approach to Class Actions Involving Large Stakeholders.\\" It is a special type of class action that is especially intended for claims by public entities with varying amounts of damages. Just like any other class action, a negotiation class must meet all of the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In particular, this includes satisfying 23(a)'s prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy, and 23(b)(3)'s predominance and superiority requirements. The negotiation class tries to solve the problem of 'large value opt-outs,' This is a situation where plaintiffs with the highest damages leave the class to instead litigate individually, because they believe individual litigation will be more profitable than receiving some unknown settlement amount. These opt-outs result in defendants becoming far less likely to settle with the remaining class members, as they know that settlement will not bring 'global peace.' In other words, even if they settle with the class, they will still have to deal with expensive lawsuits in the future from high-value plaintiffs. The negotiation class hopes to get rid of this opt-out problem by, in effect, letting all of the plaintiffs know what share of the settlement they will receive before they start negotiating with the defendant. By doing so, the class will become set before negotiations begin, ideally with the high-value plaintiffs as part of the class because they are satisfied with their share. The exact process for the negotiation class can be broken down into five steps: 1) determining the share for each plaintiff; 2) asking the judge to certify the class under 23(b)(3); 3) providing notice to all of the potential class members of their share; 4) negotiations between plaintiffs and defendants to reach a settlement; 5) a vote by all members of the class on the settlement reached, which requires a supermajority to pass.  Cases  The negotiation class has only been used in one case so far. It was first certified by Judge Dan Polster in the Northern District of Ohio for claims by the governmental entities in the Opioid Multidistrict Litigation (MDL).Order Certifying Negotiation Class and Approving Notice, In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation (N.D. Ohio 2019) (No. 17-2804), https://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/sites/ohnd/files/2591_0.pdf In the certification order, Judge Polster determined that the Opioid MDL met all of the Rule 23 requirements, and that the device provided needed flexibility to try to achieve settlement in this particular case. The MDL is comprised solely of public entities, cities and counties, with varying amounts of damages, reflecting how hard their citizens have been affected by the opioid epidemic. As of May 25, 2020, this certification is on appeal before the Sixth Circuit.  Criticism  This is relatively new proposal, so as of May 2020, there has not been very extensive criticism. The main criticisms can be found in the brief appealing the negotiation class certification and a blog post by a prominent legal scholar in the field of civil procedure. In appellants' brief challenging the certification, Part I specifically addresses the flaws in the negotiation class device itself. The main arguments put forward are that: 1) the negotiation class is inconsistent with the text of Rule 23; 2) its design gets rid of important procedural protections intended to help absent class members; and 3) its certification removes much of the bargaining power from plaintiffs and instead gives it to defendants. These are the arguments the Sixth Circuit will presumably address. In Professor Tidmarsh's criticism, he points out that a lot of the important details regarding the voting mechanism are missing from the proposal. He further explains that some \\"theoretical underpinnings\\" are flawed, as well as the practical means of evaluating claims. Specifically, he points out that parties' claims do not just differ by claim amount, but also by the relative strength and weakness, which is not factored into determining shares among class members. He ends by predicting that the Supreme Court will look unfavorably on this \\"novel project.\\"  See also  Class action Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Multidistrict Litigation  References  ","title":"Negotiation Class"},{"id":"64060856","text":"The 1923 Temple Owls football team was an American football team that represented Temple University as an independent during the 1923 college football season.

In 1976, the scheme was officially established by the government with funding from the Chinese government which was completed in 1984. Doho rice scheme is a 2500 Hectares irrigation scheme, sustaining not less than 10,000 farmers both out-growers and part of the scheme's growers. Most of the scheme was formerly a seasonal wetland on the River Manafwa flood-plain. The scheme is now an area of intensive irrigated rice cultivation with adjacent areas of natural wetland, mainly in the south.

The main settlement is located on the west back of the Mangahao River, south and west of Woodville and 11 km north- west of Pahiatua. Tararua Wind Farm, the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere, is located in the area. The Ballance area includes part of the Manawatū Gorge west of Woodville, including the Ballance Bridge on State Highway 3. The Manawatu Gorge Track extends from Ballance in the east to the outskirts of Palmerston North in the west. HistoryEuropean settlement= The settlement was founded in 1886 as one of several government- sponsored special settlements, established under a scheme of Land Minister John Ballance. It was named after Ballance, a Liberal Party politician who later went on to become Premier. By 1890, the area was still covered in dense forest. The Ballance Co-operative Dairy Company established a butter factory near the township which became central to the township's economy and identity. A hundred tons of prime butter was being produced by the factory each year. Factory manager Thomas Broome was born in Christchurch in 1864, and had learned butter and cheese making in Lincoln and Dunedin. A photograph, taken about 1895, shows two men standing outside the factory in front of suppliers with horses, wagons, milk cans and carts. The Ballance Public School was established in 1891. By September 1896, it had a headmaster and teacher, a roll of 82, and an average attendance of 64. Headmaster Andrew Anderson had been born in Edinburgh, Scotland, educated in Geelong, Victoria, and had arrived in New Zealand in 1874. By 1897, Ballance also had about a dozen houses, and a Weslayan Church and public hall built by volunteers. It connected to Pahiatua by a high-quality but narrow road, via the Mangatainoka Bridge, still incomplete Pahiatua railway station, a windy hilly stretch of road, Mangahao Valley, and Mangahao bridge. It also had a store and post office run by Thomas Murphy, a native of Kerry, Ireland who had arrived in New Zealand in 1866 and also farmed 114 acres with dairy cows. =Ballance Bridge= The original wooden Ballance Bridge was designed by James Fulton and opened by the Premier Richard Seddon and opened in 1904. It was closed in 1968 due to safety issues, and demolished on 23 February 1972. A new iron-concrete Ballance Bridge was opened in 1971. Two bluffs had to be removed for the new bridge. =Recent history= In early 2004, a once-in-a-century flood took out fences, and covered dairy farms in silt. An entry in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, published in 2007, says Ballance has \\"failed to thrive\\" as John Ballance had originally intended. In March 2009, Massey University student Catherine Peters died while jumping from the bridge when her rope came loose from her harness. The director of the company overseeing the jump was charged with manslaughter. He was found guilty in an emotionally-charged trial in June 2010. Education Ballance School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . The school is surrounded by farms and wind turbines. In 2009, a Ministry of Education review proposed closing eight of the ten schools in the Tararua bush area, including Ballance School. The school had a roll of 25 at the time.

Among his designs are the Scala dei Giganti (Staircase of the Giants), the stairs leading to the State Apartments of the Doge's Palace. Life Antonio Rizzo was the son of Rizzo di ser Giovanni of Osteno. He completed his apprenticeship on the site of the Certosa di Pavia. From 1457, he worked in Venice, in Antonio Bregno's workshop. Around 1469, Rizzo lived in a house belonging to the Benedictine nunnery of Santa Zaccaria, after his marriage to Maria, the daughter of the administrator of the nunnery. There is also evidence of a son, Simplicio, who was likely the Venetian goldsmith documented as active in Rome in the beginning of the 16th century. In 1474 and 1478, Rizzo was sent to Scutari as a military engineer. Both times (during the First Venetian-Ottoman war), the Ottoman Turks had besieged the town. He was to improve the fortifications there. He was lauded for continuously doing his patriotic duty, and received injuries. Although the citadel was lost, Rizzo was awarded a monthly pension of 1 ducat for twenty years for himself and his family. In 1484, Rizzo was appointed as proto or chief architect for the restoration of the Doge's Palace. His successful career came to a sudden end in 1498 when he was found guilty of embezzlement of between 10,000 and 80,000 ducats. He sold his house and fled first to Ancona, then to Foligno, and finally to Cesena, where he is believed to have died shortly thereafter. Career Till the 1960s, the accepted history of Rizzo's early years was that he was the supplier of columns, capitals and bases for the Certosa di Pavia's large cloister, which led to the attribution of the arcades of the cloister to him, and that in the 1460s he had been influenced by Lombard sculpture. This consensus was based on a payment document to Magistro Ricio de Verona dated 1465-1467, but was overturned in the 1970s when it was realised that the Ricio was more likely to have been Rizzo's father (though no proof of blood relationship has been found). Rizzo's premier patron in Venice was the Doge Cristoforo Moro, who commissioned him to create altars for the basilica of San Marco, after which he became the chosen sculptor and architect of the Venetian Signoria. This suggests that Rizzo already had a considerable reputation by the time he arrived in Venice. It is likely that Gregorio Correr, a Venetian noble, who had been his patron as well as Mantegna's in Verona, had recommended Rizzo to Moro to introduce the new Renaissance style into the basilica. Influenced by Bregno's gothic sensibility, in around 1464, Rizzo sculpted the figures of the Annunciation, the Allegories and the Virtues for the funerary monument of the Doge Francesco Foscari located in the Church of Santa Maria dei Frari. Towards 1467, Rizzo decorated the portal of the Church of Sant'Elena with a work Vittore Cappello genuflecting before Saint Helena. While this was attributed by Francesco Sansovino to a Antonio Dentone, there is an acceptance that Dentone is none other than Rizzo. This work is characterized by a vibrant realism, with Cappello's face a depiction of tense pleading, and his neck distorted and strained. However, Saint Helena's figure, noticeably in different material and style, is attributed to a coworker of Rizzo's rather than to the sculptor. A budding Renaissance style becomes evident in his statues (such as Mars) for the crown of the Arco Foscari at the Doge's Palace, which he worked on between the early to mid 1460s. Rizzo's Statue of Doge Tron Rizzo executed a spiral staircase with pulpit decorated with figurative reliefs at the Scuola Grande di San Marco in 1476. Its design was by Gentile Bellini. A fire in 1485 destroyed these works. Influenced by Antonello da Messina, Rizzo's style evolved to a geometrization of forms and clearer volumes. The statues of Adam and Eve in the Arco Foscari, and the Monument to the Doge Tron are outstanding. Rizzo based his statues on nude models, working in a naturalistic fashion, with neither the muscle-bound Adam nor the broad-hipped Eve subscribing to classical conceptions of human proportions. Rizzo's Adam and Eve may have influenced Albrecht Dürer, who was present in Venice between 1490-1495. For instance, Dürer's niche motif of Fortuna was inspired by the narrow niches of Venetian funereal monuments, though this derivation has been questioned. Rizzo's Scala dei Giganti, Doge's Palace, Venice Rizzo's final style is represented by the sculptures in the internal facade of the Doge's Palace. After its damage by fire on 14 September 1483, he redesigned a new east wing on the courtyard, planned a new apartment for the Doge, and executed the Scala dei Giganti. These stemmed from his appointment as proto or chief architect of the Doge's Palace, a full-time job but grossly underpaid, about which he complained bitterly, as he was unable to take on any other commission. These works occupied him between 1484 and 1498. The Venetian Senate ordered the reconstruction of the Doge's apartment and made the appointment of Rizzo as architect. There is no evidence of any prior architectural work by Rizzo at this point, although his sculptural works were well-known, so it not immediately clear why he was chosen for the prestigious role of proto, except possibly because of his distinguished exploits at Scutari. Rizzo's east wing was the first complete element in the Renaissance style at the Doge's Palace. His visually striking Scala dei Giganti lead up to a platform, beneath which appear reliefs of Victories. These have been called the supreme achievements of his latter career, and are remarkable for their mimicry of sfumato, a painterly technique, as well as the effects of reflected light off the broken surfaces. It has also been argued that the bronze statues of the Moors of St Mark's Clocktower in the Piazza San Marco, cast in 1497, can be assigned to Rizzo.

It is about an hour's drive from Palmerston North, between Pahiatua and Pongaroa. A walking track has been established through the Makuri Gorge which takes about one hour to complete. History19th century= European settlers began farming the area in the late 19th century. In 1889, Walter Tylee took control of 1200 acres of dense bush. The site was only accessible by a rough ten-mile horse track from Pahiatua, covered in two feet of mud during winter. By 1896 most of the property had been cleared for sheep farming. Tylee had been raised and educated in Napier and Nelson, and had travelled to Argentina to learn sheep farming. In 1890, Frank Anderson purchased a 640-acre property covered in standing bush. By 1896, he had cleared 400 acres for farming sheep. Anderson was born in Wellington in 1870 and was educated at Wellington College and Wanganui College. He was active in establishing the local school and organising social functions. In 1891, Bertram Harrison began managing the 3000 acre Tuscan Hills Estate. By 1896, 2000 acres had been felled, burnt and sown with grass to accommodate 3500 sheep and 100 cattle. The estate include an orchard and a villa, known as Bungalow House. Harrison had been born in Sydenham, England, in 1868, was educated in Berkhamstead, England, and had spent two years in Scotland and five years in New Zealand before taking over the estate. By 1897, he presided over the newly formed Makuri Cricket Club and was involved in local sports. By 1897, the area was accessible by coach from Eketahuna railway station or Woodville railway station. The district had a daily mail service, and its nearest telegraph office was at Pahiatua. =20th century= A photograph of a farmhouse in Makuri, taken between 1923 and 1928 by Robert Percy Moore, depicts a panoramic view of a farmhouse by pine trees, above a river. There is still some native bush, and a driveway and bridge connecting the house with a main road. In the hills in the background, there are still remains of the farmer's attempts to clear the standing forest.

While working as a machinist in Baltimore, he was either the first person or one of the first people to suggest holding a National Negro Convention to discuss the possibility of mass emigration by African Americans away from the United States. This was the beginning of the Colored Conventions Movement. Grice was also a leading figure in the founding of the Legal Rights Association, which has been credited with helping to clarify citizenship rights in America, as well as with pioneering several important tactics in American civil rights activism. He later moved to Haiti where he could secure full citizenship rights. There he became a prominent tradesman and a confidant of Faustin Soulouque. Early life Grice was born in rural Calvert County, Maryland, in the early 1800s. The historian Lucien Holness gives Grice's year of birth as 1801. A biographical sketch of Grice written in 1867 and published in Elevator, the newspaper of the Afro-American League of California and the American Citizens' Equal Rights Association of the State of California, listed his date of birth as being \\"in the early part\\" of the 19th century, but not exactly known. The same biography stated that Grice was \\"of free parentage\\". Despite Maryland's status as a slave state during the first half of the 1800s, Grice did receive some formal education and he became a machinist. Martha S. Jones wrote that, when he was young, Grice had \\"thrown off the obligations of apprenticeship\\" and migrated to Baltimore, where he was living by the 1820s. Through his formal education and his work as a machinist Grice became a skilled mathematician, and he was noted for talent as an inventor. He was also fluent in French. As he grew more politically active, Grice became affiliated with contemporary abolitionist editors like William Lloyd Garrison and Benjamin Lundy. ActivismFirst National Negro Convention= Grice was an activist and businessman in Baltimore during the beginnings of the Back-to-Africa movement, when large African American organizations first began to consider the prospect of mass immigration from the United States to countries with less restriction on the freedom of Black people. Around 1830, one proposal that was the topic of national discussion among African American activists was the possibility of emigrating to a region in Canada to which many formerly enslaved people had already escaped. This proposal was a response to the events surrounding the Cincinnati riots of 1829, and the efforts by the American Colonization Society to pressure African Americans to leave America for Liberia. Grice has been credited with being the first person to call for a national convention to discuss the idea of mass immigration to Canada. However, Martha S. Jones has written that it is not clear whether Grice was the first person to suggest such a conference, or if he was simply responding to and amplifying a call for a convention that had previously been made by activists in New York. But Jones writes that what is obvious is that Grice's leadership was foundational in turning the conference into a reality and in creating a national conversation on the colonization proposals. Grice has therefore been called \\"the moving spirit\\" of the national convention idea, and he organized it by sending letters to Black leaders across the United States. The meeting itself was called by the Philadelphia bishop Richard Allen. It became the first National Negro Convention, held on September 15 to 24 of 1830, at the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church in Philadelphia. The agenda of the convention included general discussion on the advisability of mass emigration by African Americans away from the United States, the possible locations that they could move to, and the specific feasibility of the salient proposal to move to Canada. Although the convention did not produce any clear consensus on these issues even among the 40 attendees, it has been studied as an early example of African American activists freely assembling to plan concerted action to combat their oppression, and it kickstarted the Colored Conventions Movement. The conference also suggested possible legal remedies to ensure citizenship rights for free African Americans, as well as practical tools for communal self- sufficiency like the promotion of mechanical trades and agriculture. Grice is known to have attended at least one National Negro Convention after the one that he initiated. In 1831, Grice missed the second National Negro Convention because at the time he was in Baltimore founding the Legal Rights Association. He was present in 1832, and some sources identify that as the last National Negro Convention that Grice attended; others assert that, in 1833, he attended the third Convention in Philadelphia with his son-in-law William Douglass. =Legal Rights Association= Although the politics of colonization were contentious and the idea became sharply less popular in the following years, Grice published a map of potential locations in Canada that free African Americans could relocate to. Grice also set up trading partnerships with transportation networks between people in the United States and Liberia. He remained close to John Brown Russwurm, who moved to the American Colonization Society's colony in Liberia. Much of Grice's activism focused on the denial of full citizenship rights to free African Americans. To understand how African Americans were being denied their rights under Article Four of the United States Constitution, Grice co-founded the Legal Rights Association, with William J. Watkins, Sr. and James Deaver. The Legal Rights Association has been identified as probably the first legal rights convention among African Americans. Continuing on the work of the Convention of 1830 during the previous year, the Legal Rights Association studied the question of what rights African Americans were entitled to, and how they were being denied those rights. Actions by the American Colonization Society and the legislature of Maryland made it clear over the ensuing few years that the aim of many prominent White lawyers and lawmakers, among them Octavius Taney (the brother of Roger B. Taney), was to remove free African Americans from the country entirely. Personal lifeMove to Haiti= Grice did not remain in the United States long after his activism. In either 1834 or 1835, he chose to move from Baltimore to Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. His motivation was to acquire the full citizenship rights that the United States had refused to grant him, and which he had come to believe would not be granted in the near future. He had a family in Haiti, and became known as a skilled worker due to his expertise as a machinist. Grice's biography in Elevator asserts that he was well known to the rulers of the country and was trusted because he did not engage in Haitian politics. Most notably, Grice became a confidant of Faustin Soulouque, despite Grice's well-known republican ideals. He was particularly prominent in Haiti for inventions that related to the manufacture of sugar. Although Grice never moved back to the United States, he did visit it; he was sent by the government of Haiti to New York to acquire machine parts to build and maintain his sugar manufacturing inventions in Haiti. =Family= Grice had eleven children: six sons and five daughters. It was speculated by his biographer in Elevator that all eleven of his children were likely born in Haiti, and that by 1867 three of his sons and an unknown number of his daughters had emigrated to America. All of his children were thought to be native French speakers who were also educated in English. One of his children, George Grice, was known to have become a dentist in New York, and another, Francis Grice, had moved to San Francisco by 1867. Francis Grice, a sculptor, wrote on the question of Haitian self-governance. Grice's daughter Elizabeth Grice was the first wife of the abolitionist preacher William Douglass.

She was the first woman admitted to the British legal profession's Inner Temple in 1920. Early life and education Theodora Llewelyn Davies was born in Birkenhead on 18 April 1898 to Maurice Llewelyn Davies and May Roberts. She was one of three children with brother Roland and sister Mary. Her mother died in childbirth when she was four. Llewelyn Davies was raised by her father and her mother's sister, Nellie. She came from an illustrious family. Her father's sister was Margaret Llewelyn Davies and his brother was Arthur Llewelyn Davies. Her great aunt Emily Davies was the founder of Girton College in Cambridge, the first college for women. Her grandfather was Rev. John Llewelyn Davies, Rector of Christ Church, Marylebone who was a strong advocate for women's education. She had a cousin Winifred Nicholson who was an artist. Her daughter is Jane Wynne Willson. Llewelyn Davies attended Birkenhead High School before going on to St. Paul’s Girls’ School in London. She studied law in London University for a year in 1916 when the First world war had created capacity with so many students away fighting. In 1917 she went to Girton College. Her brother Roland died in October 1918 in France. Career During the time that Llewelyn Davies was in college the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act began its procession through the houses of parliament which would allow women more equality with men in the legal profession. They were to be able to serve on juries, to be magistrates and solicitors and eventually be called to the Bar. The Inner Temple did not want to be legally forced to allow women to join and so before the legislation was completed, the opened the Bar voluntarily. Llewelyn Davies was the first woman to apply, on 9 January 1920 and be admitted. On 26 January Llewelyn Davies was joined by Ivy Williams who had an exceptional record in her university and thus was able to cut through some of the processes and was called to the Bar on 10 May 1922 while Llewelyn Davies had to wait until 17 November 1922. During her first dinner at the Inner Temple, her sister walked her to the door while the custodian at the hall ensured she was not harassed by newspaper reporters and ensured she got a seat she could manage with her long skirts. There were no bathrooms for women in the facility so Llewelyn Davies was given a key to the Benchers' House which had a cloakroom for women guests at social events. Her uncle Arthur Llewelyn Davies had been a member of the Inner Temple. Her cousins Sir Malcolm Macnaghten and Theo Mathew, better known as the writer ‘O’, took on her training in the chambers. She worked there for seven years taking on some dock briefs, attending assizes and written work. In 1926, Llewelyn Davies became Honorary Legal adviser to the Women's Engineering Society. The organisation's Seventh Annual Report, authored by Caroline Haslett noted \\"On more than one occasion during the year … [she] has given us the benefit of her advice, and our warm thanks are due to her for her kindly and practical help\\". On her resignation, Llewelyn Davies was succeeded by Helena Normanton. Later life Llewelyn Davies married Roy Calvert on 28 June 1929 in Amersham and they had two daughters. Both were interested in penal reform and the abolition of the death penalty. They were members of the executive committee of the Howard League for Penal Reform where they met. The couple toured American penal institutions and attended the 59th Annual Congress of the American Prison Association. The couple wrote The Lawbreaker – a Critical Study of the Modern Treatment of Crime. Her husband died in 1933 after a routine operation. After his death Llewelyn Davies moved back in with her sister and father. November 1935 Llewelyn Davies was appointed justice of the peace for Surrey. Her father died in 1939 and Mary in 1976. Over the years they lived in London, Surrey, Cheltenham and Birmingham. Llewelyn Davies died in December 1988 at the age of 90 of bronchopneumonia in Birmingham.

Moonshaft was allegedly discovered in 1944 during the Slovak National uprising by military commander Antonín Horák who later emigrated from Czechoslovakia to the United States via France and changed his name to Tony Horak. In 1965 Horak published an excerpt from his diary in the National Speleological Society News. In 1972 French author Jacques Bergier included Moonshaft in his book Le Livre de l'inexplicable calling it one of the biggest mysteries ever. Due to the political situation in Czechoslovakia after 1968, the first attempts to find Moonshaft took place as late as in 1980. Some of the theories on the origin of the Moonshaft include geological anomaly, ancient copper mine, entrance to an underground city, extraterrestrial spaceship, etc. The story remains very popular among speleologists, paranormal investigators, and various adventurers who regularly try to explore auspicious locations in Slovakia as well as learn more about Horak and the events from his diary.  Diary  The grotto drawn by Tony Horak According to Horak's diary, in autumn of 1944, he served as a commander of a military unit that operated somewhere in the Tatra mountains. Horak's unit got ambushed by Wehrmacht while hiding in a trench. Horak was shot and stabbed in his hand, and lost consciousness after being hit in the head with a rifle stock. He woke up on 22 October still lying in the trench. He was treated by a local herdsman Slávek, who managed to find two more wounded soldiers Jurek and Martin. Martin was immobile so they constructed a stretcher and set on a four-hour trip to a shelter in a mysterious cave. Slávek told Horak that it was only his second visit to the cave and that they should not attempt to explore its deeper sections because the cave was full of deep pits with dangerous gasses and that the place was most likely haunted. Slávek wrote some symbols on the wall next to a crack at the back of the cave, read a couple of lines from his Bible, and then told the soldiers that he would be back in the afternoon with some food and medicine. He returned with his daughter Hana and provided the men with bandages and aspirin telling them he would bring some food the next day. But due to worsened weather, Horak realized Slávek won't be able to return any soon and the men would be starving. Drawing of the cave from the diary The next day, 23 October, the only \\"meal\\" the three had was hot water with a few drops of slivovitz. Horak decided to break his promise not to venture deeper into the cave. He hoped to find some hibernating animals. Equipped with torches from pinewood, field pickax, and his rifle, he crawled through the crack and learned that navigating in the rear passages of the cave was quite easy. He continued deeper into the cave for approximately 90 minutes until he reached a small vent. When he crawled through, he was astonished to find himself in a large hall with a big grotto decorated with multiple white stalactites and stalagmites covered with enamel-like material. In the grotto, he saw a large dark cylindrical object that was completely smooth. There was a big diagonal crack in the object. Horak, unsure what was inside, threw in some drip-stone fragments and although he could hear water murmuring, the stone made a click sound that indicated the object was hollow and had a solid floor. Horak then tried to use his pickax to disrupt the black material, but he failed to leave even a scratch. He then returned to his comrades without telling them about his discovery. He used their belts to create a rope, explaining that he needed it to catch some bats. He returned to the cave the next day and used the rope to climb to the black shaft. He learned it had a shape of a crescent moon with approx. 25m (82ft) in diameter. Horak discovered the floor was steep and covered in clay and limestone. He then unsuccessfully tried to illuminate the ceiling of the shaft. He also noticed that every sound he made inside of the shaft was extremely amplified. After a brief examination of the shaft, Horak climbed out with no difficulties and returned to their shelter. Cross-section of the Moonshaft from the diary He visited the shaft again the next day taking his dismantled pickax inside. He tried digging in both of its corners. In one of them, he found a skeletal remains of some animal later identified in Uzhhorod as a cave bear. This species had gone extinct some 25 thousand years ago. This indicated that the shaft had used to be opened at some point and the bear had fallen in. It also proved the shaft to be considerably old. He further found a set of horizontal grooves that seemed to be hotter than the rest of the shaft. In the evening, Slávek and his second daughter Olga brought some meat. Horak did not tell them anything about his discovery. The following day, he explored the other corner of the Moonshaft but found no ridges or anything of importance. He then fired two shots upwards in an attempt to disrupt the wall, but this only produced some green sparkles, smoke and terrible noise. On his way out he tried to collect the unknown enamel-like material from the grotto but it was too fragile to be transported so he decided to create a sticky substance by boiling some bat claws and use it the next time he visits the place. On 26 October, Horak tried to look around for another entrance to the cave, but could not find any. During the night, Martin passed away and the two remaining men could finally leave. Horak returned to the Moonshaft for the last time. He lowered in a bottle with a piece of belt with some basic data written on it and the back of his pocket watch. He then concealed the narrow passage leading to the cave hall with stones. On 27 October Horak and Jurek met Slávek for the last time. Jurek, already able to walk longer distances, proposed to Hana and she accepted. Horak also wrote Martin's death certificate and paid Slávek to raise a wooden cross in his memory when possible. They then carried Martin's body to the original trench where he had suffered the fatal wound. Both men then continued walking to Košice. They later met a partisan group and decided to join them. At the end of the diary, Horak recalls his last visit to the place at the end of the war when he tried to find an alternative entrance to the shaft and also planned to visit Slávek. He learned that Jurek and Hana had moved to Bratislava and Slávek lived in a village called Ždiar. Horak expresses his wish that the Moonshaft is carefully studied by scientists and never becomes a tourist attraction. The diary also contains specific coordinates (49.3 N and 20.7 E) that were most likely added by the publisher to help American readers locate the Tatra mountains.  Further investigation  The diary mentions villages Yzdar, Lubocna and Plavno, that do not exist in Slovakia, but the names remind existing villages Ždiar, Lubochňa and Plaveč. The main problem preventing any serious research was the political situation in former Czechoslovakia that was out of limits for explorers from the United States who were the only ones to discuss the subject directly with Horak. Ted Phillips and Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Blue Book) visited Horak in his home in Pueblo, Colorado in 1970. Horak showed them photos he took during his last trip to the site and provided them with some additional information about the location of the cave. Ted Phillips started project \\"Tatra\\" which was expected to result in an expedition to Czechoslovakia, but the plans were halted due to safety concerns. In 1975, one year before his death, Horak met researcher Andre Estival and allegedly gave him important materials, but this has never been confirmed. The first field research was carried out by Czech explorers Ivan Mackerle and Michal Brumlík in 1980. In 1982 an official research was performed by the local Museum of Slovak Karst. Both groups failed to find any reliable information about herder Slávek and his daughters. The details of the military operations that Horak described in his diary also seemed rather inaccurate. The first snow in Tatras in 1944 fell in November although Horak mentions avalanches and snowdrifts already in October. Mackerle believed that all these inaccuracies were included by purpose to mislead people looking for sensations. Before his death, Ivan Mackerle passed his materials to other researchers. The first popular scientific article about the Moonshaft was published in 1990 by Czech geologist Václav Cílek. In 1994 another Czech geologist Walter Pavliš visited several unexplored caves in the Tatra mountains, In one of them he found letters H.A. (Horák Antonín), number 23 (23 October) and 6 crossed lines (6 days in cave) carved into the stone. But this cave had no opening in the rear wall. Walter Pavliš was also able to find many information about the life and family of Tony Horak. In 1999 Ted Phillips finally visited Slovakia and explored some of the caves Horak told him about in 1970. Phillips later admitted he was not able to reach the Moonshaft due to a partial collapse of the cave. In his presentation during a MUFON conference in 2015, Phillips showed images of various places in Belianske Tatry and High Tatras claiming to be taken from around the cave's entrance. Slovak authors Robert K. Lesniakiewicz and Miloš Jesenský (pseudonym Manfred Jensen) published their own discoveries in Poland (in Tajemnica Księżycowej Jaskini (2006) and Powrót do Księżycowej Jaskini (2010)) and later in the United States (The Mooncave Mystery (2020)). They believe the Moonshaft to be a section of an underground network of tunnels related to the mysterious glass tunnels in Babia Góra in Poland. Czech author Martin Lavay performed his own excessive research and discovered that fights similar to those described in Horak's diary occurred in Low Tatras close to villages Telgárt and Vernár. Together with author Jaroslav Mareš and researcher Erik Vojtek, they found an extraordinary rock formation they called \\"rock eye\\" near mountain Kráľova hoľa. However, due to the national park rules, they were not allowed to go any near the object. Lavay published the results of his research in his book Měsíční jeskyně (2019) and on Youtube channel záhady.info. Jaroslav Mareš shot a segment for his project badatele.net. In 2019 Slovak web portal Cez Okno received an information, that one of their followers identified a place in a small mountain range Baruchňa where vegetation grew in a shape of a crest. He believed the Mooshaft to be a slickenside – two enormous blocks of sandstone moved in opposite directions which resulted in smoothing and darkening of their surfaces. Natural geological processes caused the gap between the two blocks to grow bigger which created the unusual cavity. However, no proof that the place in Baruchňa is a Moonshaft was presented. The same year, explorer Erik Batysta visited a cave in Belianské Tatry. He found a fireplace, letters written on one of its walls and a pile of stones that looked like a grave. The cave had an opening in the rear wall but seemed to be too unstable to be explored safely. Part of the cave collapsed later that year.

Monakhov rose to platoon commander during the Russian Civil War and held command and staff positions in Ukraine between the wars. A division chief of staff when Operation Barbarossa began, Monakhov soon became acting commander and in late 1941 took command of the 278th Rifle Division. He led the latter in the Battle of Stalingrad, after which it was converted into the 60th Guards Rifle Division for its actions. Monakhov continued to command the division in the advance west into Ukraine during 1943 and in early 1944 became commander of the 28th Guards Rifle Corps. While leading the latter in the Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive in February, he was mortally wounded.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Dmitry Petrovich Monakhov was born on 3 May 1900 in the village of Filippovo, Yaroslavl Governorate, now in Lyubimsky District of Yaroslavl Oblast. Conscripted into the Red Army in August 1918 during the Russian Civil War, he was sent to the Moscow Workers' Regiment. In late January 1919 Monakhov went with the regiment to Chernigov, and in February a special purpose detachment was formed from the regiment to suppress anti- Soviet forces. In April the detachment was transferred to Poltava, where Monakhov became a cadet at the Poltava Command Course later that month. With the latter, he fought in battles against the Armed Forces of South Russia from Poltava to Kharkov. Wounded and captured in August during the Soviet retreat, Monakhov escaped in December and after reaching Soviet lines was assigned to the 398th Rifle Regiment of the 45th Rifle Division. With the latter, he served as a Red Army man before graduating from the divisional school in 1920 to become a platoon commander. Monakhov fought in battles against the Armed Forces of South Russia in Right-bank Ukraine, the disarmament of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine in the Alexandrovsk area, and in the Odessa Operation. In spring and summer 1920 he fought in the Polish–Soviet War in the advance on Kiev, Shepetovka, and Lvov. In November he fought with the division in the elimination of the Ukrainian People's Army and remnants of the Army of Wrangel in western Ukraine, after which the division suppressed anti-Soviet forces in Ukraine.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Monakhov became a platoon commander in the training regiment of the 133rd Brigade of the division, then held the same position with a destroyer detachment at Poltava. Transferred to the 7th Rifle Division in August, Monakhov became a platoon commander in its 59th Rifle Regiment and an assistant company commander in its 20th Rifle Regiment. From October 1923 he studied at the Kiev Combined Higher Military School. Upon his graduation a year later, he returned to the 20th Regiment to command a training platoon and company, then became assistant commander and commander of a battalion. Monakhov served as assistant chief of staff of the 19th Rifle Regiment from April 1931 and in October of that year transferred to serve as chief of staff of the 50th Separate Machine Gun Battalion. In February 1936 he was appointed chief of staff of the 261st Rifle Regiment of the 87th Rifle Division before rising to command the 295th Rifle Regiment at Mogilev-Podolsky in March 1938. By now a colonel, Monakhov was appointed chief of the 10th department of the staff of the Vinnytsia Army Group of Forces in November of that year and in August 1939 became chief of staff of the 135th Rifle Division. With the latter, he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Monakhov transferred to hold the same position with the 130th Rifle Division, and completed a class of the correspondence department of the Frunze Military Academy in 1941.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Monakhov succeeded to command of the division in July. During the border battles the division fought as part of the 55th Rifle Corps, which joined the 18th Army in fighting in the Mogilev-Podolsk Fortified Region and on the Dniester, then retreated towards Olgopol. In October he was sent to study at the Academy of the General Staff, but a month later was back at the disposal of the Southern Front. In late December he became commander of the 471st Rifle Division, quickly renumbered as the 278th, forming at Yelan near Stalingrad. Monakhov's division was sent to the 38th Army of the Southwestern Front in late May and fought in the defense of the Donbass near Kupiansk against the German advance in Case Blue. In July the division fought in fierce defensive battles, covering the retreat of the army headquarters and ensuring its crossing of the Don near Kletskaya. Transferred to the 21st Army on 23 July, the 278th defended positions on the left bank of the Don, covering a wide front and fighting to expand a bridgehead on the right bank in the area of Raspopinskaya and Kletskaya. Monakhov was awarded his first Order of the Red Banner on 5 November for his leadership of the division in this sector. With the 3rd Guards Army, the division fought in Operation Little Saturn and on 3 January 1943 was converted into the 60th Guards Rifle Division in recognition of its \\"courage and heroism\\" in the latter. Two days later, Monakhov was promoted to major general. Monakhov continued to command the division in Operation Gallop during January and February. In late February the division joined the 1st Guards Army and fought in the Barvenkovo area. Withdrawn to the army reserve in May, the division then fought in battles for the Izyum bridgehead in mid-July. From August 1943, the division, with the 8th Guards Army and then the 12th Army, fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive, the Zaporozhye Offensive, and the Battle of the Dnieper. Monakhov's division was decorated twice and on 4 November joined the 6th Army of the 3rd Ukrainian Front. His performance in these evaluated by his superior as demonstrating the ability \\"to remain calm in the most difficult conditions\\" and to \\"make the correct decisions, while also \\"correctly organizing combined arms cooperation.\\" He became deputy commander of the 28th Guards Rifle Corps on 29 December 1943 and succeeded to command of it on 19 January 1944. During the Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive, Monakhov was severely wounded around 13:00 on 12 February in a German air raid on the road southeast of Malo-Vorontsevka as the corps attacked Apostolovo. He died of his wounds on 17 February 1944 at an evacuation hospital in Dnipropetrovsk, where he was buried. Monakhov was recommended for the Order of Lenin but this was downgraded and instead he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class on 19 March for his leadership of the corps.  Awards  Monakhov was a recipient of the following decorations: * Order of the Red Banner (5 November 1942, 25 February 1943) * Order of Suvorov, 2nd class (26 October 1943) * Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class (19 March 1944) * Jubilee Medal \\"XX Years of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (1938)  References  Citations  Bibliography =  Category:1900 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Yaroslavl Governorate Category:People from Lyubimsky District Category:Soviet major generals Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:People of the Polish–Soviet War Category:People of the Soviet invasion of Poland Category:Soviet military personnel killed in World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd class Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class ","title":"Dmitry Monakhov"},{"id":"64061639","text":"Li Shikang is a Chinese serial killer who killed six people and wounded 17 others with letter bombs sent to medical staff whom he blamed for not curing his sexually transmitted disease.Sexual ignorance led to bombings in China, The Guardian (December 14, 1999) Crimes Li Shikang, frustrated by the fact that doctors upset him by dismissing his fears for his children while failing to cure him, sent his first bomb on February 18, 1999, disguised as a fruit box, to the house of doctor Xu, teacher of the University of Medicine of Sichuan Province.Paciente zangado com médicos mata 6 e fere 17 na China, Jornal do Commercio (December 14, 1999) On October 6, 1999 he sent a bomb to doctor Chen; it exploded and killed Chen and two others at a clinic in Guangzhou.

It lies near the open cluster Stephenson 2, which is located around 6,000 parsecs (20,000 ly) away from Earth, and is assumed to be one of a group of stars at a similar distance. It is among the largest known stars, if not the largest, and one of the most luminous red supergiants, with an estimated radius around 2,150 times that of the Sun (), which corresponds to a volume around 10 billion times bigger than the Sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Saturn. Observation history Comparison of Stephenson 2-18 and VY Canis Majoris. The open cluster Stephenson 2 was discovered by American astronomer Charles Bruce Stephenson in 1990 in the data obtained by a deep infrared survey. The cluster is also known as RSGC2, one of several massive open clusters in Scutum, each containing multiple red supergiants. The brightest star in the region of the cluster was given the identifier 1 in the first analysis of cluster member properties. However, it was not considered to be a member of Stephenson 2 due to its outlying position, abnormally high brightness, and slightly atypical proper motion. In a later study, the same star was given the number 18 and assigned to an outlying group of stars called Stephenson 2 SW, assumed to be at a similar distance to the core cluster. The designation St2-18 (short for Stephenson 2-18) is often used for the star, following the numbering from Deguchi (2010). To reduce confusion from using the same number for different stars and different numbers for the same star, designations from Davis (2007) are often given a prefix of DFK or D, for example Stephenson 2 DFK 1. Physical properties St 2-18 shows the traits and properties of a highly luminous and extreme red supergiant, with a late spectral type of M6, which is unusual for a supergiant star. This places it at the top right corner of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. A calculation for finding the bolometric luminosity by fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) gives the star a luminosity of nearly , with an effective temperature of , which corresponds to a very large radius of , which would be considerably larger and more luminous than theoretical models of the largest, and most luminous red supergiants possible (roughly and respectively). An alternate but older calculation from 2010, still assuming membership of the Stephenson 2 cluster at but based on 12 and fluxes, gives a much lower and relatively modest luminosity of . A newer calculation, based on SED integration and assuming a distance of , gives a bolometric luminosity of although the authors are doubtful that the star is actually a member of the cluster and at that distance.

NCYCS was influential in shaping a landmark social change and law in 1970 leading to the official responsibilities for disabled people moving out from hospitals and into social services departments.  Origins in Chelsea Labour Party  NCYCS was established by the Chelsea Labour Party, mostly likely in the early 1960s and certainly by 1964, by Marsh Dickson, a non-disabled man married to Dorothy Dickson, a disabled woman. They both feared that, should he become unwell or die, that she would have no alternative than to have to spend the rest of her life in a hospital ward, and usually surrounded by unwell elderly people in \\"geriatric\\" wards. Accounts confirm that the Chelsea Labour Party, of which Marsh Dickson was an active member, created and then provided practical support to NCYCS, as also acknowledged by Alf Morris MP (later Lord Morris of Manchester) and more recently by Lord (David) Owen. The constituency changed later to become Chelsea and Fulham.  1966  In March 1966 Pamela La Fane is a disabled woman aged about 39 years, living in a hospital since the age of about 13 years and on wards with elderly people since the age of 16 years, when she reads a letter in the New Statesman magazine / journal by Marsh Dixon and she first becomes aware of NCYCS. She has trained herself as a young writer and produces a leaflet which impressed the NCYCS committee and is published as an article by The Guardian newspaper later in the year, creating a lot of interest and giving NCYCS a national public and political profile. She used the pen-name of Michele Gilbert to avoid reprisals from the hospital staff.  1968  Pamela La Fane is featured in three television documentary programmes (made by the Man Alive BBC2 production team) that were broadcast on BBC1, 10:30pm on 6th, 13th and 20th June 1968 under the title, At a Time Like This - A Life of Her Own. She later wrote her autobiography, and she spoke about her book and about her 30 years in hospital in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in September 1981.  1969  Alf Morris MP was a backbench member of the UK parliament, and through a Private Members Bill he steered into law starting in 1969 and into early 1970, the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, a wide-ranging law with many new powers and duties given to social services departments to meet the needs of disabled people. There is, however, a set-back within the range of new responsibilities given to hospitals which include the controversial creation of Young Disabled Units, YDUs.  1970s  These controversial YDUs become the focus of future campaigns by disabled people in the 1970s, and especially by the radical Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation, UPIAS. Maggie Davis, a UPIAS member, has written about the abuse she endured while living in a YDU in the early 1970s before achieving her independent living as an early pioneer.  Further research  Some further details about NCYCS are currently known and have been published, but this is an emerging area of research and more details are needed.

In Punjab (pakistan), in 2014 khula cases registered were 16,942 that rose to 18,901 cases in 2016. In 2019 in Karachi 11,143 cases filed, 2020 first quarter 3,800 cases filed, one and half year preceding to June 2020 cases filed were 14,943; out of which 4,752 disposed of effecting 2,000 women divorced in 2019 affecting 2100 children. Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan holds popularity of Hollywood and Bollywood films to be responsible for increase in divorce rate in Pakistan.  Legal provisions and issues  According to Pakistani conservative Islamist scholarship provision of giving written notice to spouse for divorce is incompatible with Islamic laws and practices and they pressure the government to revoke such provisions. http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/studies/PDF-FILES/36_v21_1_20.pdf Section 10 (4) of the Family Courts Act, October 2005 provides for divorce procedure.  Reason for divorce  Prolonged illness, infertility, disability, chronic illness, and mental health issues are some of the reasons for divorces along with western influence, decreasing trust and tolerance vis a vis the joint family system, unemployment, and financial stress, decreasing religious value education too are some of the reasons for an increase in the divorce rate in Pakistan. A culture of strong joint family connections in Pakistan can lead to interference from joint of family members that intensify marital discord. = US and western influence = Shazia Ramzan and Saira Akhtar ascribe multinational job opportunities and study scholarships for Pakistani women as reasons for the increase in the divorce rate in Pakistan; Murtaza Haider questions such anti-western theories, pointing out that few women have access to overseas study. Haider suggests to stopping domestic violence against wives will reduce divorce in Pakistan. = Extra marital relationships = Pakistani spouses consider extra marital affairs as unforgettable and unforgivable act which leads to divorce situations = Sexual Dysfunction = As per Khan, Sikander, Akhlaq while some women complained of their respective spouses being impotent or gay. = Intimate Partner Violence = Domestic violence and intimate partner violence is a major reason for marital breakups in Pakistan.  Effects  As per to ‘Global Gender Gap Index 2018’, Pakistan scored 148 of 149 countries in terms of gender parity across four areas: education, health, economic opportunity, and political empowerment, that means women in Pakistan substantially miss on emotional and financial support and makes them helpless in marital discord situations. Still women are stigmatized even if cause and decision of divorce is not her mistake. Children of separated parents have to struggle more to find his life partner in Pakistan = Health = Women suffer insomnia, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks whereas men suffer psychologically for the longingness of their children. Distrust and loneliness are faced equally by both.  Divorce compensation  According to Sulema Jahangir due to politically influential conservative mindset spread by Islamist clergy in south Asia many Muslim women bear with abusive marriages to avoid risk of finding themselves on the street. It is not western influences or women behavior responsible for increasing divorce rate in Pakistan but cost of breaking up marriage to Pakistani male is minimal. Maintenance awarded to children is minimal, and even after giving lifetime service to her family, women don't get share in income or assets of their parting husband. Sulema Jahangir says modern International standards and Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women expect divorce proceedings to count women’s non-financial contributions to a marriage. Many other Muslim countries from Idonesia to Turkey are moving forwards in incorporating suitable legislations improving financial compensation to divorcee wives as mata’a (compensation of kindness) or haq meher (rightful mandatory compensation) through Nikah nama sharing husbands income and assets to better much levels (30 to 50% of assets while departing) also taking into account their non-financial contributions to the family, but Pakistan is lagging behind in social emancipation of divorcing wives.  In literature, drama and media  2019 Pakistani TV drama named Meray Paas Tum Ho encompassing debate surrounding marital relationships getting estranged with foregrounding of romantic extramarital relationship, caught Pakistani national attention.

History  Homefront, 1939 – 1940 = The 198th Infantry Division was formed in the Prague-Plzeň area in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 1 December 1939. Its initial personnel consisted of replacement formations staffed by recruits from Wehrkreis V. The two initial regiments of the 198th Infantry Division were the Infantry Regiments 305 and 308, with the former being assembled using personnel of the Infantry Replacement Regiments 5, 25, and 35, all part of the 155th Division, whereas the latter was assembled with manpower from the Infantry Replacement Regiments 78, 215, and 260, all part of the 165th Division. Additionally, the 198th Infantry Regiment was strengthened by the Light Artillery Detachment 235. On 17 January 1940, the division was transformed into a full infantry division after the addition of the Landwehr Infantry Regiment 35, which was subsequently renamed Infantry Regiment 326. This regiment had previously been part of the 14th Landwehr Division. As a result, the 326th Regiment was primarily staffed by older soldiers, typically between ages 35 and 45. Furthermore, the Light Artillery Detachment 235 was strengthened with the staff as well as the 2nd Detachment of Artillery Regiment 223 from Wehrkreis IV. The resulting artillery formation was dubbed Artillery Regiment 235. The initial divisional commander of the 198th Infantry Division, appointed on 10 January 1940, was Otto Röttig. = Denmark, 1940 = The 198th Infantry Division participated in the German invasion of Denmark and was present for the occupation of Copenhagen on 9 April 1940. The 2nd Battalion of Infantry Regiment 326 was deployed permanently in occupied Denmark to become Guard Battalion Copenhagen. A new infantry battalion was formed to take its place within the 326th Regiment on 28 May 1940. = France, 1940 – 1941 = The division was subsequently deployed to France, but only arrived there in July 1940, too late to take part in the Battle of France, which had concluced on 25 June. The division remained on occupation duty in France until March 1941. On 1 September 1940, Artillery Regiment 235 was equipped with an additional three batteries, the former 4th, 5th, and 6th Batteries of Artillery Regiment 300, to a total of nine. Furthermore, Artillery Regiment 235 was equipped with heavy artillery from the 4th Detachment of Artillery Regiment 300. This heavy artillery subsequently became the 4th Artillery Detachment of Artillery Regiment 235. On 30 October 1940, the 198th Infantry Division passed the staff of Infantry Regiment 326 as well as the 3rd Battalions of both Infantry Regiments 305 and 308 to the 327th Infantry Division, a new division of the 13th Aufstellungswelle, where the staff and two battalions would help form the Infantry Regiment 595. = Romania and Greece, 1941 = In March 1941, the 198th Infantry Division was ordered to Romania in preparation for the Battle of Greece. The division participated in the German invasion of Greece starting 5 April 1941. After the successful conclusion of that campaign, the 198th Infantry Division was put under supervision of Army Group South to participate in Operation Barbarossa. = Soviet Union, 1941 – 1944 = During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the 198th Infantry Division initially fought west of the Dnieper, then took part in the attacks against Dnipropetrovsk. The city was captured by the 13th Panzer Division by 26 August 1941. On 14 August, the staff as well as the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of Infantry Regiment 326 were dissolved. These dissolutions had become necessary as a result of the large casualties that the division had sustained. Subsequently, the division participated in the advance towards the Mius river, and the Battle of Rostov, during which the German advance was eventually temporarily repelled. During the winter battles of 1941 and 1942, the 198th Infantry Division fought along the Mius river. They would eventually be reassembled on 19 February 1943, using personnel from Wehrkreis IX and V. On 10 April 1942, Röttig was replaced as divisional commander by Albert Buck. In the summer of 1942, the 198th Infantry Division participated in Case Blue and assisted in the Second Battle of Rostov. After the German victory at Rostov, the 198th Infantry Division fought in the Battle of the Caucasus between 1942 and 1943. Ludwig Müller was appointed as divisional commander, replacing Buck, who had been killed in action, on 6 September 1942. The 198th Infantry Division assisted the German capture of Novorossiysk after the Soviet landings in that region in February 1943. On 5 February 1943, Müller was replaced as divisional commander by Hans- Joachim von Horn. Later in the year 1943, the 198th Infantry Division fought in the Izium area between June and July, and participated in the German resistance against the Soviet Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation in August. As part of the German defeat at Kharkov, the 198th Infantry Division was heavily damaged and effectively reduced to Kampfgruppe strength. On 11 September 1943, the 3rd Battalions of each of the 198th Infantry Division's former Infantry Regiments, now called Grenadier Regiments, were dissolved, leaving Grenadier Regiments 305, 308 and 326 with two battalions each. Further, the 198th Infantry Division was equipped with Fusilier Battalion 198 and with Artillery Regiment 235, the latter still equipped with all four of its detachments. In February 1944, the 198th Infantry Division was encircled in the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket. The division, already battered during the battles at Kharkov, managed to break out of the encirclement and escape, but suffered severe losses once again as it retreated to Romania. As a result, the division was taken out of the line in March 1944 and sent to Milovice in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia for reinforcements. = Western Front, 1944 – 1945 = On 12 June 1944, in the immediate aftermath of the Allied Normandy landings, the 198th Infantry Division was using personnel of the Grenadier Regiment Bohemia within Shadow Division Bohemia, and sent to Narbonne in France to assist in the German defense against the Allied invasion. The division did so under the supervision of Otto Richter, who had been appointed to divisional command on 1 June 1944. Richter was replaced by Kurt Oppenländer on 1 August, who was in turn replaced by Alfred Kuhnert on 5 August, before Kuhnert eventually was replaced later that same month by Richter, who once again returned to his command post, but was then swapped out for Freiherr von Finck, an Oberstleutnant who had previously served as the division's general staff officer, on 28 August. Finck was in turn replaced by Otto Schiel on 3 September, who held the command post until January 1945. The 198th Infantry Division once more suffered heavy casualties during its retreat to the Vosges mountains. After the German retreat from France, several minor formations were folded into the 198th Infantry Division during its defensive operations in the Upper Rhine area. These formations included two battalions from Grenadier Regiment O/V, the Fortress Infantry Battalion 1432, the Fortress Machine Gun Battalion 40, the 8th Kriegsmarine Ship Cadre Battalion, parts of the 2nd Battalion of the Security Regiment 200, the remnants of Battalion Mahnke and Battalion Märker, as well as several additional smaller units and disorganized groups of retreating soldiers. In January 1945, the 198th Infantry Division took part in the attack of Army Group Oberrhein against Strasbourg, dubbed Operation Nordwind. This offensive failed and inflicted another round of heavy casualties on the division. By the end of January, the division was down to a strength of 6,800 men, about half of the planned manpower of an infantry division. On 18 January 1945, Schield was replaced as divisional commander by Konrad Barde. In March 1945, large parts of the division were crushed in the Colmar Pocket. Parts of the formation did however manage to escape across the Rhine into Germany, where the remnants of the 198th Infantry Division continued to put up token resistance against the Western Allies. After retreating from the Neckar area, the division was taken prisoner by U.S. forces in Weilheim in Oberbayern. The last commander of the division, appointed on 26 April 1945, was Helmut Staedtke.

He served as Minister of Public Works and Development (1939-1944), Second Vice President of the Republic (1956-1962), Minister of Agriculture and President of the Council of Ministers. Early life He was the son of Francisco de Paula Moreyra Riglos and Luisa Paz-Soldán Rouaud. His brother was historian Manuel Moreyra y Paz Soldán (1894-1986). An agricultural engineer by profession, he was one of those who made the agricultural export sector of the Peruvian coast prosperity. He married Leonor García Sayán in 1933. During Manuel Prado Ugarteche's first government, he was appointed Minister of Public Works and Development, and was an part of the long-standing cabinet headed by Alfredo Solf y Muro (1939-1944). Along with his brothers, he inherited the former estate of the Counts of San Isidro, which his great-grandfather, José Gregorio Paz Soldán, acquired in 1853. He was also the owner of the Hacienda Santa Luisa. He enrolled in the Peruvian Democratic Movement, the same one that launched Manuel Prado's candidacy for the 1956 general elections, called by the Odría dictatorship. He ran as a candidate for the second vice presidency, while Luis Gallo Porras was a candidate for the first vice presidency. In those elections in which the votes of the APRA militants decided Prado's victory, as he had promised to legalize that party. Thus began the so-called \\"Coexistence\\" between Pradismo and Aprismo. In Prado's second government (1956-1962), Moreyra served as an effective liaison agent between the president and Pedro G. Beltrán, who criticized the government in the columns of the La Prensa newspaper. He had a decisive participation in the appointment of Beltrán as president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Finance. Beltrán carried out fiscal and financial policy, putting finances in order and stabilizing the currency. When Beltrán resigned in late 1961, Moreyra replaced him as chief of staff, but in the Agriculture Office. His cabinet was the last of President Prado, before the coup of 18 July 1962.

Summary The table below documents the daily growth and change of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries and RT-PCR tests in Nepal, since the first confirmed case on 23 January 2020: January A 31-year-old student of Wuhan University who had returned home on 5 January, was admitted with mild symptoms on 13 January and discharged on 17 January with instructions to self- quarantine at home, after preliminary tests showed he may not be infected. Public laboratories did not have the reagents required for testing, which cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk. As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials elected to send the samples to Hong Kong for testing. The samples were sent on 21 January, and the results came back positive on the 24 January. The patient was confirmed completely treated when RT-PCR throat swabs returned negative for COVID-19 in followup assessments of 29 and 31 January. On 17 January, urged by the WHO, Nepal began screening passengers arriving in Tribhuvan International Airport from China, Thailand and Japan, the three countries with multiple confirmed cases. Eight persons manned the health desk. The airport did not have infrared scanners and was therefore using thermal scanners as preparations were being made to install the infrared ones. The passengers who showed fever were being asked to remain in contact and visit the hospitals if they showed additional symptoms. On 23 January, Dr. Bashudev Pandey, director of Teku Hospital, was quoted as saying that the hospital was on high alert, while three other hospitals – Nepal Police Hospital, Patan Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital – would also treat the disease. Six beds in Teku Hospital had been allocated for isolation of suspected patients. On 25 January, a day after the first case was confirmed, the Health Ministry informed that two other suspected patients were in isolation at Teku Hospital. The hospital discharged them in the morning of 27 January without waiting for test results even though the results were due later that same day, raising concerns over its handling of the crisis. The tests which confirmed a negative result for both patients were conducted at the bio-safety level-2 labs of the National Public Health Laboratory, the first such tests to be performed in Nepal. Reagents sufficient for 100 tests were borrowed from the Centre for Molecular Dynamics, and test kits were provided by the World Health Organisation. On 28 January, Nepal closed down the Rasuwagadhi border with China, bringing Nepal- China trade to a complete halt.

Although called by this name, it was not actually a \\"roundup\\" since the summons were mailed, and those who responded reported to an assembly point on their own. Those who appeared as ordered were arrested, and deported to one of two transit camps in France. From there, the great majority were shipped to Auschwitz where they were killed.  Terminology  This event is called in French. Scholarship in English has tended to use one of three terms for this topic: either green ticket roundup, green card roundup, or the original French term to discuss the event. Green is part of the name in all sources, which report that the summons that was sent to foreign Jewish residents of the Paris region was printed on green paper or green card stock. The word can be translated in various ways, in this context, usually \\"ticket\\" or \\"card\\". The event is known as a \\"roundup\\" both in French () and in English, although the term roundup is not strictly accurate, since the victims responded to a mailed summons. However, it has become the conventional term to use for this event, because it was the first of a wave of massive arrests of Jews under the Vichy regime, of which the remaining ones were mostly roundups. In particular, it occurred before the larger Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of July 1942.  Background  France under German occupation France fell in World War II to the German invasion which began in May 1940 and ended with the occupation of Paris on June 14 and capitulation to Germany eight days later. France was occupied by Nazi Germany and divided in two, with the north and west (including Paris) belonging to the Occupied zone administered directly by Germany, and the rest to the so-called Zone libre (\\"Free zone\\") in the south and east. The French government under Marshall Philippe Pétain moved to the town of Vichy in the . On July 10, parliament dissolved itself, ending the Third Republic and creating the \\"French State\\" (; more commonly known as the \\"Vichy regime\\") in its place with Petain holding supreme power. Starting in 1940, the Vichy government voluntarily adopted, without coercion from the German forces, laws that excluded Jews and their children from certain roles in society. According to Marshal Philippe Pétain's chief of staff, \\"Germany was not at the origin of the anti-Jewish legislation of Vichy. That legislation was spontaneous and autonomous.\\"Henri du Moulin de la Barthète. October 26, 1946 cited in Cirtis, Verdict on Vichy. p.111. Quoting from: Robert Satloff (2006): Among the Righteous. p.31 Rudolph Schleier, the German Consul General in Paris wrote in a report to Berlin, \\"The French government has undertaken to send all foreign- born Jews to concentration camps in the Unoccupied Zone,\\" and continued that \\"[Jews] will be arrested in the Occupied Zone the moment the necessary camps are ready.\\", as quoted in By 1941, the camps at Pithiviers, Beaune-la-Roland, Compiegne, and Drancy were in operation, chiefly for the purpose of interning foreign Jews from Paris. In July 1940, Vichy set up a special commission charged with reviewing naturalisations granted since the 1927 reform of the nationality law. Between June 1940 and August 1944, 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalised.François Masure, \\"État et identité nationale. Un rapport ambigu à propos des naturalisés\\", in Journal des anthropologues, hors- série 2007, pp. 39–49 (see p. 48) This bureaucratic decision was instrumental in their subsequent internment. Statut des Juifs with annotations by Pétain In , French authorities performed a census of foreign Jews by order of the Germans. In October, the Vichy regime then took the initiative to promulgate a new law on the status of Jews. Theodor Dannecker, representative of Adolf Eichmann in Paris, wished to speed up the exclusion of Jews, not only by registering them and plundering their goods, but also by interning them. He counted on Carltheo Zeitschel at the German embassy in Paris, who shared the same objectives, and who was in charge of relations with the Commissariat- General for Jewish Affairs, which was created on . On , Dannecker informed Prefect Ingrand, representative of the Ministry of the Interior in the Occupied zone, of the transformation of the prison camp of Pithiviers into an internment camp, with the transfer of its management to French authorities. At the same time, the Germans insisted on implementation of the law which allowed the . The camp at Pithiviers being insufficient for the purpose on its own, the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp was needed as well, for a total capacity of 5,000 detainees.  Operations  Pithiviers, 1941: Internment camp in the Loiret department (France): Thorough inspection of the new arrivals at the camp. On the basis of censuses, 6694 foreign Jews, mostly Polish males between 18 and 60 years old living in the Paris region, received a summons on a green card (the ) hand-delivered by a French policemean for a \\"status review\\" (\\"., as quoted in The green cards ordered them to go to Parisian police stations, as quoted in on , accompanied by a relative. The card read: More than half (3747) obeyed the summons, because they thought it was only an administrative formality, and were immediately arrested; while the person accompanying them was requested to go fetch their belongings and food. They were transferred by bus to the Paris Austerlitz railway station and deported the same day by four special trains to the internment camps of the Loiret department, about 1700 in Pithiviers and 2000 in Beaune-la-Rolande.  Fate of the deportees  Between and , about 800 prisoners managed to escape but they were often recaptured. The overwhelming majority of the victims of the operation were deported in the first of June and July 1942 and murdered at Auschwitz concentration camp.

It is centrally located on the island of Lidingö at an elevation adjacent to Kyrkviken's southern shore. South-west of the church is Hersbyholm and south on the other side of Ekholmsnäsvägen is one of Lidingö's well-known townhouse areas, Hersby Gärde. History Lidingö Church appears for the first time on a map from 1661. Also marked on the map are some of the farms and dwellings that were on the island at that time. Around the church and the cemetery an arched wall was built in 1755, which is partly preserved. The wreath of lime trees around the oldest part of the cemetery was planted around 1810. The cemetery was expanded south and east in 1854 and was then supplemented with new rows of lime trees. The cemetery continued to expand in turns both south and east in 1905 and in 1909. Then the so-called Kyrkbacken was added. From 1945 to 1952, the areas called Bakom kolumbariet (\\"Behind the Columbarium\\"), De övre terrasserna (\\"The Upper Terraces\\") and Halvmånen (\\"The Crescent\\") were built. All are located south of the columbarium. In 1952, the newer parts of the cemetery and the columbarium were inaugurated. In 1964, the first stage of the Åsen area was built, designed by Inger Wedborn. In 1965 the Nedanför kranskullen area was designed by Inger Wedborn. Wedborn also drew up the basic proposals for the continued eastward expansion, which for some reason later changed. The areas east and north were inaugurated in turns during the 1970s and 1980s. The memorial grove in the middle of the cemetery was built in 1974 and was adorned with the statue Ängel (\\"Angel\\") by Carl Milles in 1999. The most recently added areas are the Vilokullen and the block north of Norra gångsvägen towards Kyrkviken. These were inaugurated during the 1990s and 2000s.

In 1989 he started the Thuamul Rampur tribal movement in Kalahandi which fought against the issue of land alienation of the tribals in that region. On 9 June 1989 he established the Antodaya society and organisation for the protection of tribal rights and promotion of tribal welfare in Thuamul Rampur block in Odisha.  Early life and education  Saleem Farook was born in 1962 into the Munshi Patel family of Somwarpet to Basheer Patel Ahmed and his wife Rahmath Basheer. He did his schooling from O.L.V convent school in Somwarpet. He later graduated in Economics from Maharaja's College, Mysore. He did a diploma in Rural development and management from Mysore University.  Career  Farook was appointed as a campaign manager for a state based NGO in Maharashtra. Later he was shifted to Kalahandi, Odisha where he started working for the tribals. He and his team started a movement fighting against this issue of land alienation of tribals of this block. During this period the local government made an attempt to interact with the people of Thuamul Rampur block and Sri R.B. Pattanaik who was the then collector of Kalahandi advised the group led by Farook (which was later to become Antodaya) to explore the possibilities of initiating community development work in either Lanjigarh or Thuamul Rampur block. Farook opted to explore possibilities in Thuamul Rampur block as there were no NGOs there at that time. The initial strategy was to gain experience by living with the tribal community and to address the issues and the possible solutions which could improve the living conditions of the tribal population. In a survey in 1985 it was found that a large number of tribals were either selling or mortgaging their lands in spite of the benefits that were provided to them under the \\"Land Reforms Act\\" (Art-22, 23,23A of regulation 2). It took almost two years to take up the issue of land alienation to the higher authorities, the district administration then came forward to help the tribals get back their lands. A public interest litigation was filed in the Odisha high court by Farook which led to a Commission of Inquiry by Justice Baidyanath Mishra. The High Court advised the administration to allow tribals to plead without the services of advocates. More than 175 acres of alienated lands were restored to the tribals. Farook founded an organisation called Antodaya which he registered as a society in 1989. He took active steps to stop child selling, starvation, land alienation and killings due to superstitions in the area. He wrote a paper titled 'Ascertaining Basic Rights over Collecting, Processing and Marketing of minor forest products produced by Tribal Women', which examines the tribal economy and the role of the organization in linking the poor tribals to the market. He served as the founder and chairman of the organisation until his death in 2000. The Saleem Farook Janasikhya Pathagar at Mohangiri, Kalahandi is named after him.

Millions of people live in slum dwellings across India and many migrate to live in the slums from rural villages, often in search of work opportunities. Houses are typically built by the slum dwellers themselves and violence has been known to occur when developers attempt to clear the land of slum dwellings. Reasons for wanting to clear slums vary, although land value when sold to developers is higher due to the communities that had settled and built their own homes. In some cases, such as in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, slum areas are located in desirable locations, such as on an embankment which provide opportunities for development of higher class housing and commercial units. Occasionally, slums can encroach on areas deemed a safety concern, such as near to railway tracks or on land desired for expansion, such as with Mumbai international airport. The 2011 census estimated that 65 million people lived in around 108,000 slums across India. Context The Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance Act) of 1956 provided \\"for the improvement and clearance of slum areas in certain Union territories and for the protection of tenants in such areas from eviction\\". The first Slum Clearance Board was established by Tamil Nadu, the most urbanised state in India. Under a new Slum Clearance Act, the government must declare areas identified as slums and then either build new, permanent homes or improve living conditions in the slum. Since the board was established in 1971, declaration of slums has only been made twice, once when it was first established with 1200 slums and an additional 17 in 1985. Several months before the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, an Indian minister on a visit to London declared that slums no longer existed in India, instead replaced with urban clusters, in response to a question regarding the clearance of slums in India. In Delhi alone, over a million people were displaced by slum clearances between 1998 and 2008. The 2011 Census of India estimated that 65,000 million people lived in around 108,000 slums across India, of which the state of Maharashtra had the largest number of slums, at around 21,000. In 2017, around a third of India's then 1.25 billion population lived in cities, with numbers increasing by tens of thousands annually as people migrated away from villages seeking better opportunities, with many ending up in overcrowded slums or on the streets. Shortages of affordable housing resulted in around 25% of the urban population living in informal housing, such as slums. RegionsMumbai= Dharavi slum in Mumbai, pictured in 2008 Between 2008 and 2010, the state government gifted over of slum areas to six developments on a first-come-first-serve basis, without any checks taking place on developer's credentials and under Section 3K of the Slum Act, which bypasses the usually mandatory requirement to obtain 70% consent of slum dwellers. Section 3K was added to the act in 1999, although remained unused until nearly 1 decade later to approve a scheme at Golibar in Santa Cruz, involving the redevelopment of in August 2008. Despite legal challenges by slum dwellers, the Bombay High Court cleared the development which saw violent protests and residents blocking access to a demolition squad. In Mumbai, slum residents only have free housing entitlement if they have lived in a cleared area prior to 1995, or 2000 in some cases, a caveat which prevents over 70% of slum dwellers receiving a free home and thus needing to migrate to another slum. In 2011, a battle between residents and a develop occurred in Ganeth Krupa Society, Mumbai's largest slum, as the develop intended on razing the area to make way for a new commercial development. In January 2011, violence occurred when a high court order to evict 45 families failed to be effective, as the families alleged their signatures had been forged, with a resident suggesting that \\"even a dead woman's signature was forged\\". By March 2011, over 300 dwellings had already been demolished. The conflict was not unusual, as conflicts between developers and residents had been occurring across the city for over a decade beforehand. In the 12 years up to 2011, just 100,000 homes had been built under slum renewal schemes, yet 35% of people rehoused eventually returned to the slums due to unaffordable costs in their new accommodation. As of 2011 estimates, 1.2 million homes would be required to house the population then living in Mumbai's slums. =Nationwide= Between January 2011 and September 2013, over 100,000 families were uprooted from slums in the city of Chennai to allow for development of new commercial and apartment structures. The state government made a declaration that Chennai would be free of slums by the end of 2013, prioritising clearing slums on land near the city's waterways for redevelopment. By February 2016, slums still existed in Chennai and around 1,000 families were evicted from the Surya Nagar slum with just 24 hours notice. One family, who were relocated over away into an eight-story building, experience flooding when it rains and damp which causes illness. In slums, there is a sense of community, with residents holding jobs and a degree of dignity, yet once relocated may find themselves jobless and without knowledge of their neighbours, in what one person described as being \\"dumped here like orphans with no help\\". One of the newer resettlement sites is in Perumbakkam, built by the Tamil Nadu state over a period of 20 years to house people displaced by slum clearance, as well as those made homeless by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and the 2015 Chennai floods. The outskirts of Chennai was home to around 52,000 families in 2017, who's previous slum houses had been cleared to make way for new roads and flyovers. Around 2015, a large slum in Shakur Basti was cleared, including the demolition of around 1,200 homes, leaving the residents with nowhere to move to. The land belonged to the Indian Railways, who said clearance was necessary as people had moved too close to the railway tracks, posing “a serious problem for train operations\\". The clearance resulted in the death of an infant child, although the railways denied any link between the death and the slum clearance. Reasons Dunu Roy, an ex-engineer who runs Delhi-based non-profit organisation the Hazard Centre, suggested that a key underlying reason for the drive to clear slums relates to high land value due to the unpaid labour of slum residents and that keeping people's jobs and homes indefinitely insecure helps economic growth. People who move away due to clearance of their slum resettle elsewhere, build new homes and help to increase the value of the land until clearance several years later. Around 2011 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state of Gujarat, slum dwellers were forcibly uprooted from their slum community they helped to build and relocated over away from their places of work. For the authorities, the cost of rehousing tens of thousands of slum dwellers was worth the price, as slums on the river bank were cleared to regenerate the city's waterfront, similarly to how London built the Thames Embankment during the 19th century. Planners hoped in future, the area could \\"become a Gujarati equivalent to the Thames or the Seine\\", with slum houses replaced with grand residences. Around a similar time, Mumbai International Airport was looking to expand into land right next to the airport which was occupied by slums. The clearance scheme, which would have required around 88,000 families to be relocated, was opposed by residents, some of whom were not eligible for new housing, while others who were did not want to be separated from their community, jobs and education. The scheme, which involved constructing a third terminal and expanding the existing runway on of the airport's land, was cancelled in 2014 as relocation of residents and clearance of the slums could not be achieved within the allotted time permitted. Impact Clearance of slums for economic redevelopment often overlooks the human cost and impact on the break-up of communities. Outcry from the public has been long-standing and a report published by advocacy groups show evictions have violated government guidelines. Whereas slums have their own resources, including water and electricity, it is not uncommon for communities moved to new settlements to have to wait years for running water. Food, such as vegetables and rice can cost around double the price than near slum settlements, while reduced transport links make it harder for people to travel, particularly for work. Communities that are well established in slums are dispersed and relocated to new settlements, often mixed with families from other slums. In one new development, families from different settlements were rehoused into a single building, combining people with differing customs and cultures that created unfamiliarity and distrust. Throughout 2018, authorities were demolishing an average of 114 houses per day, affecting 23 people on average per hour, which across the whole year amounted to over 41,700 homes and an estimated 200,000 people, although no official data exists on evictions. Evictions and clearance of slums became a core issue in the lead-up to the 2019 Indian general election.

The Iraqis intended to launch an Al-Ta'ir satellite with the help of such a launch vehicle. The Iraqis therefore pursued a LV with stages based on Scud missiles and the S-75 Dvina. However only the first stage could be tested on December 1989 and according to General Ra'ad the next stages could not be developed. General Ra'ad says that not even the drawings of the second and third stage vehicles are available and that no final report could be produced. UN inspectors and U.S intelligence did not offer many details regarding the Al-Abid launch vehicle as they were not interested in it. Planning In 1988 Iraq declared a program to design as well as manufacture a LV capable of putting a satellite into orbit. The project was entirely civilian and was to be carried under the supervision of MIMI and had scientists from the Space Research Centre(SRC) and Project 144. A special team consisting of foreign scientists was also made which UNMOVIC could not identify. In general the Al-Abid project drew a large amount of foreign expertise particularly from a Brazilian scientist Major General Hugo de Oliveira Piva. A 50 kg satellite had already been built by Iraqi scientists. The task was to prepare a Launch vehicle capable of putting a 100-300 kg payload in 200-500 km LEO which was to be developed from indigenous systems, namely Scud missiles. The SRC had planned for a schedule to have the first launch by 12 December 1990. When it comes to the first stage various designs and configurations of the Scud missiles were studied including cluster configurations involving four, five or six Scud missiles or modified Scud missiles were studied and similar opinions regarding higher stages were also discussed. By early 1989 Iraqi scientists had concluded on a design of five modified Scud missiles for first stage, a separated modified Scud as second stage and a double base propellant for third stage, in February 1989 the other team of two foreign specialist proposed a different design with a single Scud missile as core stage of first stage with 4-8 strap-on rockets which could be Scuds or S-75 Dvinas, the second stage would be either liquid propelled or solid propelled and would include an AKM, the space research centre would reject this design. Initially focus was concentrated on the first-stage however work on second and third stages had already commenced, initially the second stage was a 880 mm Scud missile of extended burn-time however by beginning on 1989 diameter increased to 1250 mm. Initially the missile had a large payload but General Ra'ad who oversaw Iraq's missile program had the width of the third stage increased to 1.25 m to avoid this hammerhead shape. The Iraqis would then also declare to develop a first-stage rocket engine with four Scud combustion chambers and a single turbopump which would fit a 1250 mm rocket and could operate DETA/UDMH as fuel however work on this would be cancelled after the Gulf War. Later development and Testing On 5 December 1989 Iraq would test the launch vehicle from a site 230 km south of Baghdad in al-Anbar however this would only be the first-stage, the second and third stages were only steel mockups, a videotape retrieved from the Haider chicken farm that the Iraqis were forced to reveal after a defection in 1995 showed that the Launch vehicle only burned for 45 seconds before it exploded, the Iraqis speculated it to be caused by premature firing of Explosive bolts between the first and dummy second stages, the Americans would learn of this test launch on 6 December 1989. After the December 1989 test the Iraqis decided to test the second and third stages separately, they planned a test for autumn 1990 that was known as the Al Kharief(, \\"autumn\\"). This project would become controversial as UN inspectors would claim that it was a program for a new missile yet Iraqis would claim that it was just the upper stages of the Al-Abid launch vehicle, it turned out to be both a test platform for the upper stages of the launch vehicle and a test platform for an Iraqi nuclear weapon delivery system. Around mid-1990 the projects progress was very slow urging Iraqi leaders to meet, after such meetings it became clear that the project was being delayed by disagreements between different parties and differing priorities. The project had come to a halt and all progress was suspended after the invasion of Kuwait, according to General Ra'ad no final report was produced and no drawings of the vehicles were available. It was after the 1989 testing that the Iraqis concluded that the performance of the first stage was crucial to the performance of the whole vehicle, Iraq however encountered many problems while developing the second stage as the Scud missiles only provided thrust that could fulfill minimum requirements. The Iraqis initially attempted to increase second stage performance by increasing the expansion ratio of engine nozzle and changing its fuel, the engine nozzle was relatively narrow as the scud missile was designed to operate above sea level. The Iraqis had decided for the second stage to ignite at higher altitude, the Iraqis increased the expansion ratio from 10 to 30 by adding a nozzle skirt and then changed the fuel from TM-185(a kerosene and gasoline mixture) to DETA/UDMH. Iraq focused on improving the Scud engine, work one project 1728 was done parallel to the al-Abid second stage engine. The Iraqis also approached two foreign countries for the engine however the offer was rejected and the two countries offered only to launch the satellite. On 1 December 1990 a test was carried out by project 1728 to use a nozzle extension for increased expansion ratio and UDMH as fuel however the test was carried out at sea level and no cooling was provided to emulate the high-altitude condition at which the rocket was to operate. Characteristics The missile in general was a 25 m long 3-stage missile designed to be capable of putting satellites which could be used for reconnaissance, communication and control into LEO. =First stage= The first stage consisted of four or five bundled Scud missiles, either the al-Husayn missile or al-Abbas missile. Each Scud missile had a width of 0.88 m. The first stage had a total mass of 48,000 kg and a total propellant mass of 26,020 kg having a burn time of 90 s, the propellant flows at a rate of 289.1 kg/s. The total thrust provided in sea level is 660.7 kN while in vacuum its 731.6 kN. Some sources put the total thrust provided as 690 kN. The total specific impulse provided at sea level is 233.0 s and in vacuum is 258 s. The total Impulse provided is 65.8 MN⋅s. =Second stage= The second stage was also a modified Scud missile having a diameter of 1.25 m. The second stage used 3,760 kg of DETA/UDMH as fuel being flown at a rate of 57.8 kg/s and had an expansion ratio of 30. It being a Scud missile had a relatively narrow nozzle. It provided a total thrust of 146.3 kN in vacuum and a specific impulse of 258 s also in vacuum, the stage had a burn time of 65 s in which it gave a total impulse of 9.5 MN.s. =Third stage= The third stage had a width of 1.25 m and had a clamshell payload fairing. The third stage is believed to be have a SA-2 motor although some sources suggest it might also be a Scud like the previous stages.

He was a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) for 70 years. Born in Dublin, Ireland, Barker had an erratic education but excelled in mathematics, becoming keen on electronics. He is best known for his ground- breaking work on synchronising digital communication systems and framing of received data, using digital codes (see frame slip). These digital codes are known as Barker code. The method was initially researched at SRDE Royal Signals Research Establishment, just after World War II for use in radar, rocket telemetry and digital speech. In 1952, Barker found 7 Barker sequences up to a length of 13 useful for correlation. These sequences are widely used in most data transmissions today. Examples of applications are radar, mobile phone technology, telemetry, digital speech, ultrasound imaging and testing, GPS and WiFi, etc. Early career Telemetry trials at Ynyslas, Wales, 1945 Barker is recognised for his invention of Barker code or Barker sequence, a means of checking the synchronisation and framing of received data. This is used in most forms of data transmissions within (and out of) our world today as the use of a Barker code is needed for accurate reception of the data. Quote \\"A sequence of binary digits has very little meaning unless the significance of the individual digits is known\\".Published in Communication Theory, edited by W Jackson, London, UK, Butterworths 1953 pp. 273-287. In 1941, Barker joined Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) North Woolwich, England in their thermionic valve department, designing dental X-Ray tubes and equipment. After a bombing raid over Woolwich, Roy cycled back to Heath and Reach where he met his wife to be, Wendy Emily Hunt (1917–1998). Barker resigned from STC, as he felt his work on X-ray tubes was unrelated to the war effort. He took up a new post as a temporary experimental officer at the Signals Experimental Establishment (SEE),https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C555 initially on Woolwich Common, but soon moved to Warnham Court, Horsham, England. There, he assisted with the design of Wireless Set No.19, a standard wireless set used in many tanks in World War II. From there, Barker went on to design portable two way radio sets for jungle use. The S.E.E was subsequently renamed Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) and brought within the Ministry of Supply. Staff were moved to Christchurch, Dorset, England, in the summer of 1943. The UK guided weapons program came into being in 1944. The first experimental system was named LOPGAP, acronym of Liquid Oxygen Propelled Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile. Barker was given responsibility for the telemetry equipment. This project had top priority so it was easy to make rapid progress. Initial firings were at Ynyslas in Wales prior to construction of special guided weapons range at the Royal Aerospace Establishment RAE Aberporth, Wales. In 1946 R H Barker read a paper describing his system at an international conference on telemetry at Princeton University, US. Post-war career Warnham Court, Horsham 1942Dr R H Barker and Peter Cutler in the telemetry van during tests At the end of the war, Barker was appointed as a senior scientific officer when he took over speech cryptography. The technique for the encryption of speech was to first encode digitally the speech waveform (in much the same way as was used later for digital recording of music) and to then scramble the stream of binary digits by multiplying it (bit by bit) by a second stream produced synchronously in a pseudorandom number generator. The latter was a special purpose digital computer programmed to produce a pseudorandom sequence. This work brought Barker into contact with a lot of early work on computers in England and the US. Still at SRDE Barker had a team of 12 scientists as the work on applications of digital electronics had been extended to include gunfire control, servo systems and communication by pulse code modulation (digital speech). A lot of information about SRDE is held at The Red House Museum and Gardens, Christchurch, England. Two aspects of his work became well known: *The z-transform method of analysing the behaviour of such systems (see IEE monograph No43, July 1952); *A method known of synchronising digital communication systems using what is now known as a Barker sequence or Barker code. The original paper was entitled \\"Group Synchronisation of Binary Digital Systems\\". This method is used for space communications such as the Galileo Mission. The Oxford Dictionary of Computer Science defines a Barker sequence as: Other standard works in the field also define and use the concept. In April 1954 Barker gained his Ph.D by the London University and subsequently was promoted to Senior Principal Scientific Officer, this was the end of his personal research and the beginnings of an administrative career. The new job was Assistant Director to Ministry of Supply headquarters, New Oxford Street, London. The headquarters work was tedious and in 1957 Barker returned to SRDE Steamer Point,https://www.christchurchdorset.co.uk/steamerpoint.htm Christchurch, Dorset, as Superintendent of Research in charge of the site. In 1959 Barker took a job as Deputy Director of the Central Electricity Research Laboratories (CERL) Leatherhead, Surrey, responsible for day-to-day running of the Laboratories and recruitment needed to increase the scientists from 250 to 600. It was during this period that Barker became more active in the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). He joined as a corporate member in 1945 and was elected Fellow in 1962, serving on various committees of the Power Division and of the Control and Automation Division becoming divisional chairmanChairman's address, \\"Communications in Control\\" in Proceedings of Institution of Electrical Engineers, Vol 119 No 1 pp77-82 Jan 1972, doi,10.1049/piee.1972.0014 in 1971. Barker became a member of the council and served on the important Membership Council for many years and for a time on the Automatic Control Committee. Barker accepted a Directorship on the main board with the Pullin Group of companies in 1964. The company was involved with sonar equipment for the Royal Navy under detailed supervision of the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment. The company did not have the financial resources and there was little scope for innovation. After the company was taken over by the Rank Organisation there was little scope left for research nor in the way the company was run. In 1965, Barker made his last career move to become Deputy Director of the Royal Armament Research Establishment RARDE at Fort Halstead, Kent, at chief experimental officer CEO level. Here, Barker having had line management experience in industry now had a much greater level of responsibility. In 1965, there were 2,500 staff at RARDE and Barker was responsible for half the scientific branches and staff. The research work being undertaken was assessment of non-nuclear weapons systems. Barker retired in May 1979. Over the years digital technology has advanced significantly but Barker codes remain at the core of transmissions. Many scientific papers have been published that have found Barker Code to be the best and most efficient means to transmit data. Since his original paper was published, no other codes have been found.http://www.math.wpi.edu/MPI2008/TSC/TSC-MPI.pdf It has been proven that there are no further odd-length codes,Turyn and Storer, \\"On binary sequences\\", Proceedings of the AMS, volume 12 (1961), pages 394–399 nor even-length codes of .Leung, K., and Schmidt, B., \\"The Field descent method\\", Design, Codes and Cryptography, volume 36, pp. 171–188 Examples of applications are radar, mobile phone technology, telemetry, digital speech, ultrasound imaging and testing, GPS,S.

Personal details R H Barker is 2nd player in back row from the left excluding the linesman Born in Dublin to English parents his early education years were disrupted by his father's frequent periods of unemployment and moves between Dublin and England to find work as a stained glass window artist often staying in grim lodgings. For much of the time, Roy (as he was known) lived with his mother, a school teacher in Thomas Street, Heath and Reach. At age 13 Barker was interviewed by the headmaster, Mr F Fairbrother, of a new school, The Cedars (now Cedars Upper School), Leighton Buzzard. After an entrance examination he was duly admitted to the school where he stayed until 1934. In the VIth form his main subjects were chemistry, physics and mathematics. It was whilst at The Cedars that Barker took an interest in things electrical and radio, building three valve radios with home made components such as coils and loudspeakers. Barker excelled at mathematics and won a scholarship to University College Hull. In 1938 he gained a 1st Class Honours degree in physics awarded by University of London. In 1943, Barker married Wendy Hunt at St Augustine's church in South Croydon and had two sons. In retirement Roy belonged to three bridge clubs, playing duplicate bridge at county level and was still playing at his local bridge club in Verwood until his 99th birthday. Barker passed away on 7 October 2015, his work and dedication being recognised in his obituary published by the IET in IET Obituary News.

After winning her only race as a two-year-old she won the Elfin Stakes on her three-year-old debut and went on to record Grade 1 victories in the Oka Sho and Yushun Himba. Background Daring Tact is a brown filly with a small white star bred in Japan by the Hasegawa Bokujo. As a yearling in 2018 she was put up for auction at the Japan Racing Horse Association Select Sale of Yearlings and was bought for ¥12,960,000 by the Normandy Farm. She was sent into training with Haruki Sugiyama. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Epiphaneia who won the Kikuka Sho and the Japan Cup and was rated the second-best horse in the world in 2014. Daring Tact's dam Daring Bird showed no racing ability but was a daughter of Daring Heart who won the Queen Stakes and Fuchu Himba Stakes as well as being placed in the Oka Sho, NHK Mile Cup and Victoria Mile. Daring Heart was a daughter of the American-bred broodmare Daring Danzig, who was exported to Japan after being sold for $435,000 at Keeneland in November 1998. Racing career2019: two-year-old season= Daring Tact made her racecourse debut in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres on firm ground at Kyoto Racecourse on 16 November 2019 and won from the colt No Security. =2020: three-year-old season= Daring Tact's trainer Haruki Sugiyama On 8 February 2020 Daring Tact began her second campaign in the Listed Elfin Stakes over 1600 metres at Kyoto. She came from tenth place on final turn before showing \\"top-class acceleration\\" to take the lead 100 metres from the finish and drew away to win by four lengths. Her trainer Haruki Sugiyama later commented \\"She was agitated behind the gate and she didn’t break very well. She did settle during the trip however, and displayed a good turn of foot over the last furlong.\\" On 12 April at Hanshin Racecourse Daring Tact was stepped up in class to contest the 80th running of the Oka Sho over 1600 metres in which she was ridden by Kohei Matsuyama and went off the 3.2/1 second favourite behind Resistencia. The other sixteen runners included Sanctuaire (Shinzan Kinen), Ria Amelia (Artemis Stakes), Maltese Diosa (Tulip Sho), Miyamazakura (Queen Stakes), Smile Kana (Fairy Stakes), Woman's Heart (Niigata Nisai Stakes) and Epos (Fillies' Revue). In a race run in heavy rain, Daring Tact was restrained towards the rear of the field before making rapid progress on the wide outside on the final turn. She maintained her progress as the front-runners tired, overtook Resistencia inside the last 50 metres and was finishing to such effect that she won by one and a half lengths. Resistencia held on for second ahead of Smile Kana and Cravache d'Or. After the race Matsuyama said \\"I concentrated on her rhythm more than where to position her today. We were far behind the leaders and desperate in catching up but she responded beautifully and stretched incredibly all the way to the line.\\" Kohei Matsuyama, who rode Daring Tact in 2020 At Tokyo Racecourse on 24 May Daring Tact was moved up in distance and started the 0.6/1 favourite for the 2400 metre Yushun Himba. Her opponents on this occasion included Des Ailes (Sweetpea Stakes), Cravache d'Or, Miyamazakura, Sanctuaire (Shinzan Kinen), Win Marilyn (Flora Stakes), Ria Amelia (Artemis Stakes), Smile Kana, Maltese Diosa, Woman's Heart and Ablaze (Flower Cup). Daring Tact started well before being settled towards the rear of the field as Smile Kana set the pace. The stablemates Win Mighty and Win Marilyn went past the early leaders in the straight and looked to have the race between then, but Daring Tact, having briefly struggled to obtain a clear run, accelerated through a narrow gap, gained the advantage in the final strides and won by half a length. Win Marilyn beat Win Mighty a neck for second with fourth place going to Ria Amelia. Matsuyama commented \\"we were bumped a few times, so I decided to keep her relaxed in a lower position than planned. She instantly kicked into gear once out of traffic in the straight and showed another amazing run down the middle of the lane. Her tremendous burst of speed was extraordinary. It was the first time I rode a favorite [in Grade 1 races] and I admit I felt the pressure, so I’m relieved\\".

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), there are an estimated 18 million users of cocaine globally. Approximately 70-80% of cocaine is at some point smuggled across the ocean, originating from South America. Cocaine remains the \\"highest value criminal commodity for transnational organised crime\\", motivating the criminal organisations responsible for maritime smuggling practices. Maritime cocaine smuggling is therefore an ongoing international issue, as criminal organisations are finding new and innovative ways of smuggling cocaine and go undetected by authorities.  Historical Overview  Cocaine has been an illicit and abused substance for many years. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, was previously (and still is) used in the Andes for the sole purpose of religious ceremonies. But, after the invasion of the Spanish and the exportation of coca leaves to the colonies, cocaine was used for both medicinal and recreational purposes. From the late 1800s to the early 1900s, cocaine was a popular drug widely used by the white middle-class. However, once use in society grew and the dangers of cocaine became evident, the use and sale of coca products were outlawed with the Harrison Narcotics Act in the United States in 1914, one of the first examples of drug legislation. From then on, the cocaine trade became a strictly illegal network. It was not until the 1970s that Colombian drug cartels set up their smuggling network to get cocaine into the United States. = Drug Cartels = Cocaine smuggling was previously dominated by drug cartels, particularly from Colombia. Notorious cocaine cartels such as Medellin cartel and Cali cartel have both dominated the illicit cocaine trade as well as their country of Colombia. Very early on, these cartels identified the weakness of authorities in the maritime domain and used this to their advantage. In addition to this, the lack of understanding of government administrations of the cartel structure and widespread influence has led to the speculation that this was a leading cause of the crack cocaine epidemic in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. The disintegration of these top cocaine cartels in Colombia in the late 1990s have paved the way for insurgent groups to take over. For example, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are both currently key actors in the cocaine trade from Colombia. Whilst cocaine cartels are still active today, they are not as prevalent or as active as they were in the late 1900s.  Key Routes  Based on reported seizures, main cocaine trafficking routes have been mapped out by the UNODC. These routes are primarily in line with commercial shipping routes as this is one of the major methods that smugglers use to get mass amounts of cocaine across borders. Key points of origin of maritime cocaine smuggling still remain to be from mainly Colombia, as well as Bolivia and Peru. From here, a large volume goes to Brazil, Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and Western and Central Europe. Mexico and Central America are used as transit countries for the high quantity of cocaine headed to the United States. Brazil is a major destination and transit country for cocaine smugglers and this supply goes onto Western and Central Europe, South Africa, West and Central Africa and South Asia. The Caribbean and Central America are also transit countries for the large quantity directed for Western and Central Europe. Spain is a highly used transit and destination country in Europe, which have major flows through to France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. From West/Central Europe there is a medium supply of cocaine through to Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South-West Asia. Countries in West, Central and South Africa are used as a transit for the flow of cocaine to Italy in particular. Medium volumes of cocaine go directly from South America to East and South-East Asia and Oceania, Australia in particular.  Smuggling Methods and Techniques  Smuggling cocaine has become increasingly innovative as criminal organisations try and avoid detection by authorities. These methods are primarily via the maritime using maritime cargo, containers and vessels. Most commonly, cocaine smugglers hide cocaine within other products that are arriving to another country as \\"commercial\\" products in shipping containers. Examples of this include inside concrete blocks, fruits, vehicles, in the insulation of container ships, mixing the cocaine with liquid products and soaking liquid cocaine in fabrics such as clothing. Cocaine hidden inside machinery on a ship destined for the Netherlands Another commonality is creating an operational business to disguise the mass shipments. Notorious drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, is one of many who have mixed legitimate business with their drug activities in order to conceal their illicit trading. El Chapo opened a cannery in Mexico and began producing canned jalapeños and peppers, and stuffed them with cocaine. Another popular smuggling technique is the \\"rear rip\\" or \\"rear rip-off\\" method. This involved the cocaine being stored in the rear door of the container so it can be quickly identified by smugglers or corrupt dock workers, and extracted before going through customs. = Narco Submarines = Submarine vessels are a common method that cocaine smugglers use to avoid detection. These are frequently used by major Colombian cocaine smuggling organisations and are commonly referred to as the \\"narco submarine\\". Narco submarine seized in Ecuador The first narco submarine was not intercepted until 2006 by the US Navy off of Costa Rica holding 3.5 tonnes of cocaine. Despite rumours of submarines being used by cartels in the 1990s, this was the first detection. The number of narco submarine incidents has risen in recent years. The US Coast Guard reported 35 in 2018 and 36 in 2019. United States authorities have admitted they have no idea just how many of these narco submarines go undetected.  Key Responses  Since 9/11, countries have shown an increased response and focus to maritime security related issues as threats to ports became a concern. This has created an increased focus and recognition of the role of the maritime in cocaine smuggling. The UNODC has been a major actor in the response to combatting maritime cocaine smuggling at an international level. The UNODC has found that corruption and weak law enforcement capacity are key factors in keeping the supply chain of cocaine smuggling resilient. The UNODC has recognised the maritime as a popular domain due to the lack of jurisdiction on the high seas. Therefore, international cooperation is the crucial tool to counter maritime cocaine smuggling based on the principle of \\"shared and common responsibility\\". = United States Response = The United States government has gone for a more invasive approach to the issue of maritime cocaine smuggling. Rather than relying solely on the US Coast Guard and customs to detect cocaine being smuggling into the country, the United States government is intervening in Colombia. The United States has provided military hardware and training to the Colombian military, aiming to reduce the quantity of cocaine directed towards the United States. In addition to this, the United States government is also providing infrastructure to Colombia in order to assist in fighting insurgency in the country created by FARC and ELN. = The Port of Rotterdam = Being one of the largest ports in Europe, the Port of Rotterdam sees extortionate amounts of smuggled cocaine. The high volume of shipments coming through, as well as the geographical location and access to the European market creates an appeal for cocaine smugglers. In 2019, more than 23 thousands kilograms of cocaine was seized at the Port of Rotterdam, a 28 percent increase from 2018. Fruit, especially bananas, a common Latin American export, is the most common method seen to smuggle cocaine into Europe. The Port of Rotterdam has a specialised team of divers whose purpose is to find smuggled drugs, the Dutch Customs Diving Team (CDT). The unique border policing is done under the water line as cocaine is not only smuggled onboard, but under vessels as well.  Notable Seizures  Large seizures of cocaine are not only a success for local and national authorities in getting cocaine off the streets, but also prevent it from continuing the illegal supply chain to other countries. = United States = In 2019, United States customs seized over 15 tonnes of cocaine from a ship at a Philadelphia port (estimated street value US$1.1 billion). = Germany = In 2019, German authorities in Hamburg seized 1.5 tonnes of cocaine at a port in Hamburg. The cocaine was found in shipping containers containing soybeans that were concealing 221 sports bags full of cocaine. The shipping containers were from Uruguay and were bound for Antwerp, Belgium. = Costa Rica = In early 2020, police in Costa Rica found more than 5 tonnes of cocaine in a shipping container. They discovered 202 suitcases containing cocaine hidden in a consignment of flowers. The shipping containers were headed for the Netherlands. The country has seen a surge in drug smugglers using their country to move cocaine to the United States and Europe. = Australia = In 2017, an Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigation led to the seizure of 1.4 tonnes of cocaine, the largest seizure of a single cocaine shipment in Australian history. The group of men responsible travelled from New Zealand to a 'mothership' in the South Pacific Ocean on a yacht where they collected the cocaine and attempted to sail into Australia, but were intercepted on the south coast of Australia. The investigation and seizure was supported by authorities in New Zealand, Fiji and French Polynesia.

After founding, Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd., Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., and Tokyo Electric Power Company joined the partnership. The name \\"e5\\" refers to the five \\"focus points\\" of the partnership: electrification, environment, evolution, efficiency, and economics. In October 2019, the e5 powertrain design was certified for use by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.  Marine broadband project  In November 2019, e5 announced a collaboration with SoftBank Group to develop a marine broadband network. In the first trial, planned for January through May 2020, ships would \\"be equipped with flat antennas and local wireless stations\\", before a longer trial between January 2021 and March 2022 in which SoftBank and OneWeb will test a new satellite communication system designed to develop autonomous or remotely-controlled ships.  Ship design projects  Commercial ship design is the focal point of the e5 Project. It has completed its first two designs, the e5 Tanker and Tug, and is developing a third. Both completed e5 designs are capable of ship-to- shore power supply in the event of an emergency. = Tanker = The e5 Tanker claims to be the first fully electric oil tanker, powered by a 3.5 MWh battery which is projected to \\"run non-stop for 10 hours on a half-capacity battery\\". The ship will include a high level of automation and will be charged using wind and solar energy to further reduce emissions that would be incurred in charging the ship. Asahi Tanker Co. are currently constructing two ships of the e5 Tanker design, the first of which will be completed by March 2022 and the second in March 2023, revised from an original completion target of 2021. The tanker is expected to mainly operate in Tokyo Bay. Some commentators have called attention to the irony of an electric oil tanker, as the ships deliver fuel which causes pollution several times more severe. = Tug = By October 2019, e5 Lab had designed a tugboat that would run on a mixture of electricity and hydrogen fuel cells, produced with the advice of Tokyo Kisen. It will operate in Yokohama Port and Kawasaki Port and is expected to enter service in 2022. = Car carrier = The proposed car carrier, to be developed with the assistance of Mitsui O.S.K., would be powered by a mixture of liquefied natural gas and hydrogen cell generated electricity.

The Mikkel Vibe House was from 1736 to 1756 owned by Svend Svendsen, who worked as warehouse manager for the Danish Asiatic Company on the other side of the street. On 18 January 1757, Svendsen sold 12 bays of the 20-bay warehouse were acquired to anchor smith Hans Caspersen. He had for some years been a co-owner of the adjacent building at the corner of Sankt Annæ Gade and Wildersgade (then Kongensgade). He immediately embarked on converting his new property into a two-storey residential building. He also constructed a three-storey gatehouse on an adjacent site to the left of the former warehouse. The gateway opened to a yard with a workshop building and a water pump. A dide wing with a forge in the ground floor extended from the gatehouse. In 1760, Caspersen sold the property to blacksmith Friedrich Matthiesen Rom.

He was executed by the Nazi regime shortly before the end of the war. Career Waber was born on May 20, 1884 in Kroměříž (German name: Kremsier), Moravia, in what is now Czechia but was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Joining the Austrian Army in 1907 as a junior officer, he was at the Austrian war academy when World War I broke out. He was immediately attached as a staff officer to an infantry brigade, serving in that capacity for various infantry brigades and being promoted from Senior Lieutenant to Captain in 1915. He then served on the General Staff of the 3rd Army on the Eastern Front. In 1918 he was assigned to the General Staff of the Army Of The East. After the war, he continued to serve in the army of the First Austrian Republic, achieving the rank of Major General in 1936. He retired that same year. But less than week after the Anschluss (Austria being absorbed into Nazi Germany), he returned to active duty in on March 17, 1938, with the German Air Force. He served during the coming Second World War, mostly as commander of various administrative regions on the Eastern Front. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1940, and became commander of the Air Region VIII, based in Breslau, in 1941, shortly before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1941 he was made commander of Field Air Region Kiev, in early 1942 being promoted to the rank of General of Aviators, a three-star rank equivalent to a British or American Lieutenant General. Later that year was moved over to command of Field Air Region Kharkov, and in 1944 to command of Air Region XXX based in Belgrade. Later in 1944 he was given command of the North Balkan Air Force. Arrest and execution Here, as the German armed forces entered its death throes (Belgrade itself fell in October 1944), Waber apparently engaged in looting, theft of German government property, and permitting rampant black market activities in his command. Air Force chief Hermann Göring, angry at defeatism and unauthorized retreats in the Air Force, had Waber arrested (on November 1, 1944) along with three other Air Force generals. The other three were tried and acquitted, but Waber was judged guilty of \\"severe mismanagement in his headquarters and staff and rampant defeatism throughout his region\\" and given the death penalty. He was executed (either by hanging or firing squad, according to different sources) in Spandau Prison on February 6, 1945. This incident further weakened Air Force morale, and engendered anger at Göring, who after all had himself engaged in massive looting during the war.

After conscript service as a junior officer, Sokolov became a militsiya officer but was recalled to active duty in the early 1930s. He held staff positions and after Operation Barbarossa served as a division chief of staff and regimental commander. Sokolov commanded the 45th Rifle Division during the Battle of Stalingrad, and continued in that position after the division became the 74th Guards Rifle Division. Severely wounded in late 1943, he returned to action as commander of the 60th Guards Rifle Division. Sokolov led the latter for the remainder of the war and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of it during the Battle of Berlin. Postwar, he held posts with the Soviet Military Administration in Germany and finished his career in the 1950s as an advisor to the East German military.  Early life and prewar service  A Russian, Sokolov was born to a peasant family on 16 June 1902 in the village of Kamenitsy in Smolensk Governorate. He graduated from primary school and worked as a laborer before graduating from a vocational school. Conscripted into the Red Army in October 1924, he was sent to the one-year cadet detachment of the 22nd Rifle Regiment of the 8th Rifle Division at Bobruisk. After graduating in November 1925, he re-enlisted for another year and remained with the 22nd as a junior commander. Transferred to the reserve in September 1926, Sokolov worked as a senior militsiya officer, chief of criminal investigations, and assistant chief of the district militsiya department in Cherepanovo. He rose to inspector of the militsiya sub-department of the Tomsk Okrug Administrative Department in May 1929, and in 1930 began studying at the physical and mathematical sciences department of the Tomsk State University. Recalled from the university by the army on 15 January 1932, Sokolov was appointed a platoon commander in the 232nd Tomsk Rifle Regiment of the 78th Rifle Division. He became chief of the 4th department of the staff of the division in June 1933 and in January 1935 was appointed chief of staff of a battalion of the 232nd Rifle Regiment.

World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Sokolov's unit was relocated to the vicinity of Kiev and fought in the battle for the city. Appointed corps chief of staff in August, Sokolov served with the corps in defensive actions in the area of Oster, Konotop, and Belopolets in September before it retreated towards Kursk. In the fighting, the corps was surrounded for five days before it broke out to reach Soviet lines. The corps subsequently fought in the area of Tim, where it was reorganized into the 87th Rifle Division of the 40th Army. In the latter, Sokolov, now a major, was appointed commander of the 283rd Rifle Regiment. When the 87th was converted into the 13th Guards Rifle Division in March 1942, his regiment became the 42nd Guards. Sokolov was appointed commander of the 45th Rifle Division, which was on the defensive in the area of Novoposelok, Leshchplota, Bogdanovka, Milovatka, and Selishche, on 10 March. After the division was surrounded, he was ordered to conduct a fighting retreat towards Stary Oskol by the Bryansk Front command on 3 July. By 20 July the division had broken out and was relocated to Krasny Liman, Voronezh Oblast for rebuilding.

Sri Dhammaratana 拿督达摩拉达那长老 (born 24 July 1948) is a Sri Lankan born Malaysian Buddhist monk and the incumbent Buddhist Chief High Priest of Malaysia, since the passing of his predecessor in 2006.  Childhood Memories  Born into the family of Mr. and Mrs. Basanayaka M. Siriwardena on the 24th of July 1948, in Kirinde, Matara, Sri Lanka. He was named Basanayaka M. Siripala. At the age of 17, he traded paths and in 1965 he was ordained and was given the name K. Dhammaratana. In 1972, he received his higher ordination (Upasampada) at Malwatta Maha Viharaya, Kandy.  Early life  Like his predecessor, he was born in the village of Kirinde in Matara, Sri Lanka on 24 July 1948, the second of five children of Basnayaka Mudiyanselage Siriwardena, an Ayurvedic physician, and Withanaarachchilage Dayawathie. He completed his secondary education at the Central College of Deyiyandara. Immediately after graduating, he entered monastic life as a novice monk taking the name Kirinde Dhammaratana under the guidance of Venerable Kotawila Sri Deepananda Nayaka Thero. While receiving monastic training, he also studied at Parama Buddhist International University.  About  In 1980, with the Venerable K. Sri Dhammananda's invitation, he traveled to Malaysia to be a resident monk at the Buddhist Maha Vihara in Kuala Lumpur. He was subsequently appointed the principal of its Sunday Dhamma School in 1988, and served as principal for a year, before vacating the post for a visit to the United States. He resumed his position in 1994 and remained the principal until 2008, when he was promoted to the Spiritual Advisor of the school. After his return from the United States in 1994, Dhammaratana was instrumental in setting up Ti-Ratana Welfare Society in Salak South Garden with the assistance of his friends, donors and supporters at the Buddhist Maha Vihara, and very soon developed it by adding various sections such as free clinics, orphanage, elderly homes and refugee centres for the neglected children and mothers. In 21 June 1997, The Welfare Society’s 1st children’s home, with just 12 children was officiated by Tan Sri Datin Paduka Hajjah Zaleha Bt. Ismail, also the Minister of National Unity and Community Development. It is now one of the most established and non-profit organisation in Malaysia. Dhammmaratana set up a separate affiliated society, Ti-Ratana Buddhist Society, to promote Humanistic Buddhism. The Buddhist Society shares the same locations as the community centres and runs programmes in collaboration with Ti-Ratana Community Centres. The society also runs 5 community centres across the Klang Valley that cater to promoting Malaysian Chinese culture to the community, with Chinese cultural classes teaching Chinese calligraphy and art.

The charity which is legally known as World Protection for Dogs and Cats in the Meat Trade also campaigns against the killing of animals in the fur trade. NoToDogMeat operates around the world.  About  The charity was started by lawyer Julia de Cadenet in 2009 as a campaign to end the abuse of dogs and cats. Julia first witnessed the horrors of the live meat markets in China and says that is when she knew she had to act. Julia created the campaign group NoToDogMeat and then started the charity under the formal name World Protection For Dogs and Cats in the Meat Trade. It is under this banner that the charity lobbies both governments and the UN. Speaking about creating the charity Julia de Cadenet said: \\"As a dog lover I cannot imagine anything worse than my best friend used for food - and the thought of her being beaten, hung, skinned, blowtorched or even boiled alive leaves me frozen and distressed. Imagine then an entire festival devoted to eating dog as part of a trade where such methods are commonplace. This is not a myth created to shock - it's a fact.\\" As well as continued lobbying, the charity works directly with shelters in China to rescue dogs and cats that are destined for the meat trade. Some of the dogs from the rescue centres are rehomed in China, while others travel abroad to find loving homes such as ambassador dog Annabel, a chow who was rescued blind in one eye and partially skinned, who appears at NoToDogMeat events on a regular basis and has also appeared at Crufts 2020 at Birimingham's National Exhibition Centre. NoToDogMeat also carries out regular vigils and protests outside the embassies of countries which still have a dog and cat meat trade, and lobbies governments directly for change. NoToDogMeat is a vegetarian organisation and has thousands of active supporters around the world.  Charitable objects held by the UK Charity Commission  These are the charitable objects cited by No To Dog Meat and held by the UK Charity Commission.  Campaigns and major publicity  The NoToDogMeat global campaign began on social media in April 2013, by a like-minded group from the fields of law, veterinary science, journalism and animal rescue – all motivated by their dogs. The charity World Protection for Dogs and Cats in the Meat Trade (a subsidiary of NoToDogMeat), the first charity of its kind in the United Kingdom was legally formed on May 24, 2013 and was placed on the UK Charity Commission register in November. The charity's aim is to promote enforcement of the 'Universal Five Freedoms of the Sentient Being' for the dogs and cats as defined in Article 7 of the OIE Terrestrial Code. In May 2013, NoToDogMeat took a short film on the dog meat trade to the Cannes Film Festival (Marche du Film) using footage of cruelty gathered by long-term activist Kyenan Kum from IAKA. In October 2014 when Channel 4 broadcast their Unreported World documentary Vietnam's Dog Snatchers footage made by NoToDogMeat campaigners was used. The charity says it is committed to helping brave rescuers who stop trucks on the way to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival as well as raiding markets and slaughterhouses. The charity helps people in the affected countries to make a change. In January 2018 the work of NoToDogMeat was formally recognised by United Nations and granted Special Consultative Status In June 2020, ahead of the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, NoToDogMeat was the subject of a double page spread in The Daily Star which told the stories of a number of dogs which have been rescued by the charity, including tiny lhasa apso Oliver, who was brought to the shelter close to death but now has a happy life in London. In the same month Julia de Cadenet explained why the Coronavirus could be good news for dogs destined for slaughter, as it would hopefully stifle the festival and put an end to the circus that surrounds it.https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/read-this/coronavirus-could-be-good- thing-yulin-dog-meat-festival-campaigners-heres- why-2880516?fbclid=IwAR2XB9Wq4016DiqbD5pmL011r83UXq2gfLpj5HTA7YuHioiTK5KvvwB9SYc In April 2015 NoToDogMeat responded to news that China was moving to class dogs and cats as unfit for human consumption, amid claims that eating stray animals could be to blame for the Coronavirus pandemic.https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1269080/coronavirus-news- covid-19-china-dogmeat-horseshoe-bats-pangolin-pandemic?fbclid=IwAR3Qm- yGWDkDtpk-y-WoyuRJ_J8T0eKUk2Bin3iLq2WplaQj1klQRNmdBgw In the same month the charity was the subject of publicity when the story of Mary and Annabel was told. The heartwarming story told how Annabel, a one-eyed chow rescued from the meat trade by NoToDogMeat campaigners was supporting her disabled owner Mary through Coronavirus shielding after Mary rescued her.https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/01/annabel-one-eyed-dog-rescued-chinese-meat- trade-supporting-disabled-owner- isolation-12491762/?fbclid=IwAR3sZFfAlKGDTTtzKiGkxDG4o4R90GI8EdA_lC9kFeFufMFu9zkSJygPt20 The charity has many supporters around the world including the comedian and animal rights campaigner Ricky Gervais and the actor Orlando Bloomhttps://notodogmeat.blog/2016/06/19/oliver-flies-to-his-forever-home/  Controversy and Daily Mirror complaint  In 2015, a New York Times exposé expressed concerns from campaigners that a Chinese woman named Mrs Yang - who was, at the time, the subject of one of the charity's campaigns - was misappropriating funds, and treating the animals in her care poorly. These claims were backed up by 46 organisations in China including Dr Peter Li, China specialist for HSI.https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/china-yulin-dog-meat- rescue-yang-xiaoyun/ Charity Founder Julia, flew to China with Trustee Robert Donkers and investigated the issue with other animal rights campaigners and shelter owners. They immediately stopped funding for the woman's work, and directed funds from the campaign to other more deserving sanctuaries.https://notodogmeat.blog/2015/11/24/notodogmeats-site-visit-to- mrs-yang-in-china-august-2015/ An excerpt from a statement from Julia on this issue on the charity's website reads: \\"The facilities were horrific. There was excrement and rotting garbage everywhere, dogs were tied up with open sores and no access to water and we even found the rotting carcasses of dead dogs. We went with 12 reputable activists. Her reaction was not to welcome the charity helping her but to shout at us and call the police\\". A further excerpt adds: \\"I am a lawyer so I knew under the 2011 Charities Act, Cy-Pres Doctrine, if you have money left from a restricted fundraiser it can be used for a purpose similar to that intended and carried over to next Yulin or to fund other rescue. I knew once the Charity Commission had all the facts they would support our decision and they did. Actually when we were out there we took part in two truck rescues so we were able to fund those. The remaining funds saved nearly 400 dogs\\" At that time, two supporters of a similar charity started an online crusade to demand that NoToDogMeat continued to fund Mrs Yang regardless of how she treated the dogs, and made numerous statements in the media, which did not take into account the work that NoToDogMeat was doing with the Charity Commission to legally reappropriate the funds. This led to a story in the Daily Mirror which also appeared online.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dog-charity-cash-mystery- animal-6941593 No To Dog Meat complained to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC/ IPSO) about the story, saying that it contained inaccuracies. The PCC did not uphold the full complaint as the Mirror stated they were not directing any accusations at the charity just stating the two men's opinions. The Mirror also offered to print a clarification about the law, but the clarification never appeared.https://www.ipso.co.uk/rulings-and-resolution- statements/ruling/?id=01855-16https://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/no-dog-meat- loses-complaint-8603033 The Charity Commission looked into the matter and agreed with NoToDogMeat's position regarding cutting ties with Mrs Yang and supported their decision to use funds to help reputable organisations. The Charity Commission issued a formal apology to NoToDogMeat for any ambiguity that arose from its comments to the newspaper. NoToDogMeat continues to hold charitable status in good standing and recorded a formal complaint against one of the men, a charity trustee himself, for misquoting the law and his actions to harm the charity's reputation.https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity- details/?regid=1154524&subid;=0 References Category:Animal charities based in the United Kingdom Category:2009 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Dog meat Category:Animal welfare organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"NoToDogMeat"},{"id":"64063053","text":"Californium(III) chloride is an inorganic compound with a chemical formula CfCl3.

The mints that produced them were supplied by the West African gold mines south of the Sahara dessert. The Almoravid dinars circulated widely beyond the reach of the empire; the Christian kingdoms of Iberia called them \\"marabotins\\" and \\"maravedís\\".  History  When the Almoravids conquered Awdaghust around 1054, they gained control over the southern point of the trans-Saharan trade routes. When Abu Bakr ibn Umar led the capture of the Sijilmasa oases from the Maghrawa, they occupied the northern point. In this position, the Almoravids were able to control and profit from the trans-Saharan gold trade. Within two years of taking Sijilmasa, the entry point for gold into North Africa, dinars were struck there in the name of Abu Bakr ibn 'Umar. When Yusuf ibn Tashfin officially became amir of the Almoravids in 1087, coins were struck with his name and the volume of production increased. In addition to Sijilmasa, coins were struck in several new mints, the first of which was in Aghmat in 1093. The mint in Aghmat had the highest output of any mint in North Africa until 1122, and Muhammad al-Idrisi noted in Nuzhat al-Mushtāq that under the Almoravids the population of Aghmat was the wealthiest. From around 1096, Almoravid dinars were struck in al-Andalus, starting in Seville. There was a notable increase in production around 1104, the year after Ali ibn Yusuf was recognized as the heir to the empire; these coins featured his name along with his father's. Ronald A. Messier suggests that this was \\"aimed at publicizing the legitimacy of Ali's 'right' to the throne.\\" Under Ali, coin production greatly increased. Dinars were minted in Marrakesh, the newly established Almoravid capital, from around 1097. Four years later, they were also being minted in Fes, Tilemsān, and Nūl Lamta. The multiple cities minting coins helped the Almohad sultan solidify his control over distant parts of his empire; his name on the coins functioned as a sort of brand and symbol of authority to preempt possible revolts. An Almoravid dinar minted under Ali ibn Yusuf in Seville featuring Almoravid Kufic script. The greatest extent of Almoravid dinar production started around 1120 and lasted until around 1130; it was the peak of Almoravid prosperity when most of Ali's constructions took place. The most productive Andalusi mints at this time were in Almería, Seville, and Granada—the most important cities for international commerce. With the threat of Ibn Tumart and the Almohad movement, Ali shifted his attention to the African part of his empire. Around 1130, more Almoravid dinars were made in Africa than in Iberia. From 1139 to 1146, Ibn Tumart's Almohads waged total war on the Almoravids until finally conquering Marrakesh. The economic effects of this conflict could be felt even in 1141, when Fesi merchants complained of the Almohad \\"usurpers.\\" The last Almoravid sultan, Ishaq ibn Ali, and some unknown Almoravid rebels minted a few dinars from 1146-1151.  Circulation  The Almoravids traded virtually exclusively with locally produced dinars. Under the Almoravids, al-Andalus exported goods to North Africa, Egypt, and France, among others. It also imported goods from many different areas, including China, India, Persia, the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe. Because of the extensive trade network of the Almoravids and the reputed quality of their coins, Mediterranean markets were flooded with Almoravid dinars for almost a century, and they competed with the Fatimid dinar as the dominant currency of Mediterranean trade.

Sant was a controversial figure who had an aggressive leadership approach. In the 1980s he was involved in incidents of political violence, and he has been held responsible for violating the human rights of his employees. Early life and activism Sant was born in Paola on 26 December 1937. He studied at the Technical Institute and then worked at the Malta Drydocks. He joined the Labour League of Youths (LLY), which was the youth wing of the Malta Labour Party (MLP), and became its secretary general. In August 1959, he became the editor of the LLY's newspaper The Struggle. After he wrote an anti-clerical editorial which commented on a February 1960 pastoral letter by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi, Sant was interdicted by the Catholic Church on 9 April 1960. The Struggle was discontinued after nine issues, and Sant continued to contribute in The Knight, which was a publication by the MLP. Sant was also active in the General Workers' Union, and in May 1961 he became the secretary of the union's Metal Workers' Section. He was married to Carmen Sant née Pace, who was also elected to parliament, as was his brother Salvu Sant. Political career Maltese inscription on a building in Valletta which translates to \\"This stone was laid down by the Minister Lorry Sant to commemorate that this building was built by the Labour government, 28 April 1973\\" Lorry Sant was elected to Parliament for the first time in the general election of 1962. He was subsequently reelected in the next five elections, in 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981 and 1987. When the MLP was Malta's governing party between 1971 and 1987, Sant held a number of ministerial roles. Sant was appointed as Minister of Works in 1971. The following year, he accompanied Prime Minister Dom Mintoff on a diplomatic visit to China. In 1976, Sant was appointed Minister of Works and Sports, and he later became the Minister of the Interior in 1981, and Minister of Works, Sports and Housing in 1983. He remained in office until the MLP was defeated in the elections of 1987. Projects which Sant was involved in include the conversion of the former Sacra Infermeria into the Mediterranean Conference Centre, the construction of the National Stadium, Ta' Qali and the National Sports Pavilion at Kordin. =Controversies= Lorry Sant had a very rough leadership approach which resulted in a number of controversies including human rights violations. During his tenure as minister, Sant was hostile and aggressive to some of his employees, and in 2010 the courts found that he had breached the human rights of Renè Buttigieg who had worked as a government architect when Sant was works minister. After the government took over the Marsa Sports Complex in 1971, Sant clashed with Hilary Tagliaferro, a Catholic priest who had established a youth sports centre within the complex. A dispute arose over the selection of football coaches, culminating in Tagliaferro being arrested for unauthrised possession of government stationery, although he was later released without any charges. Sant also instigated a dispute with the Malta Football Association (MFA) because the association's president was a supporter of the Nationalist Party. The MFA had been allowed to use the national stadium at Ta' Qali after its completion, but in the early 1980s Sant prevented them from using it until they paid an annual rent of Lm 10,000. Sant also created another Football Association as a rival of the MFA. Roads built during Sant's tenure as works minister were generally of inferior quality than roads which had been built earlier. Lorry Sant had ambitions to succeed Dom Mintoff as leader of the Labour Party, but the two had a falling out and when Mintoff resigned as Labour leader and Prime Minister in 1984 he was succeeded by Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici. According to his wife Carmen, Lorry Sant \\"still loved Mintoff and he was hurt that [he] had turned against him.\\" Lorry Sant and his canvassers were responsible for various forms of political violence in the 1980s. On one occasion he reportedly broke the glasses of then-Nationalist MP Josie Muscat in parliament and then beat him up and locked him in a bathroom. In 1986, Sant and Wistin Abela interrupted and almost assaulted Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami in parliament while the latter was delivering a speech which condemned the murder of Raymond Caruana and the police's subsequent frameup of Peter Paul Busuttil. End of career and death In 1989, Lorry Sant was charged with corruption in court, but the case was abandoned after magistrate Carol Peralta ruled that although there was enough evidence to issue a bill of indictment, the crimes were time-barred. After Labour whip Wenzu Mintoff (Dom Mintoff's nephew) wanted to expel him from the party, Lorry Sant produced an envelope containing a number of photos in parliament, apparently in an attempt to blackmail either Wenzu or Dom Mintoff. The photos were never revealed to the public. Due to friction within the MLP, the party administration suspended Sant from all party activities in 1990, and he therefore did not contest the general election of 1992. The MLP leader Alfred Sant reversed this suspension on 24 April 1995 due to Lorry Sant's deteriorating health at the time. Sant died on 5 October 1995 at the age of 57. Legacy A bronze statue of Lorry Sant was inaugurated in his hometown Paola on 10 February 2000. It stands within a garden which is also named after the politician. Lorry Sant owned a villa in Marsaskala. His wife requested planning permission to demolish the building and replace it with six semi-detached villas in 2018.

It was established in 1952 to conduct global influenza surveillance. GISRS is coordinated by WHO and endorsed by national governments. More than two million respiratory specimens are tested by GISRS annually to monitor the spread and evolution of influenza viruses through a network of about 150 laboratories in 114 countries representing 91% of the world's population. GISRS operates FluNet, an online tool used for virological surveillance of influenza.  History  In 1947, the WHO Interim Committee of the United Nations agreed to begin a Global Influenza Programme (GIP) for the study and control of influenza. A major outbreak of influenza in Europe was an immediate concern, as well as the identification of appropriate viruses for a vaccine against the virus strains which might be circulating. The establishment of regional influenza centers began in 1948. Five years after the creation of GIP, the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) was established in response to a need for an influenza surveillance system to inform the methods for disease prevention and control. GISN would later be renamed Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), evolving as an integrated scientific and technical global collaboration to fulfil the objectives and activities of GIP. GISRS gained momentum between the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. The growing network of national influenza centers focused on understanding disease activity and characteristics of influenza viruses globally. Through these efforts, the realization that the viruses were not only present in tropical countries but might circulate for much of the year was confirmed.  Composition  As of 2015, GISRS comprised 142 national influenza centers in 115 countries, 6 collaborating centers, 4 essential regulatory laboratories, and 13 H5 reference laboratories.  Efficacy  GISRS has been considered an accomplished tool in providing early warning of changes in influenza viruses circulating in the global population to help mitigate the consequences of a pandemic and maintain the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines.

Educated at University College Bangor, she won two prizes for short novels, two Prose Medals at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and the crown at the 1973 Anglesey Eisteddfod. Jones published ten novels with her works covering fictional diaries, her political beliefs and responses to political events, and Welsh kings and princes. BiographyEarly life and education= Jones was born at Meirion House in Llanbedr, Meirioneth on 4 November 1921, to the former Baptist minister of Salem chapel Hugh Davies Jones and his wife, the teacher Laura Jones (née Owen). She was the second child in the family after her elder sister Annie Davies Evans (née Jones). After the death of Jones' father when she was two years old, the family moved from their home in Oswestry, Shropshire went to live with her maternal grandmother in Penbont, Llanbedr. She was educated at Llanbedr Primary School, Llanfair Primary School and Barmouth Grammar School, where the headmaster introduced her to the history of Christendom. In 1940, Jones moved on to University College Bangor, where she met Ifor Williams, Thomas Parry, and Robert Thomas Jenkins. She graduated with a Certificate of Education in 1945. =Career= That same year, Jones was employed as a teacher of Welsh at Brynhyfryd Grammar School, Rhuthin. There, she began writing with the support of acquaintances with literary interests in Rhuthin. Parry advised Jones to choose between poetry and prose without mixing the two. In 1963, Jones was appointed to a lectureship at College of Education in Monmouthshire, before moving on to teach the same subject at Bangor Normal College two years later, remaining there until she retired in 1983. She earned prizes for short novels that eventually went unpublished at the 1952 and 1956 editions of the National Eisteddfod of Wales. In 1960, Jones authored Fy Hen Lyfr Cownt ('My old account book'), which is centred on a fictional diary about the final ten years of the hymn writer Ann Griffiths. This won her the 1960 Prose Medal at the National Eisteddfod, the first of her career, and the novel is credited by Meic Stephens of The Independent as having \\"gathered a momentum that it has maintained to the present day.\\" Jones won a second Prose Medal at the 1964 National Eisteddfod for the novel Lleian Llan Llŷr (The Nun of Llan Llŷr), which is focused on the grief she felt over the death of her partner. This was followed by Llys Aberffraw (The Court of Aberffraw), a novel about Owain Gwynedd's illegitimate grand daughters. As a Welsh nationalist, Jones was inspired to write the novel after learning of the Investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales and the deaths of two young nationalists who were killed by their own bomb in Abergele on the eve of the investiture. The novel won the crown at the 1973 Anglesey Eisteddfod and was published four years later. In 1981, Eryr Pengwern ('The eagle of Pengwern'), set in 7th-century Powys and based on the Heledd Saga, was written by Jones in response to Gwynfor Evans' threat to launch a hunger strike for a Welsh television channel. Four years later, she moved to journal form with the novel in Dyddiadur Mari Gwyn (Mari Gwyn’s Diary) dealing with the persecution of Catholics in Elizabeth I's reign and focusing on the Elizabethan Welsh writer Robert Gwyn. This was followed by Jones authoring a trilogy of novels between 1987 and 1993 which were set in the Age of the Princes: Cribau Eryri (The Ridges of Snowdonia), Barrug y Bore (Morning Frost) and Adar Drycin (Storm Birds). She was inspired to write the trilogy after the failed 1979 Welsh devolution referendum, and an increase of demographic pressure in the Welsh language central areas. Jones' final novel Cydio Mewn Cwilsyn (Taking up a Quill), a factious diary of Edmund Prys' daughter, was published in 2002. She wrote ten novels over her lifetime and published a collection of original children's nursery rhymes. Jones died on 22 October 2014, in Penrhos Stanley Hospital, Holyhead, Anglesey, after a long illness from pneumonia and a broken femur. She was unmarried. Jones was given a funeral service at Penuel Baptist Chapel in Bangor and was buried at Salem Baptist Chapel in Llansilin, Denbighshire on 30 October. Analysis and legacy In the book Rebirth of a Nation: Wales, 1880-1980, author Kenneth O. Morgan wrote, \\"the historical novel flourished\\" with authors such as Jones. Haf Llewelyn, writing in her entry in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, noted Jones' \\"passionate interest in her subjects is evident from the detailed research\\" was \\"the hallmark of her work\\" and \\"her beliefs and responses to political events of the period are clearly reflected in her work\\" Mair Williams of Transceltic said her works featured historical accuracies to \\"impart powerful nationalist ideals.\\" Jones was added to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in 2018.

Plot The play depicts the generational clashes within a prosperous English family, all concerning the matrimonial wishes of the rising generation and their parents' opposition to it. Act I is set in 1860; Act 2 in 1885; Act 3 in 1912. The following is from The Times's summary of the plot in its review of the first performance.\\"Royalty Theatre\\", The Times, 6 March 1912, p. 7 :In 1860 John Rhead proposes marriage to Rose Sibley, and objections raised by the Sibley family. John Rhead is go-ahead and a believer in the new iron ships. What, say the Sibleys, is the matter with English oak? Dolts! cries Rhead. Faddists! retort the Sibleys. But the marriage, nevertheless, takes place. […] :In 1885 John Rhead is about to be made a baronet. His faith in iron has brought him a fortune. But his daughter Emily is now marriageable, and up comes the old difficulty. Papa wishes Emily to marry a peer; but Emily loves Arthur Preece, a young engineer. This young fellow has discovered a new process for making steel; but John Rhead, who believed in iron (at 25), does not (at 50) believe in steel. Anyhow, he bullies Emily into marrying the peer. :In 1912, Sir John [is] a doddering old grandfather; Lady Rhead, the sweetest of grandmothers; Emily, now the widowed Lady Monkhurst, and the smartest of matrons. Once more the eternal marriage question. Emily's daughter Muriel has engaged herself to young Dick Sibley, another young engineer; and Emily cannot bear it, because Dick is going to Canada, and she dreads separation from her daughter. But Muriel is quite a different sort of daughter from the daughters of the two previous generations. They were tearful, obedient, timid. She intends to have her own way as a mere matter of course. When opposed, she is quite prepared to argue it out – is, in fact, the contemporary young woman from head to foot. Fortunately she gets her way without inflicting pain on her elders after all. For Emily's old admirer, Arthur Preece (now M.P., head of the Labour Party, and already a little disillusioned with it and politics generally), reappears and claims Emily for his own. She no longer needs her daughter, who is free to marry Dick, and all ends happily with grandpapa and grandmamma having a cosy chat over the fire.

MacVicar was part of a team along with physician Ian Donald and engineer Tom Brown, who developed the worlds first obstetric ultrasound machine in 1963. Using the new technique of ultrasound, MacVicar's research transformed the treatment of gynaecological conditions in pregnant women, through the use of clinical trials. Life John MacVicar was the youngest of six children. His father, Angus John MacVicar, was a Presbyterian minister in the Church of Scotland. His brother was the prolific author Angus MacVicar. MacVicar took his early education at Campbeltown Grammar School and graduated as Dux. In 1945, MacVicar matriculated at the University of Glasgow Medical School to study for a medical degree. After being encouraged by his peers, he decided to specialise in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology, achieving a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1950. After a number of junior positions, MacVicar spent 2 years abroad in Singapore for his National service working as a medical officer for the wives of serviceman. When he returned, he was appointed to a position at Stobhill Hospital, which enabled him to complete his membership exam for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In 1956, MacVicar was appointed as a Registrar in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Western Infirmary and Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow. In 1965, he was appointed a lecturer at Department of Midwifery at Queen Mother’s Hospital in Glasgow. While he was there, he took the opportunity of being seconded to the Department of Medicine at the University of East Africa in Nairobi. His remit was to establish a new department that specialised in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. To build the department, he quickly gained a rapport with the staff and established strong links with the Kampala University and universities in Uganda. He was recognised for both his work at the Western Infirmary and in Africa with a promotion to Professor, becoming foundation professor in Leicester Medical School, at the time the newest in the UK. He remained in that position, until his retirement in 1992. MacVicar was married to Esme MacVicar. He had four children, Marsali, Rona, Alan and Cath, and five grandchildren Sam, Emily, Ailie, Kirsty and Cameron. Research The relationship between Brown and MacVicar was mutually supportive. MacVicar had little experience of pure research as his background was in clinical work. However, he recognized the value of diagnostic ultrasound and believed it would play a significant role in obstetrics and gynaecology.

Gordon was born Alice Mary Brandreth in Shimla about 1855 to Edward Lyall Brandreth and Louisa Marriott. Her father was a Justice of the Peace and Member of the Council of India. She was their only child. During her life she was known by her husbands' names, making her Alice Gordon or Mrs J E H Gordon as well as Alice Butcher, Mrs John Butcher and Lady Danesfort.  Alice Gordon  She married the electrical engineer James Edward Henry Gordon in 1878 and took a close interest in supporting his commercial electrical activities until his sudden death on 3 February 1893, whereupon she returned to writing on other topics. They had three children, Dorothy Frances, Peter Christian and James Geoffrey Gordon. It was through collaborating with her husband that Alice became interested in electricity: he had studied this topic at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge under James Clerk Maxwell, and their first marital home in Dorking was adapted to extend such work. As she later wrote: 'Our early married life was spent in the country, where we owned a large laboratory and a small house attached. In those days I was bottle-washer and laboratory assistant to my husband'. When they moved to London, their home became a kind of Salon for those of a technical mind with an interest in developing the uses of electricity. Mrs Gordon was presented to Queen Victoria. While her husband became a significant figure in the metropolitan electrical schemes, Gordon became part of a movement to promote the domestic use of electricity, using her own home in Kensington as a showcase. Specifically, in order to support her spouse's electrical lighting consultancy business she wrote a piece for the Fortnightly Review in February 1891, assisted into the world of journalism by her friend and mentor George Meredith, a long-time contributor to that periodical. Alice's aim was to encourage wealthy middle class householders to consider adopting electric light in their homes at a time when electrical lighting was only available in some UK cities, and was greatly more expensive to run than gas lighting, oil lamps or paraffin lamps. Her Fortnightly Review piece titled 'The Development of Decorative Electricity' presented electricity as an enjoyable luxury illuminant for the wealthy elite; Alice thus emphasized how carefully-applied decorative techniques could ensure that the often clinical qualities of early incandescent electrical lighting could be shielded from tired eyes. In the same year, her approach of melding interior decoration with the new lighting opportunities led to a book Decorative Electricity (1891), for which she assumed the title of Mrs J.E.H. Gordon. This demonstrates the depth of Alice's experience and expertise in domestic electric installation acquired from collaborating with her spouse, J.E.H.Gordon, writing with the authority of an engineer's spouse, although he is separately credited with a chapter on the then notorious 'Fire Risks' of electricity. The book's line- drawing illustrations by Herbert Fell elegantly portray a rich array of suggestions for how (implicitly female) householders should light each room of the house electrically, including the servants' quarters. These suggestions borrowed eclectically from various cultural sources: a Cairo or a Pompeii lamp were recommended for the hallway and staircase; dragon pendants and Venetian glass for the dining-room, with cupids and Carton-Pierre brackets advised for the lady's boudoir. A chapter on 'Shops and Public Buildings' condemned the use of harsh overhead lighting that Alice reported made many women feel uncomfortable by casting dark shadows under their eyes. Decorative Electricity closes with a chapter on 'Some Personal Experiences' which how closely and painstakingly Alice collaborated with James Gordon, often acting as his deputy, confidante and translator for the Gordon consultancy business. Her expertise became known nationwide and a second (cheaper) edition of Decorative Electricity was published in 1892, listing many positive reviews from newspapers - except for the hostile responses journals linked to the gas industry, and with many advertisers in the outer pages clearly seeking to target the decorative electric lighting market. She latterly worked with Agnes Clerke and Mrs Humphrey Ward to ensure the representation of women writers in The Woman's Building at the Chicago Exhibition in 1893. After James Gordon died in a horse riding accident that year, Alice returned to journalism again writing, for example, on 'Women as Students in Design' in 1894.  Alice Butcher  She later married John George Butcher, 1st and last Baron Danesfort on 9 April 1898, and later adopted the title Lady Butcher when he was knighted. When he was elevated to Baron Danesfort on 19 February 1924, Gordon became Lady Danesfort. She was a friend of Robert Louis Stevenson, and as a result of her long family-connections to George Meredith. wrote her Memories of him in 1919. She died on 16 June 1929 in London.

It was built as a country estate sometime between 1787 and 1840 by Samuel Ewalt, and remained standing after most of the land was subdivided for residential lots in the 1870s. The house was notable as a rare example of an antebellum Greek Revival house in Pittsburgh, and exemplified the typical pattern of development in Lawrenceville in the mid to late 19th century. In 2019, the building was nominated as a Pittsburgh historic landmark. History The house was built sometime before 1840 by Samuel Ewalt (1750–1847), a merchant and landowner who was a prominent citizen during Pittsburgh's early history. He was also the first sheriff of Allegheny County and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In 1787, he bought a tract of land in present-day Lawrenceville for a country estate. The land in this area was divided into narrow strips perpendicular to the Allegheny River, providing riverfront access to each landowner. Ewalt's parcel spanned from present-day 43rd Street to 47th Street and inland as far as the Bloomfield vicinity, covering just over in total. The house's date of construction is unknown, but it was mentioned in Ewalt's will, dated 1841. A newspaper article from 1889 described the house as one of \\"the principal landmarks in that section of the three-quarters of a century ago.\\" Later, the property was owned by Anna H. Irwin. After she died around 1871, most of the land was subdivided into residential lots like the other country estates in the area, and began to be densely developed. Unlike many of the other country houses, the Ewalt house remained standing, though a rear wing was demolished around 1890. From 1887 to 1890, it was the home of Charles Bickel, a notable architect, and from 1945 to 1977 it was used as a social hall by a Polish-American organization. In August 2019, the house was hit by a windburst which damaged the roof supports and put pressure on the foundation which already was bowed and faltering. A structural engineer deemed the house uninhabitable and dangerous. A developer, who was going to purchase the house, was approved to build five townhomes on the Ewalt site. The house was nominated as a Pittsburgh historic landmark by the Lawrenceville Stakeholders advocacy group over the development of the five townhomes so they filed a historical nomination on December 3rd. The landmark nomination was approved by the Historic Review Commission and the City Planning Commission, after which it went before the Pittsburgh City Council in July, 2020. The City Council voted to delay the vote on the property until after July 22, meaning it will become a historic landmark by default on that date. However, the City Council later voted on August 26 to withdraw the nomination, and on September 24, they approved the owner's demolition permit. On October 7, the Ewalt House was torn down. Architecture The Ewalt House was a two-story vernacular Greek Revival style building with a hipped roof. It was constructed from American bond brick, with corner pilasters and an entablature with a brick dentil course and wooden cornice. The house had a symmetrical five-bay facade with wood-framed window openings which had been retrofitted with smaller modern windows. An entrance porch and rear garage were later additions.

His appellation serves to identify his origins in Martinengo in the area of Bergamo. In 1481, he was cited as a member of a bricklayers group (paratico dei marangoni), where he learned construction techniques of the late Gothic. Towards the end of the same decade, he was registered amongst the construction workers of the Monte di Pietà vecchio, a palazzo situated in the Piazza della Loggia in Brescia, where he would be one of the accusers of Filippo Grassi, the construction manager, for fraud against the municipality. The Presbytery of the Old Cathedral, Brescia, constructed by Bernardo di Martinengo In August 1490, he was commissioned for the construction of the new presbytery of the Old Cathedral, Brescia. He also extended the Romanesque choir in the building, and built the transept and the chapel of the Holy Crosses (now lost, after their remodelling in the 17th century). Between 1494-1495, he was involved in the construction of the Palazzo della Loggia, especially in the primary orders. In connection with this, he was sent to Padua and Venice to train himself up in structural and decorative solutions, which he would then apply to the new public building in Brescia. Among the most interesting examples of Renaissance architecture in Brescia is the main cloister of the monastery of Saints Faustino and Giovita, which is the last known work of Bernardino, dated to 1501.

(2018) When women strike the world stops (2020)/ Newsfloor (Le Monde Pixelisé) (2020) Claire Fontaine, In God They Trust (2005). Twenty-five-cent coin, steel box-cutter blade, solder and rivet. Claire Fontaine, Untitled (Negative) (2016) Claire Fontaine is a feminist, conceptual artist, founded in Paris in 2004 by Fulvia Carnevale and James Thornhill, an Italian-British artist duo who declared themselves her assistants. Since 2018 Claire Fontaine lives and works in Palermo and has a studio in the historical centre of the Kalsa near Piazza Magione. After lifting her name from a popular brand of French school notebooks and stationary, Claire Fontaine declared herself a readymade artist and began to elaborate a version of neo-conceptual art that often looks like other people's work. Claire Fontaine translated into English means \\"Clear Fountain\\" and can also be conceptually linked to the artwork Fountain by Marcel Duchamp, known as the most famous readymade.  Work  Claire Fontaine uses the concept of the readymade as a way of criticising \\"production\\" disguised as a creation of more and more artefacts that are desirable because they superficially appear as new. Generally she works with appropriation on a formal level and she hijacks contents, using sculpture, installation, video and painting to create an emotionally loaded criticism of the author and the forms of authority at this stage of capitalism. This aesthetic approach that she describes as \\"expropriation\\", a way of giving an existential use value to pre-exisitng objects and artworks, also addresses the general crisis of singularity, which she describes as the individual and collective impossibility to give a meaning to one's life under the current political circumstance and the systematic surveillance, repression and countless limitations of our freedom. Claire Fontaine prefers to integrate the existing art circuit to create complicities and foster change which entails partaking in the mechanisms and subjects of the art industry including collectors, dealers and institutions. In an Interview with Circa Art Magazine in 2008 she states: \\"I think forming gangs, mafias, collectives, networks, bands of people is a way to survive in the hostile capitalist system and then eventually a way to become a pressure group, in order to transform these particular conditions.\\" Writing and text based pieces play an important role in Claire Fontaine's work. She distributes texts in her exhibitions and she uses different registers in her writing such as poetry, critical theory, essays and manifestos. The artist criticises the hierarchy between visual and verbal expression. In February 2020 she was invited by Maria Grazia Chiuri to create the mise-en-scène for Dior's Autumn/Winter 2020 collection for Paris Fashion Week which took place in the Les Tuileries. The artist used the catwalk to perform an operation of Institutional Critique investing the floor and the ceiling; she presented Newsfloor (Le Monde Pixelisé) (2020) and several large suspended LED signs stating for example: Patriarchy Kills Love, When women strike the world stops, Feminine beauty is a ready-made or Patriarchy = Climate emergency.

They are a type of phosphoramidate. These phosphorus (V) compounds are encountered as reagents used for making new phosphoanhydride bonds with phosphate mono-esters, and as reactive intermediates in phosphoryl transfer reactions in some enzyme- catalyzed transformations. They are also being studied as critical chemical intermediates for the polymerization of nucleotides in pre-biotic settings. They are sometimes referred to as phosphorimidazolidates, imidazole-activated phosphoryl groups, and P-imidazolides.  Role in Oligonucleotide Formation  Phosphorimidazolides have been investigated for their mechanistic role in abiogenesis (the natural process by which life arose from non-living matter). Specifically, they have been proposed as the active electrophilic species which may have mediated the formation of inter-nucleotide phosphodiester bonds, thereby enabling template-directed oligonucleotide replication before the advent of enzymes. Phosphorimidazolides were originally proposed as mediators of this process by Leslie Orgel in 1968. Early studies showed that divalent metal cations such as Mg2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ and a complimentary template were required for the formation of short oligonucleotides, although nucleotides exhibited 5'-2' connectivity instead of 5'-3' connectivity of present-day life forms. It was also shown that Montmorillonite clay could provide a surface for phosphorimidazolide-mediated oligonucleotide formation with lengths of 20-50 bases. The research group of Jack W. Szostak has continued to investigate the role of phosphorimidazolides in pre-biotic nucleotide polymerization. The group has investigated a number of imidazole derivatives in the search for chemical moieties which provide longer oligonucleotides necessary for propagating genetic information. Significantly, they discovered that phosphorimidazolides promote template-directed oligonucleotide formation via imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediates. John D. Sutherland and colleagues have proposed that phosphorimidazolides may have formed in the chemical environment of early earth via the activation of ribonucleotide phosphates by methyl isocyanaide and acetaldehyde followed by substitution with imidazole.  Phosphoanhydride Bond Formation  While early studies of phosphorimidazolide derivatives of nucleotides found that oligonucleotides could form in the presence of a complimentary template, pyrophosphate-linked dimers formed predominantly in the absence of a template. This proclivity for forming new phosphoanhydride bonds has been used in the synthesis of several pyrophosphate-containing organic compounds. A variety of modified nucleotide triphosphates were synthesized using a cyanoethyl- protected phosphorimidazolide reagent. Phosphoanhydride bond forming reactions were found to proceed most rapidly in amide-based organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and particularly in N,N-dimethylacetamide with Mg2+ or Zn2+ catalysts.  Synthesis  Phosphorimidazolide reagents have been synthesized from phosphate mono-esters. In one method, a phosphate mono-ester is dissolved in anhydrous pyridine or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and activated using triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and 2,2’-Dithiodipyridine (2,2’-DTDP) in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) base and excess imidazole. In another method using fewer reagents, a phosphate mono-ester is dissolved in DMF and carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) is used to both remove an oxygen atom from the phosphate group and supply the imidazole substituent. The product of either reaction may be collected by precipitation using acetonitrile or acetone as antisolvent with sodium or lithium perchlorate to supply the sodium or lithium salt of the phosphorimidazolide respectively. Alternatively, the phosphorimidazolide may be isolated by reverse-phase flash column chromatography with TEAB buffer and acetonitrile.

It is the 22nd installment in the NBA 2K franchise and the successor to NBA 2K20. The game was released on September 4, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and will later be released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S. The PS4, Switch, Xbox One, and PC released to mixed or average reviews, with critics criticizing the lack of originality in the gameplay, as well as microtransactions and bugs.  Development and release  The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will receive special edition bundles, which will include a digital download of NBA 2K21. Promotion A teaser was released on June 11, 2020 during the PS5 Reveal Event and featured the player model of New Orleans Pelicans' Zion Williamson. It showed a few seconds of pre-alpha, in-engine footage and showed many effects such as ray-tracing and shadow details. On June 30, 2020, NBA 2K announced Damian Lillard, of the Portland Trail Blazers, would be the cover for the standard edition on the current-generation consoles. On July 1, 2020, NBA 2K announced Zion Williamson as the cover athlete for the standard edition on the next-generation consoles. The last covers were released on July 2, 2020, honoring the late Kobe Bryant. There will be a #8 cover for current gen consoles — which features artwork of him dunking with the afro and a #24 cover for next gen consoles — which features artwork of him waving after scoring 60 points in his final NBA game in 2016; both numbers were worn by Bryant throughout his NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. The demo for the game was released on August 24th. Gameplay General = The game itself plays similarly to previous installments in the series. The player mainly plays NBA games with real-life or customized players and teams; games follow the rules and objectives of NBA games. Several game modes are present and many settings can be customized. Up to six expansion teams can be created and used in both MyLeague and MyGM Modes, with the possibility of a 36-team league, and any team can be relocated and rebranded. For the second time in series, all 12 WNBA teams are available to play as. There are 67 classic teams available, with the 2018–19 Toronto Raptors, 2016–17 Golden State Warriors, and 2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers being among them. = MyCareer = A staple of the series, MyCareer, returns as one of the available game modes. MyCareer is a career mode in which the player creates their own customizable basketball player and plays through their basketball career. Players may make a male or female player, although female is only available on next-gen consoles. The Neighborhood also returns to MyCareer, as 2K Beach, in which players can customize their wardrobe, get haircuts and tattoos, and purchase boosts. They can also do their workouts and run drills to improve their attributes at their current team's practice facility. Progress in MyCareer may not carry over across generations, due to some changes made exclusively for next-gen. = MyTeam = NBA 2K21, for the ninth time in the series, features MyTeam mode, a mode based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players assemble and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams in several formats. Assets for a team are acquired through various means, including randomized card packs and the auction house. Virtual Currency (VC) is used extensively within the mode. Progress in MyTeam will carry over across generations.  Changes to MyTeam  There are many changes made to MyTeam this year, the most notable one is the adaption of a Seasons format just like most games, which has exclusive rewards that get better each season. An all-new Limited mode is added, where every weekend, players compete for rings to get seasonal rewards. By the word itself, there are some limitations to what cards you can use in Limited each weekend. Ascension is a new minigame where you flip cards and try to get the top prize in the third level. The Exchange is a new feature where you trade cards to get even better cards. Unlimited is changed to have nine different tiers, each one with its own reward for advancing. The gem levels from Amethyst to Galaxy Opal have been adjusted to leave space for a new level for cards with a 99 rating, which could be teased in the courtside report as Dark Matter. Reception NBA 2K21 received mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Michael Higham from GameSpot gave the game a score of 6 out of 10. He states \\"NBA 2K21 shows that the lone basketball sim we have now has largely stagnated. It's a full package, for sure, but one that demonstrates little-to-no motivation to meaningfully improve upon itself. That doesn't take away from the strong foundation that makes NBA 2K a fun and rewarding time. However, when you go through the same grind and the same process with only superficial changes, you just get burnt out faster than years prior.\\" Ben Vollmer from IGN gave the game a score of 6 out of 10, stating \\"More of the same isn't good enough anymore, especially when it includes such obtrusive microtransactions.\\" Vollmer also says \\"At the same time, it's a shame that 2K's focus isn't on the fun you can have on the court, but instead the money that can be extracted from your wallet off of the court in the MyCareer and MyTeam modes, which just aren't fun to grind through without paying. Maybe the new set of consoles on the horizon will bring a fresh start for the NBA 2K franchise, but right now I feel more pessimistic about the series’ future than ever.\\" The PlayStation version of NBA 2K21 sold 8,541 physical copies within its first week on sale in Japan, making it the seventh bestselling retail game of the week.

Personal life Cutler was born September 10, 1949 to Lloyd Cutler, the White House Counsel during the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and his wife, Polly Kraft. She grew up in outside of Washington, D.C. Cutler, one of four children, had a brother and a sister who also became lawyers. One sister, Louisiana Winslow Culter, also live in Alaska. Cutler attended Yale Law School. Her husband retired as a state trooper to grow potatoes. She has four children and lives in Palmer, Alaska. Career In 1974, Cutler moved to Alaska to work as a research attorney for the Alaska Judicial Council. She then went to work as a public defender. Cutler was appointed by Governor Jay Hammond as a district court judge in Anchorage, Alaska and was sworn in on September 26, 1977. At 28 years old, she replaced Dorothy Tyner, who was much older. When first appointed to the bench, Cutler was the only judge in a one- courtroom courthouse. As the court grew, they expanded into a nearby apartment where files were kept in the bathtub. In 1982, she was appointed the first judge at what is, as of 2012, the Superior Court in Palmer. When she became a superior court judge there was no district court in that jurisdiction, and so the duties of that role were Cutler's as well. She received criticism after John Pearl Smith II, a prisoner she temporarily released to attend his deceased father's memorial service, escaped and was later recaptured. She also presided over a case involving the mother of Levi Johnston. Cutler retired in 2009 after spending 32 years as a judge. She was also the superior court's administrative judge. At the end of her career, she served along side three other judges in Palmer, Alaska, where she presided for 27 years.

Originally was developed as a part of JIS specification for Physical Distribution Center. Instead of ITF-14, it wasn’t standardized by ISO Committee but it is widely used to encode additional data to Global Trade Item Number such as items quantity or container weight. History In 1983, the Logistics Symbol Committee proposed the Interleaved 2 of 5 barcode as a method to improve the JAN code. In 1985, a logistics symbol JIS drafting committee was set up at the Distribution System Development Center, and the final examination was started toward JIS.. Then in 1987 it was standardized as JIS-X-0502, a standard physical distribution barcode symbol ITF-14/16/6. The ITF barcode has an add-on version for displaying the weight, etc., and it is possible to encode a 5-digits numerical value and 6-th check character as ITF-6 after ITF-14 or ITF-16(obsolete in 2010). Currently ITF-6 isn’t standardized by ISO Committee and it is used only as a part of JIS standards. However, it is widely used by manufacturers to encode additional data and it is supported by wide range of barcode scanners Uses Despite the fact that ITF-6 barcode isn’t included into ISO standards, it is widely used as add-on to encode items quantity in package or item weight. At this time, it is used only with ITF-14 (Global Trade Item Number), but up to 2010 it was used with standardized only in Japan ITF-16 (Extended Symbology for Physical Distribution). From the left, ITF-6 contains 5 significant digits and the last one is control digit, which is calculated same way as UPC checksums. If a decimal point is required, the decimal point is between the 3rd and 4th digits: NNNNN(C/D) - without decimal point; NNN.NN(C/D) - with decimal point. ITF-6 is supported by various barcode generating software and barcode scanners. Checksum Checksum is calculated as other UPC checksums: x_6 = 10 - ((3x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 + x_4 + 3x_5)\\\\pmod{10}) Example for the first 5 digits 12345: 10 - ((3*1 + 2 + 3*3 + 4 + 3*5) mod 10) = 7.

After 1933 he went on to become a resistance activist. He spent his final years as a concentration camp inmate. Sources identify his 1943 killing by government paramilitaries at Camp Flossenbürg, in the mountains east of Nuremberg, as a murder.  Life and works  Ernst Reinke was born at Adlig Schmelz, a district near the shoreline along southern edge of Memel (as Klaipėda was known at that time), an overwhelmingly German-speaking port city, albeit set in a region of what was then the German province of East Prussia in which Lithuanian was the principal language among the countryfolk. Between 1897 and 1905 he attended school in what was then Tilsit. After leaving school he worked on the barges. In 1911 he was conscripted into the navy: he served on SMS Nürnberg, a modern light cruiser completed a couple of years earlier. The ship was assigned at around this time to the German East Asia Squadron: Reinke was accordingly stationed in Chinese waters. After the First World War Reinke joined the newly launched Communist Party which had emerged out of the anti- war movement. Still based in Tilsit, he worked till 1925 on the railways. During 1924-25 he was also a member of the city council. In 1925, following his participation in the major rail strike which took place in and around Tilsit, Reinke lost his job with the railways. In August 1925 he relocated to Berlin where he supported himself through factory work. He became secretary of the League of antifascist fighters (\\"Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus\\"), founded on 28 September 1930 under the leadership, Hermann Remmele, in which Reinke for a period became de facto leader. Günther Hortzschansky: Ernst Thälmann. Eine Biographie, 1981, p. 488. That month he was also one of 77 Communist Party candidates elected to the Reichstag (national parliament). Reinke was excluded from his membership of the assembly on 30 June 1931, however. His parliamentary seat was taken over by Hanna Sandtner. He was also, through this time, a member of the leadership team of the Revolutionäre Gewerkschafts Opposition, a communist trades union set up in opposition to the politically more broadly based Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, as mutual antagonism, encouraged from Moscow, between the Communist party and the Social Democratic Party, intensified. Political polarisation had led to parliamentary deadlock which presented the Hitler government with their opportunity to take power in January 1933. They lost no time in transforming Germany into a one- party dictatorship. Overnight on 27/28 February 1933 the Reichstag fire presented a timely justification for an accelerated termination of democracy. With implausible haste, the government blamed the fire on communists.. On 28 February, as the Reichstag Fire Decree was passed by parliament, communist members of parliament and other activists were arrested. Ernst Reinke was one of them. He was taken to the Alexanderplatz Police Station and \\"badly mishandled\\". For more than a year he was then detained at the Esterwegen concentration camp in the north-west of Germany. Following his release in August 1934 Reinke worked as a \\"mixer\\" at the Siemes-Plania chemicals plant in Griesheim (south of Frankfurt), where he set about creating a secret Communist cell. His (since 1933 illegal) political activities in the factory came to the attention of the security service and when war broke out in September 1939 they re-arrested him. Reinke was delivered to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In April 1940 he was transferred to Flossenbürg concentration camp, were he was murdered by the SS on 28 April 1943.  Celebration  During the 1960s a street in a new residential development in Berlin-Lichtenberg was named Ernst-Reinke-Straße. Although the area was redevelopment following reunification, the name honouring the murdered Communist politician has been retained. Around the same time, in the state-owned graphite products factory of VEB Elektrokohle Lichtenberg, a brigade (work group) was given the name \\"Ernst Reinke Brigade\\". Since its erection in front of the Reichstag building in 1992, Ernst Reinke has also been one of 96 murdered members of the Reichstag individually commemorated by the Memorial to the Murdered Members of the Reichstag.

Early life  Shepardson was born in St. Paul, Minnesota on May 26, 1906, as the fourth child to suffragette Sylvie Thompson Thygeson and Nels Marcus Thygeson. Her parents were both described as educated and well-informed on social justice issues of the day, such as birth control, women's suffrage, and racial equality. Nels died when Shepardson was eleven, which was a devastating event for the family.  Education  Shepardson studied at Stanford beginning when she was 16, in 1922. She graduated cum laude in 1928, but not before studying at the Sorbonne in 1925 and the London School of Economics in 1926. A gap in Shepardson's education corresponds to her marriage of her widowed brother-in-law, Dr. Dwight Shepardson in 1943 (some sources say 1942). Shepardson returned to Stanford for her masters, graduating in 1956. She continued on for a PhD at University of California at Berkeley, earning that in only four years, in 1960, just as she turned fifty- four.  Research  After her PhD, she became a Fellow in Anthropology for the National Science Foundation. Published in 1970, her research first focused on political process, comparing two Navajo communities, published as \\"The Navajo Mountain Community: Social Organization and Kinship Terminology\\". She did this and similar research with laws, courts, decision-making in the field among the Navajo people throughout the 1960s. She was associated during this time with the University of Chicago.  Teaching career  Shepardson briefly taught at Mills College after she earned her PhD, then joined the faculty of San Francisco State University in 1967 after her husband's death. She moved to a professor emeritus in 1973.  Personal life  Shepardson married Dr. Dwight Shepardson, her brother-in-law, after her own sister’s death.

This tribute to human senses is made using repoussé and chasing technique, and is composed of welded sheets of metal. History and description The piece depicts five human senses that conjoin in a face-like shape and resemble a growing plant. Kristek executed the sculpture in one of his typical techniques – from welded sheets of metal. The Czech art historian Barbora Putova noted: Kristek addressed senses and perception in his sculptural works. In some of his performance art pieces, he studied perception and behaviour of crowd. His ideas evolved in his theory of holographic perception – that various types of stimuli entangle and excite a holographic image in the mind of the spectator. In 2008, Thomas Goppel wrote a foreword for the publication about Lubo Kristek issued by the Neues Stadtmuseum and noted that this sculpture is a reminder that \\"art should be perceived by all the senses.\\" The piece was commissioned by Beatrix und Erich Matthees (the Lechstadt Hausbau company) and donated to the museum. In November 1992, it was inaugurated in the museum’s garden as an introduction to Kristek’s solo retrospective exhibition in the Neues Stadtmuseum starting on 12 December. In 2015, the sculpture was included in the selection of 40 collection pieces owned by the Neues Stadtmuseum described in the publication Schätze aus den städtischen Sammlungen des Neuen Stadtmuseums Landsberg am Lech (Treasures of the Municipal Collection in the Neues Stadtmuseum Landsberg am Lech).

Braamspunt is the most western point of the Commewijne District at the combined mouth of the Suriname and Commewijne River. The capital Paramaribo is located to the south of Braamspunt. The name is a corruption of Byam's Point which refers William Byam who was a quartermaster of Willoughby. History After Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam was constructed in 1747, a redoubt was created at Braamspunt to aid in the defence of the Colony of Suriname. Even though Napoleon Bonaparte did not officially annex the Netherlands until 1806. Great Britain considered it a puppet state and started to eye the colonies. In 1804, the British Navy arrived in Suriname with 31 ships and 5,000 soldiers. The redoubts Braamspunt and Leiden quickly fell to the enemy, but Fort Nieuw- Amsterdam managed to offer resistance before it too was conquered. Suriname was returned in 1815 at the Congress of ViennaTreaty of Paris at Wikisource During the 18th century, ships had to anchor at Braamspunt before being allowed to continue to Paramaribo. Nature reserve Baby turtles race to the ocean In the late 19th century, the strategic importance of Fort Nieuw- Amsterdam and its redoubts started to decline, and Braamspunt became a little fishing village with a tiny population. The area is a nesting ground for turtles. The most important being the leatherback sea turtles, and the green sea turtles. The ares is also known for its diversity in bird life. A dolphin protection has been setup, because dolphins are frequently often spotted near Braamspunt. During the 20 century, the importance of wildlife was recognized, and because Braamspunt together with Galibi Nature Reserve was one of the few remaining nesting grounds for the turtles, it was designed as bijzonder beheersgebied (special management area) in 2015 in order to protect the turtles, and the bird population. As of 2017, attempts were being made to prevent disturbance by day tourism. Braamspunt can only be reached by boat from Paramaribo.

Born in Lambeth as Sarah Louisa Wilmott, she was educated privately, then at the College for the Higher Education of Christian Women in Clapham. She married Dr Robert Simpson in 1889, living initially in Bristol, then in 1895 the couple moved in Plymouth. In Plymouth, Simpson became active in the Liberal Party, and in 1898 she was the only woman to win election to the town's Board of Guardians. In this role, she worked to improve conditions in the workhouse infirmary, served on the city's Distress Committee, and from 1910, chaired its Children's Committee. Simpson was a founder member of the Plymouth branch of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, in 1909. During World War I, she served with the Medical Electrical Treatment Mission. After the war, she joined the Labour Party, and in 1919 was elected to the town's borough council, representing Stoke ward, one of the first two women councillors in the town. In 1919, she was appointed as a magistrate, one of the 172 women appointed on the first day they were permitted to hold the position. In 1921, the Simpsons moved to Edmonton, near London, although Louie remained a magistrate in Plymouth and visited the town regularly. At the 1923, she stood unsuccessfully in West Dorset, taking second place with 41.2% of the vote. She was the Labour Party's only woman candidate in the West of England. The Times noted that her main policy was for international peace, and she worked hard to win the votes of Liberal Party supporters, addressing 17 meetings in just one day. She stood again in the seat at the 1924 UK general election, but fell to only 31.7% of the vote. Simpson was later elected to the Edmonton Board of Guardians, also serving on the Middlesex Education Committee and the Enfield Labour Exchange. She died in Winchmore Hill in 1941.

Its title distinguishes it from his later Small Passion. One of the best surviving sets is now in the Albertina in Vienna. History Christ Carries his Cross At first, after settling in Nuremburg, Dürer only produced prints, a far more guaranteed income stream than chasing commissions for paintings. Around 1497 he began to plan an ambitious and in many ways innovative plan to produce an illustrated edition of the Passion of Jesus, which he worked on in parallel with his Apocalypse. He not only produced the preparatory drawings for the work but also the woodblocks for printing the images and text. As with Apocalypse, the illustrations were full-page works in recto, followed by the text of the relevant Biblical verses, telling the same scene in image and words without the reader having to compare each illustration with its corresponding passage. He drew on both local and foreign artistic influences including Raphael's Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary. The stand-out print from his first phase of work on Passion is Christ Bearing his Cross - its crowd and Christ uniting two themes from copperplate engravings by Martin Schongauer and accentuating their Late Gothic style whilst the musculature of the soldier on the right also draws on the contemporary study of anatomy which Dürer would have seen in Italian Renaissance works in Venice. These two influences are merged in an idiosyncratic but naturalistic style, making the best use of the bold black- white contrast inherent in woodcutting, giving volume to the figures through parallel hatching, already used for copperplate engravings at that time. The synthesis intensifies as the work goes on, merging the visionary nature of the events with a classical naturalism and monumentality in the figures. The full set was only completed with its last four plates and the frontispiece in 1510, appearing as a book with a Latin text. In the meantime Dürer had had to release individual prints from the set thus (combined with its less sensational and fantastical nature than Apocalypse) lessening the final work's impact and success.

It is one of two species within the Bartholina genus, the other being B. etheliae. The species’ common name refers to its spreading and deeply cut lip that is said to resemble a spider's legs. It is native to the Eastern and the Western Cape Provinces of South Africa, flowering from the end of August to the middle of October and peaking in September. This is one of the species sometimes referred to as \\"spider orchid\\". Bartholina burmanniana is rarely found in colonies, growing in small groups or singly in a variety of habitats and soil types. Mass flowering is observed after summer bush fires remove thick vegetation, creating an opportune environment for attracting pollinators. Work undertaken in 2009 has proposed the long-proboscid tabanid fly, Philoliche rostrate, to be the pollinator of this species.  Description  Bartholina burmanniana was one of the earliest of the Cape orchids to be described in published works reputedly due to its unusual beauty. Bartholina is dwarf genus, with B. burmanniana reaching up to between 50-220mm tall. It is a terrestrial orchid, with a single or double root-stem tuberoid, 9-12x 5-8mm, which is replaced annually. Bartholina burmanniana has a single, prostrate, basal leaf that is sessile to the stem. It is smooth with a dark green cordate or orbicular base 10-40 x 8-20mm with a fringe of hairs along the margins. The scape (leafless inflorescence stalk), is 35-160mm tall and slender. It is pubescent with white hairs 1-3mm and a maroon- brown, sometimes turning to green at the top. The pedicle is forward curved and around 10-15mm long. The Inflorescence is typically single-flowered (rarely double) with a faint scent. It has green oblong-lanceolate, pubescent bracts, around 9-12mm long which are spathe- shaped and clasping. The petals are 9-19 x 2-3mm, white with a blue-mauve middle stripe. They are narrowly lanceolate and erect to slightly recurved. A characteristic feature within the genus is the white- mauve flowers with a fan-shaped spreading lip each divided into many linear segments. This feature gives the species its common name, as it is said that the deeply cut lip resemble a spider's legs. This lip can be up to 35x30mm. Within B. burmanniana the lip segments are divided into 4-6 slender lobes between 22-32x 05.-2mm, which taper to a long tip and bend downwards. This helps to distinguish is from B. etheliae which has a lip with clavate (club-shaped) tips which are upturned. B. burmanniana has a spur, 8-13mm long and cone-shaped which extends backwards. The lip is attached to the column at the base. The column has club- shaped anthers, up to 10mm long, held immediately in front of the petals. The rostellum, the projection on the column which separates the stigma surface from the anther, is 2mm tall. Each anther lobe has a solitary oblong, granular pollinia held on a long stalk. The stigma is minute with an ovary 10-15mm long, curved, oblong and hairy. The seed capsule is 15-20 x 4-5mm long and oblong shaped. The greenish sepals are around 6-12mm long, linear-lanceolate and bend upwards; tapering to a long tip. They are pubescent on the margins and free, subequal and erect to suberect. The hairy sepals of B. burmanniana also helps to differentiate it from B. etheliae which has hairless sepals. As a deciduous geophytic plant it goes dormant in the summer after flowering, dying back to the tuberoid until the next winter growing season.  Etymology  The genus Bartholina was named by Robert Brown in 1813 for the Danish anatomist and physiologist Professor Thomas Bartholin (1616-1680). Bartholin is most famously known for first describing the human lymph system. The species epithet burmanniana was given by Carl Linnaeus to honour his friend Johannes Burman (1707-1779) a physician and professor of botany in Amsterdam with an early interest in the flora of the Cape. The common names, spider orchid and spinekopblom refer to the spider-like lip of the flower.  Habitat and ecology  Bartholina burmanniana is considered to be a variable species, occurring in a number of conditions and habitats throughout its range. It can be found most commonly in the fertile clay soils of the ‘renosterveld’, a Dicerothamnus rhinoceritis dominated shrubland, on stony slopes or amongst bushes and clearings. It is also found on the nutrient poor, acid sandstone soils of the lowland and montane-fynbos shrubland dominated by the Cape heathland vegetation of Agathosma and Erica. It is also found in transitional fynbos-renosterveld were these two habitats meet. Bartholina burmanniana is rarely found in colonies, growing in small groups or singly in a variety of habitats and soil types. While not fire-dependent, mass flowering of B. burmanniana is observed after summer bush fires remove thick vegetation, creating an opportune environment for attracting pollinators. Field work undertaken in 2009 at the Cape Peninsula by Greig Russell and Bill Liltved, has proposed the long-proboscid tabanid fly, Philoliche rostrate, to be the pollinator of this species.  Distribution  Bartholina burmanniana is widely distributed throughout the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, from Clanwilliam in Western Cape to Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape. It can be found at altitudes between sea-level up to over 2000m in the Groot-Swartberg, a mountain range in the Western Cape.  Taxonomy and Systematics  Bartholina burmanniana is one of two species within the Bartholina genus, the other being B. etheliae. Heinrich Bernard Oldenland collected the species type, placing the voucher in the herbarium of Johannes Burman the Dutch botanist and physician. Burman's son Nicolaas Burman (1733–1793), arrived in Uppsala in 1760 to learn under Carl Linnaeus, bringing herbarium material from Oldenland's Cape of Good Hope collections. Linnaeus described these specimens in 1760 in the Plantae Rariores Africanae. B. burmanniana was amongst the small number of African orchids described by Linnaeus, naming the species Orchis burmanniana (L.) in Burman's honour. The species was described by Robert Brown as B. pedinata in 1813 marking the creation of the genus Bartholina. A few years later in 1818 it was given the still extant name of B. burmanniana by Ker Gawl. Bartholina sits within the family Orchidaceae, one of the largest flowering plant families globally. The family was first divided into eight genera by Linnaeus in 1753. As orchid taxonomy opened up to new techniques in molecular phylogenetic, studies began analysing DNA sequences to establish relationships between orchid species. Current classifications place B. burmanniana within the order Asparagales, the family Orchidaceae, the subfamily Orchidoideae and the subtribe Orchidinae. There is some debate about the relationship between Bartholina and Holothrix, another dwarf geophytic orchid genus. Both genera share an identical flower structure and a number of vegetative features. Within both Bartholina and Holothrix auricles (filament appendages) are absent. This differentiates them from all other Orchideae and Diseae. Instead their staminodes and gynostemium are homologous. As such, Kurzweil & Weber, 1991 believe that generic separation of Bartholina may not be appropriate.  Conservation status  The Red List of South African plants states the National Status of Bartholina burmanniana be of ‘Least Concern’. This means that the species has been evaluated and believed to have a \\"low risk of extinction\\". This assessment was made in 2005 by Johnson and Victor according to IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.  Horticultural cultivation  Bartholina burmanniana was amongst the first cultivated plants from South Africa to be introduced and to flower in Europe. It was first brought to Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, from the Cape of Good Hope in 1787, by Francis Masson a Scottish plant-hunter and horticulturalist. The plants mutually beneficial association with mycorrhizal fungi is the key to successful cultivation. Within Bartholina spp., the root-stem tuberoids are replaced every year, meaning that mycorrhizal associations must be renewed annually. Therefore, plants must be grown in soil from their natural region or in the presence of an appropriate mycorrhizal fungi. It is recommended that coarse sand is incorporated into the medium and placed under cover with an open aspect. Watering regimes need to mimic the conditions of the Cape, with heavy fortnightly watering that stops completely from spring throughout the summer.

Englehart is best known for his role in the formation of Imperial Oil in 1880 to combat the growing influence of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. Englehart was one of the most successful oil refiners in Canada during the 1800's and oversaw the completion of the Temiskaming and North Ontario Railway. BiographyEarly life= Englehart was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on November 2, 1847.\\"Imperial Oil Pioneer Dies\\". Imperial Oil Review ( May 1921). 5 (5): 11. In 1860, he travelled to New York, where he found employment at Sonneborn, Dryfoos and Company as a salesman. The firm blended and sold whisky from various distilleries, and legal difficulties drove Englehart and his employers to emigrate to Canada in the spring of 1866. After arriving in Canada, Englehart grew interested in Ontario's oil market, and with the support of New York investors, he built an oil refinery in London that produced kerosene from the oil pumped from at Oil Springs and Petrolia. He also operated as a broker, buying kerosene from other Ontario refineries for shipment to markets in Europe and Asia. In an effort to control all oil refineries in Canada and drive up the price of kerosene by limiting production, Englehart partnered with Chicago Judge Ebenezer Higgins and set out to lease fifty-two Ontario refineries. The scheme fell apart in six months, and Englehart formed a kerosene refining partnership with Herman and Issac Waterman that was profitable until the Panic of 1873 and the discovery of oil reserves in Pennsylvania. In 1874, the partnership between Englehart and the Watermans was dissolved, and Englehart sold his London refinery to the London Refining Company. After a two year hiatus from the oil industry, Englehart reentered the scene in 1876 in partnership with Issac Guggenheim. With Guggenheim's financial backing, Englehart acquired the defunct Carbon Oil refinery in Petrolia and rebuilt it as the Silver Star Refinery. Englehart chose to build his refinery in Petrolia because of the Great Western Railway's expensive shipping rates. It became cheaper to have the oil refined closer to the source. To encourage the construction of the refinery, Petrolia offered Englehart a five-year tax relief deal. When the Silver Star Refinery opened in January 1879, it was heralded as the largest and most modern of its kind in Canada, with state of the art equipment, an industrial agitator that could treat over 1,800 barrels and a 100,000-barrel reserve capacity. On-site, there was a barrel-making facility, plus a tin-making facility for shipping 10-barrel cans of refined oil to India, China, Japan, as well as Central and South America. Additionally, the refinery contained a boiler house, an engine house, a waterworks system with a 5,000 barrel tank and its own fire brigade. Overall, the Silver Star employed over 500 people, making it the largest employer in Petrolia until it closed down in 1898. Reportedly, Englehart always ensured the Silver Star was spotless and introduced many safety measures to prevent accidental explosions. In 1882, Englehart, John Henry Fairbank and other businessmen from Petrolia formed the Crown Savings and Loan Company. By all accounts, Englehart was always immaculately dressed , making him stand out in Ennskillen's industrial boomtown environment. = Imperial Oil = In April 1880, Englehart and sixteen leading refiners from London and Petrolia established Imperial Oil in response to Standard Oil's growing dominance in the oil market. Englehart was the driving force behind the partnership, hoping to amalgamate the entire Canadian oil industry, much as John D. Rockefeller was in the process of accomplishing in the United States. Englehart and the other refiners established Imperial Oil as a Joint Stock Company with a capitalized value of $500,000. Combined, the shareholders owned 12 refineries and 85 percent of the refining capacity in Canada. Imperial Oil's charter specified that their goal was to \\"find, produce, refine and distribute petroleum and its production throughout Canada.\\" At the time of Imperial Oil's formation, Englehart was the largest shareholder, owning roughly 20 percent of the company, and was named the vice president. In a deliberate move to limit production and boost kerosene prices, Imperial closed every refinery in its possession except for the Silver Star in Petrolia and another in London. When the London refinery burnt down after being struck by lightning, Englehart concentrated Imperial's refining efforts in Petrolia. Despite rising revenues throughout the 1890s, Imperial Oil did not have the capital to compete against Standard Oil, which was directing a chain of subsidiary companies across Canada. In 1895, Englehart and the board of directors attempted to sell the majority of shares in Imperial Oil to a British company- the Colonial Development Corporation for $585,000. The negotiations went on for three years with no successful outcome, and Imperial Oil's management instead chose to sell the company to Standard Oil. Under the deal, Standard Oil acquired 75 percent of Imperial Oil's shares, Imperial Oil would acquire all of Standard Oil's Canadian subsidiary companies, Imperial's capitalization would be increased to $1 million, and Imperial shareholders would receive a dividend of $93,000. Shortly after the deal took place, Standard Oil shut down the Silver Star refinery in Petrolia and moved Imperial Oil's refining operations to Sarnia. Englehart remained on Imperial Oil's Board of Directors after the buyout until his death in 1921.\\"Imperial Oil Pioneer Dies\\". Imperial Oil Review (1921). 5 (5): 11. = Temiskaming and North Ontario Railway = In 1905, Ontario Premier James Whitney requested Englehart's aid in constructing the Temiskaming and North Ontario Railway. Englehart agreed to help and served as chairman of the commission from 1905-1920, overseeing the completion of the railroad. Reportedly, residents of Petrolia and employees at the Silver Star refinery were shocked at Englehart's departure, seeing his decision to support a railroad venture a \\"betrayal\\" due to their ongoing problems with high tariffs. In 1908, the town of Englehart was named after him. When a fire in 1911 destroyed camps and towns along the railways, Englehart led efforts to raise relief funds for the affected workers and families. At the height of the disaster, Englehart posted a sign at the Englehart's train station that read: \\"No one need pass here hungry, J.L Englehart.\\" = Marriage and children = Englehart married Charlotte Eleanor Thompson in 1891 at Petrolia's Christ Anglican Church. Shortly after the marriage, the couple built a red-bricked mansion in Petrolia, known as Glenview. Charlotte was highly involved in community affairs in Petrolia and stipulated in her will that upon the death of herself and Englehart, their home should be turned over to Petrolia for use as a hospital. Although Englehart and Thompson were childless for 16 years, Thompson found out she was pregnant in 1908. She died on New Year's Eve 1908 due to complications of the pregnancy. = Philanthropy = In 1910, Englehart donated a set of tower bells to Petrolia's Christ Anglican Church. When the church burned to the ground on January 10, 1957, the church's tower and set of bells were the only part of the structure that survived. After Charlotte's death in 1908, Englehart honoured his wife's wishes and donated Glenview mansion to Petrolia for use as a hospital. Named the Charlotte Eleanor Englehart Hospital, Englehart provided the institution with $36,000 in Imperial Oil shares, financing its operations for over fifty years. The hospital remains open today. =Death and afterward= On April 1, 1921, Englehart died from a brain hemorrhage at Wellesley Hospital, Toronto.\\"Imperial Oil Pionner Dies.\\" Imperial Oil Review (May 1921). 5 (5): 11. Englehart's funeral was held at the Christ Anglican Church in Petrolia on April 9.\\"Imperial Oil Pionner Dies.\\" Imperial Oil Review (May 1921). 5 (5): 11. Hundreds of citizens from Petrolia turned out to the funeral service, and shops closed throughout the day to pay their respects.\\"Imperial Oil Pionner Dies.\\" Imperial Oil Review (1921). 5 (5): 16. Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions In July 2016, the Jack Munroe Historical Society of Elk City posthumously awarded Englehart with the Order of the North for his work in building the Temiskaming and North Ontario Railway. In Petrolia, a small park and street is named after Englehart.

It is accredited by the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE). Its governing organization is a non-profit organization Lycée Français de la Nouvelle Orléans, Inc. History The school opened in 2011. Originally the school operated out of the Audubon Zoo and the First Presbyterian Church, with three classrooms at each location. That year the school was making plans to sign a lease on a school building.Morris, Robert. \\"Lycee Francais nearing deal for new school building.\\" Uptown Messenger. November 14, 2011. Retrieved on August 3, 2012. The school had to rent facilities since, according to its charter classification, the Louisiana state government and the OPSB did not guarantee the school facilities. Jill Otis was the first CEO of the school. The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) authorized the charter of the school. It was not a part of the Recovery School District (RSD). In November 2011 St. Francis of Assisi Church agreed to lease its school building to the lycee. Milestone SABIS Academy previously leased the building; the Milestone SABIS school leadership learned of the change through the media. In April 2012, Jean-Jacques Grandiere became the interim CEO. By fall 2012 the school received a deficit of $80,000, and the school had to lay off some employees. At that time Grandiere had resigned. The chairperson of the board, Jean Montes, hired a former McGehee School employee, Gisele Schexnider, as the interim CEO. In response some parents complained to the Louisiana state government. Danielle Dreilinger of The Times-Picayune stated that this decision resulted in \\"Trust [having] bottomed out\\". Parents critical believed that the decision happened too quickly and that it was not right that the hiring was done without a previous superintendent search. There was also a group of parents who supported Schexnider. On January 11, 2013, parents filed a formal complaint with the BESE. In response, John White, the Louisiana state superintendent of education, appointed a person to assist the school to get a permanent leader, Jeremy Hunnewell, who was of both EMH Strategy and the Louisiana Association of Public Charter Schools, in December 2012; this was a decision Dreilinger described as unexpected. In 2013, due to the initial sudden changes in leadership, Dreilinger described the school as \\"troubled\\". The board had selected Mireille Rabaté as the new CEO for 2013 but she declined the job. On July 1, 2013, Keith Bartlett became the new CEO. Its tentative enrollment for fall 2013 was 400 and it covered up to the third grade. In 2014 the school joined the Association of French Schools in North America (AFSA, , AEFA) group and received accreditation from the French Ministry of Education. In 2015 it had 466 students. That year, the OPSB sold the three story former Alfred C. Priestly Junior High School campus to the Lycee. By 2016 the school had 721 students. It had two additional campuses: St. Paul’s United Church of Christ, and Central St. Matthew United Church of Christ, the latter beginning in 2016. That year the student population was expanding and the school was seeking additional temporary space. In 2016 the lycee's board approved plans to ask to open a campus at the former James Weldon Johnson Elementary School in Carrollton. Space in Johnson opened up since Sophie B. Wright Charter School vacated the building that year as renovation in its permanent facility had been completed. The request was approved in March 2017. Admissions For students in grade 1 and above, admissions usually requires taking a test in the French language. In 2019 the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) allowed the school to give waivers for the French proficiency test to students who come from schools accredited by the French Ministry of Education and/or have passed the Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française. Campuses The old Priestly School complex, vacant in 2010 The future Lycee school building, the former Priestly Junior High School, is in the Pigeon Town/Pension Town area, in Leonidas.

The Priestly building/complex was worth about $425,000 in 2015; Martha Jewson of The Times- Picayune wrote that the school would need to spend at least $9 million to make the building student-worthy. According to a 2008 report from the OPSB, \\"The facility has extensive damage, and most is beyond repair.\\" The property makes up a single city block. In 1980 Priestly junior high had closed. From 1980 to 1993 the building housed offices, and from 1993 to 2005 it was used to store furniture. Hurricane Katrina disrupted the latter usage. OPSB owned the school building but sought to sell it as it deemed the building to be not needed. As per Louisiana law, charter school operators had priority in buying school buildings ahead of private entities. In 2015 all members of the lycee board agreed to purchase it. There was a website operated by people who opposed the Lycee buying Priestly. A group of area residents advocated instead for a health center to the at Priestly. The Johnson campus is in proximity to Priestly. It formerly operated the Claiborne Campus and the St. Paul Campus.

He was the Governor of North Sumatra from 1967 until 1978. Under his leadership, North Sumatra recovered from the leftovers from the 30 September Movement, and organized an association football tournament by his name which was internationally recognized by FIFA.  Early life  Harahap was born on 28 February 1921 in Tabusira. He was the fourth child of the six children of Jabbar Harahap, a common farmer in Tabusira. In Tabusira, there was only one elementary school in the village, which was built by the villagers. Even though elementary schools at that time have six grades, the elementary school in the village has only three grades. Harahap entered the school, and soon after, he graduated from the school in 1939. He wished to study at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs, but because lack of funding by his parents, Harahap opted to search for a job in Medan, the capital of Sumatra at the time. He followed his older brother, Sjamsoedin, who at that time was already in Medan.  Career  Due to transportation problems, Harahap only reached the city of Pematangsiantar. He was employed as a worker at a plantation in Pematangsiantar. At first, Harahap applied as a clerk in the plantation, but due to the lack of education, the employer of the plantation rejected his application. After several months working in the plantation, he moved on to Medan. In Medan, he lived with Sjamsoedin, and planned to enlist on the Japanese military, who at that time had occupied Medan.  Military career  Shortly after the Indonesian independence, Harahap joined the Barisan Pemuda paramilitary organization.

In 1949 at the age of 17 While continuing to play the drums Machado would go onto accidentally create a play style that would go onto influence modern samba. What occurred was that whilst playing with a samba band, Machado's snare drum broke. Not wanting to disrupt the flow of the music, he proceeded to play on the ride cymbal with his right hand, while he using his left hand to add syncopated accents on a tom drum. After his accidental creation of samba no prato, it would become Machado's signature play style in the years to come. At some point in the early 1950s, Machado joined the Brazilian Army and in doing so meet Raul de Souza. By around 1955, Machado had left the army and was playing at the Beco das Garrafas clubs which was also known as \\"Bottles Alley\\".

Dillon (1886 – 20 October 1983) was an American businesswoman and President of Brooklyn Borough Gas Company. She was the first female president of any utility company in the world. Biography Mary Dillon was born in Coney Island, Manhattan, one of 12 children. Dillon left Erasmus Hall High School in her senior year when she needed to replace her sister in her job at the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company in 1903 because of her family's limited income. She was seventeen and started as a junior clerk. She got a promotion within three years to office manager and she went on to become general manager and vice president and in 1926 Dillon was named president and chairman. She was the first woman to be the president of a utility. In the early 1920s, Dillion joined the British Women's Engineering Society (WES) and the Electrical Association for Women, at the time the only such organisations in the world. She paid them a visit in London in 1925. In the late 1920s, Dillon collaborated with fellow US WES member Dr. Lillian Gilbreth, a leading expert in time and motion studies, on the creation of an efficient kitchen, equipped with gas powered appliances and named the Kitchen Practical. Inspired by Dillon's criticisms of her own kitchen, it was designed on three principles: the correct and uniform height of working surfaces; a circular work place; and a general “circular routing of working”, all carefully analysed to reduce the time and effort required in the preparation of meals. It was unveiled in 1929 at a Women’s Exposition, and formed the basis for Gilbraith's development of kitchen design principles which still underlie much of kitchen planning today. Working in the Coney Island area, Dillon also served on the local school board. She was appointed to the Board of Education by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1942 and became the first woman to be appointed president of the board in 1944 until 1946. She was on the governing committee of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences as well as a director of the Brooklyn and Coney Island Chambers of Commerce. During the Great Depression, in 1934, Dillon organised the Summer Portable Theater, known as the theater on wheels. Dillon was also on the Mayor's Business Advisory Council and the War Council of the City of New York. Dillon married Henry Farber in 1923 but always used her own name. Farber died in 1948. Dillon retired in 1949 and moved to Vermont until 1973 when she moved to Hawaii where she lived for the rest of her life.

J. Viola. The film follows a group of young adults who enter a clinical trial for a memory-enhancing drug that allows them to have visions of the future. When a previous trial participant threatens the livelihoods of the participants and the doctors involved in the current trial, five participants struggle to find a way out of the facility alive.  Plot  The film opens with a man looking at drawings. He then commits suicide. One of the drawings is revealed to say \\"Kill yourself or I kill them all.\\" In a speech, Dr. Layton (Mark Rolston) introduces the concept of A9913, a memory-enhancing drug created by Hallorann Pharmaceuticals. The drug is able to give individuals full memory recall, allowing them to fully relive their past memories. He meets with Dr. Jerrems (William Mapother), who has been working on the A9913 drug. Eighteen young adults, including Anna (Virginia Gardner), and Den (Nathan Kress) have been recruited to take part in the clinical trial. Dr. Jerrems informs them that it is a Phase 3 trial for A9913 and that all of the participants will be residing in the building until it is complete. Anna meets participants Kristen (Kirby Bliss Blanton) and Scratch (Ryan Higa). The drugs take effect in Marcus (Mark Furze) and Kristen next, who sees herself talking with another participant. She is shocked when the events begin to play out in the present and likens the experience to déjà vu. Scratch suggests that Kristen is remembering the future, since time is not linear. Jerrems is told that co-researcher Dr. Rasmussen was found dead; he was the man at the start of the film. During the night, Anna finds the bedroom is locked, and watches as the girls inside cough and begin to die. The window is painted with blood and reads \\"5260.\\" However, it is revealed that nothing happened when Anna finds herself in the present again. She attempts to leave and reveals that she saw everyone die in her vision. Curtis injects her with a sedative and Jerrems explains that she is experiencing a rare side effect. He leaves her strapped to a gurney while the effects wear off. Marcus, Kristen, and Den see Curtis die and escape the building, joined by Scratch. Anna has a vision of freeing herself and another of Marcus dead. Den, Marcus, and Kristen return to the building to find Anna, leaving behind Scratch. The sleeping participants wake after smelling something from the vents. They begin to cough violently, as in Anna's vision. Anna breaks free and the gang informs her that the participants have been gassed with mustard gas. When Kristen goes to the bathroom, she goes missing. Scratch finds an entrance into the building and discovers a drawing of himself with hands around his neck. The trio find Jerrems' office. A past video of Rasmussen and Jerrems plays on the computer, in which they are questioning a man named Pascal. Anna and Marcus realize that the bloody numbers were not \\"5260,\\" but \\"5 2 GO,\\" as Anna, Den, Kristen, Marcus, Scratch are the last five people alive while the mustard gas has killed the others. Scratch mixes together several vials of drugs and injects himself. The group finds Jerrems in a locked room but he refuses to let them in. He tells them that Pascal was the first participant to have visions, and so was used to test new variations of the drug. The drug was revealed to have a cumulative effect, and Pascal began to stop experiencing time as linear. He had a psychotic break and is now killing the participants in order to pressure Jerrems into committing suicide. Scratch has a vision of himself being stabbed. As such, he is attacked by someone and stabbed. Marcus realizes that Pascal is likely to kill everyone in order to erase all traces of the drug. Thinking Anna's visions can't come true if she can't see them happening, he hits her and Den attacks him in retaliation. Marcus stabs himself during the fight and dies. Anna gets outside by jumping off the roof into a snowbank and goes to the car, where she finds Scratch's body and Kristen's frozen body. She realizes that her vision of Kristen dying in the bathroom was wrong. She confronts Jerrems about the discrepancy and argues that the visions are not fate but merely self- fulfilling prophecies, which Jerrems agrees with. She then injects herself with the drug that Scratch had. Den finds Pascal and attacks him. Pascal stabs Den prior to throwing him into the pool. Anna saves Den. Dr. Layton arrives and unlocks the room Jerrems has been hiding in. Jerrems notices liquid on the floor; Layton drops his cigar and the room goes up in flames as Pascal walks away. Anna and Den make it outside. Pascal is watching them from the roof as sirens blare in the background.

She served fourteen years as the chief librarian at Medgar Evers College and fought against discrimination in the library profession. Early life and education Suzine Har was born in Seoul, Korea on March 21, 1931. She earned a bachelor's degree at Ewha Women's University, as well as two master's degrees from the University of Denver: a Master of Library Science and a Master in Modern Languages/Literatures and Comparative Linguistics. She later went on to earn a Ph.D. in Library Information Systems from Simmons College. Library career Nicolescu came to the United States in the early 1960s and worked in the University of Denver library for two years as a cataloger/bibliographer. In 1964 she joined the faculty at Illinois State University as assistant professor of library science and assistant librarian. She worked as an associate librarian/senior cataloger at the library at SUNY at Stony Brook. In 1968 she started her long career at City University of New York, which lasted until her retirement in 1999. Nicolescu worked as the chief of technical services and deputy chief librarian at CUNY's Medgar Evers College, going on to serve as the registrar for the college, and in 1985 she was selected as chief librarian and chair of the college's Library and Information Division. Service to librarianship Nicolescu was one of the three primary founding members of APALA in 1980; she served as the organization's president from 1985-1986. Along with fellow librarian Henry Chang, Nicolescu directed a needs assessment study for the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science Task Force on Improving Library and Information Services to Cultural Minorities. Focusing on the information needs of the Asian American community, they surveyed 240 public libraries in urban areas. Their findings \\"indicated that too much responsibility for multicultural service in public libraries was placed on minority librarians alone\\". Their 1982 report emphasized the need for an understanding of the ethnic and racial makeup of communities, appropriate language fluency, and a service-oriented positive attitude. In 1984 she was awarded a Fulbright-Hays fellowship, conducting research on the cataloging and classification systems of the libraries of three major Korean universities: Ewha Womans University, Yonsei University, and Sogang University, investigating how those libraries' catalog information could be computerized and shared internationally. Nicolescu also lectured in Korea and other Asian countries as part of her grant. Nicolescu talked openly about librarianship as one of the lowest paid professions, and lamented the fact that the compensation of women librarians remained far below that of men with equal responsibility. She worked to call out discrimination where she saw it and confront it with patience, objectivity, and effort. She encouraged librarians from around the world to unite in pursuing common goals such as equal access to information. Nicolescu died February 22, 2013 in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

He showed promise as a two-year-old in 2019 when he won two of four races and finished third in the Kokura Nisai Stakes. In the following year he won the Crocus Stakes and ran second in the Falcon Stakes before taking the Grade 1 NHK Mile Cup. Background Lauda Sion is a bay colt with a small white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Japan by the Shadai Corporation's Shiraoi Farm. He entered the ownership of Silk Racing was sent into training with Takashi Saito. The colt's name is derived from Lauda Sion, a Christian hymn written by Thomas Aquinas. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Real Impact who won the Yasuda Kinen in Japan and the George Ryder Stakes in Australia. Lauda Sion's dam, the Kentucky-bred Antiphona, showed modest racing ability winning one minor race from six starts in Japan. She was a great- granddaughter of the broodmare Carol's Christmas (foaled 1977) whose other descendants have included Olympio (Hollywood Derby), Pyro and Tapizar. Racing career2019: two-year-old season= Lauda Sion made a successful racecourse debut at Hanshin Racecourse on 22 June when he won an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1200 metres of firm ground. After an absence of over two months he returned to the track and was stepped up in class to contest the Grade 3 Kokura Nisai Stakes over 1200 metres at Kokura Racecourse and started at odds of 7.5/1 in a fourteen-runner field. Ridden by Yutaka Take he finished third behind Meiner Grit and Triple Ace, beaten a neck and half a length. On 12 October over 1400 metres on heavy ground at Kyoto Racecourse the colt was ridden by Christophe Lemaire when he started favourite for the Momiji Stakes and won by one and a half lengths from Lotus Land. For his final run of the season Lauda Sion was moved up to the highest class for the Grade 1 Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes over 1600 metres at Hanshin on 15 December and went off a 17/1 outsider. Before the race Saito said \\"He has been a little unruly in the gate previously, so he has had practice with this and getting a good start, and he does seem more relaxed now... The horse generally gives everything he's got, and having raced at Hanshin before, I’m looking forward to what he can do here\\". In the event, Lauda Sion was never in serious contention and came home eighth of the sixteen runners, six and a quarter lengths behind the winner Salios. In the official Japanese rankings for two-year-olds of 2019, Lauda Sion was given a rating of 103, making him the 28th best juvenile colt of the year. =2020: three-year-old season= On 1 February Lauda Sion began his second campaign in the Listed Crocus Stakes over 1400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and started the 4.5/1 third favourite behind Absolutismo and Armbrust. Partnered by Take he led from the start and won by two lengths from Harmony Magellan with Zenno Justa one and a quarter lengths back in third. On 14 March the colt started the 1.7/1 favourite for the Grade 3 Falcon Stakes over 1400 metres at Chukyo Racecourse and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths by Shine Garnet. In the Grade 1 NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo on 10 May Lauda Sion was ridden by Mirco Demuro and started at odds of 28.6/1 in an eighteen-runner field. Before the race Saito commented \\"It's a stretch, but I think he can handle 1,600 meters. He's more settled than he was before, a lot more mature and his balance is good now too. I think he can wait patiently enough. The competition is tough but I'm hoping he'll run a good race\\". The filly Resistencia started favourite while the other contenders included Taisei Vision (Arlington Cup), Satono Impresa (Mainichi Hai), Luftstrom (New Zealand Trophy), Shine Garnet and Harmony Magellan. Demuro broke quicky and settled in second place behind Resistencia before moving ahead of the filly in the straight. He drew away in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Resistenceia with another filly, Gilded Mirror, taking third ahead of Taisei Vision. After the race Demuro said \\"I knew that the track today ran better for front runners, and considering that he's usually an evenly-paced colt, I planned to keep him well up in front. He's always quick out of the gate so we were able to secure a good position and I felt he had plenty to outrun [Resistencia] in the final stages.\\" PedigreeReferences Category:2017 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Japan Category:Racehorses trained in Japan Category:Thoroughbred family 8-d ","title":"Lauda Sion (horse)"},{"id":"64064829","text":"Colliver is a surname.

It is one of three properties along Christianshavn Canal that were built by anchor smith Hans Caspersen and are now all known as the Hans Caspersen House, the others being Overgaden Oven Vandet 50 and Overgaden Neden Vandet 33. The building at Sankt Annæ Gade 4 is also associated with Caspersen. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History The Hans Caspersen House seen on a drawing by H.G.F. Holm The property at the site was from 1689 owned by brewer Cornelius Nissen, It was in 1701 sold to Friderich Svane, the owner of Svenstrup Manor, who that same year sold it to textile worker Christopher Vogt. Boldewin Depenbrock purchased the property in 1706. A half- timbered property at the site was in 1730 purchased by dyer Diderich Rohde. It was later sold to dyer Otto Birch. The house was in 1761 acquired by anchor smith Hans Caspersen. Caspersen replaced the half-timbered facade towards the street with one in brick and reduced the number of windows from 12 to eight larger ones. The building was a few years later hit by fire and demolished. He purchased a house at Overgaden Oven Vandet 50 where he would live with his family until circa 1780. He completed a new four-storeu building at Overgaden Neden Vandet 39 in 1777. It contained eight large apartments, two on each floor. Caspersen purchased the property at Overgaden Neden Vandet 33 in 1782 but remained in one of the apartments at No. 39 until a renovation of the building at No. 33 had been completed. On 2 January 1786, Caspersen sold No. 39 to merchant Peter Halkiær. In 1792, Halkiær sold it to Jeppe Prætorius. C. Langes Eddikebryggeri photographed by Frederik Riise in 1899 The military officer Jacob Scavenius Fibiger (1793-1861) was a resident in the building in 1860–161. He had in 1851 briefly served as Defence Minister in the 3rd Cabinet of Adam Wilhelm Moltke. The theologian Peter Andreas Fenger (1799-1878), who was pastor at Church of Our Saviour from 1855, lived in the apartment on the first floor from 1873 and until his death. C. Langes Eddikebryggeri, a manufacturer of vineger, was at the turn of the 20th century located in the courtyard. The company changed its name to De Danske Eddikebryggerier when it relocated to Holger Danskes Vej 104 in 1902.

His research typically investigates the chemistry of the lanthanide and actinide f-block elements. This is generally based on the synthesis of new f-block complexes, structural and bonding properties and their uses in different fields including in nuclear fuel cycles, energy and single molecule magnets.  Education  Mills completed his MChem in 2004 at Cardiff University where he finished his masters project with Prof. Cameron Jones. Upon graduation, he continued to read for his Doctor of Philosophy degree with Prof. Jones on Investigations into the Reactivity of an Anionic Gallium(I) N-Heterocyclic Carbene Analogue and successfully gained his PhD in 2007.  Research and career  Mills completed his postdoctoral research with Prof. Stephen Liddle at the University of Nottingham before moving to the University of Manchester in 2012 as a Lecturer. In 2017, he was promoted to the Senior Lecturer position and in 2019 was promoted to Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester. Mill's research is generally on lanthanide and Actinide chemistry and is specifically based on the synthesis of new f-block complexes, structural and bonding properties and their uses in different fields including in nuclear fuel cycles, energy and single molecule magnets. Apart from research and lecturing, Mills has also worked at the Royal Society of Chemistry, Manchester as the District Local Section Science Secretary and the University of Manchester Royal Society of Chemistry representative from (2013-2017), the Nuclear Materials Control Officer for the Centre for Radiochemical Research (2014-2019) and also as the co-organiser of Royal Society of Chemistry Manchester Dalton Northern (2015), Dial-a-Molecule Conference (2015) and Royal Society of Chemistry Manchester Northwest Organic and Dalton Division Awards Symposium (2013). = Notable work = In 2017, Mills and Nicholas F. Chilton led a research on the magnetic hysteresis at 60 Kelvin in dysprosocenium. This was the first time a higher temperature magnetic hysteresis has been observed, with the previously record being 30 K. The research introduced the ability to use liquid nitrogen instead of more expensive liquid helium during the magnetic hysteresis phenomenon which led to the attention of data storage server companies as the research introduced the potential of reducing both costs and energy requirements of data servers. In 2016, Mills also confirmed the capability to use pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure the covalency of actinide complexes in research in collaboration with Floriana Tuna and Professor Eric Mcinnes at the University of Manchester. Prior to this research, the extent of covalency in actinide complexes was less understood as this nature of bonding was not studied due to limited technology and methods of experimentation at the time. The use of pulsed EPR spectroscopy was able to determine the covalency of thorium(III) and Uranium(III) complexes for the first time and this paved the way to further research on the use of these complexes in the separation and recycling of nuclear waste. = Awards and Nominations = * Excellent Academic Advisor Award (2020) * Bill Newton Award (2019) * Periodic Table of Younger Chemists (2018) *Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize (2018) Major Reviews and Publications The following research and review papers by David Mills has been classified as \\"hot papers\\" from the journals in which the paper is published. 1\\\\.

Early life Tlhabi's parents, Brian Tlhabi and Penny Osiris, were both doctors. She was born in 1988, in the last years of apartheid. Her parents divorced and in 2010 a journalist, Redi Tlhabi, became her stepmother. Her comedy is influenced by her experience growing up as a relatively affluent black child attending mostly white institutions: for example, in junior school she was one of only two black girls in her grade. Tlhabi studied theatre in London at Brunel University and musical theatre and television writing in New York at the New York Film Academy and Columbia University before returning to South Africa to work as a screenwriter in 2014. Coconut Kelz She was writing for television and performing as a DJ (as Dame the DJ) when she started vlogging on YouTube as her alter-ego, Coconut Kelz. Kelz is a \\"caricature of a self- loathing black person who hilariously articulates collective white anxieties in post-apartheid South Africa.\\" Tlhabi sees the over-the-top character as a way to \\"play these [racist] sentiments back to them [white girls] in a funny way so they'd actually listen and not get defensive.\\" She cites Issa Rae, Tina Fey, Mindy Kaling and puppet Conrad Missing as her inspirations and comedic influences. Others have compared her race-bending comedy to Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G.

It was developed by the US Army Soldier Protection System (SPS) program, and is produced by Ceradyne, a 3M subsidiary. The helmet was first issued in 2019 to troops deploying to combat zones like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.  History  The IHPS helmet began development as a replacement for the Advanced Combat Helmets and Enhanced Combat Helmets in 2013 under the U.S. Army's Soldier Protection System program, a program intended to improve soldier protection and performance while reducing weight. Low Rate Initial Production delivery began 2nd quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. The helmet was first issued to troops deploying to combat zones through the RFI program. In October 2019 the new helmet was reported to have saved a soldiers life in Afghanistan, protecting his head from a brick thrown at his vehicle.  Design  The IHPS, combined with Military Combat Eye Protection (MCEP), completes the head protection part of the SPS effort. The IHPS is claimed to be 5% lighter than previous helmets, while offering improved blunt force impact and ballistic protection, especially when applique armor is attached. The IHPS uses a boltless chinstrap retention system, has an optional mandible with eyeshield for maxillofacial protection, and siderails for attaching equipment like flashlights.

She served during the Seven Years' War. In 1777, Pierre Beaumarchais purchased her as part of a commercial entreprise to provide weapons of the American independentist insurgents. She was part of the French line of battle at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779, and served as a hospital during the Siege of Savannah.  Career  Seven Years' War = Hippopotame entered service in 1750. From 1760, she was under Hippolyte de Sade de Vaudronne. In 1763, she conducted a mission to Algiers, under Captain de Fabry. = Interwar period = In 1769, Hippopotame was at Saint Domingue and Martinique under Vaudreuil, along with Solitaire, ferrying troops to the French colonies in the Caribbeans. She was part of the 1772 Escadre d'évolution under Captain Bougainvilliers de Croy. = War of American Independence = In April 1777, the Navy sold her to Roderigue Hortalez and Company, a company founded by Pierre Beaumarchais. He renamed her Fier Rodrigue and from 1778, he used her to ferry weapons to the American insurgents. She departed Rochefort in January 1778, sailed to Saint-Domingue and America, and was back in Rochefort on 1 October. In early 1779, she departed Rochefort to sail to Brest and Ile d'Aix. She departed Ile d'Aix around April, and sail to America. In July 1779, Fier Rodrigue was escorting a 10-ship convoy near Grenada. On 6, she encountered the fleet under Estaing, preparing for battle. the French Navy requisitioned her and she took part in the ensuing Battle of Grenada. Her captain, Montault, was killed, and 22-year old auxiliary officer Ganteaume The requisition of Fier Rodrigue caused several ships of Beaumarchais' convoy to be captured. Beaumarchais protested and sought compensation from the French Crown. Around August 1779, Fier Rodrigue was used as a hospital ship in Charlestown, to support the Siege of Savannah. Two month later, the Navy returned her to Beaumarchais. Fier Rodrigue called the Chesapeake and Yorktown, from where she departed on 14 August 1780, bound for Rochefort. On 1 August 1780, Fier Rodrigue arrived at Île de Ré, escorting a 15-ship convoy from New England, as well as two prizes captured from the British.

Early life and education Burkett was born 7 October 1924 in Newcastle upon Tyne, to Alice (nee Gaussen), a violinist, and Ridley Burkett, a watchmaker and repairer. She attended Whickham School, gained a BA and teaching qualification at St Hild's College, University of Durham, and moved down to London to work in teaching. In 1954 she moved to Cumbria as Arts and Craft Lecturer at Charlotte Mason College, Ambleside, but gave up this job in 1962 to spend seven months travelling in Turkey and Iran with her friend Genette Malet de Carteret. They co-wrote an account of this trip, The Beckoning East: A journey through Turkey and Persia in 1962 in 2006. It was on this trip that Burkett first developed an interest in felt and feltmaking. Abbot Hall Abbott Hall in 2013 After her travels Burkett was appointed to the staff of the newly-opened Abbot Hall Art Gallery in 1962, and became its director in 1966, succeeding Helen Kapp. She held this post until she retired in 1986. Under her leadership the museum developed and expanded, and major acquisitions included Barbara Hepworth's Trezion, works by George Romney, and the triptych The Great Picture of Lady Anne Clifford. She established the adjacent Museum of Lakeland Life & Industry which opened in 1971 and in 1973 was the first winner of the Museum of the Year award. While at Abbot Hall she wrote several books on Cumbrian artists and other personalities, including John Bracken, Kurt Schwitters, George Smith (\\"the Skiddaw Hermit\\"), May Moore, Joseph Sutton, Christopher Steele and George Senhouse. She co-authored books on William Green and Mathias Read with David Sloss, and on Jenny Cowern and Percy Kelly with Valerie Rickerby. William Green of Ambleside won the Lakeland Book of the Year in 1984, and Percy Kelly: a Cumbrian Artist in 1998. A book of her letters from Percy Kelly, Dear Mary, Love Percy: A Creative Thread - The Illustrated Letters of Percy Kelly to Mary Burkett 1968-1993 edited by David Sloss was published in 2011 and won the same award. Felt In 1979 she organised an exhibition \\"Art of the Feltmaker\\" at Abbot Hall, and wrote a book to accompany the exhibition, which toured the country. Following the interest in this exhibition the International Feltmakers Association was founded in 1984 and Burkett became its first President. After Abbot Hall In the year of her retirement from Abbot Hall, Burkett inherited Isel Hall near Cockermouth from a friend and distant relation Margaret Austen Leigh. This included a 14th-century pele tower but was in a state of disrepair: Burkett \\"was once introduced to the Prince of Wales as \\"the maddest woman in England\\" for taking it on.\\", but opened it to the public weekly with volunteer help and had plans to make it an artists' colony. She was a supporter of many cultural institutions in Cumbria. She was a Trustee of the Rosehill Theatre in Whitehaven, a director of Border Television, and a member of Carlisle Cathedral's Diocesan Advisory Committee and its Fabric Committee. She helped raise funds to establish Senhouse Roman Museum in Maryport, and was a trustee for 20 years and its chair for seven. Burkett died 12 November 2014.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the reign of Claudius, under whom the general Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, consul in AD 66, won his first military victories; but the family is perhaps best known for the historian Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, who flourished toward the beginning of the second century. Origin The origin of the Suetonii is nowhere mentioned in ancient writers, but several of them came from Pisaurum in Umbria, suggesting that this may be their original home.Birley, \\"Suetonius Paullinus\\". Praenomina The main praenomina of the Suetonii were Gaius and Lucius, the two most common names at all periods of Roman history. The only other names found among the inscriptions of this family are Sextus and Titus. Branches and cognomina The only distinct family of the Suetonii bore the cognomen Paulinus or Paullinus, derived from the common surname Paullus, meaning \\"small\\", which could be bestowed on account of a person's stature, or upon the youngest child in a family.New College Latin and English Dictionary, s.v. paullus. It is not known whether or how the historian Suetonius was related to this family. Members * Lucius Suetonius L. l.

He was consul in 66, and one of Otho's generals during his war against Vitellius.

History On November 7, 1871, Stephen Friel Nuckolls was selected to serve as President of the Council and Ben Sheeks was selected to serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In November, legislation was proposed that would repeal the legislation giving women the right to vote that was passed in 1869. The House of Representatives voted nine to three in favor of the legislation, with all nine Democratic members voting in favor and three Republican members voting against. The legislation later passed the Council with five to four voting in favor. However, the legislation was vetoed by Governor John Allen Campbell. The House of Representatives voted in favor of overturning his veto, but the Council did not. On December 18, the Council approved Governor Campbell's nominations of J. H. Hayward for Auditor and J.

Hall and Preddy, a homosexual couple, brought the case after the Bulls refused to give them a double room in their guesthouse, citing their religious beliefs. Following appeals, the Supreme Court held the rulings of the lower courts in deciding for Hall and Preddy and against the Bulls. The court said that Preddy and Hall faced discrimination which could not be justified by the Bulls' right to religious belief. It was held that people in the United Kingdom could not justify discrimination against others on a basis of their sexual orientation with their religious beliefs.  Background  In September 2008, Steven Preddy and Martin Hall, a homosexual couple in a civil partnership, booked a double room at a guesthouse in Marazion, Cornwall over the telephone. When they arrived, the Bulls, who are Christians, refused the couple a double room as they found extramarital sex incompatible with their religious beliefs. Hall and Preddy were offered a two-bed room or two singles, but left and found alternative accommodation. They then filed a complaint of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation to the County Court which found in their favour and ordered the Bulls to pay £1800 to each of them in damages. The Court of Appeal agreed with the lower court but the Bulls appealed to the Supreme Court.  Case  The Bulls argued that the Court of Appeal had been wrong in their judgement as they had not discriminated on the couple's sexual orientation but rather their marital status, which is allowed in English law. They accepted that this resulted in indirect discrimination for same-sex couples (who could not at the time get married) but maintained that this was justified because of their sincerely held religious beliefs.  Judgment  The appeal was dismissed unanimously, with all judges ruling that the indirect discrimination could not be justified by religion and a majority of three judges holding that it still constituted direct discrimination. Lady Hale wrote and delivered the majority decision, with which Lord Kerr and Lord Toulson agreed. Lord Neuberger and Lord Hughes dissented on the ruling of direct discrimination but concurred with the other justices in a unanimous agreement that the case constituted unlawful indirect discrimination.  Reaction  LGBT rights organisation Stonewall said they were \\"pleased\\" that the Court had upheld the rights they had \\"fought so hard to secure\\". A statement from the Christian Institute criticised the outcome, saying that \\"the power of political correctness have reached all the way to the top of the judicial tree\\".

The award was made for his actions immediately after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, for his conspicuous gallantry and outstanding leadership while leading a company of the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment in an assault on a Pakistani defensive position that remained inside Indian territory. He retired from the army as a brigadier and lives in New Delhi. Early life and family Vijay Kumar Berry was born on 26 June 1938 in Amritsar, in the British province of Punjab, the son of Shri Om Prakash Berry. He attended Sherwood College in Nainital, Uttarakhand, and St. Edward's School, Shimla before entering the National Defence Academy from which he went on to attend the Indian Military Academy. His wife's name is Klran, and they have two daughters: Manika, born in 1969; and Rashmi, born in 1972. Military career Berry was commissioned into the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Army on 7 June 1959. At the time of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Berry was a major commanding C Company of the 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment (4 PARA). The battalion had been deployed into the Ganganagar district of Rajasthan to secure the area from Pakistani incursions. On 26 December a Pakistani encroachment was located inside the Indian border at an area known as the \\"Sand Dunes\\". Pakistani troops had developed a defensive position including artillery emplacements, and had protected it with minefields. Other strong Pakistani positions across the border dominated this position. On 28 December, Berry's C Company was given the mission of clearing the Pakistani position. The assault commenced at 03:00, and was quickly pinned down by medium machine gun fire. Berry then led his men forward with great determination and without any regard for his personal safety, although the company suffered casualties and one platoon became separated from the rest of the company due to dust created by artillery fire. Berry then led his company through the minefield surrounding the Pakistani position, which caused further casualties. A threat from nearby tanks emerged, but by 05:30 C Company had captured about half of the Pakistani position. Another medium machine gun held up the assault, but was silenced single-handedly by Lance Havildar Tek Bahadur who was killed in the effort. C Company then captured the remainder of the objective. After losing the position, the Pakistanis subjected the position to heavy artillery and mortar fire for over twelve hours. Undeterred, Berry moved among his company, motivating and inspiring his troops, who held onto the captured position. For his actions during this operation, Berry was commended by the Indian government for conspicuous gallantry and outstanding leadership, for which he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, the second-highest award for gallantry available to members of the Indian Armed Forces. The award was promulgated on Independence Day in 1972. 4 PARA was awarded the battle honour \\"Sadiqia Sand Dune 1971\\" for their actions in capturing the position, known as the Battle of Nagi. Later life Berry retired from the army as a brigadier, and now lives in New Delhi.

Early years Simeon Benjamin was born on May 29, 1792, in Upper Aquebogue, in the Town of Riverhead, New York on Long Island. He was the third of eight children. Because Benjamin was considered a feeble child, he was allowed experience working as a clerk in a country store in Aquebogue. At age 16, he clerked for two years in a store on Broadway in New York City, then at the start of the War of 1812 returned to Aquebogue to open his own dry goods store there. Benjamin prospered during the war, as his location in Riverhead enabled his store to avoid the blockade that otherwise prevented goods from reaching New York. After the conclusion of the War of 1812, Benjamin returned to New York City where he operated a successful dry goods store at 371 Pearl Street for 20 years. Elmira years Benjamin, having made a fortune in New York, moved to Elmira, New York in 1835 and began buying up real estate in town. Benjamin's fortune grew as Elmira expanded. Benjamin built churches, schools, and hotels in town, and helped establish a railroad connection between Elmira and Seneca Lake. He later became president of the Chemung Railroad, vice president of the Elmira Rolling Mills Company, and president of the Bank of Chemung and the First National Bank. His wealth grew so considerable that he was considered for many years to be the wealthiest person in Chemung County. During his entire time in Elmira, Benjamin lived at 500 Lake Street, at the corner of East Third Street. At the time it was considered \\"well out in the country.\\" Benjamin was active for 30 years in Elmira's First Presbyterian Church; he was a trustee of the church, and became an elder in 1836. PhilanthropyElmira College= Elmira College in 1869 When plans to charter a women's college in Auburn, New York ran into financial difficulty, Benjamin pledged $5,000 to transfer the charter to Elmira. Benjamin became treasurer and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the new Elmira Female College. Elmira College was founded to be \\"a real college for women which shall be higher and better than any female institution in the country.\\" Benjamin selected the college's location on Prospect Hill, and it opened there on October 2, 1855, with 242 students. Benjamin's total contribution to Elmira College over the course of his life and his will totaled $80,000. =Other works= Benjamin's charitable work extended beyond Elmira college. He donated $10,000 during his lifetime, and bequested $20,000 in his will, to Hamilton College, where he was a trustee. He was also a trustee of Auburn Theological Seminary, to which he donated $10,000. He also gave $2000 to the Elmira Orphan Asylum. Records indicate that Simeon Benjamin attended anti-slavery meetings. He also provided support in the form of \\"food, clothing, and cash\\" to the anti-slavery movement through the work of John W. Jones, a former slave who was Elmira's main \\"agent\\" of the Underground Railroad. Personal life Benjamin was widely active in Presbyterian Churches in Aquebogue, Brooklyn, and Elmira. He supported the Temperance movement and abolition, and he had connections to the Underground Railroad. Benjamin married Sarah Wickham Goldsmith, of Mattituck, New York. They had three sons and four daughters; all but one son and one daughter died in childhood. William, the surviving son, died shortly after graduating from Williams College. The surviving daughter married John T. Rathbun, of Elmira. In 1867, Benjamin became ill with \\"bronchial affection\\" and diarrhea, and was largely confined to his home for over a year, unable to climb steps without assistance. Despite these health problems, he took his annual trip, accompanied by his daughter, to his birthplace in Riverhead, Long Island to visit his nephew. Benjamin died there on September 1, 1868, with his daughter by his side. His body was returned to Elmira for burial in Woodlawn Cemetery. Legacy Statue at Elmira College A statue of Benjamin stands on the Elmira College campus. A song about Benjamin was composed by an Elmira College sophomore in 1958.
