The pastoral lease is currently held by the Kupungarri Aboriginal Corporation. The property had been established prior to 1903 when it was stocked by cattle that were taken from Fitzroy Crossing and across the King Leopold Ranges (modern-day Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges) in the first drove across the range. In the same year the station was being managed by Mick O'Connor who remained there until at least 1912. In 1912 it was owned by the Rose Brothers. Mount Barnett was one of eight properties located along the Lennard River, all of which were very isolated at the time, and not being serviced by a mail run. In 1920 it was owned by Ben Copley, who was running cattle.

After beginning his career in English local football, he emigrated to Canada, where he spent two years playing for Canadian clubs, including representing the province of Saskatchewan in the Dominion Championships. He returned to England and played for Blackhall Colliery Welfare, from where he signed for Football League First Division club Sunderland. He was released after a few months, and joined Third Division North club Hartlepools United, with whom he played 45 matches in the Football League over two seasons. He also played once in the Third Division for Darlington in between further spells with Blackhall Welfare. Personal life Makepeace was born in Trimdon Grange, County Durham, the fourth child of Robert Hutchison Makepeace, a coal miner, and his wife Eleanor. At the time of the 1911 Census, the family were living in Ferryhill. Several of his brothers were good at football: his three older brothers played for teams in Canada, and his younger brother Robert was on the books of Hartlepools United, though never played for their first team. He married Vera Kirkbride in September 1936. Makepeace died in early 1995 in the Hartlepool area. Football career Makepeace played football as a left half for his local club, Trimdon Grange Recreation, and had a trial with Football League First Division club Leicester City. In April 1929, he followed his older brothers Tom and Joe to Canada where they were playing for the Prince Albert Penitentiary club, soon to be joined by another brother, Cud. From Prince Albert, Makepeace joined the Saskatoon-based Sons of England in the spring of 1930. He helped them win that year's Saskatchewan Challenge Shield and with it the right to represent the province in the Dominion Championships; they lost to Manitoba's Winnipeg Hearts in the regional qualifier. Makepeace played as a forward in the second leg to accommodate other players in the half-back line. He, his brother Cud and another player moved on to Challenge Trophy-holders the Westminster Royals for 1931, a move attributed by the Manitoba Free Press to the lack of suitable off-field employment to fit in with the requirements of their football career. He returned to England in 1931 and resumed his domestic career with Blackhall Colliery Welfare of the Wearside League. In October, he joined First Division club Sunderland on trial. While he was still in Canada, in a match between Westminster Royals and a Football Association touring side that included numerous international players, Makepeace had played at left half against the England and Sunderland right winger Tommy Urwin, who recommended him to the club. His performance during the initial month earned him a contract, but he played only for the reserve team and was listed for transfer at the end of the season. Makepeace signed for Third Division North club Hartlepools United ahead of the 1932‚Äì33 season. In a pre-season practice match, the Northern Daily Mail thought him to be \\"a worker, but not over constructive\\". He made his Football League debut on 3 September, in Hartlepools' first home game of the season, a 3‚Äì1 win against Wrexham; the Mails correspondent thought he would keep his place, despite a lack of pace. He was reportedly outstanding against Gateshead, but a few weeks later, he appeared to lack both speed and stamina, and his form was \\"so far below that of which we know he is capable, that I can conclude only that it was too bad to be true or permanent\\". The next week, he was tried at centre half, and played well defensively, although the Mails reporter was unimpressed with the way he \\"punted the ball down the field, anywhere so long as he parted with it\\", and felt he would need to improve the constructive side of his game if he was to keep the position. He was a regular selection through the season when fit, but missed games in the winter with a damaged thigh and at the end of the season, also because of injury. He came back into the side in mid-October 1933, and played regularly until the following February, when he sustained an ankle injury, and appeared only twice more in what remained of the season. Despite having been the subject of transfer interest during the season, Makepeace was given a free transfer at the end of it, and returned to Blackhall Welfare. Makepeace played once more in the Football League. He signed for Third Division Darlington in November 1934, and was preferred to Arthur Childs as replacement for the injured Dan Cassidy in the New Year's Day match at home to Accrington Stanley, a 5‚Äì0 win. After leaving Darlington, he returned once more to Blackhall Colliery Welfare. By 1937, he was the team's captain. He helped them reach a standard high enough to earn the club admission to the North-Eastern League for the 1939‚Äì40 season, remained with them during the early months of the Second World War, and was brought back into service after it when a rule forbidding guest players was introduced for the 1945‚Äì46 Durham Challenge Cup.

While initially developed by Google and Yubico, with contribution from NXP Semiconductors, the standard is now hosted by the FIDO Alliance.  Design  The USB devices communicate with the host computer using the human interface device (HID) protocol, essentially mimicking a keyboard. This avoids the need for the user to install special hardware driver software in the host computer, and permits application software (such as a browser) to directly access the security features of the device without user effort other than possessing and inserting the device. Once communication is established, the application exercises a challenge‚Äìresponse authentication with the device using public-key cryptography methods and a secret unique device key manufactured into the device. The device key is vulnerable to malicious manufacturer duplication, and logically secured against reverse-engineering or counterfeiting by the robustness of the encryption and physical possession.  Support and use  U2F security keys are supported by Google Chrome since version 38 and Opera since version 40. U2F security keys can be used as an additional method of two-step verification on online services that support the U2F protocol, including Google, Dropbox, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Nextcloud, Facebook, and others. Chrome, Firefox, and Opera were, , the only browsers supporting U2F natively. Microsoft has enabled FIDO 2.0 support for Windows 10's Windows Hello login platform. Microsoft Edge browser gained support for U2F in the October 2018 Windows Update. Microsoft accounts, including Office 365, OneDrive, and other Microsoft services, do not yet have U2F support. Mozilla has integrated it into Firefox 57, and enabled it by default in Firefox 60 and Thunderbird 60. Microsoft Edge starting from build 17723 support FIDO2.. As of iOS and iPadOS 13.3 Apple now supports U2F in the Safari browser on those platforms.  Specifications  The evolution of the U2F protocol standard The U2F standard has undergone two major revisions: * U2F 1.0 Proposed Standard (October 9, 2014) * U2F 1.2 Proposed Standard (April 11, 2017) Additional specification documents may be obtained from the FIDO web site. The U2F 1.0 Proposed Standard (October 9, 2014) was the starting point for a short-lived specification known as the FIDO 2.0 Proposed Standard (September 4, 2015). The latter was formally submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on November 12, 2015. Subsequently, the first Working Draft of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard was published on May 31, 2016. The WebAuthn standard has been revised numerous times since then, becoming a W3C Recommendation on March 4, 2019. Meanwhile the U2F 1.2 Proposed Standard (April 11, 2017) became the starting point for the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) Proposed Standard, which was published on September 27, 2017. FIDO CTAP complements W3C WebAuthn, both of which are in scope for the FIDO2 Project. WebAuthn and CTAP provide a complete replacement for U2F, which has been renamed \\"CTAP1\\" in the latest version of the FIDO2 standard. The WebAuthn protocol is backward-compatible (via the AppID extension) with U2F-only security keys but the U2F protocol is not compatible with a WebAuthn-only authenticator. Some authenticators support both U2F and WebAuthn while some WebAuthn clients support keys created via the legacy U2F API.

He is a lawyer in the Court of cassation, where he was called to the bar in Tunis in 1973 and was elected by his peers as Secretary General of the National Order of Tunisian Lawyers for two consecutive terms. He is a founder of CAG Law Firm. As well as being a renowned lawyer, since 1974 he has been a lecturer at the Tunis Faculty of Law and Political Science. and at the Magistrates' Higher Institute () and the Legal Professionals' Higher Institute (). Youth Ghazouani started his education in Souk el-Arba at the gymnasium (school) Mosbah el-Inoubli. In the same year he achieved his certificate of completion of primary education, his sixth-stage Ministry and sixth-stage French Mission exams. Because of these excellent results, he was sent to the French lyc√©e at Mutuelleville to study for a French diploma, and then to the mixed-sex lyc√©e at Bizerte for his Tunisian diploma. Although his diploma was awarded by the highly regarded University of Ez-Zitouna, his father chose to enrol him into the French lyc√©e, against the advice of the governor of Souk el-Arba, who suggested he sever all ties with the French colonial empire. Unfortunately, the French lyc√©e at Mutuelleville did not accept domestic students, so he was required to go to Bizerte. To be near his family, he transferred to a secondary college in Souk el-Arba. After two years of study, he then went to the mixed-sex lyc√©e at B√©ja, where he majored in Literary Letters and the following year a baccalaur√©at in Philosophy. Early career Ghazouni enrolled at the Tunis Faculty of Law and Political Science and at the same time at the Tunis National School of Administration (ENA), the same year (1971) passing the entrance exams in private law and the Diploma of the ENA. He had been studying towards a licence in practice for public law, which he passed with merit in 1970. But on results day he was summoned by the Dean of the Faculty of Law and Economics, Professor Chedly Ayari, who informed him that at his teachers' request he had been shifted to study private law. This change of plan was approved by the Examinations Office, who thought he would get better marks in private law. Once again there was a change of plan. However, this provided another challenge because the Tunisian law schools did not study to a high enough level. Ghazouni opted to go to the Panth√©on-Assas University in Paris (\\"Paris II\\") where he obtained a Doctoral Diploma of Higher Studies (DES) in general private law. After this, he studied for a diploma in Criminal Science. Puis, il pr√©pare avec succ√®s le dipl√¥me d‚Äô√©tudes approfondies en Sciences Criminelles. During his first year of studies he was forced to return to Tunisia to finance his studies. The second year proved easier, because he could work at small jobs to earn a living. In 1987, Ghazouani was awarded the State Doctorate in Law by the famous professor Jean Pradel. His teaching career was assured by having doctorates in all branches of the law. Lawyer Ghazouani is a lawyer before the Court of Cassation, being called to the bar in Tunis in 1973. He is a co-founder of the C. A. G. Law firm. He specialises in business law, commercial arbitration law and is one of the best-known criminal lawyers. As a young lawyer, he defended the rebel Ezzeddine Cherif, in the famous case of the Gafsa Uprising. He was lawyer for members of the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT) during the events of 1978, where a group led by Habib Achour was brought before the State National Court of Security by President Habib Bourguiba. Several times he was also lawyer for the Islamist movement. On the international stage, he has advocated for large Tunisian businesses in international arbitration at Geneva, Milan and Paris. He is also a retained lawyer for the Libyan State, and for the Qatar Friendship Fund (QFF). Educator Since 1973, Ghazouani has been the Chairman of the Board at the Faculty of Law and Political Science in Tunis. He is the author of courses on international arbitration (doctoral studies) and on civil procedure, commercial law, criminal law, and an introduction to civil law. He has examined doctoral theses and post-doctoral studies. Between 1987 and 2003 he was a professor at the Higher Institute of Magistrature, and is now a professor at the Higher Institute for the Legal Profession. Other responsibilities Ghazouani has been Pr√©sident de l‚ÄôAssociation Tunisienne de l‚ÄôArbitrage et des Proc√©dures Judiciaires since its creation in the 1990s. He participates in international and domestic arbitration in Tunisia and abroad, as a membar of the Arbitration Tribunal. Ghazouani has organised several international conferences and symposia both nationally and internationally, and has participated in numerous conferences on different topics. He has taken part in several preparatory commissions for law under the Ministry of Justice and took part in the Tuniso-Libyan Commission for the unification of legislation in 1989. He has been a member of the Commission for the law concerning the conduct of the lawyers, which was stayed but has re-emerged after the 2011 revolution. In 2012 he was charged by the Tunisian President to chair the National Commission on reform of the civil law. Publications Ghazouani is the author of many publications in specialist journals, on themes including: * (\\"Objective conditions on the conventions for arbitrage\\") * (\\"Acknowledgement of foreign judgments\\") * (\\"The new commercial law in Tunisia\\") * (\\"Intellectual property in the state of Maghreb\\") * (\\"Reflections on sales sanctions and third-party property\\") * (\\"The tiers and processes of civil law\\") * (\\"Commentary on the law of 1 September 1986 concerning modification of the Civil Codes and Procedures\\") * (\\"New roles of the Court of Cassation\\") * (\\"Rules and commercial and civil procedure in the law of tort and contract\\") He is author of a book on civil and commercial procedure (2011) and a commentary on the same (1996).

It can have many causes. Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap The performance gap is mainly due to uncertainties. Uncertainties are found in any ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù system, and buildings are no exception. As early as 1978, Gero and Dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems (HVAC) subjected to uncertain demands. After that, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design; uncertainties in building design/construction can be classified into three groups:Ramallo-Gonz√°lez, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter. # Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station. # Workmanship and quality of building elements. Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of thermal bridges, conductivity of insulation, value of infiltration or U-Values of walls and windows. # Behavioural. All other parameters linked to human behaviour i.e. doors and windows opening use of appliances, occupancy patterns or cooking habits. =Type 1: Environmental uncertainties= The type 1 from this grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change; and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area).ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.de Wilde, P. & Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7 Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.Wang, L., Mathew, P. & Pang, X., 2012. Uncertainties in energy consumption introduced by building operations and weather for a medium-size office building. Energy and Buildings, 53, pp.152-158 The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% ‚Äì 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% ‚Äì 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% ‚Äì 57%) for Washington D.C. The operation parameters were those linked with occupants‚Äô behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files. The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al.Eames, M., Kershaw, T. & Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12 Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand. =Type 2: Workmanship= In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered (Pettersen, 1994). This work shows how important occupants‚Äô behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles-Shenton, D., South, T. & Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap between designed and real performance: Lessons from Stamford Brook. London: Department for Communities and Local Government The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use. Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing Hopfe, C.J. & Hensen, J.L.M., 2011. Uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation for design support. Energy and Buildings, 43, pp.2798-2805 looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian,de Wilde, P. & Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174 compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two dimensional Monte Carlo Analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised Regression Coefficients and Standardised Rank Regression Coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. De Wilde and Tian agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in the infiltration over energy calculations, but also introduced other factors, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants‚Äô behaviour (equipment and lighting). Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties. The work of Schnieders and Hermelink Schnieders, J. & Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants‚Äô satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171 showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). =Type 3: Occupants= The work of Schnieders and Hermelink showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses. Blight and Coley Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants‚Äô behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants. The method used in the previous paper to generate accurate profiles of occupants‚Äô behaviour was the one developed by Richardson et al.Richardson, I., Thomson, M. & Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566 The method was developed using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a reference of real behaviour of occupants, this database was elaborated after recording the activity of more than 6000 occupants in 24-hours diaries with a 10 minutes resolution . Richardson's paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS. The availability of this tool allows scientist's to model the uncertainty of occupants‚Äô behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants‚Äô behaviour.

The spiny shell, commonly referred to as the blue shell, is a well-known power-up item of the Mario Kart series of video games. Originating in Mario Kart 64, it allows a racer to shoot a projectile directly at the first place racer. The blue shell acts as a \\"catch-up\\" system, intended to give the lower-ranking characters a better chance at keeping players closer together. A character in first place is likely to be hit by a blue shell at some point and once fired, the blue shell is almost always unavoidable. Because of this, the power-up has received a mixed reception. In addition to the Mario Kart series, the blue shell is a power-up item in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Mario Hoops 3-on-3. History The Mario series features some visually similar figures which predate the blue shell, such as the red Spinies from the original Super Mario Bros. (1985) and blue Koopa Troopas of Super Mario World (1990). In Mario Kart 64, only the last place racer can obtain the blue shell. Since the release of Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the series sees the blue shell being more common to characters closer to the lead, and in all releases prior to Mario Kart 7, it is unable to hit characters on its way to the lead, as it flies above the track using wings rather than gliding upon its surface. There are few techniques possible in some Mario Kart games to evade a blue shell, such as using a timed boost from a Mushroom item in Mario Kart Wii onwards. In Mario Kart 8, it is possible to use a Super Horn to destroy blue shells. A toy model of the blue shell is included in the limited edition package of Mario Kart 8. In the mobile phone game Mario Kart Tour, the Super Horn returns; however, with the introduction of item \\"frenzies\\", it is indeed possible to get a blue shell frenzy. The shell also glides along the ground in this title. Reception The blue shell is known as a random element with harsh consequences, which is difficult to evade. As a \\"hazard that strips certainty and authority\\", Gamasutra calls Mario Kart blue shell the \\"most profoundly existentialist element of the Mario canon\\", disruptive to \\"the entire logic of this familiar fantasy universe.\\" The Geek Handbook names as one of Mario Kart 8 greatest frustrations, to be hit by a blue shell shortly before reaching the finish line. GameSpot considers the ability to destroy the \\"dreaded\\" blue shells as a particularly exciting feature of Mario Kart 8. Nintendo Power called the use of a Mushroom to dodge a blue shell a \\"defining moment\\" of gameplay in Mario Kart Wii. Calling it \\"The Great Equalizer\\" for its enhancement of the elements of struggle and luck, Kotakus Nathan Grayson considered the blue shell to be the most despised, and best, item of the Mario Kart series. Kotakus Yannick Le Jacq considered the blue shell to be the most notable and game-changing among Mario Kart \\"most notorious\\" items, adding that this made it \\"a lot more fun\\" to use in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U.

It is found across Kenya and Tanzania, particularly around the northern coastal area of each of the countries, and has been located living from sea level to around above sea level.  Description  The Kenya coast galago has a dark, blackish patch on either side of the muzzle, and has light brown hair covering its body. It is morphologically similar to both P. z. udzungwensis and P. z. zanzibicarus, and though it is generally slightly larger than them, it has a high interspecific overlap in body size, meaning that there has been confusion over the taxonomy of the species. However, the Kenya coast galago, like many other galagos, has its own unique call, which has been called an incremental call and separates it from any other species in the same genus.  Habitat  The Kenya coast galago is found in the middle storey of coastal lowland tropical moist forest, riverine forest, and some secondary growth such as cultivated mosaic habitat and rural gardens around the northern coast of Kenya and Tanzania, and lives from sea level to at least above sea level over the coastal zone of Kenya, and to at least in the foothills of the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania.

Plot Heller's (John Larch) gang of outlaws pull a robbery, kill a man and ride toward Mexico, fleeing a posse. To spend the night, they first head for the border town of Quantez, but are shocked to discover that it has become a ghost town, with no one else there. Gentry (Fred MacMurray), the gang's most experienced man, finds liquor in the saloon, while Teach (John Gavin), a younger gunslinger, becomes interested in Chaney (Dorothy Malone), who is Heller's woman but upset over the murder during the holdup. Gato, who was raised by Apaches, is infuriated by Heller's referring to him as \\"breed\\" and making him proceed on foot after a horse collapses from exhaustion. Gato (Sydney Chaplin) discovers a warning from Apaches to anyone who comes to town. He seeks out Delgadito (Michael Ansara), the tribe's leader, and proposes they kill the whites and divide the loot. Heller, meantime, is trying to get his partners to do the same, kill the others so there's more money to split among who's left. Gentry and Teach both have feelings for Chaney, who wants to leave town as soon as possible. A wandering minstrel comes to town, calling himself Puritan (James Barton), and while he paints Heller's portrait, he sings a song about John Coventry, a legendary outlaw in these parts. Puritan is suddenly astonished when he spots Gentry and realizes that he is Coventry. The veteran gunman is trying to put his violent life behind him for good.

Although she lived until 2000, this was Lamarr's final film in a Hollywood career of nearly 30 years. Plot Movie star Vanessa Windsor is nearly struck by a camera on the set, saved at the last second by Chris Farley, a handsome extra. A cut on his arm is attended to and Vanessa invites him to dinner at her Malibu beach home, where she clearly has designs on him for a night of romance. Their evening is interrupted by a message that Vanessa's grown daughter, Penny, is sick. Vanessa rushes to her only to find her drunk. Penny then accuses her mother of adopting her simply for the publicity. Vanessa decides to offer Chris a job as caretaker for the beach house. He is considering an offer from a friend, Hank Lopez, to shoot a film in Mexico, but the job pays nothing, so Chris accepts Vanessa's offer instead. In time, they become lovers as well. Not knowing who she is, Chris comes upon Penny being physically manhandled by a date. Chris punches the man and takes a tipsy Penny back to the beach house. She doesn't indicate any recognition of the home as her mother's. Penny is so drunk that Chris places her under a shower, whereupon she kisses him. Vanessa begins having Chris as her escort in public, but endures disapproving looks as well as snide remarks from Lily Frayne, another aging actress out with a younger man. Chris starts to resent being a kept man. Although Penny reveals her true identity to him, they end up having an affair. Chris decides to bail out of the threesome by agreeing to shoot the movie in Mexico, but Vanessa merely sees this as an opportunity for a publicity stunt marriage in Mexico. Chris again tries to end the relationship but still keeps Vanessa in the dark about the identity of her love rival. When she's shooting a dangerous scene and while being \\"drunk again\\", Vanessa sees Chris and Penny standing together on the set and finally realises that they are having an affair. She takes a dangerous plunge into a water pool, a scene that was supposed to have been performed by her stunt woman. Chris rescues her again; in the final scene, she tells him \\"it wouldn't have worked anyway\\" and then sobs into her pillow.

Reception The original telenovela Graduados was a huge success in Argentina, so RCN Televisi√≥n bought the rights to make a Colombian remake, expecting a similar success. However, the series had a poor reception. √ìmar Rincon, from the newspaper \\"El Tiempo\\", attributed it to the poor actor performances, a failure to capture the feeling of the eighties, plot references to the Argentine society which were not properly modified to reference the Colombian one, and a failure to use the music as a plot element, rather than as a mere background. The Colombian writer Cecilia Percy pointed as well that there are few previous attempts in Colombia to produce remakes, and that they usually generated poor received works even when the original one was a success.

The first church, made of cogon and wood was constructed in 1820 and was dedicated to Mary Magdalene. Father Antonio Moreno, OFM was appointed at its first parish priest in 1821. A permission to build a stone church was ordered by Captain Pablo de la Concepci√≥n in 1829. To obtain funds for the church, the people were forced to pay taxes and quarry sand and stones from the river. The construction of the church building was halted in 1839, continued in 1849 and finished in 1855 under the direction of Father Maximo Rico, Father Jose Cuesta, Father Joaquin de Coria and Father Francisco de Paula Gonzalez. Construction of the belltower was finished in 1861. In its convent, Filipino revolutionary leader General Emilio Jacinto sought refuge and his blood stains could be found.

Hibutsu are generally located within Buddhist temples in shrines called . They are generally unavailable for viewing or worship, although they are brought out for specific religious ceremonies; it is also possible in some cases for the hibutsu to be viewed in exchange for an offering to the temple. Certain hibutsu, such as the wooden statue of Gautama Buddha at Seiry≈ç-ji or the Amida statuary at Zenk≈ç-ji, are almost never displayed, even to initiates of the temples in which they are held (such examples are known as zettai hibutsu). Others are put on public display only rarely, in a ceremony called . History Whilst the practice of concealing important religious artefacts within zushi or behind curtains dates to the Heian period, the concept of hibutsu is slightly later. It is possible that the original practice was based on Shinto concepts, in which are without physical form, however a document from K≈çry≈´-ji indicates that it began at that temple with the concealment of a statue of Kannon imported from Silla in 616 C.E. The earliest record of an actual hibutsu dates from 1106, when sources indicate the Amida statues at Zenk≈ç-ji were briefly put on display. By the Edo period hibutsu had become a popular concept in Japanese Buddhism, and during this time kaich≈ç ceremonies became major public events, drawing crowds of thousands. It has been noted by art historians such as Shiro Ito that hibutsu are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon; other Buddhist cultures do not have any equivalent practice. The concealment of the hibutsu is intended to emphasise their potency and transcendence. It may also serve to protect them from pollution by the impure influences of the mundane world, or to preserve the personal privacy of these \\"living\\" embodiments of Buddhism.

This alleged effect is supposed to occur because the first child is more prone to receiving privileges and responsibilities (by virtue of being the oldest), while the youngest in the family is more likely to receive indulgences. The second child (or middle child) no longer has their status as the baby and is left with no clear role in the family, or a feeling of being \\"left out\\". There is notably often a negative connotation surrounding the term \\"middle child syndrome.\\" It is debated whether the family dynamic imposes this negative attitude or if middle children develop it themselves, or if it exists at all. Currently, the APA dictionary defines it as a hypothetical condition, with no reliable evidence showing a strong correlation on the psychological impacts of birth order. When thinking about the theory of birth order and the studies that have been done it is important to remember that correlation does not equal causation. Many similar theories regarding birth order seek to classify and box in personality aspects of individuals based on birth order. However, in recent years some have noted that family dynamics have changed in that there are often larger gaps between children, there are merged families with step- siblings as well as blended families because of adoption. All of these factors can affect the way siblings view themselves within the family group.  Theories  Alfred Adler (1870-1937), was an Austrian psychiatrist and worked closely with Freud and founded the school of individual psychology. Specializing in inferiority complex, Adler was a pioneer in psychology as the first to theorize that birth order influences personality. He also believed that birth order had a lasting impact on an individual's methods of coping with stress and problem solving skills in adulthood. Adler's theory revolves around the nuclear family structure, with both parents present in the children's lives, an average space between siblings, and excluding extenuating circumstances such as the birth of twins, a tragedy in the family, or the occurrence of step-siblings. Adlerian researchers take a more modern approach of studying birth order today, in which they move away from studying the phenomenon of birth order traits in favor of studying the effects of birth order on Style of Life.

His boxing career began in the army; He was entered into a boxing contest without his knowledge while serving in Gibraltar. Initial success led to his pursuing it further and by 1912 he was army champion of India. He left the army and turned professional in 1912, and remained unbeaten in the first two years of his professional career, including victories over the Dixie Kid, Jack Harrison, and Young Johnny Johnson. Georges Carpentier, writing for the People's Journal in January 1914, was highly complimentary of Blake, describing him as a \\"most promising man\\", and having \\"the right stuff in him...the right temperament\\". In March 1914, despite being very much a middleweight, he fought for the British heavyweight title against Bombardier Billy Wells; Wells won with a fourth round knockout, inflicting the first defeat of Blake's career. In April 1914 he fought American Joe Borrell in a fight billed as being for the 160 lbs world title; Borrell knocked Blake down as he was returning to his corner after the bell at the end the fourth round, and with Blake unable to continue the referee declared it a no contest. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Blake put both his boxing career and his forthcoming marriage on hold and rejoined the 2nd Norfolk Regiment. He was wounded in action in September 1914 and returned to England, where he was treated at the Royal Herbert Hospital in Blackheath. Blake was still unbeaten at middleweight and won fights against Nicol Simpson and Harry Reeve before losing to Pat O'Keeffe in May 1915. A year later he fought O'Keeffe for the British middleweight title, taking a twenty round points decision to become champion. O'Keefe regained the title in January 1918, knocking Blake out in the second round. Blake lost to Army champion Corporal Tooley of the Grenadier Guards in April 1918, and his final fight was a win by fourth round knockout against Arthur Cameron in 1921. After retiring from boxing, Blake played football for Yarmouth Town, swam and angled competitively, and became a boxing referee. Between the wars he was a publican, running the Army and Navy public house on Blackfriars Road in Yarmouth. For the rest of his life he worked as a swimming instructor at an open-air pool in Great Yarmouth. Blake died at his home on North Denes Road on 2 September 1960, aged 70.

Most notably, they have organized performances during the 2011 and 2012 Make Music New York Festival and co-hosted the Mass Appeal: Guitars event with Guitar World, in 2013,http://www.guitaraficionado.com/new-york-city-guitarists-invited-to- unite-june-21-for-mass-appeal-guitars.html and Acoustic Nation, in 2014. The school‚Äôs motto is to ‚ÄúTo foster personal greatness through the medium of guitar lessons‚Äù.http://www.nycguitarschool.com/mission/ This sentiment is reflected in the teaching style and overall philosophy of the institution, which unifies commitment, deliberate practice, goal-setting, and personal growth with the enjoyment of learning to play an instrument. Teachers Over forty instructors are employed at the school‚Äôs five branches and include notable New York City performers. All of the teachers hold music degrees and are rigorously vetted, as well as being active contributors to the local or national music scenes. The teachers represent colleges and universities such as Berklee College of Music, Yale University, the Manhattan School of Music, and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. Several have shared the stage with artists such as Chaka Khan, The Drifters, Melissa Etheridge, Blues Traveler, John P. Hammond, The Allman Brothers, B√©la Fleck, John Scofield, and been featured in the pit orchestra of Broadway productions of Mamma Mia and Jersey Boys.http://www.nycguitarschool.com/suzuki-guitar-teachers/ Notably, four instructors have received certification from the Suzuki Association of the Americas.http://www.nycguitarschool.com/our-teachers/ Dan Emery has extensive performing experience as a guitarist and songwriter for The Dan Emery Mystery Band. He co-founded Yonkers Boost Afterschool, a program that helps give students from underfunded schools access to the arts, cultural studies, and physical activity. Director Jen Elliott began her career as a singer and songwriter before pursuing her passion for guitar. She has released two albums on the indie label City Canyon Records and continues to write and perform. Publications Founder Dan Emery, who also holds a Masters of Education from Columbia University, wrote and self-published Guitar for Absolute Beginners, in 2009. This book serves as the foundational course for new guitar players pursuing group classes at the school. It presupposes that the student has little to no knowledge of playing guitar and covers material ranging from naming strings, strumming techniques, chord and tab diagrams, chord progressions, and practice sessions that culminate in the ability to play several arrangements of popular songs. Other publications originating from New York City Guitar School include Guitar for Near Beginners, Guitar for Intermediate Beginners,The Ultimate Guitar Workbook, and Finger Style Basics for Guitar (written by instructor Lenny Molotov). In November, 2014, Dan Emery was interviewed by Julia Pimsleur for a Forbes.com article on entrepreneurship and self-publishing. He expressed enthusiasm for self-publishing and discussed the success of Guitar for Absolute Beginners, which is available through the school and online retailers, and is even being used by guitar instructors otherwise unaffiliated with New York City Guitar School .

Ledoux (August 13, 1874 ‚Äì April 8, 1941), later known as \\"Mr. Zero\\", preferring his own name not to be prominent, was an American diplomat and activist with a declared interest in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. His quest to serve humanity began early in life. He sought to become a Catholic priest at 15, but witnessed a case of priest abuse and quit the seminary about the age of 17. He began to work for law and business interests, hoping to use these as a means of progress for humanity. He then sought to serve in diplomatic service for the United States with this approach and earned a few promotions. He advocated that commercial development could be a means to further the interests of humanity, but came to believe that personal transformation was more important. He quit the diplomatic service and sought to work with non-governmental organizations for both business and peace interests. Soon he was working with the Bah√° º√≠s and was present during the conflict over the status of Sarah Farmer, when she was involuntarily committed to a mental institution in 1910. He led the efforts to free her from involuntary confinement in an insane asylum, ultimately gathering a chief of police and a judge to accompany a court order to effect her freedom. He then began to found humanitarian organisations. He first made news seeking to help with unemployment after the First World War among workers and veterans on the breadline. He advocated for the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, albeit with a limited understanding of the principles of the religion. Ledoux set up events aimed at raising awareness of the suffering of the unemployed in New York and Boston. His efforts were seen as too confrontational. His events were repeatedly shut down, even when he sought to be less confrontational and have discussions with leaders. The work was renewed with greater intensity during the Great Depression but he was in his 60s already and died soon after. Some of his work and antics were recorded in pictures and newsreels. Biography Born August 13, 1874 in Sainte-H√©l√®ne- de-Bagot, Quebec, his family soon moved to Biddeford, Maine. He had limited schooling and began to work to support the family at age nine. He was an altar boy and read French religious books. At 15 he sought to enter the Catholic priesthood at a seminary in Marieville, Quebec. Two years later he witnessed a case of priest abuse of an altar boy, quit the priesthood and soon began work at a law firm back in Maine. He also began to organize political clubs, became Republican ward leader, and launched the first French language publications and newspaper stories in Maine. In 1895 Ledoux sought an open consulate position with the US Government at the age of 21 and was assigned to Trois- Rivi√®res where he engaged in promoting business interests, French language and culture in an anglophone environment as well as seeking balance in that advocacy. He was promoted in 1903, and sent as consul to Prague where he represented business interests. In 1907 he was promoted again, but chose not to accept appointment to Brazil. He had been challenged that his goals required a means to transform human nature. He returned to the States in 1910 and was involved in Boston area peace initiatives the same year. In 1912 he was working with peace activist Paul Otlet. In 1915 Ledoux was working with Bah√° º√≠s, especially at Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School, and would later credit many of his actions to the tenets of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He was perhaps the third francophone Bah√° º√≠ born out of Canada. At the time Sarah Farmer, founder of Green Acre, was ill and had been involuntarily committed to an insane asylum. Ledoux led the effort to free her which, though it was confrontational, included the local chief of police and judge in the attempt with a court order.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, praised Ledoux for his work in freeing Farmer. That year Henry Ford financed the Peace Ship mission to attempt to end World War I, setting sail in December 1915. Ledoux attempted to join the expedition, but wasn't accepted. Instead, he jumped off the pier and made a spectacle swimming after the ship - an act that got notice in the newspapers and entered him into public awareness. As his actions became more pronounced he protested that his aims were apolitical - that he was neither an agitator nor a Bolshevist - and that his aims were religiously based. He claimed he was trying \\"to awaken the slumbering conscience of the people.\\" His institutions In the vicinity of Greenacre Ledoux opened a \\"Unity Hotel\\" in 1917. During the war he began to assist in the relief of soldiers' families. After the Armistice he began to assist jobless veterans. =The Stepping Stone= \\"Stepping Stone\\" breadline managed by Urbain Ledoux, New York, NY, 1919. In April 1919 Ledoux opened a breadline named \\"The Stepping Stone\\" near Bowery and 9th Street in NY. He did this with the assistance of some Bah√° º√≠s as well as some financial support. Mason Remey went down one time to see what it was like and was taken up in the enthusiasm both of the work and the chance to talk. A picture was taken of \\"The Stepping Stone\\" and several newspapers covered its establishment. * Also in April 1919 Ledoux had an article published in Star of the West called \\"The Oneness of the World of Humanity\\". In June  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° sent a message hoping he would promulgate the Bah√° º√≠ religion, human unity, universal peace, and overcome prejudices dividing the world. In August he was one of the signatories of a letter to  ªAbdu'l-Baha hoping for a return trip to the United States. He met Dane Rudhyar who inquired about the religion but did not join. In April 1920 he was a delegate to the national convention of the Bah√° º√≠s.Report of the Twelfth Annual Mashrekol-Azkar Convention;(listing of the delegates), Star of the West, vol 11, no 11, Sept 27, 1920, (see page 175) In January 1921 he helped to run a Bah√° º√≠ meeting in New York.* * At the same time he appeared in national media like The Nation.* * A biographical sketch of him appeared in The Survey, a charity journal under Paul Underwood Kellogg,Survey Associates, Inc., by Jhansan, The Social Welfare Welfare History Project. and The New Republic, in October and The Independent in November. Each painted him in different ways. Some of the coverage referenced his advocacy of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and was sometimes confused with Buddhism, \\\\- a confusion that echoes more recently. The 'Stepping Stone' picture was eventually acquired by Getty Images, has been used some 90 years later and has been noticed by Bah√° º√≠s and others. =Further endeavors= Ledoux escalated his efforts and organized the unemployed and former soldiers. He set up hotels for them to stay in, tried to get them invited to President Harding's inaugural ball, and eventually ran foul of the law while presenting their case (and them) to the socialites of New York. He escalated his efforts with a public \\"slave auction\\" of jobless war veterans on the steps of the New York Public Library. The authorities began to systematically reject his applications for events. In 1921, he repeated the action in Boston and had some success,The shepherd of the unemployed, The Single Tax Review, vol 21, no 5, Sept-Oct, 1921, p. 136 including getting 150 people jobs, but after a major row he became less confrontational, instead relying on churches for contributions for relief to the poor. He gained an audience with President Harding but it did not lead to a change. While in Washington, he gave several talks at the Bah√° º√≠ Center though in his enthusiasm some of his points were clearly off base compared to those of the faith. Refusing to learn the formal teachings of the religion, the remainder of his talks were canceled. Meanwhile, he was praised as a mystic. While away from Boston, much of what he had set up had been dismantled. He tried to move the starving to another hotel. In a confrontation with the desk clerk, he quoted passages from the Gospel of Matthew but the clerk was not moved enough to allow them to stay. Ledoux broadened his advocacy for all the unemployed and labored further for years before and during the Great Depression. In one stunt he would hold a lantern \\"looking for an honest man\\" or \\"a Christian delegate\\" who would address the wrongs in society; eventually he drew attention to Eugene V. Debs. He downplayed the inspiration of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith because of xenophobic fears among the public. Films were taken of him trying to promote the work. Pictures were taken too.* * He died in April 1941, with his daughter Yvette having moved there to help him. Obituaries were published by Associated Press and United Press International as well as independently. In 1973 an Ed.D thesis was done on Ledoux.

In Indonesia, kue cucur can be found throughout traditional marketplaces in the country; the popular version, however, is the Betawi version from Jakarta. In Brunei and Malaysia, the term cucur is generally used to refer to any type of fritters. A popular type of cucur in Brunei and Malaysia is Jemput-jemput (also known as Cokodok) and Pinjaram (also known as Kuih cucur gula merah/melaka). In Southern Thailand, it is often featured in wedding ceremonies and festivals. The dessert, made of fried rice flour mixed with palm sugar, is thick in the middle and thin at the edges. Thai people believe that it is similar to the lotus which can grow in poor conditions. Thus, it is like the love of a newly married couple that will smoothly grow up and succeed in married life. Thai people like to use it at a wedding or propitious ceremony, or at any festival. Sometimes it is given as a gift. Normally, Thai people like to eat it immediately after it is fried because it is still soft and colorful, and smells good. If it is left for an hour, it will be sticky, stiff and full of oil.

His work ranges from Italianizing landscapes, equestrian skirmishes and battles to cattle market and hunting scenes. He worked in Antwerp, Middelburg and Rotterdam.Hans- Joachim Raupp, Historien und Allegorien, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 1995, 110-117 Life There are no details about the place of birth of Simon Johannes van Douw. It is possible that he was born in Antwerp. It is not known with whom he trained. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1655. He married Johanna Soolmaeckers in 1656. It is not clear whether she was related to the landscape painter Jan Frans Soolmaker. From this year he also had pupils in Antwerp. Horse market at the Piazza del Quirinale, Rome On 1 November 1656 he became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Middelburg. He was active in Middelburg until September 1657. From 1659 he is recorded in Rotterdam. Here he was referred to as a 'burgher and painter' when he was involved in the sale of a house in 1666. He is documented in Rotterdam until 1677. From 1666 he is also recorded in Antwerp so he seems to have been active in Rotterdam and Antwerp at the same time. His last recorded work dates from 1677. It is not known when or where he died.Simon Johannes van Douw at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His pupils include Pieter van Bloemen and Carel Fonteyn. In 1664 he founded in Antwerp a school for the painting of battle scenes; Pieter van Bloemen, Frank Valk, and Pieter Verpoorten were involved in this school. Work His known works date from 1654 to 1677. Initially he mainly painted cavalry skirmishes and battles. Later he changed to the subjects of horse and cattle market and hunting scenes. His early works are stylistically related to the cabinet painting tradition in Antwerp. This is noticeable in the stage-like setting of the action, the breaking down of the landscape through colour thresholds and the atmospheric palette. He later increasingly was influenced by Philips Wouwermans. Some of his works are also similar to those of the landscape painter Jan Frans Soolmaker with whom he may have been related through marriage. Battle skirmish between Christians and Turks Van Douw was known for his accurate depictions of animals, especially horses. He often painted lively horses similar to Wouwermans. Although no evidence exists that he visited Italy, his imaginary landscapes are in the Italianate style and often depict classical ruins. They typically include a great number of figures engaged in a variety of activities. A good example is the Italianizing Capriccio with Market Scene showing a large number of people engaged in trade and in play, enjoying themselves in the tavern or herding their flock.Simon Johannes Van Douw, Italian-Style Capriccio with Market Scene, 1650-1660 at Artgate Fondazione Cariplo The Italian influence is also evident in van Douw's human figures, which are often plump and round-faced, reminiscent of the genre painters in the circle of the Bamboccianti.\\"Italianate Landscape with Horses at the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery A number of Flemish painters such as Anton Goubau and Pieter Casteels II were painting similar scenes.

Au centre de l'Europe intellectuelle, University of Lausanne, 2011. BIB_S_000000015950  Origins  The Davos University Conferences owed their creation to two complementary initiatives, one local and one international. = Local initiative = Davos in 1932. Together with the university courses, sporting competitions demonstrated the locals' desire to diversify from purely medical courses Noting the large number of tubercular students who came to Davos, as a mountain town known for its cosmopolitan atmosphere and as a luxurious place to convalesce, between 1926 and 1927 a committee was formed by the local doctors to formulate a diversification project for Davos University. = International initiative = The Davos project coincided with warming international relations, particularly between France and the Weimar Republic (Germany) after the Locarno Pact of 1925. The French intelligentsia wholeheartedly participated in projects of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, but the Germans, who were excluded from it by the Treaty of Versailles, instead founded the (DFG, \\"German-French Society\\"). German intellectuals who wanted to participate in international academic conferences approached the Davos initiators and redefined their university project to become an annual conference.  Organisation  A committee made up of local and visiting academics was assembled under the chairmanship of Dr Paul M√ºller (instigator of the Spengler coup in 1923), the sociologist Gottfried Salomon (1892 - 1964), president of the Frankfurt DFG, and Erhard Branger (1881 - 1958), mayor of Davos, who made it their mission to invite √©lite Europeanan intellectuals to Davos for weeks of work and exchange of ideas. The committee was augmented in 1929 by three national committees (German, French and Swiss).  Establishment  For four consecutive years, between 1928 and 1931, the committee convened a large number of important intellectuals, (available only at the National Library, Ref 7q107). mainly German and French, for conferences (in both languages) lasting three weeks at the end of winter. These academics were accompanied by promising students in a programme of (\\"Work communities\\") and as well as the conferences themselves there were opportunities to get to know academics from other countries who were working in the same field.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, endemic to the southern and central United States. It has copper- red to deep red flowers and bright green leaves. Description Iris fulva has slender greenish-brown rhizome (or occasionally red,) that has the (ring- like) scars of old leaves (from previous seasons). They are approximately 1.5‚Äì2 cm in diameter, shallow rooted with fibrous roots underneath and can form many branches. Which eventually spread out to create large clumps around 1‚Äì2 feet wide. It grows new leaves early in the autumn, which can pass through the winter into the spring. This means that the plant is generally only leafless around August time. The leaves are bright green, blade-like (meaning long and narrow), lightly ribbed (parallel to the stem) and rise from the base of the plant but then arch away from the stem. They can measure between long, and between 1‚Äì2 cm (¬Ω to 1 inch) wide. It was noted by Dykes, that when held up the light, the leaves have black dots, which are similar to water-irises leaves. Some leaves emerge along the flower stem (which is known as cauline in botany terms). The flower stem is generally straight with 1 or 2 branches (or joints), and can reach up to a height of between . tall.Neil G. Odenwald and James R. Turner The stem is mid-green in colour, with 1‚Äì3 alternate leaves rising along the stem, that are very similar (but smaller) to the basal leaves. It normally flowers between spring and early summer, between April and June, with 1 or 2 flowers per axil of each alternate leaf along the stem. There can be as many as 4‚Äì6 (occasionally more) flowers per stem. In Australia and New Zealand, they bloom between September and November. The blooming period lasts for about 3 weeks. Although the individual flowers are fairly short-lived (lasting for about 1‚Äì4 days). Copper iris in bloom, close-up The flowers are slightly fragrant, and come in a range of shades of red, from copper-red (reddish orange to brownish orange), to brick-red,Edwin B. Smith to rust-red, to deep red, and bronze. Occasionally there are yellow flowered forms. Unlike many other irises, the flower on the falls and standards are the same colour. It has a 2‚Äì2.5 cm perianth tube. Iris fulva is unusual, as its 6 petalled flowers, all droop away from the middle section. The flowers are wide spread, have 3 drooping falls (or sepals), which are wide and long, and 3 drooping standards (or petals), which are 4.5 cm long and across. The base of each flower is tubular and has a yellowish centre. The flower has short styles (female parts) which are about 2 cm long. Inside the flower, the stigma has two small pointed teeth (or lobes). The filaments (stalks holding the anther) are yellow, the anthers are cream, reaching the stigma, the pollen is cream. Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva share very similar looking seed-pods (capsules) and seeds. The green capsules are 6-angled (hexagonal in cross- section), elliptical to oval (in shape) measuring between long by wide. The seeds are stored in 2 rows within the capsules. The seeds are flat and irregular (in shape), measuring 10-15mm wide. Like other Louisiana irises they are covered in a cork-like substance, which allows them to float on the water (within the swamp habitats) to new locations. =Genetics= As most irises are diploid, they have two sets of chromosomes. This fact can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count: 2n=42, It has been counted several times. 2n=42, differing from some other Louisiana Iris species, so hybrids from crossing with those other species should have an odd number of chromosomes, for example, an Iris with 44 is crossed with this species, the hybrids should have 43 chromosomes .Simonet 1932, 2n=42-Riley 1942; 2n=42 by Randolph & Mitra 1961; 2n-42, Randolph, 1966. Taxonomy Iris fulva It has the common name of 'Copper Iris'.Tina M. Samuels The Latin specific epithet 'Fulva' comes from the Latin for 'tawny- orange'. It was first found and collected on the banks of the Mississippi River near New Orleans in 1811.Lucille Parker It was then first published and described by John Bellenden Ker Gawler in the Botanical Magazine Issue 36 of 1812. It was later published in 'Addisonia' Issue 12 on March 1927 with colour illustrations. John James Audubon illustrated a pair of Northern Parulas in Birds of America, (published, London 1827‚Äì38), Plate 15 entitled \\"Blue Yellow- backed Warbler ‚Äì Sylvia americana\\". The birds are shown perched on a Louisiana Flag (Iris fulva) painted by his assistant Joseph Mason to which Audubon added the two birds in 1821. This led to a group of Irises in Louisiana known as the \\"Louisiana Irises\\".Charlotte Seidenberg It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, and then updated on 1 December 2004. Iris fulva is also an accepted name by the RHS and it has been awarded with the Award of Garden Merit. Distribution and habitat Iris fulva in flower It is native to North America. =Range= Iris fulva comes from the southern United States, including Arkansas, Illinois, (in the LaRue swamp on the Big Muddy River,Robert H. Mohlenbrock ) Kentucky, Louisiana, (in the Mississippi valley,) Mississippi, (along the banks of the Mississippi River, rarer on the eastern side), Missouri, Ohio, (Champaign County, Clark County,), Georgia, Florida (only found rarely in Santa Rosa County,) and Tennessee. =Habitat= Iris fulva is found in freshwater, in marshes, stream banks, field or roadside ditches, in drainage canals, swamps, and wet pastures. It is normally found in water up to deep. Conservation Iris fulva is listed as 'endangered' in the states of Kentucky and Tennessee, and listed as 'threatened' in Illinois. This is due to the loss of habitat. Which are under threats from dredging operations, also swamps that are being drained and 'toxic' farm herbicides running into ditches and streams. Cultivation Close-up image of Iris fulva flower The Louisiana irises generally all have similar cultivation requirements. They need full sunlight (minimum of 6 hours during summer), moist, acidic soils (ph level of 6.5) with a high organic and high fertility content.Helen Nash For best flowering, moisture is essential during late autumn, winter and spring times (October to May), when the plant starts to grow new leaves. They can be given a light feed between autumn and spring, if needed. It is estimated to be hardy to between USDA Zones 3 to 10. It can tolerate frost but will flower poorly in areas with cool summers. It can be grown in southern UK, in damp or wet soils. They can be grown in most of the United States, New Zealand and Australia. They can be used planted by the edges of ponds and pools or they can be planted in the water. But they need the rhizomes to be pinned into the ground to stop them floating away. Also the rhizomes must be covered in gravel to stop fish disturbing the roots. They can also be planted in streams, but not heavy flowing rivers. It can tolerate pools up to 6 inches deep. They also can be grown in containers (even in the water or bog garden) but they must be re-potted and divided every year. If using a fertilizer, sprinkle around the plant in late January or February, before the plant is in flower. New plantings need to be mulched to prevent sun-scalding. Plantings in the water do not need mulching and tend to grow quicker than others. =Propagation= Propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes.Nick Romanowski Which is best carried out in late summer, when the plants are dormant. The ground must be prepared pre-planting, with the addition of a generous amount of organic matter and the soils dug to about 6 inches deep (to allow for new root growth). Plants require dividing every 3‚Äì4 years to promote good flowering. They can combine with other plants but tend to 'move' to suitable positions. The iris seed is not hard to raise but a very slow process. It can take many months to germinate (between 3‚Äì12 months) with a 50% germination average. They then can take 3‚Äì5 years before reaching flowering stage. Seeds should be harvested from the plant after flowering but they must be from mature seed pods. They then should be stored in paper bags, as seed stored in glass containers often goes mouldy. =Pollination= Iris fulva (like Iris brevicaulis) is primary pollinated by hummingbirds looking for nectar, mainly the ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris). It also attracts butterflies. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris fulva can easily hybridize with other Louisiana irises to create new variants. The first was 'Iris fulvala' a hybrid Dykes raised as a cross between Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis. It produced two forms, both with rich velvety falls, one a red-purple form and the other was a bluer shade. The name was composed of Iris fulva and the first syllable of Lamance (the common name of 'Iris foliosa' which was known at that time as Iris hexagona var. Lamancei). Later, Iris foliosa was found to be a synonym of Iris brevicaulis. The hybrids were found to be good garden plants and could flower more freely than either of the parents. Other crosses include with Iris giganticaerulea to produce 'Iris √ó vinicolor' Small and also with Iris savannarum to produce 'Iris √ó cacique' (J. Berry) N. C. Henderson. Several American garden nurseries and plant breeders have created many Iris fulva cultivars including, 'Apricot Queen', 'August Flame', 'Autumn Fire', 'Baby Sis Pink' 'Bayou Bandit', 'Bayou Goula', 'Bazeti', 'Bolshevik', 'Bronze Red', 'Chocolate', 'Choctaw Tribe', 'Couperin', 'Cuprea', 'Devil's Advocate', 'Devil's Scion', 'Dwarf Terracotta', 'Dwarf Yellow', 'Edith Dupre', 'Encarnado', 'Esplanade', 'Flash', 'Fulvaflav', 'Fulvaflav', 'Fulva Special', 'Fulvaurea', 'Galloway-Lanoke', 'Georgia Peach', 'Golden Arrowhead', 'Gold In California', 'Gold Medallion', 'Gulf Sunshine', 'Karandash', 'Kraemer Tan', 'Kraemer Yellow', 'Le Vieux Carre', 'Louisiana Sunset', 'Margot Castellanos', 'Maringouin Freak', 'Maringouin Fulva', 'Marvell Gold', 'Mc Gregor', 'Red Fire', 'Sazerac', 'Slick Willie'. Toxicity Some parts of the iris are poisonous. Because both the foliage and rhizomes are deadly toxic, most mammalian herbivores usually leave Iris untouched, although the Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) occasionally feeds on their rhizomes and lower stems and the White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) sometimes nibbles the leaf edges.

Nina Dotti (born Andreina Mercedes del Carmen Fuentes Angarita, April 5, 1968, in Caracas, Venezuela) is a Venezuelan art collector, curator, philanthropist, business woman and art dealer living in Miami, Florida. Early life Fuentes's family moved to California when she was just 30 days old, and she lived in the state until she was six years old. Fuentes then returned to Caracas, Venezuela, where she graduated from Universidad Metropolitana with a bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance in 1991. She then studied Law, Museology and Art History, earning her bachelor's degree in Arts in 2003 from Universidad Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas. At a very young age she discovered the power of art to promote causes at the primal core of her principals. During her formative years she realized that although she couldn't struggle against all the social ills that troubled her she could focus her attention and efforts on contributing to those issues she could positively impact. Artist & Education Activist  Fuentes's art work is supported by the versatile use of diverse materials, applied in installations, sculpture, photography, and video. Her work is neo-conceptual, nurtured by a Duchampian influence and pop sub realistic aesthetic, and her message is highly critic, intimate and personal. Since the beginning of her career, Fuentes explored common social and political issues like religion, the role of women in society, prostitution, violence and discrimination, especially to LGBT and women. Also, she builds on concepts of femicide as a clear demonstration of power and patriarchal control over women's lives, freedom, dignity and sexuality. In her country, Fuentes uses active protest channels with irony and a sense of humor. Her relationship with Venezuela has become more complex, as she questions its current state socially and politically. Fuentes has held solo and group exhibitions in France, China, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Germany, USA (Miami, LA, and New York), UK, Switzerland, Argentina, and many other countries around the world. Art & Humanitarianism, Nina behind new philanthropic artwork Nina Fuentes has an indefatigable passion in the universal labor to secure human rights for the disenfranchised and marginalized, as well as others whose voices have been silenced by injustice. Through her art and its visual power to provoke thought, she fearlessly engages spectators to reconsider current social realities and understand how easily it is to become inured to negative stereotypes in our media saturated world. Her work typically confronts issues culled from worldwide headlines ranging from the rights of same sex couples to adopt children, to the fashion industry's unwholesome mediated image of the ideal feminine form, to the outdated chauvinistic roles imposed upon mothers and housewives. In addition, Fuentes is a pioneering supporter and tireless advocate on behalf of Venezuela's FUNDANA Foundation whose mission it is to find adoptive parents for orphaned children. To this vital cause she has contributed immeasurably through time and treasure to secure these vulnerable children a proper place in society during these increasingly volatile times. Fuentes began her philanthropic journey in 1996 as a cultural sponsor of Venezuelan Contemporary Art through the creation of the \\"Fundaci√≥n Arte Emergente\\" or FAE (Foundation of Emerging Arts) to promote new talent around the world. In 2000, Fuentes began her battle to promote adoption in Venezuela, sponsoring \\"El Libro de Vida\\" project, which has helped integrate children with their adoptive families. For more than 10 years, the project has been successful through partnerships with FUNDANA, Fundaci√≥n Pro Adopci√≥n and Fundaci√≥n Mi Familia. After moving to Miami in 2006, she created Arts Connection to continue supporting the arts, as well as emerging artist. From Venezuela to Miami to New York City, Fuentes has promoted and supported a large group of museums, institutions, social work, arts and classical music organizations. Art & Wellness: The Chill Concept It's a known fact that art in all its forms improves our lives and enriches our souls. In recent years scientific research has also proven that by focusing on concepts of wellness and the health of both our bodies and spirit, these efforts prolong our happiness and lives. For Nina Fuentes, the melding of these complimentary approaches to self- fulfillment is the natural condition resulting in her visionary and pioneering project called The Chill Concept. More than a mere gathering place, it is an urban sanctuary where contemporary art practices and meditative contemplation combine seamlessly to uplift the mind. An Educational Platform for community engagement through creative thinking and the integration of wellness, innovation and contemporary culture, The Chill Concept (TCC) is her conception of a new kind of museum. Her focus is building a community with a \\"strong positive learning environment by mitigating the big learning inhibitors: fear, ego, defenses, complacency, and arrogance\\" (Edward D. Hess, Learn to Die, Columbia University Press, 2014). TCC is a platform that provides useful guidance on a large body of research on wellness, innovation and contemporary culture factors that promote learning and experimentation in every member of our community to transform, transcend and enjoy life. In 2004, the Art Districts in Miami published Fuentes's work, The Chill Concept at Hardcore: A Contemporary Evolution, continuing her contribution to the Museum of Sciences. Career =Museologist= On Education for Community Engagement and Creative Thinking Fuentes's expertise represents a way to community engagement primarily as a tool of education . Fuentes worked in the Museo Jacobo Borges, Caracas, Vzla. First in the educational department . In 1998, Fuentes humbly started her career as an exhibition coordinator for the Museo Jacobo Borges in Catia, Venezuela. Since then, Fuentes has done many community services in the Caracas Museum of Science , always keeping her focus on trying to help solve many social issues that affect our society. Her first contribution was the essay \\"Exhibici√≥n - Acci√≥n: Arte y Comunidades,\\" which was a collaboration with Venezuelan Anthropologist, Luis Galindo, in 2001. The essay was presented at the Museo Jacobo Borges and Museo de Ciencias Naturales in Catia and Caracas, Venezuela. In 2004, she founded the \\"Asociaci√≥n de Muse√≥logos de Venezuela\\" I Museologist Conference. Meanwhile, Fuentes worked for many years in her theory. In 2005, she began working with Luis Galindo and evolved with the collaboration of well-known curator, Gerardo Zavarce. Their work was published in Mendoza, Argentina, \\"Exhibici√≥n - Acci√≥n: Arte y Comunidades,\\" as part of the ‚ÄúPrimer Foro de Arte Emergente: ‚ÄòEst√©ticas Latinoamericanas‚Äô.\\" In 2013, Fuentes and Gerando were published after their presentation of Exhibition - Action: Art and Museum at the NODEM Conference in Stockholm, Sweden as part of the conference and by Common Ground in their publication: The Journal of the Inclusive Museum in New York. Most recently, and after 17+ years in the arts, Fuentes inaugurated the first Pop Up Museum (Project Museum) in Miami, The Chill Concept. =Art dealer= Fuentes started her career as an art dealer in 2005 when she founded the Hardcore Art Contemporary Space in Wynwood Art District in Miami, FL. Since then, she has produced many shows, represented many artists and participated in many of the most important art fairs in the world. In 2010, she organized and founded the board of incorporation of the Miami Art Dealer Association (MADA), where she participated until 2014 as a board member. Fuentes founded PSH in 2013, which is a joint venture to promote the Contemporary Arts throughout Latin America, in an association with dealers from Colombia and Bolivia, participating in seven fares around the world that year alone.http://artdistricts.com/psh- projects-the-new-art-dealers/ Early September 2014, Fuentes officially opened her dream space, The Chill Concept, also in the Wynwood Art District of Miami, FL. =Art collector= Fuentes began her art collector career in 1996 when she acquired her first piece, by Francisco Narvaez, which would become the inception of her Contemporary Art Collection. Her inspiration and purpose to collect was to invest and donate important contemporary feminist art pieces to museums around the world. She shared pieces to museums all over the United States and the world, from Miami to New York City and beyond. In 2007, Fuentes joined the Independent Collectors group of Berlin. =Curator= Fuentes's first work as a curator was in the exhibition called \\"Tribute to Miss Venezuela Pageant\\" inside the exhibit \\"609060,\\" design by the Goethe Institut of Caracas, and shown at the Museo Jacobo Borges, Catia (Caracas) in 2000. For a decade, she managed the curatorial program at Hardcore Art Contemporary Space, and Fuentes has participated in numerous Contemporary Art Fairs: Art Miami, Arte Americas Miami, SCOPE Art Show New York, Miami, and Basel, Context Miami, Bridge London, Pinta Art Fair London, and New York, Art Shanghai, LINK Hong Kong, Platform LA, FIA Caracas, among many others. As part of her career as a curator, one of the most important challenges Fuentes faced was implementing the new methodology \\"Exhibici√≥n - Acci√≥n: Arte y Comunidades\\" in the exhibitions Album de Boda (2005) and Tr√°nsito (2006).

Early life and work Sheinfeld was born in Bessarabia and in 1929 he emigrated to Mandate Palestine. He first resided in Magdiel, then in 1941 relocated to Petach Tikva where he found employment as a stonecutter and a road worker. In 1947, he established his own stonecutting factory which in time became one of the biggest quarries in Israel, producing thousands of tons of materials daily for the Israeli construction and road industry. Painting career It was only in 1969 at age 60, that Scheinfeld first took up a paintbrush. In his first year, unwilling to reveal the need for self- expression, Scheinfeld worked surreptitiously in the early mornings or late nights - when no one was about. Just a year later, in 1970, after a successful group exhibition in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Scheinfeld was recognized as one of the striking artists on the local Na√Øve art scene. Although his usual subject matter was the scenery of the land of Israel, Scheinfeld introduced the landscape using a mosaic pattern, something that had become his unique artistic signature. While Scheinfeld's favorite media were tempera and ink on board, he also worked in various others including acrylic on canvas and board, etching with hand-painted colors, mixed-media collage and even weaving. Between 1971 and 1975, Scheinfeld gained a wide international recognition and his artworks were exhibited not only in Israel, but also in Europe and in North and South America. In 1975, Scheinfeld's colorful pen-and-ink artwork ‚ÄòAqueduct‚Äô was featured in UNICEF‚Äôs New Year Round collection. Although Scheinfeld had only a short ten-year career as an artist, in 2004 he was recognized by INSITA, the International Triennial congress of Na√Øve self- taught Art, as one of the four exceptional artists who played a major role in the international context of 20th century art.Insita 2004 - The International Triennale of Naive Art Collections * Petach-Tikva Museum of Art, Petach- Tikva, Israel * The President's Residence, Jerusalem, Israel * Stadshof Nijmegen, The Netherlands * Slovak National Gallery, Bratislava, Slovakia * Musee d‚ÄôArt spontane, Bruxelles, BelgiumMusee d‚ÄôArt spontane Collection * Musea Oost-Vlaanderen in Evolutie (MovE) Gent, Belgium * Museum of La Creation Franche Begles, FranceMuseum of La Creation Franche Begles Collection * The Magnes Collection of Jewish art and life, Berkeley University of California, United States * Gallery of International Naive Art (GINA), Tel Aviv, Israel Exhibitions =1970= * Yad-Lebanim Museum, Petach Tikva, Israel * Tel- Aviv Museum of Art, Tel-Aviv, Israel =1971= * Municipal Museum, Holon, Israel * Israel-America Cultural Foundation, New York, USA * The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, New York, USA * Gallery La Boetle, New York, USA * The Naive Art Gallery, New York, USA * The Great Neck Library, New York, USA * Traklin Gallery, Haifa, Israel * Ben Yehuda Gallery, Tel Aviv, Israel =1972= * The Na√Øve Art Gallery, S√£o Paulo, Brazil * The Magnes Collection of Jewish art and life, Berkeley USA =1973= * Queens County Art & Cultural Center, New York, USA * Ile Mostra Internazionale dei Naifs Contemporanei, Lugano, Switzerland * Great Neck Library, New York, USA * Weizmann Institute of Science, Rechovot, Israel * Yad-Lebanim Museum, Petach Tikva, Israel =1974= * Gumprecht Gallery, Hamburg, Germany * Regard Gallery, Lyon, France * Ben Uri Museum, London, UK =1975= * UNICEF's Year Round collection, The United Nations NY, USA * Runhof Gallery, D√ºsseldorf, Germany * France TV art expo (French public national TV), Paris, France * Sara Bar Gallery, Los Angeles, USA =1976= * Yad-Lebanim Museum, Petach Tikva, Israel =1977= * Canada-Israel Cultural Foundation, Montreal, Canada * The Museum of Modern Art, Haifa, Israel =1978= * Delson Richter Gallery, Tel Aviv, Israel =1980= * Petach Tikva Museum of Art, \\"In memory of J.

It is a rhizomatous perennial with long bright green leaves, long thin stem and has small groups of flowers in shades of blue, from violet, to bluish purple, to lavender. It flowers in springtime and is native to the southeastern and south-central US states. Description Iris hexagona has thick (around 2‚Äì2. cm in diameter), greenish, branching rhizomes, that can spread to form large colonies of plants. The rhizomes are shallow rooted and can spread up to per plant. Arising from the rhizomes are the basal leaves, which are yellow-green to bright green and sword-shaped.Stephen Elliott (1821) They can grow up to between ,Edwin B. Smith (or 2 feet), and between wide. They overlap at the base, similar to a fan, but some leaves grow on the flowering stem. After the plant has flowered, the leaves wither and die, to re-grow in the autumn (for the next season). The flowering stem (or stalk) grows up to between or 12‚Äì36 inches). The stem is usually straight but sometimes slightly zig-zag, or flexuous (winding),John Darby (1841) with 1 -2 branches. At the top of the stem are several groups of flowers in later spring, between late March to May (in the US), and between June and July (in the UK). Each flower arises from an axil (or spathe), of a reduced leaf (except the top flower), and the single (or double) flowers open in succession. They have a slight fragrance which is similar to sandalwood. The flowers come in a range of shades of blue, from violet, to bluish purple, to lavender. Although there are occasionally white or greenish-white forms. The flowers are generally between across. They have yellow signal, crest, ridge or mid-rib, and a perianth tube of 2‚Äì3 cm, and 3 sepals (or falls) that are widely spreading (about 2 inches or 5 cm) and arching downward. The 3 standards are smaller and narrower than the sepals. It also has linear yellow anthers. After flowering, the plant produces a seed capsule in early summer. The six-angled seed pod, (which gives rise to its name 'hexagona'), has a ventricose (a swelling on one side). It is between . The large and heavy pods, contain large light brown seeds that are D-shaped and across. The seeds are generally described as being 'corky', so they can float on the water. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count: 2n=44 (Riley, 1942). and 2n=44 (Snoad 1952). Taxonomy It has the common name of Dixie iris, (Dixie is a common name for the southeastern United States.Daniel F. Austin ) and it also occasionally known as 'Carolina iris'. In Florida, it was known as the 'Prairie iris', but this due to a population of Iris hexagona var. savannarum which was later classified as a synonym of Iris savannarum. Most of the I. hexagona population in Florida was re-identified as Iris savannarum. The name 'hexagona' refers to the six angled seed head. The Louisiana irises and the name of the series of Hexagonae are derived from Iris hexagona, which was published (in Latin) and described by Walter in 'Flora Caroliniana' page 66 in April‚ÄìJune 1788. Iris hexagona is a name accepted by the RHS. Native Lakeland, US Iris hexagona comes from the southeastern and south-central US states along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee and South Carolina. It is found in wetlands and low roadside ditches in Florida and South Carolina, and west of Tennessee River near Johnsonville in Benton County, Tennessee, Hollow Rock and Carroll County, Tennessee. It was found to be one of the rarest irises in Florida and South Carolina. It was found in Nassau County and Duval County in north- eastern Florida in 1933. But these populations have been extirpated, although the populations in Dixie County and Taylor County are stable. Same as the population in the lowlands near the Santee River in South Carolina. =Habitat= It is ordinarily found in swamps, ditches, or marshes and wet prairies. Cultivation The Louisiana irises generally all have similar cultivation requirements. They need 6 hours of full sunlight per day,), moist, acidic soils (pH of 6.5) with a high organic and fertility content.Neil G. Odenwald and James R. Turner They have a high moisture requirement during the growing season to be able to flower prolifically. The new leaves grow in the autumn and consequently suffer in winter (if heavily frosted). They can be used planted by the edges of ponds and pools or they can be planted in the water ‚Äì but need the rhizomes pinned into the ground to stop them floating away. If grown in borders, they need a mulch to retain moisture (in the soil) and to protect the rhizomes from sun burn. The iris seed is not hard to raise, but does take many years to germinate and then they take 3‚Äì5 years before reaching flowering stage.Nick Romanowski The seed should be sown before they dry out. Iris brevicaulis and Iris hexagona are primarily pollinated by bumblebees. Propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes, which is best carried out in late summer or autumn when the plants are dormant. The ground must be prepared before planting, with the addition of a generous amount of organic matter and the soils dug to about deep (to allow for new root growth). Plants require dividing every 3‚Äì4 years to promote good flowering. They can combine with other plants but tend to 'move' to suitable positions. If using a fertilizer (or feed), sprinkle in late January or February, before the plant is in flower. Iris giganticaerulea and Iris hexagona are considered too tender for cultivation in the UK, although in Kew Gardens (in London) the plant is grown in a rock garden, near a stream. Botanist William Rickatson Dykes recommends a sheltered position. It is thought to be hardy to in the UK. In the US, they best grown in the southeastern states. It is listed as a native plant to be suitable use in landscaping in Georgia.Bonnie Harper-Lore and Maggie Wilson (editors) The rhizomes (thickened roots) of Iris hexagona contain poison. If eaten, it could cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and an elevated temperature. The roots, seeds and plant sap can also cause skin irritation if touched. Research has also been carried out on the effects of saltwater on the Iris. Normally, saltwater getting into a wetland ecosystem can destroy or damage many native plant populations. Iris hexagona is a salt-sensitive species. The 2-year research found that saltwater affected the iris flowering times by several days, since Iris flowers are only receptive to pollinators for 2 days or less. This could have significant effects on iris colonies. It also means that the iris can be 'stressed' during episodic events (such as tropical storms). References Sources *Correll, D. S. & H. B.

Martel discovered the Ondes Martenot while making her 2004 film, Le fant√¥me de l'op√©ratrice, which featured a soundtrack by accomplished \\"Ondiste\\" Suzanne Binet-Audet. Martel has stated that in post-screening question periods, people often asked about the mysterious music on the soundtrack. The film documents the musical instrument's invention by Maurice Martenot, who conceived his instrument after being inspired by the humming and static sounds made by the telegraph machines he operated during the First World War. He built fewer than 300 of the instruments that bear his name during his lifetime, of which there are only about 70 left. Wavemakers includes a performance by musician Jonny Greenwood, filmed during a Radiohead soundcheck. Greenwood, who was self- taught on the instrument, stated after his performance Binet-Audet pointed out a technical error in his playing style. The film also features interviews with Jean-Loup Dierstein, an electronic-instrument repairman-turned-Ondes Martenot maker, who was commissioned by Greenwood to build him a new instrument, Binet- Audet, as well as Montreal-based Ondiste Jean Laurendeau.

Like other members of the genus, they are usually found in large schools in the sloping or vertical drop-offs at coral reef edges. Similar to other species of Trimma this species consists of multiple cases of bidirectional sex change, meaning that if a group is lacking in a specific sex a partial amount of the group can change their undeveloped gonad structure of the opposite sex in order to accommodate. This sex change is made possible due to the females having a developed set of ovaries with female hormones that are developed, and a set of testis and male hormones that are underdeveloped; The males follow a similar set up in vice versa, so their testis and male hormones are developed, while the ovaries and female hormones are underdeveloped. Taxonomy Trimma caudomaculatum belongs to the Trimma tevegae species group of the dwarfgoby genus Trimma. It was included in the true goby subfamily Gobiinae in the goby family Gobiidae. However, the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World does not give any subfamilies in the Gobiidae. It was first described as Trimma caudomaculata (in error) by the Japanese ichthyologists Tetsuo Yoshino and Ch≈´ichi Araga from specimens recovered from southern Japan. In 2005, the ichthyologist Richard Winterbottom examined specimens of Trimma caudomaculatum (specific name corrected for gender agreement) and compared them with specimens of Trimma tevegae. Based on morphology, he concluded that they belonged to the same species, and thus synonymized Trimma caudomaculatum into Trimma tevegae. However, he reversed this opinion after a 2011 phylogenetic study on the genus Trimma. Trimma caudomaculatum is now again considered to be a separate valid species, though still closely related to Trimma tevegae. The study also revealed that Trimma tevegae may be a cryptic species complex. Distribution Trimma caudomaculatum can be found in the Western Pacific coral reefs. Specimens have been recovered from Japan and Palau.

Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk praised the album for a nostalgic, but original vibe that the albums gives. Beringer stated that \\"what makes You Blew It! so endearing is just how real they are. There's nothing fake or insincere with them or this record, as it contains that DIY charm.

The Palace was first erected at the site of a few earlier tower-houses bought in 1616 by the Lucchese merchant of silk Ascanio Mansi and his descendants. While the facade retains earlier Renaissance window features, between 1686 and 1691, Ascanio's son Raffaello employed the architect Raffaello Mazzanti to further renovate the now palace, and the piano nobile rooms acquired the present decoration and a grand staircase access. The cooler ground floor rooms were turned into a summer apartment. In the second half of the 18th century, Luigi Mansi pursued further refurbishing. The Mansi family retained prestige in the early 19th century; Raffaele Mansi and Camilla Parensi had been appointed courtiers to Elisa Bonaparte and Felice Baciocchi. Raffaello Mansi Orsetti, who died in 1956, was the first to display the art collections to the public. In the mid-1960s his children sold the palace to the state, which has converted into a National Museum of arts and tapestries.

This is the main difference of , , and from other yogurt-based drinks.  Production  Ryazhenka is made by first pasteurizing milk before simmering it on low heat for eight hours at minimum. Historically, this was done by placing a clay pot (glechik or krinka) with milk in the traditional Russian oven for a day until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes the Maillard reaction between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting in the formation of melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. In household production, sour cream (smetana) is subsequently added to trigger fermentation. In modern industrial production, pure thermophile bacterial cultures (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) are used instead. The mixture is then kept in a warm place. The fermentation occurs at temperatures above ca. 40 ¬∞C / 100 ¬∞F and usually takes from three to six hours. The fat content of industrially produced ryazhenka is typically 3.5‚àí4%, but in general it is allowed to vary from <0.5% (if made from skimmed milk) up to 8.9%. The protein content is at least 3%. The carbohydrate content is usually 4‚àí5%. Like scalded milk, ryazhenka is free of harmful bacteria and enzymes and can be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from northern America. It has long drooping, grass-like leaves, tall stems, 10 red- purple flowers. Description Iris nelsonii spreads into large colonies by rhizomes. It has long and narrow grass-like green leaves, which are often droop and becoming glaucous. They are wide and grow up to long. They do not grow as tall as the stem. The stems grow up to , (28‚Äì43 inches) with 2‚Äì4 branches. It blooms between April and May (a week or 2 later than Iris fulva and Iris giganticaerulea) in the UK (June) with up to 10 flowers, that are 4‚Äì5 inches across. The large flowers come in a range of shades from red-purple, to bright red to brown, and occasionally yellow. The rare yellows are sometimes called 'Abbeville yellows'. The flowers are often drooping or flaring, there are two top (terminal) flower buds, and often two buds together on the stalks. There is often a \\"signal\\" or bright spot on the petals. The iris flowers have three pollination units, each of which is composed of a sepal and stylar branch subtended by a single anther and the nectary. When a pollinator attempts to access the nectar, pollen is deposited on the head or the body of the pollinator. When the pollinator visits the next flower, the pollen (of the first flower) is deposited onto the stigmatic surface that folds down in front of the anther. After flowering, the iris produces a seed capsule, which tapers to a point at both ends. Taxonomy It has the common names of 'Abbeville red iris' or 'Abbeville swamp iris' and occasionally Nelson's iris. It was discovered in the late 1930s by W. B. Macmillan near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish in the US state of Louisiana. In July 1958, Charles W. Arny Jr. (a known Louisiana iris hybridizer) wrote an article in the 'Bulletin of the American Iris Society' #150 about the importance of the recently found Abbeville Iris and its use in creating new hybrids. Iris nelsonii was then first published and described by Randolph in 'Baileya' (a Quarterly Journal of Horticultural Taxonomy of Ithaca, New York) 14: 150 in 1966. Lowell Randolph had collaborated with Ira S. \\"Ike\\" Nelson (a professor of horticulture at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette) since 1942, after the first show of the 'Society for Louisiana Irises' was held. Randolph named the new iris after him. Nelson later died in a car accident. It appears on Washington Flora Checklist. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 3 December 2004. Iris nelsonii is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to North America. Range Iris nelsonii can only be found in Abbeville swamp, in Louisiana (South-eastern U.S.). Habitat It lives in a privately owned Cypress-tupelo gum swamp, with forested edges and fluctuating water levels. The water levels of the swamp have changed over the years, possibly due to agricultural use and modification of waterways to improve drainage, which has resulted in reducing the swamp waters. Most iris nelsonii colonies are in ditches and spread along the banks of waterways, although some are still in the centre parts of the swamp. Conservation Due to its very limited native range of a single swamp in 'Vermilion Parish', which is privately owned. It has been introduced to Palmetto Island State Park to make it viewable to the public and to create a protected habitat. It is under several locational threats. Including, residential and commercial development, deforestation, over-collection (of wild species) and the main threat, of agriculture, which includes conversion of habitat and water usage pressures. Other natural threats such as salt water intrusion (into the swamp) caused by hurricanes and further magnified by coastal erosion, increases the threats to the iris colonies. Hybrid origin In 1938, Riley described the natural hybridization of Iris fulva and Iris hexagona; this led to the population of 'Abbeville Reds'.James F. Hancock (2003) In 1966, when Randolph when describing the Iris, had mentioned that he had thought it had a hybrid origin, due to various chromosomal and morphological characteristics. In 1993, Michael L. Arnold (Department of Genetics of University of Georgia), carried out molecular study (using isozyme, cpDNA and RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) markers) on Iris nelsonii. It confirmed that the species was a hybrid, with genomic contributions from three widespread species of Louisiana iris ‚Äì Iris brevicaulis Raf., Iris fulva Ker. and Iris hexagona Walt. It also suggested that most of the iris genome is inherited from Iris fulva. Although, it still as aspects from all three progenitor species. This means that Iris nelsoniis rhizomes, leaves and flowers are much larger than those of Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva, yet are similar in size to those of Iris hexagona. The flowers of Iris nelsonii and Iris fulva are red and characteristic of a hummingbird pollination syndrome, whereas those of Iris brevicaulis and Iris hexagona are blue and characteristic of a bee pollination syndrome. This suggests that the few introgressed regions of Iris hexagona and Iris brevicaulis may have contributed to ecological divergence in Iris nelsonii.Michael L. Arnold Michael L. Arnold (2008) This characteristic of creating hybrids from three parents is rare. Cultivation The Louisiana irises generally all have similar cultivation requirements. They need full sunlight, moist, acidic soils (ph of 6.5) with a high organic and fertility content. For best flowering, moisture is essential during late autumn, winter and spring times, when the plant starts to grow.Neil G. Odenwald and James R. Turner They can be used planted by the edges of ponds and pools or they can be planted in the water ‚Äì but need the rhizomes pinned into the ground to stop them floating away. Propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes.Nick Romanowski Which is best carried out in late summer, when the plants are dormant. The ground must be prepared pre-planting, with the addition of a generous amount of organic matter and the soils dug to about 6inches deep (to allow for new root growth). Plants require dividing every 3‚Äì4 years to promote good flowering. They can combine with other plants but tend to 'move' to suitable positions. If using a fertilizer, sprinkle around the plant in late January or February, before the plant is in flower. The iris seed is not hard to raise, but does take many years to germinate and then they take 3‚Äì5 years before reaching flowering stage. It is estimated to be hardy to between USDA Zones 7 to 11. But could be hardy to Zone 5 or 6 with winter protection. It has a similar hardiness to Iris fulva. It can tolerate frost but will flower poorly in areas with cool summers. Iris nelsonii can be grown in southern UK, in damp or wet soils. Pollination Iris nelsonii, due to its hybrid origin, has been well documented and observed. This research found that the iris was most commonly visited by Archilochus colubris (ruby-throated hummingbird), then other pollinators include butterflies, wasps, and bee species. It was found that hummingbirds did not show an initial preference for either flower when they entered multi-species arrays. But when a hummingbird first visited an Iris nelsonii flower to collect pollen, it then visited another Iris nelsonii flower significantly more than expected (more than chance), revealing a flower constancy that may result in reproductive isolation between these species of iris. Hummingbirds readily transferred pollen analogues both within and between species, so despite their morphological differences, mechanical isolation does not result in reproductive isolation of these species. This also means that pollinator isolation may be important in preventing hybridization between Iris nelsonii and its geographically closest progenitor species, Iris hexagona. Further research found that some hybrid flowers may be as equally as attractive to pollinators as pure species flowers; also that Iris brevicaulis and Iris hexagona are primarily pollinated by bumblebees. Also Iris fulva is primary pollinated by hummingbirds. =Hybrids and cultivars= The iris has been used by plant breeders to hybridize with various other irises, including Iris pseudacorus, Iris spuria, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.} References External links *Image of Iris nelsonii nelsonii Category:Plants described in 1966 Category:Flora of the United States Category:Flora of Louisiana ","title":"Iris nelsonii"},{"id":"44536636","text":"Agyneta pseudofuscipalpis is a species of sheet weaver found in Nepal.

Early life Anne Somerset was born in 1673, the third daughter and youngest child of Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester and Mary Somerset (n√©e Capell), a botanist and gardener. Her father became the first Duke of Beaufort in 1682. Her mother was the daughter of the 1st Baron Capell of Hadham and the widow of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1626‚Äì1654), son of the Duke of Somerset. William Seymour, 3rd Duke of Somerset (1652‚Äì1675) and Elizabeth Bruce, Countess of Ailesbury (died 1697) were Anne's half- siblings from her mother's first marriage. At 17, Lady Anne married Thomas Coventry, 2nd Earl of Coventry in 1691; that same year, she was painted by Godfrey Kneller.Lady Anne Somerset, Godfrey Kneller, BBC Writing and charitable activities The Countess of Coventry by Charles Jervas Lady Coventry was noted for her benevolence and piety as well as her interest in education for women. In 1709, she helped found Mary Astell's Charity School for Girls in Chelsea, in association with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. She was a close friend of Mary Astell, a feminist, with whom she shared many views. It is possible Lady Coventry was involved with Jacobite activities along with Astell and her own elder sister Mary Butler, Duchess of Ormonde, but was never publicly accused of it. In her will, she strongly attested her allegiance to the Church of England. In 1707, her book The Right Honourable Anne, countess of Coventry's meditations and reflections, moral and divine was published. Her book was republished in 1727. Contemporary biographies note that she was a pious and well-read woman who was an \\"enthusiastic collector of books\\" which she kept in her own library. She was also among the subscribers to George Ballard's 1752 Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain, who have been Celebrated for their Writings or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts and Sciences. In addition to religious texts, the catalog of her library showed an interest in contemporary works through a large collection of plays, including some rather racy comedies. According to Emma Major in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, these racy plays reveal a \\"sophisticated broad-mindedness that reflects her involvement with fashionable life. It also perhaps hints at the pleasure in life that prompted her to tease Astell about her tendency to gloom.\\" Marriage and family Lord Coventry died in August 1710, leaving her with significant debts that she managed to repay over the years before her death. They had one child, a son, who died shortly after his father: * Thomas Coventry, 3rd Earl of Coventry (7 April 1702 ‚Äì 28 January 1712). He died at Eton College, age 9. The Countess never remarried.

The then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sir Humphrey Jervis built a house on the property, Belcamp House, where Henry Grattan lived and Dean Swift often visited. Countess Markievicz rented the property in 1909, and it was also used as a centre for the Fianna Eireann. The center was known as the 'Belcamp Commune' where for a year, an agricultural cooperative was built. However, the cooperative was not a success, due to problems such as no electricity, poor water supply, damp conditions, and over grown fields and gardens. The central part of Belcamp House's demesne remained in private hands, later hosting a fee-paying secondary school, but some of the southern lands of the estate were eventually formed into Belcamp Park. Facilities The park accommodates pitch and putt, tennis, and basketball, as well as playing fields, children's play facilities, and has an extensive network of pathways for walkers.

Yet, for the purpose of apostolic cooperation, usually grouped with the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia. It also has a working partnership with the Apostolic Vicariate of Tabuk and the Diocese of Baguio, both in the Cordilleras, to coordinate Catholic missions among the Igorot tribes. The Apostolic Vicariate operates a liaison office in the compound of the Baguio Cathedral. On 6 May 2015, Pope Francis appointed Valentin Dimoc as its fifth bishop, after the vicariate was without bishop for three years.http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=55708 Territory The apostolic vicariate comprises the two civil provinces of Ifugao and Mountain Province. Based on NSO record of 2007, there are about 190,000 Catholics in the jurisdiction. The seat of the vicariate is the town of Bontoc, where the Santa Rita of Cascia Cathedral and the vicarial chancery, known as the Teng-ab Pastoral Complex, are located. The territory is divided into 21 parishes. History Records from Santa Rita Parish of Bontoc reveal that the first baptism held in Bontoc was administered by Augustinian Father Jose Iglesia on 28 November 1893. Spanish missionaries however abandoned the Bontoc Mission sometime in 1898. After a lull for almost a decade, a group of Belgian CICM missionaries led by Father Constance Jurgens and Jules Sepulchre arrived in Bontoc in time to celebrate a midnight mass on 24 December 1907 On 10 June 1948, Pope Pius XII established the Apostolic Vicariate of the Mountain Province, formerly known as the Apostolic Prefecture of the Monta√±osa. Eleven days after, on 21 June, Vatican appointed the Belgian missionary, Bishop William Brasseur, CICM as its first Vicar Apostolic. The apostolic vicariate was erected on 6 July 1992 with the papal bull Ad aptius in Insulis of Pope John Paul II. Under the papal bull, Bontoc-Lagawe was one among the three vicariates created by dividing the old Vicariate of Monta√±osa into three : the Vicariates of Baguio (elevated into a diocese in 2004), Tabuk and Bontoc- Lagawe. Assisting the Vicar Apostolic in the governance of pastoral welfare is the Vicariate Mission Council. All members of the presbyterium form this council which meets regularly every quarter. However, it is the prerogative of the Vicar Apostolic to convene the mission council as the need arises. Bishops (all Latin Church) * Brigido A.

He returned for some years to his home prefecture in Kumamoto, where he attended junior high school. Returning to California, he graduated from Piedmont High School in Oakland in 1929. =Art= The Way Home (1935) Noda soon attended the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA‚Äînow San Francisco Art Institute. There he met Arnold Blanch, who taught at the Art Students League in New York. Noda saw Diego Rivera paint \\"The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City,\\" April‚ÄìJune 1931, at the school. Later in 1931, he was studying mural-tempera painting there under Blanch, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and George Grosz. He lived for a time at the Woodstock Art Village with fellow students Sakari Suzuki and Jack Chikamichi Yamasaki. In 1932, he won a prize from the Chicago Art Institute and exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Washington, DC. He was a member of the Mural Painters Guild and the Woodstock Artists Association In 1933, Noda became one of several assistants to Rivera on the artist‚Äôs work for Man at the Crossroads in Rockefeller Center Plaza in New York City. (Other assistants included: Lucienne Bloch, Stephen Pope Dimitroff, Lou Block, Arthur Niendorf, Seymour Fogel, and Antonio Sanchez Flores.) Photographer Walker Evans knew Noda in New York in 1933. Estelle Hama, wife of painter Art Hama, recalled of 1933-1934 \\"I met Art in New York at the John Reed Club. They had just formed. He was a protege of the artist Kuniyoshi. I knew Kuniyoshi. Well, everyone knew Yasuo in those days. They were friends Isamum Noguchi, Hideo Noda, and Eitaro Ishigaki.\\" In 1934-1935, Noda's work appeared in the Whitney Museum's \\"Second Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting\\" along with Kuniyoshi's. According to an entry, \\"Hideo Noda participates in Whitney Second Biennial; his painting 'Street Scene' is purchased by the museum.\\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted, \\"Look for Hideo Noda's 'Street Scene.' Noda is a mural painter and a real modern, immensely responsive to the daily sorrows and beauties of people in 1935.\\" Noda was \\"involved in a conflict over a mural he designed for Ellis Island in 1934-1935. In 1935, Noda's murals lost out to those of Edward Laning for Ellis Island: > It was a great relief to PWA, to the College Art Association, to Architects > Harvey Wiley Corbett and Chester Holmes Aldrich and to Edward Laning last > week to learn that Commissioner of Immigration & Naturalization Rudolph > Reimer at Ellis Island had finally approved Artist Laning's designs for > murals for the dining hall at New York's immigrant station. Cheered, > Muralist Laning and his two assistants, James Rutledge and Albert Soroka, > hustled to get his cartoons on tempera and gesso panels as soon as > possible... > No sooner was Muralist Hideo Noda's cartoon submitted to him than > Commissioner Reimer blossomed out as a stickler for artistic detail. The > Noda mural was promptly rejected because Negro cotton pickers were shown > wearing turtlenecked sweaters and creased trousers, because the creature > pulling a poor blackamoor's farm cart seemed to be a full-blooded Percheron > stallion. Artist Noda threw up his hands and his job, went back to > California. Returning to California in 1937, he painted the mural \\"School Life\\" in the Piedmont High School. Merry-go-round (1937) Returning to Japan, he continued his work \\"in the modern art, art societies, Shinseisakka (:ja:Êñ∞Âà∂‰ΩúÂçî‰ºö) and Nikka.\\" =Politics and espionage= Noda joined the John Reed Club of New York, where Eitaro Ishigaki and \\"Chuzo Tomatzu\\" (Chuzo Tamotsu) were founding members. (A fellow student of the Art Students League, member of the John Reed Club, and artist concerned with African-American rights was Esther Shemitz, by 1931 wife of Whittaker Chambers. ) In New York, Noda became acquainted with leftist American art historian Meyer Schapiro, a classmate of Chambers at Columbia, and they corresponded between 1934 and 1936. In his 1952 memoir, Whittaker Chambers claimed to have recruited Noda, who he said was a communist, in late 1934 as translator for the head of a Tokyo spy cell. Helping him were either J. Peters or Meyer Schapiro. Chambers organized the cell from New York City with the help of John Loomis Sherman, who would head the Tokyo cell, and Maxim Lieber, whose literary agency would provide cover for an ‚ÄúAmerican Feature Writers Syndicate.‚Äù Sherman and Noda spent an unsuccessful year (1935) in Tokyo, at the end of which the cell closed suddenly and both returned to New York. Chambers provided perhaps the longest description of Noda by a contemporary. He claims he was a member of the American Communist Party. He says he was a relative of one of Japanese premier, Prince Fumimaro Konoe. \\"He was extremely intelligent, alert, personable and likable.\\" Noda agreed to go to Japan to work for Sherman, who gave him the underground name \\"Ned.\\" In 1936, upon Noda's return to New York from the failed Tokyo cell, Chambers gave him his next instructions, namely to go to Southern France (Nice or Antibes) and wait until contacted. At that time, Chambers advised him to get out of the underground: Noda reacted by denouncing Chambers as a \\"Trotskyist wrecker.\\" Chambers records his last sightings: > Some time in 1937 or 1938, Hideo Noda... flitted through New York again. > Before Noda had been alert, somewhat as birds are, as if in him mental and > physical brightness were one. Now he seemed a little faded and tired. > Our brief meeting was stiff. Perhaps he still considered me a \\"diversionist > mad dog\\" and was disappointed to find that I had not, after his denunciation > of me to the Party, been purged. But I suspect that Noda was so silent > because, had he begun to speak, the words that came out would have been: > \\"Oh, horror, horror, horror!\\" I stood and watched Ned as he walked away, > something that I did not often do. I never saw him again. =Death= Noda died of a brain tumor on January 12, 1939, in Tokyo. According to the New York Times, he had been \\"visiting Japan for about a year.\\" According to the Brooklyn Daily News, he died on January 11, 1939, at the Imperial University Hospital, Tokyo. Surviving him were his wife, Ruth Noda in New York, and his parents in Japan. His wife had just returned to New York, and he was to join her shortly. In his 1952 memoir, Chambers \\"wondered whether, in Ulrich's words, Noda had 'been shot by them or shot by us'.\\" A 1940 issue of the Bulletin of the New York Public Library notes under \\"Limited or Other Special Editions\\" the following entry: \\"Mrs. Ruth Noda Hulley ‚Äî No. 120 of a limited edition of 500 copies of Album Hideo Noda, by Shinseisaku- Ha.\\" Style In his 1939 obituary, the New York Times declared: > Mr. Noda's art, which was one of the modern school, achieved wide > recognition in Japan, where he was considered an important figure in the > modern movement known as Shinseisakka. In this country, his work was gaining > increasing appreciation as critice noted in it a distinctive \\"mode,\\" which > in his later works approached the surrealism of Paul Klee and Joan Miro. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted, \\"Noda is a mural painter and a real modern, immensely responsive to the daily sorrows and beauties of people in 1935.\\" Japanese-American artists A number of Japanese-American artists involved themselves in Communism during the 1930s: > Both Ishigaki and Noda were members of the communist John Reed Club... > However, as Japan‚Äôs militarism became threatening to the U.S., Noda was > actually \\"censured\\" because he was a second-generation Japanese American who > had been educated in Japan in his youth... (The \\"censure\\" above may include reference to Noda's loss of the Ellis Island mural competition.) Attracting these artists were the plight of African- Americans: > Liberal American artists responded with protest images, again encouraged by > the ACA Galleries. Japanese American artists could easily empathize with > their black contemporaries, another minority facing discrimination, and they > made work that joined them in protest. Among them were Ishigaki, painter > Hideo Noda, the young sculptor Leo Amino... The young Noguchi dramatically > suspended a contorted, life-sized figure from a rope in his 'Death (Lynched > Figure)' (1934). > Outside the West Coast, Japanese expatriate intellectuals formed bonds with > African Americans. In New York, Eitaro Ishigaki pained a black history mural > for a Harlem courthouse, while he, Isamu Noguchi, and Hideo Noda each > produced artworks of lynchings.

He was chairman of the central committee of the building and timber industry union in the East German Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB / Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund ) and President of the International Federation of Unions in the building, timber and building materials industries in the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Life Lindner was born in Saxony, the child of a bricklayer and a waitress. On completing his schooling, in 1942 he started an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. However, in 1944 he was drafted as an air-force assistant. He returned to and completed his apprenticeship in 1945/46, and started work as a bricklayer, working on construction sites in Limbach and Chemnitz. With the re-establishment of trade unions, in June 1945 Lindner joined the Building Industry Union and the FDGB. In the same year his co-workers elected him to the works council and as the youth spokesman in the local Building Workers' committee. In 1947 he joined the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). From January 1947 he served as youth secretary to the regional executive in Saxony of the building and timber workers' union (IG Bau-Holz), and then in 1947/48 became head of the youth and training department of the FDGB before becoming, in 1948/49 Secretary for Training in the National/Central Executive of the union. In 1949 he attended a training course at the national FDGB school at Bernau near Berlin. From January 1950 till 1951 Lindner was Chairman of the Saxony- Anhalt regional committee of IG Bau-Holz, then becoming, in January 1951, deputy chairman and a secretariat member of the union's central committee. In October 1953, however, he was removed from his position as deputy chairman and received a formal warning (Partreistrafe) from The Party on account of a \\"false assessment\\" in June 1953 and for his \\"support of the programme of demands put forward by the IG Bau-Holz union\\"‚ÄûUnterst√ºtzung des Forderungsprogramms der IG Bau-Holz‚Äú in July 1953.

After that he worked as the deputy department leader (1955‚Äì57) and as the department leader and executive departmental head (1957/58) on the national committee of the FDGB. From 1958 right up until February 1990 Lindner was also chairman of the national committee for his union, IG Bau-Holz in succession to Walter Tille.

It was first described by the American zoologist John Percy Moore in 1904. The type locality is Hawkinsville, Georgia. This worm has bioluminescent properties; its body fluids and the sticky slime it exudes when stimulated emit a bluish glow. Description Diplocardia longa can grow to a length of about when moderately extended and a diameter of at segment 7 and behind the clitellum. The number of segments varies between about 270 and 330. It is slender and cylindrical, slightly tapering at both ends. At the posterior end it swells slightly into a club-shape before narrowing to the anal opening. The two ends of the worm are brown, the clitellum reddish-brown and the rest of the body is a rather dull salmon pink. The skin is translucent and the veins can be seen distinctly in the less-pigmented regions. Bioluminescence Structural formula of the luciferin molecule used by D. longa This worm produces bioluminescent mucus, its family Acanthodrilidae being one of three families of oligochaetes that exhibit bioluminescence. The light is produced in the coelomic fluid and is emitted when a luciferin (N-isovaleryl-3-amino-propanal) is acted on by a peroxidase-like luciferase. This is a copper-containing protein which reacts with the hydrogen peroxide that is produced by another enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Strong stimulation of the worm causes fluid to be exuded from the worm's mouth, dorsal pores and anus. Light is emitted by certain large cells in this fluid when they rupture, and the worm is visible as a dark silhouette against the luminous slime. It has been suggested that when the worm is attacked by a predator such as the eastern mole, it can writhe and squirm and produce the slime, perhaps causing the mole to retreat from the bright light while the worm escapes.

(http://www.google.com/patents/US6303096)Lin, S., Pitch based short carbon fibers, United States Materials Technology Laboratory, 1991. (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a244780.pdf) Pitch is a viscoelastic material that is composed of aromatic hydrocarbons. Pitch is produced via the distillation of carbon-based materials, such as plants, crude oil, and coal. Pitch is isotropic, but can be made anisotropic through the use of heat treatments. However, the most important in carbon fiber production is mesophase pitch due to the ability to melt spin anisotropic mesophase pitch without filament breakage. The mesophase pitch forms a thermotropic crystal, which allows the pitch to become organized and form linear chains without the use of tension. Mesophase pitch is made by polymerizing isotropic pitch to a higher molecular weight. The melting point for the mesophase pitch is roughly 300 ¬∞C. An advantage in the production of Pitch carbon fibers over PAN carbon fibers is that Pitch carbon fibers do not require constant tension on the fibers at all processing stages. Pitch based carbon fibers have been found to be more sheet-like in their crystal structure, as opposed to PAN based carbon fibers, which are more granular. There are four main steps in the production of carbon fiber from pitch 1) melt spinning 2) oxidization/precarbonization 3) carbonization and 4) graphitization. 1) Melt spinning is the method of forming fibers through the rapid cooling of a melt; due to the fast rates of cooling, the mesophase pitch is able to become highly oriented. Mesophase pitch can be melt spun, but because of its flow characteristics the process can be difficult.Huang, X., Fabrication and Properties of Carbon Fibers, Materials, 2009. (http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/2/4/2369) The viscosity of mesophase pitch is more sensitive to temperature than other melt-spun materials. Therefore, during the creation of pitch based fibers the temperature and heat transfer rate must be carefully controlled. 2) Oxidization/Precarbonization is used in order to cross-link the fibers to the point where they cannot be melted or fused together. This step is extremely important because it produces fibers that are stable at the high temperatures of carbonization and graphitization; otherwise, the fibers would fail in those steps of the process. 3) Carbonization is the process removing all nonorganic elements. In the case of carbon fibers, all elements except for carbon are removed. This is achieved by heating the fibers to high temperatures in an environment without oxygen. This step removes all impurities from the fibers and leaves crystalline carbon structures. These structures are mostly hexagonal in shape and are composed of entirely carbon. 4) Graphitization is the process of treating the fibers at high temperatures in order to improve the alignment and orientation of the crystalline regions along the fiber direction [1,8]. Having the crystalline regions aligned, stacked, and oriented along the fiber direction increases the overall strength of the carbon fiber. The high strength of carbon fiber can be attributed to these four main processes. Having high levels of crystalline regions allows the fibers to withstand high levels of stress. These crystalline regions are formed via the melt spinning process; the crystals are stiff areas that do not deform when an external stress is applied. Orienting and aligning these crystalline regions gives further strength to the fibers, specifically if the orientation is along the fiber axis. Carbonization and graphitization are the two processes responsible for this alignment of the crystalline regions. Pitch based carbon fiber is lower in strength than fiberglass; however, it has a very high elastic modulus. Pitch-based carbon fibers have various end uses due to their high strength. These fibers are used within the aerospace industry due to their high modulus and higher price. These fibers could be used within the automotive and sports industries, but the cheaper PAN based carbon fibers provide a high enough strength for these applications. https://www.azom.com/amp/article.aspx?ArticleID=19200 References * Category:Composite materials Category:Synthetic fibers ","title":"Pitch-based carbon fiber"},{"id":"44537216","text":"Tabernaemontana cerea is a species of plant in the family Apocynaceae.Tabernaemontana cerea at www.theplantlist.org.

HowNutsAreTheDutch has been designed by researchers from the University of Groningen to support self- measurement of mental health for the entire population of The Netherlands. The project shows how crowdsourcing can be used for studying mental health in the general population. HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL in Dutch) provides automatic personalized feedback on filled-out questionnaires to provide participants with more basic insight in their mental health, including a comparison with the scores of other participants. HowNutsAreTheDutch is meant to reduce mental health stigma and to promote a discrete categorization of mental health, by showing that all people have both personal strengths and weaknesses, and that most psychological characteristics are distributed continuously in the population. A background goal is to develop and evaluate personalized interventions to improve mood-related problems and social- emotional functioning. In the first year 13000 inhabitants of the Netherlands and Belgium participated.  Background  The HowNutsAreTheDutch name has been reported to be inspired by the Pandora foundation. The Pandora foundation was a Dutch patient organization for people with mental health problems, which used posters with tongue-in-cheek sayings to inform the public and reduce mental health stigma. The HowNutsAreTheDutch project was created by scientists from different fields, including computer sciences, psychiatric epidemiology, psychology, and mathematics.  Diary Study  Since the summer of 2014 HowNutsAreTheDutch provides an automated electronic diary study. This is also known as the ecological momentary assessment methodology. With this diary study participants can monitor their emotions, behaviour, somatic symptoms, and well-being over 30 days (3 times a day), which results in a personal network model. There is no financial compensation for taking part in the research; instead, if participants fill in the diary often enough they get a personal, automatically generated report in return. The web-platform uses automated vector autoregression models to determine cause-effect relationships between the measured features in the time series data. Results evidence substantial between-person variability in within-person associations. The diary study featured in the Dutch magazine \\"Psychologie\\" as a Quantified Self tool. Some researchers coupled data from commercially available sensors (i.e., their Apple Watch, Google Fit, Jawbone, NikeFuel, or Misfit) to their HowNutsAreTheDutch diary data to study the interaction between their physical and psychological processes. One study showed that positive affect and prosocial actions reinforce each other; Thus when an individual was feeling good in one six-hour period, they were more likely to do something prosocial in the next six hours, and vice versa, in line with the mood maintenance theory. Another study showed that negative affect predicted most differences in somatic symptoms between subjects, whereas positive affect predicted most variations in symptom levels within subjects. An increase in positive affect was followed by a decrease in somatic symptoms in the following 24 hours.  Psychopathology  Psychological problems like major depression can be seen as complex dynamic systems in which symptom activation patterns can change suddenly (phase transitions). Researchers showed that people from the general Dutch population were not susceptible to these transitions whereas someone who had experienced a depression was, using mean field approximation.

The Government of India honored Khattar in 2011, with the fourth highest civilian award of Padma Shri, reported to be the first Singaporean to receive the Padma award. Biography Sat Pal Khattar was born on 22 November 1942, in a middle class Punjabi family at Bhera, in the present day Pakistan, then the British India. His father had been running a small sports goods business in Singapore and the young Khattar, who lost his mother in childhood, had a difficult childhood due to the pre-independence struggles and partition pangs. It is reported that Khattar and his sister had to spend days at refugee camps before they could reach Delhi before the Indian Independence Day. Soon, he was flown to Singapore to reunite with his family. Sat Pal Khattar's schooling was at the Raffles Institution, Bras Basah Road, and, as a private candidate, completed A-Level Examinations. Assisting his father in the business and, later, running it on his father's death when he was a second year student, he secured an Honours degree in Law from the University of Singapore, in 1966 and started his career as a Deputy Public Prosecutor and State Counsel at the Attorney General's office. This was followed by a shift in job to the Inland Revenue Office as a Legal Officer and, by the time he moved out of IRO, he was a Grade F Senior Legal Officer. During this period, he continued his studies at Singapore University and obtained a master's degree in 1970. Sat Pal Khattar is married to Reeta and the couple has a daughter and two sons. The eldest, Shareen, is a businessperson, the elder son, Naveen a practicing lawyer in UK and the youngest, Arvind, assists his father in business at Khattar Holdings. Business career After resigning from Inland Revenue service in 1974, Khattar started a small law firm, Sat Pal Khattar Company. After the initial years, Khattar invited property lawyer, David Wong and expanded the partnership to form Khattar Wong LLP, which, over the years, has grown to become one of the largest law firms in Singapore, employing over 150 lawyers. It is the sole representative of Taxand, the worldwide law consultants and is accredited by the International Tax Review. Sat Pal Khattar retired from law practice in 2000 and established Khattar Holding, a private investment firm.

In the episode, Amy gets upset with Sheldon after he does not appreciate her good news, and Howard reconsiders his relationship with Bernadette after he finds out she does not like children. Plot On a date, Amy tells Sheldon that her paper will be published in Neuron, a prestigious scientific journal; Sheldon does not acknowledge her good news, distracted by his Twitter account. Amy excuses herself to \\"wash up\\"; Penny explains to Sheldon that Amy is upset that he did not appreciate her accomplishment. Later, Leonard discusses the situation with Sheldon and suggests he buys her something to apologize. Sheldon visits a jewelry store with Penny. He is distracted by a pocket watch but Penny forces him to focus and they buy Amy a tiara. When Amy is told Sheldon has bought her jewelry, she calls him shallow; she then realizes it is a tiara and hugs Sheldon, overjoyed. In the meantime, Howard shows the guys a magic trick; Leonard and Raj are impressed while Sheldon is not. Howard and Bernadette prepare a magic show for a birthday party while discussing children: Bernadette is not particularly fond of them, while Howard has always planned to have kids (partially to appease his mother). At the party, Bernadette gets annoyed with several children who interrupt Howard's performance; the performance ends badly when milk is poured down the front of Howard's pants due to the milk being poured from the wrong pitcher. Bernadette reiterates that she does not like children. A dejected Howard discusses the situation with Leonard and Raj, and (as usual) off-screen, his mother. Bernadette comes over to Howard's house and suggests that he could take care of the children while she continues working. He agrees and pulls out a condom.

Within cultural psychology, na√Øve dialecticism explains some of the cultural differences observed between those who hold dialectical beliefs and those who hold more Westernized beliefs. Individuals who hold dialectical beliefs are primarily members of Confucian influenced cultures, such as in Japan, China, and Korea. Certain researchers have shown that specific aspects of na√Øve dialecticism have broad implications on cognition, emotion, and behavior. As well, it is sometimes regarded as being more contextual, flexible, holistic, and dialectical as compared with Western thinking and reasoning. Dialecticism is a perceptual framework that applies to all situations and guides all actions, which is called a domain-general thinking style. Na√Øve dialecticism is an expansion on this research; it is a whole collection of domain-specific beliefs, meaning that there is a tendency to understand a situation in terms of these beliefs but there is variation depending on the context and individual differences Na√Øve dialecticism contains certain concepts that distinguish it from Western thinking and beliefs, specifically they have different beliefs about change and contradiction. Dialectic thinking involves treating the world as consisting of co-existing extremes or opposites (e.g. hot/cold or light/dark). As a result, they are more likely to expect change from the status quo. Dialectic thinkers also believe that the truth is always somewhere in the middle (doctrine of the mean), which differs from Western beliefs that contradictions must be reconciled because only a single truth is thought to exist Naive dialecticism provides a framework for analysis that is halfway between a macro-level and a micro-level approach. On a macro-level, individualism and collectivism define the social differences between cultures, which influences the specific common beliefs about how the world operates. Na√Øve dialecticism shares this macro-level framework while also looking at individual and situation-specific differences between people (micro-approach). Principles of na√Øve dialecticism The three principles of na√Øve dialecticism are change, contradiction, and holism, and they operate together. If the world is in constant flux, as explained by the principle of change, then there must be acceptance of contradiction because one phenomenon will inevitably become something else. The fact that understanding phenomena relies on acceptance of contradiction within and between phenomena suggests that the only way to understand it is to look at it holistically =Change= People who are high in na√Øve dialecticism tend to view the world as constantly changing, especially alternating between two opposites. For example, day transforms into night, life becomes death, etc. Basic Taoist teachings suggest that knowledge and existence are in constant flux, and categorization is ineffective as nothing is ever fixed. The concept of change is situation- specific, and so those who are dialectic thinkers believe that their behaviors change depending on the context and individual differences. However, the concept of change is global in that it applies to feelings, events, objects, natural processes and any other phenomena observed in the universe. This can be contrasted to na√Øve aristotelianism, which follows the law of identity: If something is true than it is true, regardless of context =Contradiction= Contradiction assumes that objects, events and states of being have coexisting opposing parts. By splitting or differentiating something to better understand its component parts, one is simply emphasizing the interaction between the contradicting parts. The doctrine of the mean is the belief that the truth is always in the middle, between extreme viewpoints. This belief is consistent with na√Øve dialecticism and is based on the values of balance and harmony. This contrasts Western beliefs that more often align with the law of non- contradiction, which maintains that a statement cannot be both true and false, and the law of the excluded middle, which suggests that a statement is either true or false. Westerners tend to pick a side, even to the point of changing their beliefs about the pros that the losing side offers. Changing one's beliefs such that they will be consistent with one's choice is called cognitive dissonance =Holism= Holism is the belief that everything is interconnected and relational, and understanding something requires that you understand its relationships and context. A primary part of holism is that personal growth requires physical and spiritual growth, and is not independent of the environment within which the growth occurs. In this tradition there is no dichotomy of ‚Äúself‚Äù and ‚Äúother‚Äù Na√Øve dialecticism research has arisen primarily out of the holistic/ analytic tradition of cultural research, which compares cultures on the basis of cognitive styles. These cognitive styles are general ways of interpretation that are adopted, and often similar within a culture. Holism is a characteristic that is generally applied to East Asian cultures, while Western cultures are more often characterized by analytic thinking. This means that Westerners tend to deconstruct something into parts to understand it, while East Asians tend to look at the entire phenomena as a whole and attempt to understand the relationships that bind each facet to every other and to the phenomena as a whole. Historical Roots:Three Systems of Thought Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism are One In East Asian countries, lay beliefs predominantly derive from Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. Taoism guides cognitive beliefs about the physical world, Confucianism guides state decisions and Buddhism guides development of the mind and spirit =Taoism= Na√Øve dialecticism is a lay rendition of Taoism. Taoism is not a religion, but rather a system of beliefs regarding thinking and reasoning or, generally, for understanding how the world works. Unlike the traditions of Confucianism or Buddhism, Taoism did not begin from a community following the teachings of a leader, and therefore there is no original orthodoxy or orthopraxy that provide a standard for the Taoist tradition. Taoism teachings suggest that most people do not live a fulfilling life, as they do not strive for self-cultivation to enhance their experiential awareness. Tao roughly translated means ‚Äúthe way,‚Äù although there are many definitions and none accurately capture the meaning of Tao Laozi-author of Tao Te Ching Basic Concepts of Taoism * Non-duality: the concept that matter and spirit are one. You must have one to know the other. Non-duality is consistent with the principle of contradiction, a fundamental concept in na√Øve dialecticism. * Two-poles: the basic concept of opposites coexisting and complementing one another is evident in the Yin/Yang symbol. Yin, the negative, passive, feminine side, must interact with yang, the positive, active, masculine side. Without one the other cannot exist. * Perpetual change: this concept suggests that the universe is in a perpetual cycle, consistent with the principle of change in na√Øve dialecticism. * Three Treasures: Ching (essence), chi (vitality) and shen (spirit) are the fundamental components of energy and exist at every level of the universe. This is consistent with the concept of holism in na√Øve dialecticism. * Five Elements: According to the Taoist tradition there are five basic elements making up the universe: metal, wood, fire, water and earth. Understanding how each contributes and influences one another is essential to the belief of Holism * Non-action (Wu wei): this concept refers to flexibility and spontaneity of one's actions. =Confucianism = The Confucian tradition is agnostic; it focuses on living a moral life for the sake of itself, without discussing what comes before or after. Most of Confucius‚Äô teachings stem from the Analects, a series of correspondences between Confucius and his students. It generally informed citizens of their social roles within interpersonal relationships and how they should act morally and politically. For example, a young man was expected to pursue education and economic welfare for the betterment of his family, which relates to the importance of filial piety. This emphasis on family relations and interdependence reflects the principle of holism. =Buddhism= Originally from India, the tradition of Buddhism was introduced to Chinese culture during the Han dynasty. Since it was a later player in Chinese culture, Buddhism was unique from the indigenous traditions of Taoism and Confucianism in that the Chinese interpreted the Buddhist tradition to integrate it into these pre-existing cultural systems. The successful union of Buddhism into Chinese culture reflects the integrative and holistic nature of both. Buddhist ideas filled in many of the blanks that Taoism and Confucianism did not address, for example: Buddhism introduced the ideas of karma and rebirth. Buddhism brought a strong position on death, and filial piety was softened by Buddhist ideas of equality between all people. Cultural products Yin and Yang The principles of na√Øve dialecticism are apparent in cultural products. For example, in the yin/yang symbol, there is perpetual motion from black to white indicating that the world is in constant flux. The black and white dots represent contradiction; Not only can opposites co-exist, they could not exist without one another. The values of balance and harmony are represented by the symmetry of the symbol, and the cognitive style of holism by the outer circle representing context The Yin/Yang symbol is present in many well known pieces of art, as well as other symbols of Taoism and naive dialectic beliefs. The famous woodblock print ‚ÄúThe Great Wave off Kanagawa‚Äù by Japanese artist Hokusai depicts a large wave that a writer describes as a ‚Äúyin yang of empty space beneath the mountain‚Ä¶ The violent Yang of nature is overcome by the yin of the confidence of these experienced fishermen‚Äù (Andreas Ramos). This follows the principle of contradiction, which states that events and states of being have coexisting opposing parts. Great Wave off Kanagawa The following story demonstrates contradiction and change, and the idea that what starts off as a blessing may actually end up a curse and vice versa. This way of thinking is consistent with na√Øve dialecticism, and as a cultural product from ancient times it gives a glimpse into the roots of traditional East Asian thought. Alternative comparisons =Individualism vs collectivism= The first dimension created to measure cultural differences was individualism-collectivism, which was built with the intention of avoiding one-sided comparisons of ‚Äúus‚Äù vs ‚Äúthem‚Äù. This way of categorizing people has been used for years to explain the differences seen between people in Western vs. Eastern countries, for example what the common beliefs and goals of a culture are. From this perspective, Westerners have made claims that ‚Äúthe Japanese lacked individuality,‚Äù and such claims have been made back by saying that people from Western countries are ‚Äúself- centered‚Äù or ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù. Recent research has shown that this viewpoint does not adequately explain cross-cultural differences and is unsupported by empirical research. Researchers have now shown that this common view of an individual-collective difference between cultures has relied too heavily on casual observations to be accurate. Likewise that converse observations, as well as some historical events, have proven that this viewpoint is outdated and, overall, unsupported. On the other hand, the concept of na√Øve dialecticism is an alternative to the outdated use of individualism- collectivism to explain cultural differences between Western and Eastern countries. Differences seen in the goals and beliefs of East-Asian cultures may be due to the values that they hold as a result of naive dialecticism. For instance, the principle of holism dictates that personal growth is dependent on the environment within which the growth occurs, and that the ‚Äúself‚Äù and the ‚Äúother‚Äù are one. Perhaps this belief is what we once called collectivism, but holism is much more central and universal than the pure concept of collectivism. =Interdependence vs. independence= The interdependence/independence viewpoint for making cultural comparisons is focused on the way people view themselves in relation to others and the world around them. Interdependent cultures tend to define who they are by their in- group relations, whereas independent cultures tend to separate their identities from one another or from the wider groups they may associate with. Generally, Westerners hold autonomy at high value, and maintaining individual integrity is essential for one's self-conception. The distinction between self and group is much more blurred in collectivist cultures. In accordance with social expectations, similarity to the social group and adoption of their organizational scheme and values is characteristic of interpersonal cultures. Modesty of one's achievements is preferred in collectivists because they are motivated to bolster the group, not their own esteem as seen in individualists. This can have an interesting interplay with na√Øve dialecticism. For example, although East Asians are generally more interpersonal, and thus may be expected to favor their in-group, they are also dialectical and understand things as balanced in contradiction. East Asians actually have a more negative view of their own in-groups compared to European Americans, simply because they consider both positive and negative aspects rather than emphasizing the positives only. This is a good example of how flexible na√Øve dialecticism can be when competing with other cultural tendencies.

In 2005 he became a Canadian citizen. He is a fugitive wanted by the judicial authorities of Islamic Republic of Iran. As of October 2016, Khavari was wanted by Interpol. He was chairman of Bank Melli Iran until September 2011 and chairman of Bank Sepah‚Äôs board of directors from December 2003 until at least March 2005.  Early life and education Mahmoud Reza Khavari was born in the city of Khorramabad in western Iran. He obtained a Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Tehran and a master's degree from Shahid Beheshti University.http://alef.ir/vdcj8xe8tuqevyz.fsfu.html?214023 Career After graduation Khavari was hired by the Bank of Industry and Mine (Sanat-o-Madan) as the head of its complaints department. He was then selected to the board of directors of Sepah Bank in Rafsanjani's government and became the head of Sepah Bank during Khatami's presidency. In 2010 he was appointed by Ahmadinejad's government as the chairman of the board and managing director of Bank Melli Iran, the largest bank in Iran.http://www.parsine.com/fa/pages/?cid=49210 During his inauguration, Shamseddin Hosseini, minister of economic affairs and finance in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government described Khavari as a wise and pious man and told the reporters that the highest level scrutiny was employed in his appointment.http://www.bmi.ir/fa/shownews.aspx?nwsid=3124 Khavari has not obtained a PhD but has often referred to himself as Dr. Khavari in official Bank Melli Iran communications.http://www.bmi.ir/Fa/shownews.aspx?nwsId=3325  2011 Iranian embezzlement scandal  In 2011, Khavari resigned from his position at Bank Melli amid allegations of being involved in the Iranian embezzlement scandal of roughly 2.6 billion dollars. The scandal involved using forged documents to fraudulently buy assets that included major state- owned companies; Bank Melli, which Khavari led as its chairman of the board and managing director, was accused of facilitating fraudulent payments. Khavari shortly after went to United Kingdom in order to attend a meeting at Lloyd Bank and announced his resignation by faxing it to Iranian officials on Tuesday, September 27, 2011. In his resignation letter, Khavari implicated another bank as the source of the fraud and claimed that he was resigning in order \\"to respect public opinion,\\" according to Bloomberg. At the end of September, 2011 he moved to Canada, where he has citizenship. Toronto property records in Khavari‚Äôs name date to 2001, when he took out a mortgage for a $615,000 property on Elmwood Ave., in North York. At one time, Khavari owned a Toronto-based company called Soaring Properties. In attempts to protect his capital from seizure, Khavari invested in Toronto real estate by giving money to his sons, Khashayar and Ardavan. He also signed his 3-million dollar house in Bridle Path, Toronto over to his daughter, Parandis Khavari, and transferred their other two houses to be in Mrs. Khavaris name only. Despite numerous requests from Iranian police, Canadian authorities did not extradite Khavari. He may face the death penalty if convicted by the judicial system of Iran. On October 31, 2011, House of Commons of Canada member Irwin Cotler called for investigation on how he became a Canadian citizen. In 2016 Bloomberg reported that Khavari and his sons have been active in Toronto real estate market even after the scandal and from 2012 to 2016 the family has purchased at least $12.1-million worth of properties under various names and legal entities. Additionally they are responsible for roughly $11-million from 10 different mortgages. Many of the companies and institutions that Khavari has been associated with such as Bank Sepah and later Bank Melli have been sanctioned by the UN security council and the international community since 2007. UN Security Council blacklisted Bank Sepah under resolution 1747 and placed restrictions on Melli under resolution 1803. According to security expert, Avi Jorisch, Khavari is in violation of the Special Economic Measures (Iran) Regulations for having worked and provided financial services on behalf of a designated Canadian entity. Khavari is also in violation of Canada‚Äôs Anti-Terrorism Act, along with Part II.1 of the Criminal Code (Section 83.05). Furthermore, under Section 83.05, Canadian authorities have the right to freeze Khavari‚Äôs assets. However, as of 2016 Khavari has not been subjected to any asset freeze or investigation by the Canadian authorities.http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2016/2016onsc101/2016onsc101.html?resultIndex=1  Whereabouts  In February 2014, the head of the Interpol Office of Iranian police said \\"a few days ago, the Canadian Interpol claimed in a phone contact that he has escaped to a Latin American or Caribbean country but that they couldn't verify the escape yet, and this is the latest piece of information provided by the Canadian police to us\\". He dismissed the report on his escape from Canada\\". In March 2015, the same official announced that his hiding place had been discovered and Canadian authorities were referring his case to Canadian judiciary. The New York Times reported that Canada, has chosen not to extradite him to Iran since the two countries do not have a bilateral extradition agreement in place.

History The rivalry can be separated into distinct eras, the first two being Minnesota's glory days, followed by Nebraska's rise to prominence. These match-ups took place when the schools were non-conference rivals, facing each other on a semi-regular basis from 1900 to 1974, then on a more intermittent basis until 1990. The Big Ten era started in 2011, when Nebraska joined the conference and played in the Legends Division (now the West Division) with Minnesota. The trophy era began in 2014 with the creation of the $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy. Minnesota leads the series 32‚Äì25‚Äì2. From 1900 to 1960, they went 29‚Äì6‚Äì2. Minnesota gave Nebraska their worst home loss ever with a 61‚Äì7 win in 1945. However, since 1960, Nebraska has gone 19‚Äì4 against Minnesota, winning 16 straight from 1963 to 2012, with an average margin of victory over 30 points. =1983= On September 17, 1983, No. 1 Nebraska, coming off a 44‚Äì7 week one win over No. 4 Penn State, traveled to Minneapolis. Nebraska racked up 790 yards of offense, nearly 600 of them rushing, en route to an 84‚Äì13 win over the Gophers, the worst loss in Minnesota history. Nebraska wide receiver Irving Fryar, who would go on to be the top pick in the 1984 NFL Draft, managed 230 yards of offense on five touches (three carries for 92 yards; two receptions for 138 yards). Future Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier carried 15 times for 196 yards and three touchdowns. Nebraska's entire 60-man travel roster had entered the game before the end of the third quarter. The Cornhuskers would go on to set the all-time NCAA scoring record, while the Gophers lost their final ten games and finished 1‚Äì10. =$5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy= The origin of the $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy is rooted in November 2014 banter between the Twitter accounts for Minnesota mascot Goldy Gopher and \\"Faux Pelini\\", a parody account of then- Nebraska head coach Bo Pelini.Nebraska vs. Minnesota: Faux Pelini and Goldy Gopher Create A Trophy, The Daily Gopher, November 21, 2014, accessed April 29, 2015. Goldy suggested a wager on the game with this tweet: \\"Hey @FauxPelini, how about a friendly wager for this weekend's game? Team that gets the most points gets a conference win? Seem fair?\\" Faux Pelini responded \\"OK how about if we [Nebraska] win you give me $5, if you [Minnesota] win I get to smash a wooden chair over your back\\". This prompted Goldy to start crowdsourcing Twitter followers and Reddit's college football community to design the \\"$5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy\\".The Internet made a Minnesota- Nebraska rivalry trophy actually worth caring about, SB Nation, November 23, 2014, accessed April 29, 2015. Many designs were quickly presented and eventually Goldy created a real trophy, which was brought to the 2014 game in Lincoln. Minnesota won 28‚Äì24 to take the trophy, their first victory in Lincoln since 1960; it also gave Minnesota their first winning streak against Nebraska since their 3-game streak from 1951 to 1954. It received widespread acceptance from both fanbases, but it has been rejected by both universities. It has been taken to Minnesota spirit events by fans, but it is not an official trophy like the Floyd of Rosedale trophy and the Little Brown Jug.The Big Ten's favorite rivalry trophy made an appearance tonight... accessed April 29, 2015. The trophy changed hands for the first time on October 17, 2015, after Nebraska defeated Minnesota 48‚Äì25 in Minneapolis. Although Nebraska distanced itself from the trophy, in the weeks following the Cornhuskers' 2015 victory, the chair was seen with players and coaches, and made several appearances on the school's social media pages. In 2016, after Nebraska defeated Minnesota in Lincoln, the trophy seemingly disappeared. Inquiries to the Nebraska and Minnesota athletic departments revealed that neither school formally recognized the trophy in the first place. This essentially ended the $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy in any major capacity. Alt URL On September 12, 2017, it was announced, via Twitter, that Nebraska and Minnesota will once again play for the $5 Bits of Broken Chair, likely as an unofficial trophy game. Following an initial Reddit post where Huskers fans brainstormed ideas to keep the trophy alive, a new trophy was built. The trophy will serve as the focal point of fundraisers for Nebraska's Team Jack Foundation and Minnesota's Masonic Children's Hospital. The image of Faux Pelini on the $5 bill has been replaced with Herbie Husker. The other $5 bill still bears a picture of Goldy Gopher.

She was one of the leading fillies of her generation in the United States, winning 11 of her 22 races between April 2001 and November 2003, earning over $2 million. She recorded Grade I victories in the Ashland Stakes and consecutive editions of the Spinster Stakes, and also won the Alcibiades Stakes, Silverbulletday Stakes, Fair Grounds Oaks, Dogwood Stakes and Arlington Matron Stakes. After her retirement from racing she became a successful broodmare, producing the Grade I winners Take Charge Indy, winner of the 2012 Florida Derby and Will Take Charge, 2013 Champion Three- Year-Old Male Horse. In addition, her first foal Charming is the dam of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner Take Charge Brandi. Background Take Charge Lady is a bay mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by William Schettine, the owner of the Florida-based Signature Stallions stud. During her racing career she was described a being \\"lean\\" and \\"lanky\\" in appearance. She was sired by Dehere, the American Champion two-year-old colt of 1993 whose other progeny included Defier (George Main Stakes) and Graeme Hall (Jim Dandy Stakes). Take Charge Lady's dam Felicita, was an unraced daughter of the American Champion Sprint Horse Rubiano. As a yearling, the filly was consigned by Bluewater Sales to the Fasig-Tipton sale and was bought for $175,000 by the trainer Kenneth McPeek, acting as an agent. She entered the ownership of Jerry and Faye Bach's Select Stable and was trained during her racing career by McPeek. Racing career =2001: two-year-old season= Take Charge Lady was ridden in most of her early races by Tony D'Amico. The filly made her debut by winning a maiden race at Keeneland in April, but was then off the track for almost five months before returning to win an allowance race over one mile at Turfway Park in September. Four weeks later Take Charge Lady was moved up in class distance and started at odds of 5.8/1 for the Grade II Alcibiades Stakes over eight and a half furlong at Keeneland. D'Amico tracked the favorite Never Out before sending his mount into the lead early in the stretch and winning by a length. McPeek described the winner as \\"just class top to bottom... she's very, very, very special\\", before adding \\"I'm just trying to keep from messing her up\\". Take Charge Lady was stepped up again on 27 October for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Belmont Park and was made the 11/1 fourth choice in the betting behind the Frizette Stakes winner You, Bella Bellucci and Habibti. She disputed the lead in the early stages but faded in the second half of the race and finished sixth of the nine runner behind Tempera. On her final appearance of the season, the filly started favorite for the Grade II Golden Rod Stakes at Churchill Downs but was beaten four and a half lengths by the Carl Nafzger-trained Belterra, to whom she was conceding five pounds. =2002: three-year-old season= Take Charge Lady began her second season with two races at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. Jon Court took over the ride from D'Amico when the filly made her seasonal debut in the Grade III Silverbulletday Stakes over one and one sixteenth of a mile on February 16. Starting the 1.6/1 favorite, she led from the start and drew away from her four opponents to win by eight and a half lengths from Charmed Gift. Her winning time of 1:42.09 equaled the track record. Take Charge Lady was reunited with D'Amico and started 1/2 favorite for the Grade II Fair Grounds Oaks over the same distance three weeks later. Racing on a sloppy track, she took the lead soon after the start and accelerated clear in the stretch to win by five length from Lake Lady. Following the race D'Amico said that the winner was \\"turning into something extraordinary\\" whilst owner Jerry Bach was jubilant after winning the Louisiana Derby with Repent earlier on the card. On April 6 the filly was moved back into Grade I class and faced a rematch with Belterra in the Ashland Stakes (a trial race for the Kentucky Oaks) at Keeneland. She recovered from being bumped at the start to overtake Colonial Glitter at half-distance, went clear of the field entering the stretch, and won by four and a quarter lengths from Take the Cake, with Belterra a further two and a half lengths back in third place. The filly's success gave D'Amico his first at Grade I level and gave him compensation for losing the rides on the Kentucky Derby contenders Repent and Harlan's Holiday. He commented; \\"This is just a remarkable day for me. It takes a lot of the pain away\\". McPeek considered running the filly against colts in the Kentucky Derby, but opted instead to contest the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs on May 3. Take Charge Lady started the 1.6/1 favorite ahead You, Imperial Gesture (winner of the UAE Oaks) and Habibti in a nine-runner field. She took the lead soon after the start and went two lengths clear of her opponents in the straight but was caught a hundred yards from the finish and beaten one and a quarter lengths by the 20/1 outsider Farda Amiga. After being ruled out of the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes by a lung infection, the filly was then dropped in class for the Grade III Dogwood Stakes at the same course three weeks later. Starting the 0.3/1 favorite, she raced in second place behind French Satin before taking the lead entering the second turn, going three lengths clear before being eased down to win by one and three quarter lengths from Charmed Gift. Immediately after the race McPeek expressed his opinion that the filly was capable of winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff and the Eclipse Award. Plans to run Take Charge Lady in the Mother Goose Stakes were abandoned after McPeek became concerned by the filly's condition. He explained that she had she had not been eating well and that blood tests had shown her to be \\"a touch dehydrated\\". After a break of three and a half months, Take Charge Lady returned in September in the Grade I Gazelle Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont Park in which she was ridden for the first time by Edgar Prado who became her regular jockey. Carrying top weight of 121 pounds, she tracked the wire-to-wire winner Imperial Gesture throughout the race before finishing second, two and a half lengths behind the winner, but six lengths clear of the favorite Bella Bellucci in third. Take Charge Lady was then matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Spinster Stakes at Keeneland on October 6. She started 11/10 favorite against opponents including You, Dancethruthedawn (Go For Wand Handicap) and Victory Ride (Test Stakes). Prado restrained the filly on the inside rail before moving up on the final turn to take the lead from You and took a clear advantage in the stretch to win by two and a half lengths from her fellow three-year-old with the five-year-old Chilean mare Printemps in third. Prado said that the winner \\"took off like a rocket\\", whilst You's jockey Kent Desormeaux admitted that Take Charge Lady was \\"just too good\\". At Arlington Park twenty days later, the filly started second favorite for the nineteenth running of the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Drawn on the outside of the eight-runner field she raced in third place but tired in the closing stages to finish sixth behind the favorite Azeri beaten more than thirteen lengths by the winner. She was later found to have been suffering from another lung infection. On November 28 she started odds-on favorite under top weight of 122 pounds for the Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs but was beaten one and quarter lengths by Allamerican Bertie. Take Charge Lady ended her season in the ungraded NTRA Great State Challenge Distaff Invitational Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park in Texas. Starting at odds of 1/10 she led from the start and won easily by three and a half lengths from three opponents. =2003: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Take Charge Lady was ridden for the first time by Shane Sellers (returning from a long injury layoff) when she contested the Grade I Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn on April 5. She started quickly and led from the start, maintaining her advantage until the final strides when she was overtaken by Azeri and finished second by a head. After a two and a half month break partly necessitated by a training injury at Churchill Downs in May the filly returned in the Grade I Ogden Phipps Handicap at Belmont Park on 21 June in which she was re-united with Prado. As in her previous appearance she set the pace before being overtaken in the straight: on this occasion she was beaten five lengths by the Bobby Frankel-trained Sightseek. A month later she was dropped in class for the Delaware Handicap (then a Grade II race) and finished second for the third time running, beaten six lengths by the Chilean filly Wild Spirit after leading until the last quarter mile. Take Charge Lady began her autumn campaign in the Grade III Arlington Matron Handicap on September 1. Ridden by Sellers she started the 0.3/1 favorite in a six-runner field, conceding at least six pounds to her opponents. After tracking the leader Fly Borboleta she took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win by eleven lengths from Lakenheath. Sellers commented \\"She's something else. She's a joy to ride. She's been the highlight of my comeback.\\" On October 5 at Keeneland, Take Charge Lady attempted to become the fourth horse after Bornastar, Susan's Girl and Bayakoa to win the Spinster Stakes for a second time. She was made the 1/2 favorite ahead of You, and four others including Desert Gold and Printemps: there were no three-year-olds in the six- runner field. After racing just behind the leaders, Prado sent the filly into the lead on the penultimate turn, opened up a clear advantage entering the straight and held off the renewed challenge of You to win by a head, with a gap of four lengths back to Miss Linda in third place. After the race Prado said \\"She got a little tired the last seventy yards but these kind of horses give you everything to the wire. It was a game performance\\". Three weeks later Take Charge Lady made her second bid to win the Breeders' Cup Distaff, which was run that year at Santa Anita Park and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Sightseek, Got Koko and Elloluv. She raced just behind the leaders in the early stages, but dropped away in the second half of the race and finished sixth of the seven runners behind the 40/1 outsider Adoration. Take Charge Lady was reunited with her first jockey, Tony D'Amico, when she made her last track appearance in the Falls River Handicap on November 27. She started odds-on favorite despite carrying top weight of 123 pounds, but tired in the closing stages and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Lead Story. Her retirement was announced on December 2. Jerry Bach commented \\"Take Charge Lady has done more than enough on the track and it's time for her to embark on her new career. She's a very honest filly and has given us one thrill after another\\". Assessment and awards Take Charge Lady was named Top Kentucky- based filly or mare (the Morris Code Award) in both 2002 and 2003. She was the top-earning three-year-old filly in the United States (and the eleventh highest-earnest overall) in 2002 but was beaten to the Eclipse award by Farda Amiga. Take Charge Lady was awarded the title of Kentucky Broodmare of the Year for 2013 at the annual awards for Kentucky-bred horses in April 2014. Breeding record Take Charge Lady began her broodmare career at the Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Kentucky. In November 2004, Take Charge Lady was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $4.2 million by Eaton Sales, acting on behalf of a partnership of Kentucky breeders. Her progeny to date are as follows: *Charming, a chestnut filly, foaled in 2005, sired by Seeking The Gold. Charming, who sold for $3.2 million at Keeneland as a yearling, was trained by Todd Pletcher and raced three times as a three-year-old in 2008. She won on her debut at Keeneland, but sustained a serious injury at Monmouth Park in July and was retired from racing. Charming's foals include Take Charge Brandi and Omaha Beach. *Love Pegasus, a dark bay or brown colt, foaled in 2006, sired by Fusaichi Pegasus. Love Pegasus was exported to race in Europe where he was gelded. He won two minor races at Kempton Park Racecourse in 2009 in a twenty-three race career. *Elarose, a dark bay or brown filly, foaled in 2007, sired by Storm Cat. Elarose raced in the United States but failed to win in nine attempts. *Take Charge Indy, a dark bay or brown colt, foaled in 2009, sired by A.P. Indy. He was sold privately after failing to reach his reserve price at Keeneland. He won the Florida Derby in 2012 and returned from a long injury layoff to win the Alysheba Stakes in 2013 before sustaining a career- ending injury in the Monmouth Cup. He began his stud career at WinStar Farm in 2014. *Will Take Charge, a chestnut colt, foaled in 2010, sired by Unbridled's Song. He was bought for $425,000 at Keeneland by Willis D.

It was released on September 25, 2015, by Roadside Attractions. The drama is set in and around the 1969 Stonewall riots, a violent clash with police that sparked the gay liberation movement in New York City. Plot The drama is a coming-of-age genre film, and centers on fictional Danny Winters, a gay white teenage boy from Indiana, who flees the conservative countryside in the late 1960s and moves to New York City. Shortly before leaving, he is discovered by friends while making love with his boyfriend. His father is upset, and while his mother is ambivalent as she feels for her son, she does not stand up to her husband either. His father then refuses to sign the scholarship application for Columbia University where Danny is supposed to attend. Danny leaves for New York anyway, leaving behind his supportive younger sister Phoebe. After reaching Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, he is befriended by a multiracial group of young, gay, and genderfluid street kids and drag queens, and witnesses police violence against them. Danny goes into the Stonewall Inn accompanied by his friends and is asked for a dance by an older man Trevor, who is a member of the Mattachine Society. Later that night, the police raid the bar and arrest some customers. Danny, who did not get arrested because he was not cross-dressing, picks up his friend Ray at the police station next day. Danny, destitute, then turns to prostitution and is seen disgraced while being fellated by a middle-aged man. Danny then goes to a meeting of the Mattachine Society, which purports to attain gay rights through conforming to society rather than radicalism. There he finds Trevor, and though they differ in opinion, they end up spending the night together. Danny soon finds Trevor with another young man, and, heartbroken, he decides to leave the Village. But immediately after, he is abducted and forcibly sent out to a high-class prostitution business, at the direction of Ed Murphy, who runs the Stonewall Inn. Murphy has colluded with corrupt policemen and exploited homeless gay youth to his own advantage. Danny escapes with the help of Ray and the two go to the bar to confront Murphy. Then the police raid the bar and arrest some customers again. Danny is thrown onto the street as well as the rest of the customers, and, despite Trevor's dissuasion, hurls a brick into one of the bar's windows, screaming \\"Gay power!\\" This instigates the crowd to attack the police, who lock themselves up in the bar in response. One year later, after finishing the first year at the university, Danny returns home and tells his sister that he is going to attend the gay liberation march on Christopher Street. The film ends on the day of the parade where he is marching in the street after reuniting with his friends and discovers his mother and sister on the sidewalk.

It's about these crazy kids in New York, and a country bumpkin who gets into their gang, and at the end they start this riot and change the world.\\" On March 31, 2014, the producers announced it would film in Montreal. =Casting= On April 9, 2014, Irvine joined the cast of the film. On June 3, 2014, Rhys Meyers, Perlman, and King joined the cast. =Filming= Principal photography began on June 3, 2014, in Montreal. Emmerich initially wanted to shoot in New York; however, he changed the venue after finding it too expensive. Release On March 25, 2015, Roadside Attractions acquired distribution rights to the film. In July 2015, Roadside Attractions scheduled the film for a September 25, 2015, release. The film opened to $112,414 with 127 locations, for an \\"abysmal\\" per- theater average of $871. =Critical reception= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 10% rating based on 73 critics and an average score of 3.65/10. The site's consensus states: \\"As an ordinary coming- of-age drama, Stonewall is merely dull and scattered‚Äîbut as an attempt to depict a pivotal moment in American history, it's offensively bad.\\" Metacritic reports that, based on 27 critics, the film has a normalized score of 30 out of 100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Writing for Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson described the film as \\"maddeningly, stultifyingly bungled\\", the script as \\"alarmingly clunky\\" and featuring \\"production design that makes late 1960s Christopher Street look like Sesame Street\\". Lawson faults the director for taking \\"one of the most politically charged periods of the last century\\" and making it into \\"a bland, facile coming-of-age story\\", and says that the role of Marsha P. Johnson was \\"played as comic relief, flatly\\". According to Lawson, the treatment of Johnson is part of a wider lack of respect for non- white and \\"non-butch\\" characters in the movie; he believes they are treated with \\"only a minimal, pat-on-the-head kind of attention\\", showing the riots through a \\"white, bizarrely heteronormative lens\\". In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film \\"does a reasonably good job of evoking the heady mixture of wildness and dread that permeated Greenwich Village street life\\" but that \\"its invention of a generic white knight who prompted the riots by hurling the first brick into a window is tantamount to stealing history from the people who made it\\". Writing for Gawker in a piece entitled \\"There Aren't Enough Bricks in the World to Throw at Roland Emmerich's Appalling Stonewall\\", Rich Juzwiak wrote that the film is \\"formally inconsistent\\" and \\"teaches you about as much about being gay as the Aristocats taught you about being an aristocrat.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote that, while Emmerich \\"has made a movie even less historically accurate than 10,000 BC\\", the most fatal problem of the film is that it \\"embrace[s] every wrong cliche\\", which \\"in the desperate lack of nuance afflict[s] nearly every performance.\\" Maya Stanton wrote in Entertainment Weekly, \\"Roland Emmerich has taken a seminal moment in gay rights history and reduced it to mere background for a coming-of-age story we've seen before ... Emmerich and screenwriter Jon Robin Baitz could have focused on real-life participants (the filmmakers had been accused of whitewashing history since the trailer debuted) or explored any number of themes that would've been more compelling than 'pretty white kid comes out, struggles.' The subject matter deserves better, and so do we.\\" Stonewall veteran Mark Segal, writing for the PBS NewsHour said, > \\"Stonewall is uninterested in any history that doesn‚Äôt revolve around its > white, male, stereotypically attractive protagonist. It almost entirely > leaves out the women who participated in the riots and helped create the Gay > Liberation Front, which included youth, trans people, lesbian separatists > and people from all other parts of the spectrum of our community.\\" Speaking to The Guardian, Stonewall historian David Carter called the film \\"a very lame and inaccurate portrayal.\\" Another Stonewall veteran Thomas Lanigan- Schmidt also denounced the film's lack of accuracy in terms of the characters' choices, its production design, etc., while acknowledging \\"the street kids being the main engine of things\\" and the extent to which the police were violent against homosexuals to be accurate. =Controversy= Prior to release, the promotional trailer was criticized by many for its lack of representation of minorities, who were prominently involved in the historical event, in particular people of color, drag queens, butch lesbians and trans women. Emmerich responded to the controversy, saying, \\"The film is racially and sexually far more diverse than some people appear to think.\\" Irvine, who plays the lead role in the film, denied that key historical figures have been omitted, or whitewashed. \\"To anyone with concerns about the diversity of the #StonewallMovie, I saw the movie for the 1st time last week and can assure you all that it represents almost every race and division of society that was so fundamental to one of the most noteworthy civil rights movements in living history,‚Äù Irvine wrote on his Instagram account. ‚ÄúMarsha P. Johnson is a major part of the movie, and although 1st hand accounts of who threw the 1st brick in the riots vary wildly, it is a fictional black transvestite character, played by the very talented Vladimir Alexis, who pulls out the 1st brick in the riot scene,‚Äù he continued. Responding to the criticism the film itself received, Emmerich said of his casting choice: \\"I didn't make this movie only for gay people, I made it also for straight people... As a director you have to put yourself in your movies, and I'm white and gay.\\" Later in 2015, those who protested the film were listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate Person of the Year. In 2016, Emmerich blamed the film's failure on \\"one voice on the internet who saw a trailer and said, this is whitewashing Stonewall. Stonewall was a white event, let‚Äôs be honest. But nobody wanted to hear that any more.\\"Roland Emmerich: ‚ÄòStonewall Was A White Event, Let‚Äôs Be Honest‚Äô See also * Before Stonewall: The Making of a Gay and Lesbian Community (1984), a documentary of the decades leading up to the Stonewall uprising * Stonewall (1995), another fictional presentation of the events leading up to the riots * After Stonewall (1999), a documentary of the years from Stonewall to century's end * Stonewall Uprising (2010), a documentary presentation using archival footage, photographs, documents and witness statements * List of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender-related films of 2015 * White savior narrative in film * Whitewashing in film References External links  * Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2015 drama films Category:2015 LGBT- related films Category:American drama films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Films directed by Roland Emmerich Category:Films scored by Rob Simonsen Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films shot in Montreal Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:LGBT-related controversies Category:Roadside Attractions films Category:Gay-related films Category:Transgender-related films ","title":"Stonewall (2015 film)"},{"id":"44537670","title":"Aleksandr Krestinin"},{"id":"44537671","text":"John Gatyn (fl. 1385‚Äì1404) of London and Guildford, Surrey, was an English politician, fishmonger and property owner.

She worked as a high school history teacher at Governor Livingston Regional High School and was active in the League of Women Voters before running for office. In 1971, Wilson was elected to the Berkeley Heights, New Jersey Township Committee, the first woman to win local office in that municipality. In the Watergate landslide election of 1973, Wilson ran successfully for a seat in the State Assembly. Running with Arnold D'Ambrosa, they defeated two Republican incumbents, Herbert H. Kiehn and Arthur Manner. Wilson was the top vote-getter and ran more than 6,000 votes ahead of the two Republican Assemblymen. As a freshman legislator, Wilson won a leadership post and served as the Assembly Majority Whip. She sought re-election to a second term in 1975, but was unsuccessful. After D'Ambrosa was caught up in a political scandal, she ran with Rahway Democratic Chairman William A. Wolf; they lost to Republicans Donald DiFrancesco, who would later serve as governor, and William J. Maguire, a former Union County Freeholder. Wilson ran 2,387 votes behind DiFrancesco. Following her loss, Governor Brendan Byrne appointed her to serve as Assistant Commissioner (and later Deputy Commissioner) of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. From 1980 to 1981, she served in the Carter Administration as Associate Director for Recreational Programs at the U.S. Department of the Interior. She returned to the Byrne Administration from 1981 to 1982 as the Deputy Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Industry. Governor James McGreevey appointed her to serve on the New Jersey Pinelands Commission in 2002. In 2005, Governor Richard Codey named her Chairman. (Codey and Wilson were freshman legislators together in 1974.) She was the founder of the Center for Non-Profit Corporations, which is a consulting firm, and a toxic-waste cleanup company. She held that post until 2008. Wilson, who grew up in Burlington and returned there in later years, has also served as Chair of the Burlington City Historic Preservation Commission, as Trustee of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, as Trustee of the Whitesbog Preservation Trust, and as Trustee of Family Service of Burlington.

Jackson served several terms as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from this area. In addition, he served two terms on the Opp City Council from 1952 to 1960; he was a charter member of the Opp Lions Club in 1946, served as president of that organization from 1945 to 1950, and was still an active member at the time of his death; he was a member of the Opp City Board of Education from 1951 to 1952; he served two years as president of the Opp Chamber of Commerce from 1950 to 1951 and from 1962 to 1963; he served as Worshipful Master of Opp Lodge number 605 from 1949 to 1951 (Freemasons). Jackson was well known by the people of this area (Covington County, Alabama), for his many civic endeavors, but he was best known for his efforts to bring about the realization of the lake and state park that is today known as the 'Walter Frank Jackson State Park,' which is located north of Opp on Lightwood Knot Creek.Frank Jackson State Park, Encyclopedia of Alabama The project, through an act of the Alabama Legislature, was named in his honor. Representative Jackson spent tireless hours both during and following his tenure in the legislature lobbying for this project, and through his efforts several million dollars were allocated for this endeavor. Right up to only a few weeks prior to his death Jackson was still making trips, writing letters and making telephone calls all across the United States in an effort to see the project completed. In earlier years Jackson served the city as a businessman in the business of selling and servicing agriculture equipment, and through this work he became widely known to the many farmers and agri- businessmen in this part of the country. During his later years as a representative he did not forget the people in agriculture and he worked hard for passage of bills that were in their best interest. Jackson was born in Wilsonville, Alabama on March 13, 1915 to William and Ida Lee Jackson. He later married Mary Brown and they had three daughters, Judy, Frances, and Sue. Walter Frank Jackson had two sisters, Eunice Wood, and Louise Johnson. He also had five brothers, Terrell Jackson, Speer Jackson, Karl Jackson, Edgar Jackson, and Forrest Jackson of Leeds, Alabama. It was Jackson's dream to bring a major recreational area to the people of Opp and Covington County, Alabama. During his 12-year tenure serving as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, he served under three different governors. In 1966 he was the first citizen of Opp elected to the 40th District, State of Alabama to serve in the Alabama House of Representatives. Walter Frank Jackson moved to Opp in 1945. His professional life in Opp started when he owned and operated Opp Equipment Company. In 1961 he joined Morgan Distributing Company, serving as Vice-President and General Manager. After his retirement in 1972, he continued to serve on Morgan's Board of Directors. Jackson was well known by the people of Opp and the surrounding area, as well as to the State of Alabama. His devotion to Opp was evident in his active civic, public, and business involvement. During his 36 years as a resident of Opp he never forgot the people whom he represented. Jackson's quiet but effective manner of getting things done will live on through the enjoyment of future generations at the Walter Frank Jackson State Park.

The Rahway Democratic Municipal Chairman and the city's Director of Public Works, D'Ambrosa was elected Assemblyman in 1973, the beneficiary of the Watergate scandal that helped Democrats score massive gains in the legislative elections. D'Ambrosa and his running mate, Betty Wilson, defeated two Republican incumbents, Herbert H. Kiehn and Arthur Manner. He took office as an Assemblyman in January 1974. In July, he was arrested. Prosecutors charged him with selling an air conditioner owned by the City of Rahway for $600 and keeping the money. He was also accused of taking a $200 bribe from a contractor, as well as lying to a Grand Jury and misusing city assets (materials and employees) for work on his vacation home in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. He remained in office, but was not a candidate for re-election to a second term in 1975. In January 1976, just before the expiration of his term, he was sentenced to nine months in jail after admitting to charges of embezzlement, bribery, perjury and official misconduct. Rahway also fired him from his Public Works job. After prison, D'Ambrosa relocated to Point Pleasant, where he owns a nautical supply business. He is a Republican and contributes to GOP candidates.

The fortress is composed of a walled enclosure, which houses the heart of the population and the castle proper, and of five exterior towers, separate and strategically placed. History Of Arab origin, the fortress was first under the jurisdiction of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba. Following the collapse of the emirate‚Äôs successor state, the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, and the formation of the taifa kingdoms, the town submitted to the Taifa of Toledo. During its time under Muslim power, the castle served as a defensive stronghold in the midst of internal conflicts. In 1184, Fern√°n Mart√≠nez de Ceballos, military captain under Alfonso VIII of Castile, besieged the fortress for nine months before finally capturing it in the name of his king. He was rewarded with the privilege of taking the name of the town as his surname, which he did, calling himself Mart√≠nez de Alarc√≥n and thus establishing a new lineage. From then on, the Castle of Alarc√≥n received much attention from the successive kings of Castile, who expanded and reinforced it while providing it with its own charter (fuero) and granting it lordship over extensive neighboring territories. Spanish historian Andr√©s Marcos Burriel writes that its domain comprised 63 villages, including Albacete, La Roda, Villarrobledo, Castillo de Garcimu√±oz, Belmonte and many others. All of this was placed under the protection of the Military Order of Santiago by Alfonso VIII. In 1212, the town council of Alarc√≥n sent troops to support the king‚Äôs army in the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. At the start of the 14th century, Ferdinand IV of Castile gave lordship of Alarc√≥n and its castle to Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena. Only a provisional measure in 1297, the appointment was confirmed on March 23, 1305. It was at Alarc√≥n that the prince wrote some of his literary works. After his death, the lordship passed to his son and then to his granddaughter Blanca. It was later recovered by King Peter of Castile and returned to the royal heritage. Henry II of Castile then gave it to Alfonso I of Aragon, whom he named Marquis of Villena in 1372, but Henry III took it back for the Crown in 1395. Finally, in the 15th century, Alarc√≥n was given to Juan Pacheco, Marquis of Villena, on May 23, 1446. Juan and his son sided with Joanna of Castile, a claimant to the throne, against Queen Isabella and her husband King Ferdinand. During this dispute, the marquises managed to hold the castles of Belmonte, Garcimu√±oz, and Alarc√≥n as well as the marquisate of Villena. Following the Middle Ages, the Castle of Alarc√≥n was abandoned and suffered deterioration. In 1712 it belonged to the Marquis of Aguilar, who received a report from master builders insisting on urgent repairs to prevent collapse. In 1720, the castle was governed by Alejandro de Alarc√≥n and Duchess Julia de Alarc√≥n, who harbored many refugees during times of conflict in the country, turning them into heroes of the region. Jos√© Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez de Velasco, 15th Duke of Fr√≠as, sold the castle and ‚Äúfour or five little towers more‚Äù to Rafael L√°zaro √Ålvarez de Torrijos for 20,000 reales on June 5, 1863. In 1963, the Minister for Information and Tourism, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, expropriated it from the family of √Ålvarez Torrijos Torres, native of La Almarcha but with paternal ancestors from Gascas. The castle was then revitalized as a parador hotel and opened to the public on March 25, 1966.

Torre del Homenaje.jpgCastle keep File:Alarc√≥n- TorreAlarconcillo.jpgTorre Alarconcillo File:Alarc√≥n-TorreDelCampo.jpgTorre del Campo Legends The legend of the Castle of Alarc√≥n tells the story of how the stone blocks in the encircling wall were stained with blood, represented today by curious black and reddish spots on the mortar. Long ago, there lived in the castle the lord of all the region. He had a very beautiful sister of marriageable age and desired by many suitors. Among these was the son of a lord from neighboring lands. This young man was notorious for his evil ways, and thus, when he came to ask for the maiden‚Äôs hand in marriage, he was thrown out straightaway. Some time later, the lord of the castle learned that the rejected suitor, deeply resentful, had made plans to murder him and kidnap his sister. And so, when one day a stranger arrived asking to meet with the lord in private, he suspected that the man had been sent as an assassin and took great care in preparing the meeting. In the end, his suspicions were confirmed, and at the very moment when the stranger was about to leap upon him, his servants restrained and killed the assassin. Then, as some construction was being done in the castle, they mixed the corpse in with the mortar that had been prepared for the work.

Although generally regarded as hydrophobic, many petroleum hydrocarbons are soluble in water to a limited extent. This combination often also contains less soluble, higher molecular mass components, and more soluble products of chemical and biological degradation.Harrison G, Lamont N. Simulated Time-based Studies To Evaluate Changes In Crude Oil Composition Through Evaporation And Biodegradation. Wessex Institute of Technology Oil and Hydrocarbon Spill Conference Greece 2002 Toxicity Low molecular mass compounds account for much of the toxic nature of hydrocarbon spills. In particular, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and the xylenes (BTEX) are of great environmental interest due to their availability to organisms. This availability, also influenced by volatility and reactivity, impacts on biodegradation and bioremediation in water and soil environments, with even dissolved components within pore water considered bioavailable.Megharaj M, Ramakrishnan B, Venkateswarlu K, Sethunathan N, Naidu R. Bioremediation approaches for organic pollutants: A critical perspective. Environment International 2011;37(8):1362-1375. Concentration The WAF is found in greatest concentration in close proximity to the bulk phase of hydrocarbons, the progress of which is often limited by physical containment measures such as booms. The dissolved components of petroleum mixtures such as crude oil can become subject to the transport mechanisms of the bulk aqueous phase.Craig R. Soil Mechanics. 6th rev. ed.

Source identification of these can therefore become problematic without the visual indications usually expected with petroleum hydrocarbon spills. However, after relatively short periods of exposure, the chemical profile of the original oils is still largely intact, allowing chemical analysis to provide identification and discriminate between different petroleum sources.Lamont N.

It was released digitally on February 3, 2015 and was released on DVD on February 17, 2015. Plot The film opens with Daphne trying to pass her driver's test and get her license. She is in the Mystery Machine. Velma tells her she can do it, yet despite the encouragements, Daphne crashes the van into a tree. Later she and Velma win a lottery that takes people into space. The two girls soon find themselves going into space along with billionaire Sly Baron, trained astronaut Shannon Lucas, retired astronauts Zip Elvin and Colt Steelcase, alien hunting specialist Ridley, football player Uvininous \\"U-boat\\" Botango, news reporter Clark Sparkman (who instantly takes a fancy to Velma, much to her annoyance) and of course Fred, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. Fred allies himself with Zip and Colt, much to their dismay. Shaggy and Scooby are happy to see U-boat. Shannon tells Daphne that she scored the highest on the space test she and her friends took, much to Velma's surprise. This causes Velma to become bitter towards Daphne. Soon everyone is boarding Sly's ship, the Sly Star One and they blast off into space. Once in space, they meet a robot named H.A.M. whose sense of humor is horrible and dark. After a while, a mysterious alien starts messing with the ship, causing it to land on Sly's space resort, situated on the dark side of the Moon. There they are greeted by Sly's twin brother Hudson and some Sly Bots. Afterwards Scooby and Shaggy go to find some food while their friends go to find the alien. Velma's bitterness towards Daphne increases, causing a rift in their friendship. Fred continues to annoy Zip and Colt. Scooby and Shaggy are briefly chased by the alien and then meet up with U-boat who tells them that when they're scared, they should think of something that doesn't scare them. After a while Fred decides to trap the alien. During the plan to trap the alien, Daphne and Velma still continue to argue and Velma finally says that she wonders what if Daphne is the astronaut. Afterwards, the gang later catches the alien and it is revealed to be Shannon who states that she wanted to convince people on Earth that space travel isn't safe for amateurs and should be left to professionals. She used her alien costume to make that happen and most of the other characters Scooby and his friends had met during the course of the movie to unknowingly go along in her plan. She then realized that with Scooby and his friends abroad, they would prove the alien hoax and foil her scheme and had to make it hard for them to work together. So she reveals that she lied about Daphne getting the highest score, knowing it would put a strain on her and Velma's friendship, and reveals that it was actually Shaggy who got the highest score (much to everyone's--including Velma and Shaggy's--surprise). She traps the heroes behind a wall of glass, telling them she planted explosive devices all over the resort to blow it up. She heads back to the now repaired Sly Star One and get back to Earth alone, leaving the others to their deaths. Ham reveals that he isn't really a robot but a flesh and blood human actor. The gang quickly manage to escape the glass wall and rush into an exact copy of the Sly Star One, built by Hudson. However the tank is broken. Luckily Zip and Colt go to hold it down and they allow Fred to help them, finally accepting him. When the others wonder who will fly the ship, everyone is knocked by pieces of falling metal. Velma tells Daphne she has to fly them home. At first, Daphne protests, but Velma assures her she believes she can do it because she is her best friend. Upon hearing Velma's kind words of encouragement, Daphne manages to get the ship off the ground and fly everyone home. Once home, the heroes confront Shannon and expose her scheme. She is taken to prison. Once Shannon is taken away, Daphne and Velma reconcile. The movie ends with Daphne once again driving the Mystery Machine with all her friends.

Pardo's artwork explores the intersection of contemporary painting, design, sculpture, and architecture. In 2010, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. He lives and works in M√©rida, Mexico. Life and career Pardo was born in Havana but his family relocated to Chicago when he was six. His father worked at a staple factory and his mother was a bookkeeper. He attended the University of Illinois at Chicago, originally to study biology. After taking courses in painting recreationally he was encouraged to change direction by a teacher, and received his BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena,[5] where he was a student of Stephen Prina and Mike Kelley. Works Pardo's work has always dealt with the intersection of sculpture, architecture and construction. Regarding his work, Pardo has stated \\"What I do is shape space and play with history that forms people's sense of expectation.\\" At one of his earliest shows, at Los Angeles gallery Thomas Solomon's Garage (1990), Pardo exhibited handyman tools he had reworked. 4166 Sea View Lane (1998) In 1993, Pardo proposed that he would build his own house as part of an exhibition for LA MoCA, blurring the lines between art and function; \\"a house that is also a sculpture\\". The single story, bent C-shaped redwood structure was completed in 1998, when it opened to the public as a temporary satellite space to MoCA. The house is situated on a steep hillside in Mount Washington, Los Angeles. Structurally, the house is windowless toward Sea View Lane but offers semicircular views of a lush interior garden as well as a view of the Pacific Ocean, weather-permitting, from the dining room. Pardo designed every element in the building - the lamps, furniture, tiles and garden landscaping.https://www.worldcat.org/title/4166-sea-view-lane-a- reader/oclc/698386749 Project (2000-2001) Pardo was commissioned to create an art work for the Dia Art Foundation at 548 W 22nd Street in Chelsea, New York in 2000. His resulting work, Project, functioned in three ways: to redesign the museum lobby, to create a substantial bookshop, and to propose an exhibition for the first-floor gallery, a traditional white cube space. The installation included wardrobe furniture for a patient's room by designer Alvar Aalto, side tables by designer Marcel Breuer, high stools by designer Jasper Morrison, and a full-scale model of a 1994 Volkswagen New Beetle. Pardo preferred to work incrementally, improvising with an agreed-upon framework as the project progressed. The exhibition brochure states: \\"Eschewing finite edges, erasing borders both literal and metaphorical, Project problematizes the interface between art, architecture, and design.\\" Reyes House (2005) In 2005, Pardo was commissioned to design a house for art collectors C√©sar and Mima Reyes in Naguabo, Puerto Rico. Fashioned after 4166 Sea View Lane, the house was designed to take advantage of the location by making the space open to the surrounding Caribbean views. Pardo incorporated concrete, bright orange metal screens, colorful tiling, and a kitchen collaboratively designed with the Reyes themselves. Reyes said of Pardo, \\"Jorge has an incredible sense of space. Some people have a perfect ear for music; he has perfect spatial intelligence.\\" Tecoh (2007) Madrazo Tecoh Project saw Pardo renovate a ruined estate an hour out of M√©rida, Mexico. The site was originally a farm and factory for manufacturing sisal twine, reaching its apex of productivity in the 1920s and '30s. The estate gradually went into disrepair in the postwar years, following the introduction of synthetic fibers. Pardo's refurbishment is founded on the history and aesthetic of the site, calling on local craftspeople for construction assistance. Like 4166 Sea View Lane, Pardo meticulously designed every aspect of the building's structure and interior elements. \\"Every element in Tecoh is laboriously thought over by being designed and redesigned, the formalism of the near-cubist angular surfaces further reinforcing not only the \\"irregular topography\\", but also the ongoing conversation so crucial to Pardo's work.\\". The catalogue for this project consisted of a book of photographs of the site, where Pardo superimposed glowing color fields. Exhibitions Pardo is represented by neugerriemschneider in Berlin, Petzel Gallery in New York and Galerie Gisela Capitain in Cologne. His work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, K21 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein- Westfalen, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami.

The only example flew in 1979. Design and development The GL.02 Pou Ami was a very simple, small, low-powered tandem wing aircraft in the Mignet Pou-du-Ciel style. This was reflected in its name, which also referred to the source of its engine, the Citro√´n Ami 8 car. Its rear wing, a little shorter in span than the forward, upper one, was mounted on top of the rear fuselage. In common with other Pou-type designs, the GL.02 was controlled by changing the incidence of the forward wing. To do this, this wing was mounted high over the fuselage on four co-linear pivot points. Two struts from the upper fuselage longerons rose almost vertically to the inner pivot points and two more, also from those longerons, leaned out to the second pair. The incidence was altered by two links from the control column to the rear of the wing. The fuselage of the Pou Ami was a simple, flat-sided structure. Its engine, a modified modified Citroen Ami 8 motorcar air-cooled flat-twin engine was mounted low in the nose, with its cylinders exposed for cooling. This retained the standard clutch as a torque damper and, because its maximum power was developed around 5,500 r.p.m., was geared down with six intermediate belt drives. As a result, the propeller driveshaft was noticeably higher in the nose than the engine, enclosed under a curved decking that extended back to the open cockpit between the two wings. The small cropped triangular fin began at the rear wing's trailing edge and carried a generous, tall, near-rectangular balanced rudder that extended to the keel. The Pou Ami had a tailwheel undercarriage, with mainwheels on sprung, light alloy cantilever legs. The Pou Ami flew for the first time on 27 October 1978 and gained its Certificate of Airworthiness on 23 July 1979. This was not renewed the following year and the Pou Ami was dismantled.

The church was built between 1370 and 1420 during the reign of Louis I of Brzeg. He built it on the site of a former brick building, mentioned in sources from 1279. The building was financed by the town's inhabitants and the prince. The town's noblemen commissioned the project to Wroc≈Çaw's Master Gunther who had planned churches in Wroc≈Çaw: St. Mary Magdalene Church and St. Elizabeth's Church. Building of the church The church takes the form of a three-aisled basilica with an elongated nave including a division for choir and lateral aisles leading to the main altar. The naves have vaults which are wide and dark. The main nave is separated from the side by pillars and simple linear spans, with lots of interior space. The church has fine decorations carved in wood and stained glass windows. To date, only fragments survive of the original wooden decorations. The woodwork was burnt during the Second World War; the remains can be found in the National Museum in Wroc≈Çaw and in the Museum of the Silesian Piasts in Brzeg. Two of the original stained glass windows are located in the National Museum in Pozna≈Ñ. History of the church In 1523, the town of Brzeg experienced a Reformation. Prince Frederick II introduced the Lutheran religion into the principality. In 1524, the former Franciscan friar Jan of Opava gave his first sermon in the church in the reformist spirit; having gained ducal support, the teachings of Martin Luther were quick to find recognition among most of the people. In 1525, the church of St. Nicholas began to function as a Protestant church, continuing this role until 1945. The walls and pillars of the church are of stone. It has wooden epitaphs of the rich citizens of Brzeg. At the end of the nineteenth century the church towers were extended in response to the heightening of towers in the Holy Cross Church. After the church burned down in late January and February 1945, it was left in disrepair for 13 years (until 1958). In 1958, on the initiative of Father Kazimierz Makarska, it was rebuilt on the basis of the plans from 1370. During the renovation work, late Gothic wall frescoes were discovered in the sacristy. Currently, the church functions as Roman Catholic temple. It is one of the largest Gothic basilicas in Silesia. File:Brzeg, Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈õw.

Pallen is a Research Leader at the Quadram Institute and Professor of Microbial Genomics at the University of East Anglia. In recent years, he has been at the forefront of efforts to apply next-generation sequencing to problems in microbiology and ancient DNA research. Education Pallen was educated in his home town of Wallington in England, attending Wallington High School. He completed an undergraduate degree in medical sciences at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and gained his medical qualification from the London Hospital Medical College. During the mid-1990s, he worked for a PhD under the supervision of Gordon Dougan at Imperial College. During this time, he captained the winning team from Imperial College in the TV quiz show University Challenge,University Challenge winners ‚Äì May 1996 while also writing a series of articles for the British Medical Journal, introducing the medical profession to the Internet. Bacterial Genomics and Metagenomics In 2011, Pallen led a crowdsourced analysis of the genome of the outbreak strain from the 2011 German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak, which had been genome-sequenced on the Ion Torrent platform by the BGI. Around the same time, he also led a project in which an isolate from the 2011 German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak was genome-sequenced on three new benchtop sequencing platforms, benchmarking these new platforms. He has also shown that whole-genome sequencing can be used to track the spread of resistant bacteria and to study the emergence of antimicrobial resistance . Through analyses of fecal samples from the 2011 German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak and sputum samples from The Gambia, Pallen showed that metagenomics can be used as a culture-independent approach to the diagnosis of bacterial infection. He has pioneered the use of metagenomics to open up new avenues in ancient DNA research, recovering 200-year-old Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes from human remains and a medieval Brucella genome sequence. With Vince Gaffney and Robin Allaby, he has applied shotgun metagenomics to sedimentary ancient DNA samples, showing the presence of wheat in the British Isles 2000 years earlier than expected. Public Understanding of Science Pallen is the author of a popular science book, The Rough Guide to Evolution. In the wake of the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, he wrote a review with Nick Matzke, outlining the evidence that the bacterial flagellum is an evolved rather than designed entity. He commissioned and peer-reviewed Baba Brinkman's Rap Guide to Evolution and was responsible for recruiting Alice Roberts to the role of Professor of Public Engagement in Science at the University of Birmingham. In June 2011, Pallen appeared in an episode of Melvin Bragg's In our Time radio programme.In Our Time: The Origins of Infectious Disease In 2014, he shared a platform with Michael Mosley on Medicine and War at the Cheltenham Science Festival. In 2018, Pallen wrote a book on the 1978 smallpox outbreak in the United Kingdom, The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham, which includes a mixture of popular science and a historical narrative of the outbreak and subsequent courtcase.

The club's history goes from its founding, in 1908, up to present day. The team was founded on 25 March 25, 1908 by twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte, led by Margival Mendes Leal and M√°rio Toledo. Since 1915, the club has competed in the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais, which it has won a record 43 times. In 1937, the club won its first title at national level, the Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais. In 1950, Atl√©tico went into a European tour, an important event in the club's history and, at the time, for Brazilian football itself. Since the inception of regular national club competitions in Brazil in 1959, the club has played in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system, throughout most of its history, and has won the competition once, in 1971, finished in second place in four occasions. In the 1970s, it also won the Copa dos Campe√µes Brasileiros in 1978. Having taken part in international club competitions since 1972, the club's first title at that level was the 1992 Copa CONMEBOL, the inaugural edition of the competition, which it also won in 1997. After managerial and financial crisis originated in the 1990s, Atl√©tico experienced relegation for the first and only time in its history in 2005, but returned to the first division in 2007. Since then, the club has won the Copa Libertadores in 2013, and the Recopa Sudamericana and the Copa do Brasil in 2014.  Foundation and early years (1908‚Äì1949)  An√≠bal Machado (front, right), a Brazilian writer, scored Atl√©tico Mineiro's first goal. Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro was founded on March 25, 1908 by twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte. The founding players were: Aleixanor Alves Pereira, Ant√¥nio Antunes Filho, Augusto Soares, Benjamin Moss Filho, Carlos Marciel, Eurico Cat√£o, Hor√°cio Machado, Hugo Francarolli, Humberto Moreira, Jo√£o Barbosa Sobrinho, Jos√© Soares Alves, J√∫lio Menezes Melo, Le√¥nidas Fulg√™ncio, Margival Mendes Leal, M√°rio Hermanson Lott, M√°rio Neves, M√°rio Toledo, Raul Fracarolli and Sinval Moreira. Three other young men were not present in the founding meeting, but are also considered as founders of the club: Francisco Monteiro, Jorge Dias Pena and Mauro Brochado. The founders decided that the club's name would be Athletico Mineiro Foot Ball Club. Atl√©tico's first match was against Sport Club Foot Ball, the biggest and oldest club in Belo Horizonte at the time. The match was played on 21 March 1909, and Atl√©tico won 3‚Äì0; the first goal was scored by An√≠bal Machado. Sport's board demanded that Atl√©tico play a rematch the following week to get revenge, to which Atl√©tico agreed, and won again, this time by 4‚Äì0. Despite having liberal, upper-class students, from an early age the club opened its doors to players from every social class, nationality or ethnicity, which earned it a \\"people's club\\" status in Belo Horizonte and in the state. In 1913, the club officially changed its name from Athletico Mineiro Foot Ball Club to Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro. The following year, in 1914, Atl√©tico won its first championship, the Ta√ßa Bueno Brand√£o, the first competition ever held in the state of Minas Gerais, contested between Atl√©tico, Am√©rica and Yale. In 1915, the club won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais, then organised by the Liga Mineira de Sports Athl√©ticos, which would later become the Federa√ß√£o Mineira de Futebol. Am√©rica won the next ten editions of the Mineiro, and Atl√©tico only won the league again in 1926, led by striker M√°rio de Castro. In 1927, forwards Said and Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking partnership nicknamaed the Trio Maldito (\\"Unholy Trio\\"), which guided Atl√©tico to another state league triumph. The team was headed by Hungarian coach Jen≈ë Medgyessy. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter against Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. The team won 3‚Äì1 in a match played at the Presidente Ant√¥nio Carlos Stadium, which had opened earlier that year and which would be the club's home ground for the following two decades.The Trio Maldito (circled): Said, Jairo and M√°rio de Castro, from left to right. Castro was the first Atl√©tico played to be called up to the Brazilian national team, in 1929, but refused because the Brazilian Football Confederation indicated he was to serve as reserve to another player, with which he disagreed. Together, the Trio Maldito together scored more than 450 goals for Atl√©tico. Atl√©tico won the state league in 1931 and 1932, before becoming a professional club in 1933. After another Campeonato Mineiro triumph in 1936, Atl√©tico won its first title at national level in 1937. This was the 1937 Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais, which was organised by the Federa√ß√£o Brasileira de Foot-Ball, the federation for professional clubs that would later merge into the Brazilian Sports Confederation (CBD). The competition was contested by the 1936 state league champions from Minas Gerais (Atl√©tico), Rio de Janeiro (Fluminense), S√£o Paulo (Portuguesa) and Esp√≠rito Santo (Rio Branco). Atl√©tico defeated the latter 5‚Äì1 in the final match, played at the Ant√¥nio Carlos stadium. The main responsibles for the achievement were Zez√© Proc√≥pio, goalkeeper Kafunga and Guar√°. The title was followed by two more Campeonato Mineiro victories, in 1938 and 1939. The 1937 Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais winning squad. Success continued in the 1940s, with a squad that included Bigode (international in the 1950 FIFA World Cup), Murilo Silva, Carlyle, Lucas Miranda, N√≠vio Gabrich and Kafunga. The club was dominant in the state as it won the league in 1941, 1942, 1946, 1947 and 1949. Although Am√©rica had been Atl√©tico's long-standing adversary, a new rivalry started to develop with Cruzeiro in the 1940s, as it became Galo's main challenger during this period.  European tour and the start of the Mineir√£o era (1950‚Äì1969)  In 1950 the club's home moved from Ant√¥nio Carlos to the newer and larger Est√°dio Independ√™ncia and Atl√©tico had another Campeonato Mineiro triumph. It was also the year of the European tour, an important event in the club's history.The team played a series of friendly football matches in Europe, becoming the first club of Minas Gerais and also the first Brazilian at professional level to compete in the continent. Atl√©tico Mineiro played ten matches from 1 November to 7 December, touring through Germany (where it took part in a Winter Tournament), Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. The team won six matches, lost two and tied the remaining, scoring 24 goals and conceding 18. At a time when neither national competitions in Brazil nor continental in South America exist, and in the wake of the traumatic Maracanazo, the tour and Atl√©tico's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. Upon the return of the club's delegation from the tour, the team was honored by the Brazilian Sports Confederation and received a standing ovation at the Maracan√£ before a Campeonato Carioca match. The team was welcomed by over 50,000 people upon its return to Belo Horizonte, in what was described as an \\"apotheotic\\" celebration in the city streets. Despite not having an unbeaten run, sports media lauded Atl√©tico Mineiro's tour as a historical success for the country's football, which had suffered a major setback with the Maracanazo in the same year, and the results achieved under adverse conditions and snowy grounds led to the dubbing of the team as Campe√µes do Gelo (Portuguese for \\"Ice Champions\\"), a feat remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s with five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956, and another in 1958. In 1959, Atl√©tico took part in the first edition of the Ta√ßa Brasil, an annual nationwide cup competition contested between state league champions, created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores. Between the decades of 1940 and 1960, players of national relevance who played for Atl√©tico included as Bigode (part of the Brazilian squad in the 1950 FIFA World Cup), Carlyle (the first Atl√©tico player to play for the Brazilian national team in 1949), N√≠vio Gabrich, Murilo Silva, Lucas Miranda, Orlando Pingo de Ouro, Paulo Valentim, Mussula, Marcial de Mello and Djalma Dias. In the 1960s, Atl√©tico won the Campeonato Mineiro twice, in 1962 and 1963, but failed to advance to the later stages of the Ta√ßa Brasil. Mineir√£o, Belo Horizonte's new stadium, opened in 1965 and immediately became the club's home. It was in the mid-1960s that the rivalry with Cruzeiro became the biggest in the state, after this club won the first five state leagues of the Mineir√£o era. In 1967, another national-level competition was created by the CBD, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. It included more clubs than the Ta√ßa Brasil, but Atl√©tico did not finish in the top-four in any of its editions in the decade. In the second half of the 1960s, highlights came in the form of friendlies against national sides. In 1968, Atl√©tico, representing the Brazilian national team, defeated European Championship runners-up Yugoslavia 3‚Äì2 at the Mineir√£o. The following year, the Sele√ß√£o itself, which would become champions of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was defeated by Atl√©tico 2‚Äì1.  National success and dominance in Minas Gerais (1970‚Äì1989)  Dad√° Maravilha, here pictured in 2013, was the top goalscorer and led to club to triumph in the 1971 Brasileir√£o. With the arrival of Tel√™ Santana as the club's manager in 1970, Atl√©tico broke Cruzeiro's sequence and won its first state league title in the Mineir√£o, also finishing third in the last Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. In 1971, led by midfielder Oldair and World Cup-winning forward Dad√° Maravilha, the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro. It was the first edition of the competition, also known as the Brasileir√£o, which replaced both the Ta√ßa Brasil and the Roberto Gomes Pedrosa as the new national championship. Atl√©tico played a final group stage against S√£o Paulo and Botafogo, defeating the former 1‚Äì0 at the Mineir√£o and the latter 1‚Äì0 at the Maracan√£. The victory also secured the club's first participation in an official continental competition, the 1972 Copa Libertadores, in which it failed to reach the second round. After four trophyless years, Atl√©tico won the state league again in 1976 and finished third in that year's Campeonato Brasileiro. Starting from 1977, Atl√©tico's youth program formed a golden generation of players, regarded as one of the greatest in the club's history, that would last until the middle of the 1980s. Reinaldo, Toninho Cerezo, √âder, Luisinho, Paulo Isidoro and Jo√£o Leite were central to the team that took Atl√©tico to six consecutive state league victories between 1978 and 1983, and to good results in the S√©rie A. Atl√©tico came second in the 1977 Brasileir√£o, losing to S√£o Paulo on penalties at the Mineir√£o, despite remaining undefeated for the entire season. Reinaldo, the league's top scorer in that season with an average of 1.56 goals per match, was banned from the final. By his account, this was because of his insistence on celebrating his goals by raising his fist, a political symbol which opposed the Brazilian military government of the time. In 1978, Atl√©tico reached the Copa Libertadores semi-finals and won the Copa dos Campe√µes Brasileiros, a tournament organised by the CBD between past winners of the Brasileir√£o. Atl√©tico defeated S√£o Paulo in a penalty shootout in the final.In 1980, Atl√©tico lost in another controversial Brasileir√£o final. Three players were sent off against Flamengo, among them Reinaldo, who received a straight red card after scoring twice. The following year, Atl√©tico was eliminated from Copa Libertadores without losing a match, after having five players sent off in a play-off match. In the match, played at Serra Dourada Stadium, Atl√©tico forward and best player Reinaldo received a straight red card from referee Jos√© Roberto Wright after fouling Flamengo's Zico at 33 minutes, in what was described as a \\"normal\\" foul and \\"without much violence\\". After the foul, Wright then sent off Atl√©tico player √âder for complaining, after which the game was stopped. A turmoil started, in which Atl√©tico's Palhinha and Chic√£o were also sent off, for insulting the referee. Left with seven players, Atl√©tico's goalkeeper Jo√£o Leite simulated an injury at the restart of the match, but Wright refused to stop the game. Atl√©tico defender Osmar then held the ball with his hands, preventing the restart, for which he too was sent off and the match ended at the 37 minute mark, because Atl√©tico had less than seven players on the field. The match ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw, which meant qualification for Flamengo, as it had the best goal difference in the group stage. Atl√©tico tried to appeal to a CONMEBOL court for annulment of the match, unsuccessfully. According to Wright, who until before the match was considered the country's best referee, Reinaldo's foul was indeed \\"normal\\" but he was sent off because of a previous warning. He also stated that √âder, Palhinha and Chic√£o were \\"stickers to indiscipline\\", and that he had to send √âder off as to not lose control of the match. The episode and referee Wright's performance were described by Brazilian and South American media as \\"shameful\\", \\"deplorable\\" and \\"opprobrium\\". Flamengo advanced to the semi- finals and went on to win the competition. During the 1980s, Atl√©tico participated in and won international friendly competitions, such as the Amsterdam Tournament and the Tournoi de Paris. The club had the best statistic league records of the 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1987 Brasileir√£o seasons, but did not win the title, falling in the finals or semi-finals of those editions. In the second half of the decade, the club continued its success in the state, winning the Campeonato Mineiro in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. Atl√©tico was one of Brazil's top sides of the 1980s, providing many players to the Brazilian national team, being dominant at state level and having good performances in the Brasileir√£o, but failed to win the competition due to a tendency to lose in its final knockout stages.  International achievements and financial turmoil (1990‚Äì2009)  Cl√°udio Taffarel won the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL with Atl√©ticoIn the following decade, Atl√©tico won the state league in 1991 and saw success at international level in 1992, when it won the inaugural Copa CONMEBOL, its first official international title, defeating Olimpia in the finals. As champion of that competition, the club took part in the 1993 Copa de Oro, in which it eliminated rivals Cruzeiro in the semi-finals but eventually lost to Boca Juniors. After finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileir√£o, the following year saw the club win the state league and reach the finals of the Copa CONMEBOL for a second time, this one ending in defeat to Rosario Central. In 1996, Atl√©tico participated in the Copa Masters CONMEBOL, a competition between past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL that was played in Cuiab√°; Atl√©tico eliminated Rosario Central in the semi-finals but lost to S√£o Paulo in the final match. The team also finished third in that year's Brasileiro and fourth in the following edition, falling in the semi- finals of both seasons. Another triumph came in the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL, when an Atl√©tico team that included Marques and Cl√°udio Taffarel reached the finals of the competition. Atl√©tico faced an Argentine team in a continental final for the third time, with reigning champion of the competition Lan√∫s as the opponent. Atl√©tico took the lead in the series with a 4‚Äì1 win at La Fortaleza. After the match, Atl√©tico players and staff were trapped in the surrounding wiring and attacked by Lan√∫s players and fans. Atl√©tico head coach Emerson Le√£o had to undergo surgery after being hit in the face. The second leg was played at the Mineir√£o, and this time the team's advantage was secured with a 1‚Äì1 draw, and Atl√©tico won its second international title undefeated. Atl√©tico player Valdir was the top scorer of the competition with seven goals. In 1999, after another Campeonato Mineiro title, an Atl√©tico side led by Marques and Guilherme, the top scorer in the league, reached the S√©rie A finals for the fourth time, but lost to Corinthians. Despite international success and good performances in the S√©rie A, the decade was marked by bad club management by Atl√©tico's presidents and deteriorating finances, which made the club one of the most indebted in Brazilian football. Atl√©tico won the Campeonato Mineiro in 2000, reached the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the national league, the Copa Jo√£o Havelange. The following season, despite a good performance in the Brasileir√£o with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team once again was eliminated in the S√©rie A semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atl√©tico then finished in the upper part of the national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the S√©rie B, the second level of the Brasileir√£o. The club was promoted straight back up as S√©rie B champion in 2006, returning to the S√©rie A for the 2007 season. That year, Atl√©tico won the Campeonato Mineiro, its first trophy in seven years, and finished eighth in the national league. Alexandre Kalil was chosen as the club's new president in 2008, and tried to improve its finances and status. In 2009, with Diego Tardelli in good form, Atl√©tico led the Brasileir√£o for eight of the thirty- eight rounds, before eventually finishing in seventh place. Despite some highlights at the beginning and end of the decade, the 2000s were not a successful period in the club's history, marked once again by bad administration and frequent managerial changes.  National resurgence and international success (2010‚Äìpresent)  Ronaldinho played an important part in the club's resurgence after his arrival in 2012 The team won its 40th Campeonato Mineiro in 2010, but finished 13th in the S√©rie A. After an unsuccessful year in 2011, coming close to relegation, the arrival of Cuca as manager at the end of that season marked the beginning of another successful era for the club. In 2012 the club moved back to the Independ√™ncia as the Mineir√£o was closed for renovation, and won the Campeonato Mineiro undefeated. The arrival of Ronaldinho in the middle of the season was an important event for the club, which eventually finished as runner-up in the S√©rie A and earned a spot in the following year's Copa Libertadores. Gilberto Silva had his breakthrough with Atl√©tico in 2001 and returned to the club to win the 2013 Copa Libertadores2013 saw the return of Tardelli to the club, who joined Ronaldinho, J√¥ and Bernard, and Atl√©tico once again had a strong start with yet another Campeonato Mineiro win and qualification for the knockout stages of Libertadores as the best team of the second stage. An iconic moment for the club happened at the Independ√™ncia, which had been adopted since 2012 as the club's home ground after renovations, in the second leg of the continental competition's quarter-finals against Tijuana. After drawing 2‚Äì2 away and with the score 1‚Äì1 at home, Leonardo Silva fouled a Tijuana player inside the box at the 87th minute, and a penalty was awarded, subsequently saved by Victor with his foot. The save represented to many the kicking out of the club's historic bad luck. In the semi-finals Atl√©tico faced Argentine champion Newell's Old Boys, and lost the first leg 2‚Äì0 in Rosario. In the second leg, Atl√©tico scored in the first-half, and after the match was interrupted because of a failure in the floodlights, made 2‚Äì0 at 90+6, the final score. Atl√©tico advanced after winning 3‚Äì2 on penalties. In the finals Atl√©tico re-encountered Olimpia, after the first continental final the club took part in. As in the semi-finals, Atl√©tico lost the first leg 2‚Äì0 at the Defensores del Chaco, and the second leg was played at the Mineir√£o due to the competition's rules, which demanded a higher capacity stadium. A J√¥ goal in the beginning of the second half and a header by Leonardo Silva at the 87th minute equalised the aggregate, and the match ended with the same score after extra-time. The title was decided by a penalty shootout, which Atl√©tico Mineiro won 4‚Äì3 to claim its first Copa Libertadores title. J√¥ was the top goalscorer in the competition with seven goals, and Victor was selected as the tournament's best goalkeeper. The club's first participation in the FIFA Club World Cup, however, was unsuccessful, as the team failed to reach the finals after losing to Raja Casablanca; Atl√©tico eventually finished in third place after defeating Guangzhou Evergrande. The following year, Atl√©tico won its first Recopa Sudamericana after once again meeting Lan√∫s at a continental final, which finished 4‚Äì3 after extra-time. In the first leg in Lan√∫s, Galo had won 1‚Äì0. At the Mineir√£o, Diego Tardelli scored his hundredth goal for the club at the 6th minute, and Maicosuel scored at the 37th minute. For the granate, the previous year's Copa Sudamericana champions, Ayala, Silva and Acosta scored, the latter at the 90+3 mark. which took the match to extra time. Lan√∫s's players Gustavo G√≥mez at the 102nd minute and Victor Ayala at the 111th minute gave the title away with own goals. In that season's Copa do Brasil quarter-finals against Corinthians and semi-finals against Flamengo, Atl√©tico lost the first leg 2‚Äì0 and conceded first in the second one. The team managed to make 4‚Äì1 comebacks in both stages to advance. Atl√©tico won its first Copa do Brasil defeating rivals Cruzeiro twice in highly anticipated finals, the first at national level to feature both Belo Horizonte clubs. In the end of 2014 Alexandre Kalil's term at the club's presidency ended and Daniel Nepomuceno was elected for the office. The team's successful run in the decade continued with its 43rd state league triumph in 2015, and Nepomuceno announced that Atl√©tico had a four-year project to build a new stadium in Belo Horizonte, with a 45,000 capacity.

Cronica Walliae (full title: Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad annum 1294) is a manuscript of chronological history by Humphrey Llwyd written in 1559. Llwyd translated versions of a medieval text about Wales' history, Brut y Tywysogion, from Welsh and Medieval Latin into English. He also added historical material from Matthew Paris and Nicholas Trivet, as well as from other well known historians. It is the first history of Wales written in English and contains material about ancient rulers, with some material based on legends. Llwyd's work gives a history description of Wales that was originally written in the early part of the sixteenth century by Sir John Prise of Brecknockshire, Wales.  History  This manuscript is Llwyd's earliest and largest work. It is his only surviving work, and describes in detail the lives of Welsh nobility from Cadwaladr Fendigaid to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and covers from the mid 7th century to the 14th century. Llwyd says his main source was 'the Welsh Cronicle' implicating Caradoc of Llancarfan of the 12th century. His work is based on three (possibly four) different versions of the Chronicle of Caradoc that generally became known as Brut y Tywysogion or \\"The Brut of the Princes\\"(also known as \\"The Chronicle of the Princes\\"). Llwyd relied heavily on material from the writings of Matthew Paris as he is talked about more than any other historian that he used for reference. Lywyd used much historical material from Matthew Paris's Chronica Majora and Historia Anglorum. According to C.P. Lewis, Llwyd's aim was to show the Welsh had their own history and were an ancient people descended from the Trojans (an idea put forth in the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth). He summed up his work as the perfecte discription of the Countrey as his was in olde tyme and as his is at these dayes to give the idea that it was a historical work. In 1573, David Powel took over the task of preparing Llwyd's manuscript for publication, upon which John Dee had been working before leaving England. Powel expanded Llwyd's work in its scope and detail, with the help of Lord Burghley providing access to some further documents, making his own contributions clear by typographical distinctions. The resulting publication in 1584, The Historie of Cambria, now called Wales, was the first printed history of Wales. The work remained an important source for medieval Welsh history for several centuries thereafter. It is the earliest extant written version of the history. It popularised the legend that Prince Madoc had discovered America in about 1170, a tale used to justify English encroachments on the territory of Spanish America (for example in Richard Hakluyt's Discourse on Western Planting). Dee, in particular, was influenced by Llwyd's claims and advised Queen Elizabeth I to make this new land a British Empire. Llwyd's work was again edited and published by Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt and later again by William Maurice of Cefn-y-braich. These later copies were the basis for the 1697 publication of History of Wales that was augmented and improved by William Wynne the historian. A reprint of Powel's book of Llwyd's work was published in 1811. For centuries, Llwyd's original work had been known to scholars only from five surviving manuscripts. In 2002, University of Wales Press published a version of the original manuscript with the title Cronica Walliae. It was prepared mainly by Professor Ieuan M. Williams, and established from the surviving manuscripts. The book Cronica Walliae (2002) by the University of Wales was published by their History and Law Committee consisting of several scholars.  Description  The 2002 commentary book Cronica Walliae by the University of Wales says the full Latin title of Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad annum 1294 in English translates approximately as Chronicle of Wales as a sequential chronological history record of events of Wales from Prince Cadwalader to the year 1294. It says there are five known manuscript copies of Llwyd's work, none in his personal handwriting. *MS 1 BL, Cotton Caligula MS Avi :To historians that wrote on Llwyd this was the best known text. It is preceded by a colophon done by Sir Robert Cotton, Cronica Walliae a Rege Cadwalader ad(num) 1294 Humfredo Floid authore with gave the title \\"Cronica Walliae\\" that Llwd's text is known by. *MS 2 Bodleian Library, Ashmole MS, 847 :This is a copy of MS 1 above that was done by Robert Glover around 1578.

It has a treatise called \\"Kyfrinach y Beirdd\\" and the note \\"John ap D'd ap R'c toke possetion upon theyrsdaye being the XXjth of Majj the XV yere of the Raying of our queen Elizabeth 1573 in the hande of Ieuan ap Dav' ap Jankyn thys being wyttenessed Gryffythe mechen, John ap Owen, Gryffyth ap holl, Robert ap John Rondell, Thomas Hirllard.\\" The manuscript is complete except for a small part related to Alfred. *MS 5 NLW 23202 B :This manuscript was purchased from the Thomas Fairfax Collection by the National Library of Wales in 1993. It is preceded by a colophon text later than the manuscript itself. It has an intricate signature with text by Powell the original Autograph. The signature says \\"Tho. Powell.\\" There are parts missing, deliberately left out by the copyist, that especially relate to events outside Wales. There are also parts left out related to the church and the papacy. Missing too are sections related to Polydore Vergil and other Welsh links. Because of the missing parts it is not relied on for a Llwyd reference source.  Commentary  The commentary book shows Llwyd starting his chronology of sequential records of Wales with Prince Cadwaladr of the seventh century. The first thing he explains is that he is the last British king to rule Wales, descending from the noble race of Trojans. He explains the devastating plagues that happened during his reign. He explains that the Britons had been ruled by different kings and princes for 1817 years up to Cadwaladr. Llwyd says Cadwaladr went to Rome for 5 years to study different philosophers and that he died in 688 A.D. He then explains in \\"Yvor the sonne of Alan, Ina de Stirpe regia filius Kenredi sorori regis Cadwaladri\\" the next sequence of events that while he was in Rome according to the comanndement received by the angell, he left his son Idwal Iwrch, his sister and his people with Alan, Kinge of litle Bryttayn. Llwyd then explains that the son of Idwal Iwrch Rhodri Molwynog became the ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. He explains in \\"Rodryke the sonne of Idwall the sonne of Cadwalader\\" that Rhodri began his reign in the year 720. Also in this section he details the Battle of Pencon and the Battle of Hehil. Llwyd also talks about the Battle of Carno Mountain in 728 ‚Äì see eighth-century wars. In this section he also talks about the Ecclesiastical History of the English People being finished in 731 that was written by a great clercke that wroote manye woorkes named Bede from Monkwearmouth. He says the priest Bede died in 733 A.D. He then talks about Sw√¶fberht of Essex and Saelred of Essex. He also describes Battle Edge where King √Üthelbald of Mercia was defeated by King Cuthred. Llwyd then talks about King Rhodri Molwynog and that he died in 754 and left his son Cynan Dindaethwy to rule afterwards. Llwyd then goes into the next section \\"Kynan Tindaethwy sonne to Rodryck\\" beginning with the year 755. He details the Battle of Cenn Fabrat (near Seefin Mountain, Co. Limerick) where Dyfynwal the sonne of Teudwr was slain ‚Äì see Cathussach mac Etersc√©lai. Llwyd records that √Üthelbald of Mercia died in the year 757. He explains then that Beornred of Mercia succeed him. He then shows the next important event in 758 when Elfodd, a Welsh bishop both godly and learned induced the standard for determining the date of Easter. Llwyd then details in his historie the events of the year 763. He begins with Offa of Mercia becoming king and Heaberht of Kent made king of West Saxons. He later explains the Battle of Otford that took place in 776. Llwyd then gives specifics for the well known ditch Offa had built. He describes it as a great dyche large and deepe made between Mercia and Powys from sea to sea. In the sixteenth century it was referred to as Clawdh Offa and Offas Diche. The reason he built the ditch was for protection to defend his country frome the incoursions of the Welshemen. Llwyd then spells out the next important event as being in the year of our Lord 800 when Egbert of Wessex (Egbrutus) was made king and the following year Coenwulf of Mercia (Kenewlf) was made king. He says the next important event of history was when Cadell ap Brochfael, the king of Powys, died in 808 and his son Cyngen ap Cadell became the new king. Llwyd notes the next interesting event was a solar eclipse on Christmas Day in 810 and at the same time there was an unusually large death rate of cattle in Wales. He notes also that this was the year that St David's Cathedral was bernt by the West Saxons. Llwyd then records the death of Owain ap Maredudd (Dyfed). He then shows as the next dramatic event in 812 when Deganwy Castle was struck by lightning and destroyed. Llwyd records as events under the section \\"Blethyn ap Kynvyn and Meredith ap Owen\\" that in 1073 Bleddyn ap Cynfyn was traytorouselye and cowardely murdered by Rhys ab Owain after he reigned Wales for 13 years. Under the section \\"Griffith the sonne of Kynan\\" Llwyd records as historical events how peacefully after the death of Trahaearn ap Caradog in 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan ruled Northwales and Rhys ap Tewdwr ruled Southwales. He records the history that led up to this time. One of the events he describes is the murder of William Walcher in 1080. He describes in detail how the Northumbrians killed him and his 100 men that accompanied him. Later in this section Llwyd records the historical event of 1125 when Cadwallon ap Gruffydd killed his maternal uncles to capture the district Dyffryn Clwyd. Under the section \\"Owen Gwyneth sonne to Griffith ap Kynan\\" Llwyd records as sequential historical events how the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan divided up the kingdoms of Wales according to custom after his death in 1137 A.D. Llwyd explains here how Owain Gwynedd is the first to be styled Prince of Wales\\" starting in 1137 and that the name \\"king\\" is no longer used in British records when referring to the ruler of Wales. Llwyd then describes in his recordings that in the year 1146 Cadwallon ap Madog captured his younger brother Einion Clud and turned him over to King Owain Gwynedd, who in turn handed him over to Henry II to be imprisoned at Winchester. He then explains how Madog soon escapes and goes back to Wales. Llwyd reports also in this section the information that in 1160 Madog ap Maredudd died. Llwyd then chronicles that in 1165 Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd destroyed Tegeingl, which at the time belonged to King Henry, and he took all the people and their possessions to the Valley of Clwyd. He then describes the 1169 death of Owain Gwynedd after controlling north Wales for 32 years. The next sequence of events he details gives an accounting of the turmoil this caused among his many children over the inheritance. He follows this up in the next section of the events that happened in the 1170s. In the section \\"David the sonne of Owen Gwynedh\\" Llwyd wrote that > After the death of Owen his sonnes fill at debade who shulde enherite after > him. For the eldest sonne borne in matrimonye Edward or Erwerth Drwyndwn was > counted unmeete for his maime upon his face. And Howell who toke upon him > all the rulle was a base sonne begoten upon an Irishwoman. Therefore David > gathered all the power he coulde, and came against Howell, and fought with > him and slewe him, and afterward enjoyed quietly the whole lande of > Northwales, his brother Iewerth or Edwards sonne came to age as shall > hereafter appeare. And at this tyme an other of Owen Gwynedhs sonnes, named > Madocke, lefte the lande in contention betwixt his bretherne, and prepared > certaine shippes, with men [and] munition, and sought adventures by the > seas.

For by reason and > order of cosmographie this lande to which Madoc came to, most needs bee > somme part of Nova Hispania, or Florida. And so hit was by Britons longe > afore discovered before eyther Colonus or Americus lead any Hispaniardes > thyther. Peter Roberts noted that according to Dr John Dee \\"the Tudors had inherited a historic claim to the newfound lands in the west, first through King Arthur and then through Prince Madoc. It was Humphrey Lhuyd who, in his ‚ÄòCronica Walliae‚Äô (c. 1559), first publicised the legend that the Welsh prince Madog ab Owain Gwynedd (fl. 1170) had sailed across the Atlantic and discovered America.\\" A return trip to Wales by Madoc and a second trip with a number of ships are additionally detailed by Llwyd. Llwyd describes historical events for the year 1170 saying, But to my hystorie, about the same time e.g., the prearranged marriage of Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile, to King Alfonso VIII of Castile; Owain Cyfeiliog's land grant for the founding of the abbey of Strata Marcella; Richard Strongbow's taking of the towns of Dublin and Waterford with the King of Leinster (and promised marriage to his daughter); and Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd's payments to King Henry II of 300 horses and 4,000 cattle and the 7 October 1170 meeting with King Henry. Llwyd then explains the November 1170 conspiracy to kill Archbishop Thomas Becket which happened then right after Christmas of the same year. He names William de Tracy, Richard le Breton, and Reginald Fitzurse as three of the four knights that did the murder. Llwyd then gives the chronological historical events going from 1171 and going into 1172. He records the events of King Henry II visiting Laugharne in 1172 on his return from Ireland and made peace with Prince Rhys. He then describes the Laugharne Charter that was made between them at this time. Llwyd then records the traytorousely and cowardly 1174 murder of Iorwerth Drwyndwn. He then gives as a summary how Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd in the same year imprisons his brother Rhodri and puts him in shackles to take away his inherited lands. Llwyd then states as the next sequence of events how in 1175 Howell, son of Iorwerth, takes Owen Penkarn (his maternal uncle) prisoner, pokes out his eyes and castrates him. He references this back to the history records of Matthew Paris. Llwyd then explains that in 1176 William II of Sicily married Joan the daughter of King Henry II. Llwyd then notes the records that in 1179 King Henry II of England bought the County of La Marche in France for 6000 of silver and put Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent in charge of it. Llwyd's manuscript contains a report regarding an alleged 1179 discovery at Glastonbury Abbey at the island of Avalon (a.k.a. Island of Apples) of the burial place of King Arthur and his wife. He describes it as located fifteen feet down in the ground in an elder treetrunk coffin with a cross of lead. It is referenced to Matthew Paris as being recorded about 10 years after the discovery. The inscription on the cross was recorded to be :::Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia ‚Äì Powell spelling. :::Hic jacet sepultus inclytus Rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia ‚Äì Williams spelling. :::Here lies buried the renowned King Arthur on the island of Avalon ‚Äì English translation from the Latin. Llwyd details the bones found as mervelouse biggenesse and the probable cause of Arthur's death (a hard blow to the head). He further describes the queen's hair as being blonde. He records that clues to King Arthur's burial location were found because of a poem of a bard that King Henry II heard at Pembroke Castle. Llwyd then in a chronological sequence shows the year 1182 as that when Henry duke of Saxony was exiled from Germany and stayed with King Henry II, his father- in-law, in Normandy. In 1184 is born a son, later to be called William of Winchester, Lord of Luneburg. He also lists 1183 as the year Henry the young King died. Llwyd then tells of the murder of Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath in 1186 and Prince John is sent over to Ireland to take possession of his lands and returns at Christmas. The year 1186 is also the time Llwyd lists as when Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany dies, leaving behind a daughter and a wife pregnant with the future Arthur I, Duke of Brittany. He references these 1180s events back to the historian Matthew Paris. Llwyd then talks about the year 1187 as being the time when Owain Brogyntyn was murdered at Carreg Cennen Castle. This same year Llwyd shows of when Maelgwn ap Rhys for the first time appears in the historical record bringing his power against Tenby and by brute force took the town burning it down. He then shows the next important time as 1189, being the time when Henry II of England died. He explains then his son Richard becomes King of England. This same year Llwyd explains as being when Rhys ap Gruffydd captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. He further explains that this is when Lord Rhys' son Maelgwn is taken prisoner. Llwyd goes on to say this is when Richard I of England was officially made Bishop of Durham and Duke of Normandy. Llwyd then points out that Richard was captured in 1192 near Vienna by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, who turns him over to Henry the Emperor that asked for a 20,000 mark ransom. Llwyd then writes about what historian Nicholas Trivet recorded for the year 1270. He talks about Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Gruffudd ap Madog (1236‚Äì70) Lord of Bromfield. He then ends his manuscript in 1295 with the history of Madog ap Llywelyn and the Battle of Maes Moydog.

She has also been nicknamed \\"Hope\\" and the \\"Little Jane Doe.\\" The victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered and is believed to have been killed by strangulation. She was raped and decapitated. The brutality of the crime has led to national attention. The head of the Jane Doe has never been located, preventing dental examination and the possibility of a traditional facial reconstruction. Discovery On the afternoon of February 28, 1983, two looters entered an abandoned Victorian house at 5635 Clemens Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri; inside, they discovered the headless body of an African- American child in the home's basement. The looters noticed the body after lighting a cigarette, which illuminated it; her body was naked except for a yellow sweater, and had been left lying on her stomach, with the hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope. The victim was initially believed to have been a prostitute until police moved her body and discovered she did not have developed breasts, indicating she had not gone through puberty. Further examination was conducted within the next week. Investigation =Initial findings= It was concluded by law enforcement that the victim was not killed at the location where she was discovered, as no traces of blood were found by the body. This led to law enforcement to believe blood had been drained from her body elsewhere; her stomach was also empty at the time of her death. The Missouri Botanical Garden performed mold tests on her body which determined she had been killed within five days of her discovery. The child had been bound at the wrists with a red nylon cord. Her head had been severed cleanly by a large blade, possibly a carving knife. She was between eight and eleven years old and was prepubescent; she had also been raped. She wore only a yellow, long sleeved V-Neck sweater and two coats of nail polish on her fingers ‚Äì both of them shades of red. Her head has never been found, but the fingerprints, footprints and DNA information have been collected. There were no distinct marks or deformities on her body, except for evidence of spina bifida occulta. She was approximately tall when she was alive. Ten months after her discovery, with no new leads for investigators, she was buried at Washington Park Cemetery on December 2, 1983. The child's sweater had previously been sent by law enforcement to a psychic in Florida who wanted to touch it to receive a psychic impression; however, the sweater was never returned, and is presumed to have been lost in the mail. Four missing girls have been ruled out as the victim, as well as the Northampton County Jane Doe from North Carolina, who was ruled out to be the remaining parts of the body. She was also presumed to have been a victim of Vernon Brown, who had murdered young girls in a similar manner. Brown was executed in 2005 and never confessed to murdering the Jane Doe, despite efforts made by investigators. =2013 exhumation= Authorities decided to exhume the body in 2013 in order to gather more forensic information about the victim. The remains had been misplaced, along with many other bodies in the Washington Park Cemetery, due to the negligence of cemetery records and were not found until mid June. The remains were located by using camera calibration techniques to determine precisely where a photograph of the casket had been taken on the day of the burial. Isotope tests on samples of her bones were undertaken to determine the area the victim would have likely lived based on mineral content in her body. According to an article in the St. Louis Post- Dispatch, the test results concluded the girl was likely to have lived her entire life in one of ten southeastern states: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee, or North or South Carolina. However, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children catalogue entry alternately lists the midwestern‚Äìmidatlantic states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, or West Virginia. After the exhumation, the remains were re-interred at Calvary Cemetery in the Garden of Innocents, a section of the cemetery designated for unidentified decedents.

Maguire was elected to the State Assembly in 1975, running with future Governor Donald DiFrancesco; they defeated incumbent Democrat Betty Wilson and her running mate, William A. Wolf, the Rahway Democratic Municipal Chairman. He was re-elected in 1977. Following the resignation of State Senator Peter J. McDonough in 1979, Maguire ran for the State Senate, but lost a vote of a Republican convention to DiFrancesco. He was re-elected to the Assembly, with future Congressman Bob Franks as his running mate. Maguire's political career came to an end in 1981, when redistricting traded Democratic towns in Union County for solid Republican towns in Essex County. DiFrancesco was facing a primary challenge from an Essex County Republican; to secure the Essex organization line in a district where Republican primary election voters were evenly split between Essex and Union, DiFrancesco agreed to put an Essex Republican on his ticket. John Renna, the Essex Republican Chairman, preferred that Franks (who had worked on Renna's 1977 bid for County Chairman), get the second Assembly seat.

Recent administration has reaffirming Indonesian aspiration to be a global maritime axis. The military history of Indonesia includes the military history of the modern nation of Republic of Indonesia, as well as the military history of the states which preceded and formed it. It encompassed a kaleidoscope of conflicts spanning over a millennia. The ancient and medieval part of it began as tribal warfare began among indigenous populations, and escalated as kingdoms emerged. The modern part is defined by foreign colonial occupations, battles for independence through guerrilla warfare during Indonesian National Revolution, regional conquests and disputes with neighbouring countries, as well as battles between the Republic and separatist factions. Since the formation of the Republic, the military has played significant role in state affairs. However, in Post-Suharto era, the Indonesian military has retreated from politics, yet it still possesses some influences. As an archipelagic nation, historically Indonesia has always been a maritime power since Srivijaya and Majapahit era. The 7th century Srivijayan empire for example, thrived by maximizing the potential of the sea. During its early formation until the Suharto's New Order era, Indonesian military was heavily focused on its land component. However, by the 21st century, its interest has shifted to maritime sphere, as in 2014 President Joko Widodo has expressed a desire to turn Indonesia into a \\"maritime axis\\". Prehistoric warfare Bugis warrior armed with spear and shield, c. 1740s Archaeological findings dating from prehistoric eras have discovered a variety of stone and metal weaponry, such as axes, arrows and spearheads. Usually used for hunting, they also allowed tribes to battle with each other. Some more elaborate bronze pieces, such as axes, seemed better suited for ceremonial purposes, but showed its influence as an icon. Native edged weapons, such as the parang, klewang, mandau, badik, pedang, kujang, golok and kris, were invented early. Tribal warfare, although often motivated by resources, lands and slave grabbing, was also a tribal solution to settling disputes, as well as a component of coming of age rituals (headhunting) for several tribes, primarily the Dayak, Nias and Batak. Warriors from militaristic tribes were appreciated by other factions, and were recruited by developed kingdoms and polities as mercenaries, such as Nias warriors serving as palace guards in the Aceh Sultanate, as well as Ambonese warriors recruited by the Dutch East India Company. Tribal wars still occur amongst Papuan tribes in West Papua, as well as more remote areas of Nusantara, such as the interior of Borneo and Sumatra. Ancient kingdoms Greek and Chinese sources mentioned that the people of the archipelago already building large ships from at least 1st century A.D., the ships could be over 50 m in length and had 4-7 m high freeboard. These ships are called kolandiaphonta by the Greeks and K'un-Lun po by Chinese. As ancient kingdoms began to form in Indonesia, at least as early as 7th century B.C., standing units became increasingly prevalent in the region. Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms saw the establishment of the Hindu Kshatriya caste. Bas reliefs on Javanese temples dating back to the Mataram Kingdom, particularly Borobudur and Prambanan, depict battles and soldiers wielding various types of weapons. These weapons were primarily sharp-edged, such as spears, swords, sabre, klewang, golok, as well as stabbing daggers (seeming predecessors to kris). However, blunt weapons such as the Gada, shields, bows and arrows were also depicted. Major Indonesian empires such as Srivijaya and Majapahit were known to launch naval raids against neighbouring kingdoms. Bas reliefs from their period depict double outriggered ships, now called cadik. These reliefs show that some kingdoms developed navies and even armadas. These ancient kingdoms also developed martial arts for use in self-defence and warfare. They are collectively known today as pencak silat. =Srivijaya and Medang= Many inscriptions were found that mention Srivijayan activity in the 7th century. The Kedukan Bukit inscription is the oldest record of Indonesian military history, and noted a 7th-century Srivijayan siddhayatra expedition led by Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa. He was said to have brought 20,000 troops, including 200 seamen and 1,312 foot soldiers. The Telaga Batu inscription mentions military titles; such as senƒÅpati (general), cƒÅtabhata (soldier), puhƒÅvam (ship captain) and vƒÅsƒ´karana (blacksmith/weapon maker). It revealed that the empire had specialised military units and formal military occupations. The Kota Kapur inscription mentions a Srivijayan naval expedition against Bhumi Java, and is dated to a period coinciding with the fall of the Tarumanagara and Kalingga kingdoms in Java. From the 7th to 9th century, Srivijaya was allied with the Sailendras of Central Java due to intermarriage. Srivijayan leader Maharaja Dharmasetu launched various naval raids against Cham ports in Indochina. The city of Indrapura was temporarily controlled from Palembang in the early 8th century.Munoz, 132 The Srivijayans continued to dominate areas around present-day Cambodia until the Khmer King Jayavarman II, the founder of the Khmer Empire dynasty, severed the Srivijayan link later in the same century.Munoz, 140 In 851 an Arabic merchant named Sulaimaan recorded an event about Javanese Sailendras staging a surprise attack on the Khmers by approaching the capital from the river, after a sea crossing from Java. The young king of Khmer was later punished by the Maharaja, and subsequently the kingdom became a vassal of Sailendra dynasty. In 916 CE, a Javanese kingdom invaded Khmer Empire, using 1000 \\"medium-sized\\" vessels, which results in Javanese victory. The head of Khmer's king then brought to Java. The 10th century Arab account Ajayeb al-Hind (Marvels of India) gives an account of invasion in Africa by people called Wakwak or Waqwaq,Kumar, Ann. (1993). 'Dominion Over Palm and Pine: Early Indonesia‚Äôs Maritime Reach', in Anthony Reid (ed.), Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian Past (Sigapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies), 101-122. probably the Malay people of Srivijaya or Javanese people of Medang kingdom, in 945-946 CE. They arrived in the coast of Tanganyika and Mozambique with 1000 boats and attempted to take the citadel of Qanbaloh, though eventually failed. The reason of the attack is because that place had goods suitable for their country and for China, such as ivory, tortoise shells, panther skins, and ambergris, and also because they wanted black slaves from Bantu people (called Zeng or Zenj by Arabs, Jenggi by Javanese) who were strong and make good slaves. According to Waharu IV inscription (931 AD) and Garaman insription (1053 AD),Nastiti (2003), in Ani Triastanti, 2007, p. 39.Nastiti (2003), in Ani Triastanti, 2007, p. 34. the Medang kingdom and Airlangga's era Kahuripan kingdom (1000-1049 AD) of Java experienced a long prosperity so that it needed a lot of manpower, especially to bring crops, packings, and send them to ports. Black labor was imported from Jenggi (Zanzibar), Pujut (Australia), and Bondan (Papua). According to Naerssen, they arrived in Java by trading (bought by merchants) or being taken prisoner during a war and then made slaves.Kartikaningsih (1992). p. 42, in Ani Triastanti (2007), p. 34. Anjukladang stone steele commemorated the Javanese Medang successful effort to repel Srivijayan attack in 935. In the late 10th century, animosity between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Medang kingdom escalated. The Anjukladang inscription, dated to 937, commemorated the Javanese Medang successful effort to repel Srivijayan attack. In 990 AD, King Dharmawangsa of Medang launched a naval invasion against Srivijaya, and unsuccessfully attempted to capture Palembang. Dharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa to seek protection from China. His diplomatic skills saw him securing Chinese support through appeasement, by building a Buddhist temple to honour the Chinese emperor. In 1006 AD, Srivijaya successfully repelled the Javanese invasion, and in retaliation and alarm, assisted Haji (king) Wurawari of Lwaram to revolt, destroying the Medang palace. With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the Medang capital, Srivijaya collapsed the Medang kingdom. In 1025 Rajendra Chola, the Chola king from Coromandel in South India, launched naval raids on ports of Srivijaya and conquered Kadaram (modern Kedah) from Srivijaya. Further battles with the Chola dynasty marked the decline of Srivijayan military might. =Majapahit= After defeating Srivijaya's successor, the Dharmasraya kingdom, in Sumatra on 1275, the kingdom of Singhasari in Java became the most powerful kingdom in the region. King Kertanegara launched the Pamalayu expedition against Sumatran states and conquered them. Having taken notice of these conquests, the Mongol Yuan dynasty of China demanded tribute to be sent to Kublai Khan's court by Java. Kertanegara responded by insulting and torturing Khan's envoy, and Kublai Khan sent an armada of 1000 ships in retaliation. Meanwhile, Jayakatwang, the ruler of the Gelang-Gelang (Kediri) kingdom, revolted against Kertanegara, killing him and destroying the Singhasari kingdom. Raden Wijaya, the son in law of Kertanegara, led Mongol forces during the Mongol invasion of Java to Jayakatwang to oust him. Raden Wijaya then turned back against Mongol forces, and drove them out to the sea. Raden Wijaya then established the Majapahit kingdom in 1293. Majapahit cetbang cannon from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The 440x440px Gunpowder technology entered Java during the Mongol invasion. During the following years, Majapahit army have begun producing breech-loading cannon known as cetbang. Cetbang can be mounted as fixed or swivel gun, small sized cetbang can be easily installed on small vessels. This gun is used as an anti-personnel weapon, not anti-ship. In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called Balai and perform boarding actions. Loaded with scattershot and fired at close range, the cetbang is very effective at this type of fighting. Majapahit would be plagued by regional rebellions, such as the rebellions of Sadeng and Keta, rebellion of Ranggalawe, and Nambi. After that, under the able and aggressive leader Gajah Mada, Majapahit spread its influence beyond Java and Sumatra, to the rest of the Nusantara archipelago. In 1350 Majapahit launched its largest military expedition, the invasion of Pasai, with 400 large jong and uncountable malangbang and kelulus.Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai, 3: 98: After that, he is tasked by His Majesty to ready all the equipment and all weapons of war to come to that country of Pasai, about four hundred large jongs and other than that much more of malangbang and kelulus. The second largest military expedition, invasion of Singapura in 1398, Majapahit deployed 300 jong with no less than 200,000 men.Sejarah Melayu, 10.4:77: then His Majesty immediately ordered to equip three hundred jong, other than that kelulus, pelang, jongkong in uncountable numbers. During the Majapahit conquest, small breech-loading swivel gun called cetbang is used in naval warfare, against more traditional boarding tactics employed by other kingdom of the archipelago. During the reign of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit was involved in a battle against the royal family of Sunda Kingdom in the Battle of Bubat. However, the Paregreg war of 1404 to 1406 drained the coffers of the Majapahit kingdom, and led to its decline in the following years. Islamic states For centuries, numerous kingdoms rose and fell in the Indonesian archipelago. By the 15th century, Islamic states began to spread their influence, as a number of Sultanates started flourishing in Indonesia. =Mataram Sultanate= The military campaigns Sultan Sultan Agung of Mataram (1613‚Äì1645). During his reign he expanded the Mataram Sultanate throughout Java. In the 17th century, Mataram Sultanate had replaced Demak and previous hegemon Majapahit, as the most powerful kingdom in Java. The reign of able and ambitious Sultan Agung of Mataram marked the apogee of Javanese Mataram martial power. The Sultan launched a series of military expeditions against other polities in Java, such as Pajang, Surabaya, Priangan, and went further by attacking the Dutch East India Company (VOC) fortress in the Siege of Batavia (1628‚Äì29). =Aceh Sultanate= Aceh was one of the earliest Muslim states in the Indonesian archipelago, and they had the ambition to spread Islam as well as their political influence in northern parts of Sumatra. The Sultanate was founded by Ali Mughayat Syah, who began campaigns to extend his control over northern Sumatra in 1520.Ricklefs, 32 His conquests included Deli, Pedir, and Pasai, and he attacked Aru. His son Alauddin al-Kahar (d.1571) extended the domains farther south into Sumatra, but was less successful in his attempts to gain a foothold across the strait, though he made several attacks on both Johor and Malacca,Ricklefs, 33 with the support along with men and firearms from Suleiman the Magnificent's Ottoman Empire. The Aceh sultanate has formed a military alliance with the Ottoman Empire, that sent a relief force of 15 Xebecs. Ottoman guns during the Dutch conquest of Aceh. The Aceh Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire have cooperated militarily as early as the 16th century. Aceh's military ambition reach its peak during the reign of Iskandar Muda. He extended the Sultanate's control over most of Sumatra. He also conquered Pahang, a tin-producing region of the Malayan Peninsula. The strength of his formidable fleet was brought to an end with a disastrous campaign against Malacca in 1629, when the combined Portuguese and Johor forces managed to destroy all his ships and 19,000 troops according to Portuguese account.Ricklefs, 34*D. G. E. Hall, A History of South-east Asia. London: Macmillan, 1955. Aceh forces was not destroyed, however, as Aceh was able to conquer Kedah within the same year and taking many of its citizens to Aceh. In 1871, the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of Sumatra allowed for Dutch control throughout Sumatra in exchange for concessions in the Gold Coast and equal trading rights in northern Aceh. The treaty was tantamount to a declaration of war on Aceh, and the Aceh War followed soon after in 1873.Ricklefs, 144 In 1874 the Sultan abandoned the capital, withdrawing to the hills, while the Dutch announced the annexation of Aceh into Dutch East Indies colonial state. European colonial state Started during the age of exploration in the 16th century, the European kingdoms and empires began to established themselves in Southeast Asia. From Portuguese, Spanish, British to the Dutch, each of them involved in some fierce contests, during the age of European colonialism, to rule Indonesian archipelago. Because of the European's advance military technology, such as gunpowder technology in canons and muskets, many kingdoms and polities in Indonesian archipelago were conquered and subjugated by European power. =Dutch East India Company= Depiction of the Dutch East India Company's conquest of Makassar by Speelman in 1666 to 1669. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was the first multinational corporation in the world VOC at the National Library of the Netherlands (in Dutch) It was a powerful company, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to form military units or militias, wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. The Company in particular, was extremely successful on conquering local Indonesian polities, mostly contributed from European superiority on weaponry and military technology. Start by subjugated Ternate Sultanate in Maluku, wrestled former Portuguese ports by conquering Amboina and Banda islands, acquired port of Jayakarta from Banten Sultanate as they were establishing their headquarter in Batavia (now Jakarta), and the conquest of Makassar in 1669. They went further by weakening the Sultanate of Mataram, and conquered most parts of Java, except the interior of Vorstenlanden Mataram and Banten. By 1800, the company was declared bankrupt and the Dutch nationalised VOC assets and creating the colonial state of Dutch East Indies. =Dutch East Indies= Indigenous troops of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, 1938. The colonial state of Dutch East Indies expanded further as they launched a series of conquest against native kingdoms and sultanates started in the early 19th century to the early 20th century. The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army or the Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (KNIL) was formed on 10 March 1830. It was not part of the Royal Netherlands Army, but a separate military arm specifically formed for service in the Netherlands East Indies. Its establishment coincided with the Dutch ambition to expand colonial rule from the 17th century area of control to the far larger territories comprising the Dutch East Indies seventy years later. The KNIL was involved in many campaigns against indigenous polities and militias in the Indonesian archipelago including the Padri War (1821‚Äì1845), the Java War (1825‚Äì1830), crushing the resistance of Bali in 1849, and the prolonged Aceh War (1873‚Äì1904).Ibrahim, Alfian. \\"Aceh and the Perang Sabil.\\" Indonesian Heritage: Early Modern History. Vol. 3, ed. Anthony Reid, Sian Jay and T. Durairajoo. Singapore: Editions Didier Millet, 2001. p132‚Äì133 In 1894, Lombok and Karangasem were annexed.Vickers, Adrian. (2005) A History of Modern Indonesia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p10‚Äì11 Bali was finally taken under full control through the campaign in 1906 and the final campaign in 1908. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the KNIL launched some conquests on the Indonesian archipelago, and after 1904 the Netherlands East Indies were considered pacified, with no large-scale armed opposition to the Dutch rule. By 1920 the Dutch colonial state has integrated most of Indonesian archipelago within its territory. The Dutch East Indies has become the most precious colony for Dutch crown. World War II Indonesian youth being trained by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The Dutch colonial state was brought into an abrupt end when the Japanese Empire launched some fast and systematic attacks in 1942. The Japanese occupation in Indonesia was part of larger war of the Pacific theatre during World War II. To gain popular support and mobilise Indonesian people in their war effort against the Western Allied force, Japanese occupation forces encouraged Indonesian nationalistic movements and recruiting Indonesian nationalist leaders; Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hajar Dewantara and Kyai Haji Mas Mansyur to rally the people support for mobilisation centre Putera () on 16 April 1943, replaced with Jawa Hokokai on 1 March 1944. Some of these mobilised populations were sent to forced labour as romusha. Japanese military also provided Indonesian youth with military trainings and weapons, including the formation of volunteer army called PETA (Pembela Tanah Air ‚Äì Defenders of the Homeland). The Japanese military trainings for Indonesian youth originally was meant to rally the local's support for the collapsing power of Japanese Empire, but later it has become the significant resource for Republic of Indonesia during Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, and also has leads to the formation of Indonesian National Armed Forces in 1945. Republic of Indonesia =War of independence= Just two days after Japanese Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japanese Empire to the Allied force, the Indonesian Republic was proclaimed by Sukarno and Hatta in Jakarta on 17 August 1945. At first, The Indonesian Army started out as BKR (Badan Keamanan Rakjat ‚Äì People's Security Bureau), which was formed on 29 August 1945, it was created more as a civil defence force than an army. Sukarno speaks with Indonesian soldiers prior to the Battle of Surabaya. The battle saw the birth of the Tentara Keamanan Rakyat, a predecessor of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. However, the Dutch with the help of British forces tried to reestablish the colonial state of Dutch East Indies. Indonesian nationalist republicans fought hard to protect their newly declared independence. The fierce Battle of Surabaya on October to November 1945 saw the birth of Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (TKR ‚Äì People's Security Armed Forces) - predecessor to the current Indonesian National Armed Forces - on 5 October 1945; this was a move taken to formalise, unite, and organise the splintered pockets of independent troopers ('laskar') across Indonesia, ensuing a more professional military approach, to contend with the Netherlands and the Allied invasion forces. In January 1946, TRI (Tentara Republik Indonesia ‚Äì Republic of Indonesia Army) was formed, in a further step to professionalise the army and increase its ability to engage systematically. In June 1947 then, TRI changed its name to TNI (Tentara Nasional Indonesia - Indonesian National Armed Forces) which is a merger between the TRI with the independent paramilitary people's struggle organizations (laskar) across the young republic. On 20 July 1947, the Dutch launched a major military offensive called Operatie Product, with the intent of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as politionele acties (\\"police actions\\") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army. A map of Java following the Renville Agreement in January 1948, with Republican held areas in red, and Dutch held areas in white. The United Nations Security Council brokered the Renville Agreement in an attempt to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; which connected the most advanced Dutch positions.Kahin (2003), p. 29 Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. In February 1948 the Siliwangi Division (35,000 men) of the Republican Army, led by Nasution, marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Division in the Surakarta area. The Battalion, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing Mount Slamet, and the Dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. Dutch forces during Operation Kraai, a Dutch military offensive against Republican forces. The Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 called Operatie Kraai (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, the temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands.Reid (1973), page 153 The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra. Although Dutch forces conquered the towns and cities in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside. Republican troops and militia led by Lt. Colonel (later President) Suharto attacked Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon.Reid (1974) Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00 pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum '1 March General Offensive'). A similar attack against Dutch troops in Surakarta was led by Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi on 7 August the same year. The resilience of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch. The United States pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations. The Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all the territory of the former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; which was retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949. =Securing the Republic= B-25 Mitchell bombers of the Indonesian Air Force. During the 1950s, the bombers were used to combat regional rebellions throughout the country. In the period between the 1949 to 1965, Indonesian national unity faced some dire ordeals, as Indonesian Central Government in Jakarta faced numerous regional rebellions and separatist movements that appeared almost simultaneously. They had established the alternative government and declared separate independent states within the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian Islamic state appeared in 1949, Republic of South Maluku was declared in 1950, while the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia and Permesta rebellions appeared in the same period between 1957 and 1958. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Kartosuwirjo founded his own band of freedom fighters in West Java, called Hizbullah and Sabilillah. As a protest toward the Renville Agreement signed by Indonesian leaders in 1948, which ceded West Java to the Dutch, Kartosuwirjo proclaimed a Darul Islam (\\"Islamic State\\") in West Java on 7 August 1949. Darul Islam did not disband itself after the transfer of sovereignty in 1949, resulting in a clash with the government of the Indonesian Republic. On 25 April 1950, the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) was declared and promptly quashed by Indonesian Republic. The RMS on Ambon was defeated by Indonesian forces in November 1950. The defeat on Ambon resulted in the flight of the self-declared RMS government to the island of Seram, where guerrilla clashes would take place for more than a decade. In 1951, rebels in South Sulawesi led by army deserter Abdul Kahar Muzakkar joined the Darul Islam movement. On 20 September 1953, Daud Beureu'eh declared that Aceh was part of the Islamic State of Indonesia (Negara Islam Indonesia) under the leadership of Kartosuwirjo. In 1957, it was estimated that the Darul Islam controlled one-third of West Java and more than 90% of South Sulawesi and Aceh provinces. The movement had 15,000 armed guerrillas operating under the banner of Tentara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic Army). Indonesian Republic launched some crackdown operations against the Islamist state. Smaller Darul Islam bands operating in Central Java under Amir Fatah was crushed by Colonel Ahmad Yani's Banteng Raiders in 1954‚Äì1957. Amir Fatah was killed in 1954, while Ibnu Hadjar was eventually executed in 1962. Col. Ahmad Yani leading a briefing prior to Operation 17 August, a military operation directed against the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia. On 2 March 1957, the Permesta rebellion was declared by civil and military leaders of East Indonesia, centred in Manado. The movement was led by Colonel Ventje Sumual. In 1958, the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (/PRRI) set up an alternative government in Sumatra to oppose the Indonesian Central Government.Audrey R. Kahin and George McT. Kahin, Subversion as Foreign Policy: The secret Eisenhower and Dulles debacle in Indonesia, p. 143 On 17 February 1958 the Permesta rebels joined forces with the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebels based in Sumatra who had declared a revolutionary government two days earlier.M.C. Ricklefs, A history of modern Indonesia since c.1200, p. 299. Darul Islam forces in South Kalimantan under Ibnu Hadjar were forced to surrender in 1959. Three years of negotiations (1959‚Äì1962) led to a peace agreement that ended the conflict in Aceh, in which Aceh was restored as an autonomous province with special rights for Islamic law. Introduction of effective \\"fence-of-legs\\" method of encircling rebel mountain hideouts in 1959 succeeded in breaking the strong rebel grip over West Java's rural areas. The Central Government launched military operations against PRRI headquarter in Central Sumatra. General Nasution, who was leading the government forces, launched Operasi Pemanggilan Kembali (Operation Call Back) at the end of 1960 to take advantage of internal rifts within the PRRI. The main objective of which was to persuade the army officers supporting the PRRI to surrender themselves. By 1961 PRRI rebellion surrendered.Audrey R. Kahin, Rebellion to Integration: West Sumatra and the Indonesian Polity, p. 226-228. Following successful Central Government attacks on the PRRI based in Sumatra, the conflict swung to the east where the Permesta rebels were based. Central Government forces were able to capture the Permesta capital of Manado at the conclusion of June 1958. However, the Permesta rebels continued their resistance, fighting a guerrilla campaign against central government troops until the last remnants surrendered and were given an amnesty in 1961. In June 1962, Kartosuwirjo, the leader of Darul Islam, was captured on his hideout of Mount Geber near Garut. In captivity, Kartosuwirjo issued order for all his followers to surrender, after which he was quickly tried and executed. The last Darul Islam band in West Java surrendered in August 1962. Successive military operations also crushed the Darul Islam in South Sulawesi. RMS armed struggle continued on the island of Seram until defeated in December 1963. In February 1965, Darul Islam's leader Kahar Muzakkar was killed in a military ambush in the interior of Southeast Sulawesi province, ending the Darul Islam insurgency in Indonesia. The fall of RMS position in Maluku has led to the formation of RMS government in exile in the Netherlands in 1966. =Regional ambition= In the early 1960s, Indonesia has succeeded in maintaining its national unity against regional rebellions, and shifted their attention to Dutch-held West New Guinea. Indonesia argued that as a successor state of Dutch East Indies, West Papua is theirs. Feeling confidence, Indonesia has won Soviet Union's supports to modernise their weapons and military equipment, and soon would embarked on regional military campaigns, first against Dutch to wrestle West New Guinea, then against the formation of Malaysia, and later in the 1970s against Portuguese Timor. In July 1959, the Indonesian government adopted a policy of confrontation against the Dutch to claim West New Guinea and increased military incursions into the island.Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, p.125 Sukarno also developed closer relations with the Soviet Union, which shared Indonesia's anti-colonial outlook. Later that year, the Soviet government decided to supply the warships and other military hardware directly to the Indonesians. Indonesian postage stamp commemorating Yos Sudarso, commander of the West New Guinea campaign. Between 1960 and 1962, Indonesia continued its policy of confrontation against the Netherlands for the control of West New Guinea, combining diplomatic, political, and economic pressure with limited military force.Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, pp.1‚Äì2 The final stage of the Indonesian Confrontation also involved a planned military invasion of the territory. The Indonesians also secured military weapons and political support from the Soviet Union, which induced the United States to intervene in the conflict as a third-party mediator between Indonesia and the Netherlands.Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, pp.122‚Äì35. Throughout 1960, Indonesian armed forces launched several infiltrations into West New Guinea. On 19 December 1961 Indonesian President Sukarno decreed the establishment of the Operation Trikora or Tri Komando Rakyat with the objective of 'liberating' West New Guinea by 1 January 1963.Bilveer Singh, West Irian and the Suharto Presidency, p.86Soedjati Djiwandono, p. 131 During the ensuing Vlakke Hoek incident, one of Indonesian torpedo boats was sunk while the remaining two boats were forced to retreat.Ken Conboy, 'Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces', p. 66. Many Indonesian crew members and embarked marines being killed and 55 survivors taken prisoner. Among the casualties was Commodore Yos Sudarso, the deputy chief of the Indonesian Navy Staff.Wies Platje, p.304. On 24 June 1962, four Indonesian Air Force C-130 Hercules jets dropped 213 paratroopers near Merauke. Throughout the year, a total of 1,200 Indonesian paratroopers and 340 naval infiltrators landed in West New Guinea. By mid-1962, the Indonesian military had begun preparations to launch a full-scale invasion of Dutch New Guinea known as Operation Jayawijaya around August 1962. However, a ceasefire agreement between the Dutch and Indonesians, which facilitated the transfer of West New Guinea to Indonesia control by 1963, was signed on 15 August. As a result, the Indonesian military cancelled Operation Jayawijaya on 17 August 1962.Wies Platje, pp.305‚Äì07. Following the Act of Free Choice plebiscite in 1969, West Papua was formally integrated into the Republic of Indonesia. An Australian Broadcasting Corporation report from 1966, discussing the Indonesian political context of Konfrontasi. In 1963, Indonesia opposed the British decolonisation initiative on the formation of Malaysia, arguing that it was the western imperialist move to block Indonesian influence. This led to an undeclared war popularly called Konfrontasi that took place between 1963 and 1966. This tension was marked by the infiltration of Indonesian forces into Northern Borneo.Easter, \\"Britain and the Confrontation with Indonesia 1960‚Äì1966\\", p. 46 The conflict lasted nearly four years; however, following General Suharto's replacement of Sukarno, Indonesian interest in pursuing the war with Malaysia declined, and combat eased. Peace negotiations were initiated during May 1966 before a final peace agreement was ratified on 11 August 1966.Goldsworthy, \\"Facing North: A Century of Australian Engagement with Asia, p. 342,\\" On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded East Timor under the pretext of anti- colonialism. Operasi Seroja (Operation Lotus) was the largest military operation ever carried out by Indonesia.Indonesia (1977), p. 39.Budiardjo and Liong, p. 22. Following a naval bombardment of Dili, Indonesian seaborne troops landed in the city while simultaneously paratroopers descended.Schwarz (2003), p. 204 641 Indonesian paratroopers jumped into Dili, where they engaged in six-hours combat with FALINTIL gunmen. Indonesia would rule East Timor as its province for 24 years until 1999, when East Timorese vote for independence from Indonesia. =Battling separatism= By 1970s Indonesian Republic facing two main separatist movements in both edges of the archipelagic realm; separatist movement in Aceh on western front, and small scale separatist movement in Papua on eastern front. Insurgents of the Free Aceh Movement during the insurgency in Aceh, 1999. The insurgency lasted from 1976 to 2005. Between 1976 and 2005 in Aceh, there was an insurgency waged by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) aspired for the province to be independent from Indonesia. Previously in the 1950s, Aceh has been a part of similar separatism aspiration, the Darul Islam. On 4 December 1976 Hasan di Tiro, the leader of Free Aceh Movement, declared Acehnese independence. In 1985, di Tiro secured Libyan support for GAM‚Äîtaking advantage of Muammar Gaddafi's policy of supporting nationalist rebellions. Incidents began in 1989 after the return of the Acehnese trainees from Libya. Operations by GAM included weapons raiding, attacks against police and military posts, arsons and targeted assassinations of police and military personnel, government informants and other individuals. The GAM's actions led the Indonesian government to institute repressive measures. The period between 1989 and 1998 became known as the \\"Military Operation Area\\" or Daerah Operasi Militer (DOM) era as the Indonesian military stepped up its counter-insurgency measures. This measure, although tactically successful in destroying GAM as a guerrilla force, alienated the local Acehnese. Shortly the GAM re-establish itself when Indonesian military was almost totally withdrawn from Aceh by order of president Habibie in late 1998.Leonard Sebastian, \\"Realpolitik: Indonesia's Use of Military Force\\", 2006, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Destruction caused by the armed conflicts and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake brought a peace deal and an end to the insurgency. The resulting peace agreement Text of the MOU (PDF format) was signed on 15 August 2005. Under the agreement, Aceh would receive special autonomy under the Republic of Indonesia, and non-Aceh native government troops would be withdrawn from the province in exchange for GAM's disarmament. As part of the agreement, the European Union dispatched 300 monitors. Their mission expired on 15 December 2006, following local elections. In eastern front, despite the official international recognition of West New Guinea absorption into Indonesia in 1969, there is some residual problems that still haunting the province up until this day. This is mostly because previously the Netherlands New Guinea has promoted Papuan nationalism among native population back in the 1950s that inspired their desire to establishing an independence state separated from Indonesia. There is an ongoing low-level conflict between the Indonesian Government and portions of the indigenous populations of West Papua in the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. One of the separatist group, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a militant Papuan- independence organisation, has conducted a low-level guerrilla war against the Indonesian state, targeting the Indonesian military and police, as well as engaging in the kidnapping of both non-Papuan Indonesian settlers and foreigners. Up until this day, most of the West Papuan insurgency were considered as low-level security disturbances and dealt by deploying Indonesian police and military force. =War against terror= After the crack down of Darul Islam in 1962 and the death of most of its leaders in 1965, the Islamist aspiration in Indonesia were seems to be repressed, but not completely eradicated. During and after the rule of Suharto, numbers of Islamist movement has been aspired to establish Islamic state based on sharia and toppled the secular Republican government of Indonesia. Among these organisation, the most notable is Jemaah Islamiyah Islamist terrorist group, that orchestrated series of terror attacks in Indonesia, such as 2000 Christmas Eve bombings, 2002 Bali bombings, 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing, 2004 Australian Embassy bombings, 2005 Bali bombings and 2009 Jakarta bombings. Since then Indonesian Police and authority has been successfully crack down the terrorist-cells and arrested their leaders and masterminds. =International engagements= An Indonesian United Nations peacekeeper teaching a child from Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo how to use a laptop. Since 1956, Indonesia has been participating in United Nations' peacekeepers force drawn from the Indonesian military called Garuda Contingent. It has deployed to three continents. The Garuda Contingent was first deployed to Egypt and Israel in November 1956 as part of the United Nations Emergency Force. The next two contingents were sent to the Congo. The first contingent consisted of 1,074 troops, served from September 1960 to May 1961. The second contingent to the Congo consisted of 3,457 troops, served from 1962 to 1963 and saw one casualty. The Garuda Contingent's fourth and fifth deployments were to Vietnam in 1973 and 1974, towards the end of the Vietnam War. This was followed by a sixth deployment to Egypt after the Yom Kippur War under the command of Colonel Rudini. The Garuda Contingent later returned to Vietnam and Egypt for a seventh and eighth deployment, respectively. After an eight-year hiatus, the Garuda Contingent deployed as part of the United Nations Iran‚ÄìIraq Military Observer Group in 1988, followed by the mission to Somalia and Cambodia in 1992, Mozambique in 1994, Bosnia in 1995,Congo in 2003, and Lebanon in the 2010. =Military role in modern Indonesia= Throughout the history of modern Indonesia, military has maintained an important role in political and social affairs. Numbers of Indonesian prominent figures has military backgrounds. Since the rise of Suharto regime in 1965, the armed forces has been actively involved on supporting the regime. However, after the fall of Suharto regime in 1998, there were some calls to limit the military role in national politics. With the inauguration of the newly elected national parliament in October 2004, the military no longer has a formal political role, although it retains important influence.

Colonization  The story begins with the issuing of French adventurers in the Tortuga Island, which was close to the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. As a result in the late 17th century, the French had de facto control of the island close to the Spanish colony. The wars of Louis XIV of France in Europe finally convinced the Spaniards to give the island to the French under to the Treaty on Ryswick (1697). The French called their new colony Saint-Domingue. And they began transforming the settlement into a large sugar plantation. Later the Frenchmen began to bring large numbers of African slaves to work on plantations, the destruction of the Taino and African imports changed the demographics of St Domingue. By the late 17th century, the French made up 90% of the nation, with more than 1,000 settlers and their descendants (note that Haiti had a European past), but as the number of black people grew faster, they acceded to a mix between French and black people, which resulted in a fast growth of mulattos, although in some cases the mixing occurred two or more times. The French could notice that some mulatto were clearer than others. By the early 18th century, mulattos and slaves started to compose the majority of the colony, blacks continued to be used as slaves for the production of sugar, which was in demand in Western Europe. That made the French put much pressure and cruelty to blacks to speed the production.Historical Boys'Clothing Haitian History: French Colony--Saint Domingo (1697-1791) Retrieved, 28/11/2014. = Haitian massacres and slave revolt = For 1791, the first revolt of slaves and mulattos got up, which consisted blacks demanded their rights, to abandon slavery, and equal skin color, this fault with indignation in Paris and whites in Saint-Domingue the white man lynched blacks and mulattos that fell into their hands, no matter their gender or age. Then another stood up to 1804, this time led by the slaves: Toussaint Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, but this what slaves joined and massacred in a brutal form to whites who lived in the colony, as well as their descendants in that colony.

The township of Aberbechan was transferred to Bettws Cedewain and more recently moved, with the township of Dolforwyn, into the community of Abermule with Llandyssil.English E (ed) 1999 A Collected History of the Communities of Llandyssil, Abermule and Llanmerewig. The Hall was originally built by the Blayney family, passing to the Price and Lloyd families, before becoming the property of Sir Gervais Clifton. In 1810 it was sold to David Pugh of Llanerchydol near Welshpool. The Hall was demolished in 1870 and replaced by the present Hall. Visit of Thomas Pennant Aberbechan Hall 1796 Aberbechan Hall 1796 In 1786, Thomas Pennant, who was staying with Arthur Blayney at Gregynog and they passed Aberbechan when visiting Dolforwyn Castle.Thomas Pennant A Tour in Wales. Bridge Books reprint 1990, Wrexham, Vol 2, 372 Pennant in 1796 commissioned John Ingleby to produce two watercolours of Aberbechan Hall, which presumably he intended to use an illustration in a future edition of the Tour in Wales. These watercolours, which are now in the collections of the National Library of Wales, would appear to be the only surviving depictions of the Hall, which must have been an impressive timber- framed building. The Hall, as shown in Ingleby‚Äôs watercolours is likely to have been built in the earlier years of the 17th century or perhaps slightly earlier. The Hall must have been one of the grandest in the county, and appears to bear much in common with the Herberts‚Äô house at Lymore on the outskirts of Montgomery. Both houses were built in a combination of brick and timber-framing and both have series of triangular roof gables with windows set in them. More striking is the way in which Aberbechan Hall is jettied out on each floor. The brick chimneys are square sectioned, in contrast to the star sectioned chimney stacks seen on earlier timber-framed houses of the area. History of the Hall This was a house that had been built by the senior branch of the Blayney family, but Rhys ap Morris (Blayney) became High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1565, the family name changed to Price (ap Rhys).Morgan P., The Blayney Period in Hughes G T et al (ads) Gregynog, University of Wales Press 1977, 30 The house descended to Sir John Price, who swapped sides in the Civil War and became the Parliamentary Commander of Montgomery Castle. The Hall then passed to his son Sir Richard Price.Lewys Dwnn Heraldic Visitations of Wales and Part of the Marches, Edited by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, Welsh MSS Society, Llandovery 1846, reprinted Bridge Books , Wrexham 2005, Vol I, 283-4 The house passed to the Lloyd family, but in 1766, the heiress Frances Lloyd married Sir Gervais Clifton. This was probably a case of an Englishmen prowling for Welsh heiresses.Humphreys M The Crisis of Community: Montgomeryshire 1680-1815, Univ wales Press, Cardiff, 1996, pg 103 Sir Gervais Clifton 6th.Baronet was a leading Nottinghamshire landowner and is likely to have been an absentee landlord. The house and its estates were later sold in 1810 to David Pugh, a fabulously wealthy London Tea dealer, who was to build the castellated, gothic revival house at Llanerchydol Hall, on the outskirts of Welshpool.

He has also acted as producer on ca 50 albums. In addition to this, he has played ca. 5 000 gigs. Studies Haavisto studied the flute in the Espoo Music Institute during 1968‚Äì73. He also studied musicology and the English language at Helsinki University for five years in the 1970s. Career as a musician Haavisto's first band was Vanha Is√§nt√§, founded in 1973, which the same year won the Finnish championship of pop bands, playing an entirely acoustic set, mainly traditional songs from the British Isles. The band soon oriented itself towards Americana, mainly bluegrass and country music. Now there was a demand for Haavisto's pedal steel guitar. Haavisto bought his first pedal steel guitar in 1976, and played a session with it no less than a fortnight later. The song was called ‚Äú√Ñidin ihmekauha‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Wonderful Soupstone‚Äù, written by Shel Silverstein), sung by Aimo Jaara, with Finnish lyrics by Jukka Virtanen.

Heaton (November 12, 1875-December 6, 1951) was an American architect from Washington, D.C. During his 50-year career Heaton designed over 1,000 commissions, including many notable buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). He was the first supervising architect of the Washington National Cathedral and one of several local architects responsible for designing many of the buildings in the Burleith, Cleveland Park, Kalorama Triangle, and Woodley Park neighborhoods. Early life Arthur Berthrong Heaton was born on November 12, 1875, in Washington, D.C., to Frank and Mabel (n√©e Berthrong) Heaton. After graduating from Central High School in 1892, Heaton apprenticed for architectural firms owned by Marsh and Peter (William J. Marsh and Walter G. Peter), Paul J. Pelz, and Frederick B. Pyle. He later traveled to Europe and visited grand buildings while studying at the University of Paris. In 1897, following his return to Washington, D.C., Heaton and architect George A. Dessez designed 1712-1720 22nd Street NW in Sheridan- Kalorama and two homes on Decatur Street NW. The following year he opened his own architectural office. Career Heaton's practice was very successful and within a few years he had already designed four apartment buildings, including The Augusta and The Highlands (now the Churchill Hotel). He would eventually design 28 apartment buildings between 1900 and 1940. The Altamont, located at 1901 Wyoming Avenue NW, is one of Heaton's prominent apartment designs and a contributing property to the Kalorama Triangle Historic District. Most of the residential buildings he designed were private residences. Heaton is one of the local architects who was responsible for designing many of the homes during Woodley Park's housing boom from 1905-1929\\\\. One of his noted designs in Woodley Park, 2618 31st Street NW, incorporates arches from Henry Adams's house, designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, that was demolished to make room for the Hay‚ÄìAdams Hotel. Heaton also incorporated salvaged elements from Adams' house into the Woodley Park residence at 3014 Woodland Drive NW. He was one of the prominent architects who designed buildings in Kalorama Triangle during that neighborhood's development, and from 1917 to 1932, he provided plans for hundreds of homes in the Burleith neighborhood for the Shannon and Luchs development company. Heaton designed homes for many of Washington's prominent citizens, including Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, the first president of the National Geographic Society, and the widow of Representative Joseph W. Babcock, whose house now serves as the Embassy of Cape Verde. His work was not limited to residential architecture. From 1908 to 1928, Heaton served as the supervising architect on the construction of the Washington National Cathedral. Educational buildings designed by Heaton include Corcoran Hall and Stockton Hall (both with architect Albert Harris) on the campus of George Washington University and Bunker Hill Elementary School (now called the Brookland Education Campus @ Bunker Hill). His surviving commercial designs include the Equitable Bank Building (with architect Frederick B. Pyle), the National Geographic Society's Administration Building, the Riggs National Bank, Washington Loan and Trust Company Branch (1927 addition; now a Courtyard by Marriott hotel), the John Dickson Home for Aged Men (now the Kingsbury Center), and the Park and Shop, believed to be the country's first planned neighborhood shopping center. He was a member of American Institute of Architects from 1901 until his death and named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1941. Following Heaton's death on December 6, 1951, one of his colleagues, Leon Chatelain III, donated almost 10,000 of Heaton's drawings and designs to the Library of Congress. Personal life Heaton and Mabel Williams were married on October 1, 1902, at St. Andrews Episcopal Church (now the John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church) at 14th and Corcoran Streets NW in Logan Circle. The couple had two children, Doris (b. 1906), and James (b. 1911). The family originally lived at 3320 Highland Avenue NW in Cleveland Park, but moved to 4861 Indian Lane NW in Spring Valley, designed by Heaton, in 1928. References External links * Arthur B.

Originally known as The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, the Trust was launched in September 2013 as a project to carry forward the call of the August 2013 Change.org petition to name the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge ‚Äî long known locally simply as \\"the Bay Bridge\\" ‚Äî after Emperor Norton, who set out the original vision for the bridge with three newspaper proclamations published in 1872. Subsequently, the organization has positioned this bridge-naming project within a larger public mission that includes research and documentation; education; and advocacy concerning the full life and legacy of Emperor Norton. The Emperor's Bridge Campaign adopted a new name, The Emperor Norton Trust, in December 2019. Background In June 2013, a group of California state lawmakers introduced a resolution in the California State Assembly to name the Western crossing of the state-owned San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge ‚Äî the section from Yerba Buena Island to San Francisco ‚Äî for former Assembly Speaker and former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown.Wyatt Buchanan, \\"Bay Bridge May Carry Willie Brown's Name,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, June 13, 2013. Several weeks later, on 1 August 2013, writer John Lumea, then living in San Francisco, wrote and published a Change.org petition calling for the entire Bay Bridge, from Oakland to San Francisco, to be named after Emperor Norton, who in 1872 ‚Äî with three proclamations published in the African-American-owned abolitionist weekly The Pacific Appeal ‚Äî called for a bay-spanning suspension bridge linking Oakland to San Francisco via Goat Island, the present-day Yerba Buena Island.\\"Bridge Proclamations,\\" The Emperor Norton Trust. The petition echoed an earlier, 2004 effort in which then-San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors calling for the Bay Bridge to be named after Emperor Norton. Ultimately, the resolution passed by the Board called for only the bridge's new Eastern crossing ‚Äî the \\"Oakland side,\\" then in the early planning stages ‚Äî to be named after Norton. This suggestion was not well received by the Oakland City Council, and the idea went no further. In the six weeks from the launch of the Change.org petition until the final California State Senate vote approving the resolution naming the Bay Bridge's Western crossing for Willie Brown, the petition attracted 3,800 signatures. It also received media coverage from the San Francisco Chronicle,Debra J.

Origins and first year Encouraged by this response, Lumea set up a Facebook group on 26 August 2013 for a potential new organization that he called \\"The Emperor's Bridge Campaign.\\"John Lumea, Post documenting creation of Facebook group for The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, Facebook, 26 August 2013. A launch party for the effort was held on 28 September 2013 at Emperor Norton's Boozeland, an Emperor Norton-themed bar in San Francisco. Over the course of its first year, the Campaign continued to engage in the call to name the Bay Bridge after Emperor Norton.Stuart Schuffman, \\"The Deeper Problem with 'Willie L. Brown, Jr., Bridge, BrokeAssStuart.com, 11 February 2014.\\"The Bridge Name Game\\" in \\"Intelligence\\" roundup, San Francisco Bay Guardian (vol. 48, no 9), 27 November ‚Äì 3 December 2013 issue, p.4. The organization identified a couple of state naming practices that it used to develop a naming approach that it saw as a more politically and financially realistic than a wholesale \\"renaming\\" of the bridge. Specifically, the Campaign observed: (1) while the State of California recognizes \\"Willie L. Brown, Jr., Bridge\\" as the official name for the Bay Bridge's Western crossing, the state also ‚Äî separately and independently ‚Äî continues to recognize the unofficial name \\"San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge\\" for the entire bridge system. (2) There exists the precedent of state-owned bridges for which the State of California recognizes multiple names, either multiple official names or some combination of official and unofficial names.\\"Whys and Hows of Bridge Naming: A Primer\\" (points 8‚Äì9; 11), The Emperor Norton Trust.\\"California State Bridges With Multiple Names, The Emperor Norton Trust.

While The Emperor's Bridge Campaign remained active on the bridge-naming front, it expanded its mission to include historical research and documentation, and public education, about the full life and legacy of Emperor Norton. Via its Web site and social media channels (Facebook and Twitter), as well as in public talks, the Campaign began to document its historical discoveries about Emperor Norton and to highlight art, music, film and other creative efforts that are inspired by him. The Emperor's Bridge Campaign also began to produce public commemorative events to mark and celebrate various aspects of the Emperor Norton story.\\"Raise a Tannenbaum Toast with Emperor Norton,\\" second item in \\"Drink Here Now: Five Places to Sip This Week,\\" 7x7.com, 4 December 2013.Stuart Schuffman, \\"A New Tradition: Toast the Union Square Xmas Tree with Emperor Norton!\\" BrokeAssStuart.com, 5 December 2013.\\"The First Annual Tannenbaum Toast,\\" The Bold Italic, December 2013.\\"The Emperor's Garden Party,\\" The Bold Italic, September 2014.

Research program Since launching the organization in 2013, founder John Lumea has written and published more than 100 research articles on different aspects of Emperor Norton's life and legacy.The Emperor Norton Trust, Original Research & Commentary, Emperor Norton Trust. Lumea's research has garnered particular attention in three areas of general interest: =Emperor Norton's birth date= When Emperor Norton's remains were moved in 1934 from their original resting place at the Masonic cemetery, in San Francisco, to Woodlawn cemetery, in Colma, Calif., a new granite headstone was created that memorializes 1819 as his birth year. Over time, Emperor Norton's grave has become a frequently photographed pilgrimage site, and this has shaped the conventional wisdom about when Norton was born. But, the two later book-length works about Emperor Norton ‚Äî Allen Stanley Lane's Emperor Norton: The Mad Monarch of America (1939) and William Drury's Norton I: Emperor of the United States (1986) ‚Äî maintain that Norton was born in 1818. In late 2014 and early 2015, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign undertook its first large project of original research: an effort to pin down Emperor Norton's precise birth date. At an event in February 2015, Lumea presented the Campaign's case for 4 February 1818 as the most likely date.John Lumea, \\"Joshua Abraham Norton, b. 4 February 1818,\\" Emperor Norton Trust. Based on this research, the Campaign in January‚ÄìMarch 2018 produced Emperor Norton at 200, a 6-week series of talks, exhibits and special events in San Francisco celebrating the Norton bicentennial. In co-producing specific events, the organization was joined by the California Historical Society, the Mechanics' Institute, the San Francisco Public Library and the Society of California Pioneers.Carl Nolte, \\"City to Celebrate Emperor Norton's 200th Birthday, San Francisco Chronicle, 2 February 2018.\\"America's Emperor, San Francisco's Treasure: Who Was Emperor Norton? article and 12-minute podcast, KQED, 1 March 2018.Joe Kukura, \\"The Emperor's Birthday\\", SF Weekly, 1 February 2018.

In March 2020, the Campaign ‚Äî newly renamed The Emperor Norton Trust ‚Äî presented its research to the Library of Congress, which responded by changing its official birth information for Emperor Norton (Joshua Abraham Norton) from \\"1819\\" to \\"1818\\" and specifically to \\"1818-02-04\\", reflecting the specific birth date.\\"Library of Congress & Emperor Norton Trust Update Emperor Norton's Birth Year from 1819 to 1818, The Emperor Norton Trust, 5 March 2020. =Printers of Emperor Norton's bonds= In May 2017, Lumea published an essay on the two printers of the promissory notes that Emperor Norton sold from 1870 until his death in 1880: Cuddy & Hughes and Charles A.

Similar to the Hippocratic Oath, it is a statement of professional values and ethics. The first version of the oath was created in 1938, and the current version of the oath has been in use since 1954. Although taking the oath is not required or legally binding, it is commonly seen as a rite of passage. History The Oath was first developed in 1938 by a committee formed by the Associated Colleges of Osteopathy, headed by Frank E. MacCracken, DO. In 1954, some amendments were adopted to create the current text. Use  In the United States, all osteopathic medical schools administer the Osteopathic Oath, often in the context of a white coat ceremony. The Oath upholds the concepts of confidentiality, evidence-based medicine, and nonmaleficence. It also specifically forbids euthanasia but does not address abortion. In a 2000 survey of United States medical schools, all of the then extant medical schools administered some type of professional oath. Among allopathic schools, sixty-two of one hundred twenty-two used the Hippocratic Oath or a modified version of it. The other sixty schools used the original or modified Declaration of Geneva, Oath of Maimonides, or an oath authored by students and or faculty. All nineteen osteopathic schools used the Osteopathic Oath. Like the Hippocratic Oath and similar professional oaths, the Osteopathic Oath is not legally binding, nor is it required in order to become a practicing physician. However, reciting the Oath is considered an important rite of passage for a new osteopathic physician.

Background Many of these veterans suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, an anxiety disorder that often occurs after extreme emotional trauma involving threat or injury. Causes of homelessness include: * Disabilities - physical injury or mental illness * Substance abuse - drug abuse or alcoholism * Family breakdown * Joblessness and poverty * Lack of low cost housing * Government policy Demographics Veteran homelessness in America is not a phenomenon only of the 21st century; as early as the Reconstruction Era, homeless veterans were among the general homeless population. In 1932, homeless veterans were part of the Bonus Army. In 1934, there were as many as a quarter million veterans living on the streets. During the Truman Administration, there were one hundred thousand homeless veterans in Chicago, and a quarter of that number in Washington, D.C. In 1987, the number of homeless veterans was as high as three hundred thousand. Estimates of the homeless population vary as these statistics are very difficult to obtain. In 2007, the first veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom began to be documented in homeless shelters. By 2009 there were 154,000 homeless, with slightly less than half having served in South Vietnam. According to the VA in 2011, veterans made up 14% of homeless adult males, and 2% of homeless adult females, and both groups were overrepresented within the homeless population compared to the general population. The overall count in 2012 showed 62,619 homeless veterans in the United States. In January 2013, there were an estimated 57,849 homeless veterans in the U.S., or 12% of the homeless population. Just under 8% were female. In July 2014, the largest population of homeless veterans lived in Los Angeles County, with there being over 6,000 homeless veterans, out of the total estimated 54,000 homeless within that area. In 2015, a report issued by HUD counted over 47,000 homeless veterans nationwide, the majority of whom were White and male. In 2016, there were over 39,000 homeless veterans nationwide. A Corps in terms of military size. As of January 2017, the state of California had the highest number of veterans experiencing homelessness. There were an estimated 11,472 homeless veterans. The biggest population of homeless veterans, after California, in 2017 lived in Florida - an estimated 2,817, and in Texas - 2,200. In April 2019, the U.S. had a homelessness population of over 630,000 with 67,000 being veterans of the armed forces. Aid Many programs and resources have been implemented across the United States in an effort to help homeless veterans. Among the prominent are: * National Coalition for Homeless Veterans * Veterans Community Project * United States Department of Veteran Affairs * United States Department of Housing and Urban Development * The American Legion * National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs *Veterans of America HUD-VASH, a housing voucher program by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Administration, gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable U.S. armed forces veterans. =Historical= In 1887, the Sawtelle Veterans Home was constructed to care for disabled veterans, and housed more than a thousand homeless veterans. Other such old soldiers' homes were built throughout the United States, such as the one in New York. These homes became the predecessors of the Veteran Affairs' medical facilities. = Risk Factors = According to a study in 2014, veterans are slightly more likely than non- veterans to be homeless; 9.7% of the general population are veterans, but 12.3% of the homeless population are veterans. These risk factors were found by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA). This is the first systemic review to summarize research on risk factors for US veterans experiencing homelessness. They evaluated thirty- one studies from 1987 through 2014. The risk factors that are most common among this population are substance abuse disorders and poor mental health, followed by low income and other income related issues, a lack of support from family and friends, or weak social networks. = Supportive Housing for Veterans Compared to Non-Veterans = The needs between veterans and non- veterans experiencing homelessness can differ. A study was implemented by the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness (CICH) in 2004 by the Interagency Council on Homelessness. They used eleven sites around the United States tracked data for one year by comparing 162 chronically homeless veterans to 388 chronically homeless non-veterans. Both groups were enrolled in a national supported housing initiative over a one-year period and several differences were noted. The first was that the veterans tended to be from an older age group, identified as male, and were more likely to have completed high school. While in enrolled in supported housing, the mental health of both groups improved through mental health services offered. However, veterans were reported to make greater use of the outpatient mental health services compared to non-veterans. Both groups also gradually reduced the use of health services once housing was obtained, therefore, this suggests that the program is effective in reducing clinical needs among chronically homeless of adults in general. =Department of Veterans Affairs= On November 3, 2009, United States Secretary Eric K. Shinseki spoke at the National Summit on Homeless Veterans and announced his plan. Along with President Barack Obama, Shinseki outlined a comprehensive five-year plan to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs and its efforts to end veteran homeless. The goal was to end veteran homelessness by 2015, but because of budget constraints that has now been pushed to 2017. The plan focused on prevention of homelessness along with help for those living on the streets. The plan would expand mental health care and housing options for veterans, and would collaborate with: * The Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development * Small Business Administration * U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness * State directors of veterans affairs * Veteran service organizations * National, state, and local social service providers and community groups The prominent role of the Department of Veterans Affairs and its joined up approach to veteran welfare help to distinguish the US response to veteran homelessness internationally.Wilding, Mark. (2020). The Challenges of Measuring Homelessness among Armed Forces Veterans: Service Provider Experiences in England, European Journal of Homelessness, 14(1): 107-122. Still, associated programmes are not without their difficulties. For example, in 2009, call centers were established in order to assist homeless veterans to gain assistance. As of December 2014, of the 79,500 veterans who contacted the call center, 27% were unable to speak to a counselor, and 47% of referrals led to no support services provided to the homeless veteran. A study published in the American Journal of Addiction showed a link between veterans' trauma of mental disorders and their substance abuse. = Housing Interventions with Veterans = A study conducted by O‚ÄôConnell, Kasprow and Rosenheck is a secondary analysis of data from the evaluation of the HUD-VASH initiative that began in 1992 to provide housing for veterans with psychiatric disorders. They compared the results of three kinds of interventions with 460 veterans across nineteen sites in the country. They were assigned to three groups; one group was given a voucher and intensive case management, one group was given intensive case management only, and one group was given standard care only. Intensive case management included help locating an apartment, while standard care which consisted of short-term broker case management provided by the Health Care for Homeless Veterans outreach workers. An evaluation assistant conducted follow up interviews every three months for up to five years. Through that they found that individuals in the intensive case management group had lower scores on quality of life which was measured by the Lehman Quality of Life Interview. This is a structured questionnaire to assess the life circumstances of persons with severe and persistent mental illness. Housing failure is defined as experiencing homelessness for at least one day. Before intake, 43% (n=170) has been homeless between one and six months and 27% (n=105) has experienced homelessness for two years or more. The risk factors are the greatest in the first few months of being housed due to the more structured and supervised setting. Weekly face to face contact, community-based care and services offered by the VA were encouraged, which is vastly different from the life they were used to before this program. The veterans were tracked for five years and the statistics changed vastly over that time. 72% of participants remained housed after one year (N=282), 60% after two (N=235), 52% after three (N=204), 47% after four years (N=184) and 36% after five years (N=141) (5). Those in the HUD-VASH group has a lower risk of returning to homelessness over the course of five years had an 87% lower risk compared to those in intensive care management only group and 76% compared to those in standard care. The greatest risk factor for returning to homelessness was either due to drugs or due to PTSD. Overall, after five years of follow up, 44% of all participants (N=172) returned to homelessness for at least one day after being successfully placed into housing. = Studies of Housing First for Veterans = To end homelessness among veterans, new resources and program expansions were introduced. One of the goals set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) is to place veterans experiencing homelessness in permanent housing. A housing first approach has been introduced to help support this initiative. One of the goals of Housing First is the rapid placement of veterans to directly from the streets to a permanent home. The Housing First approach works with the HUD supplying housing assistance through a voucher program while the VA provides case management and supportive services through its healthcare system. By having permanent housing, there is a decrease in the usage of shelters, hospitals and correctional facilities. This program is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. A study by Montgomery, Hill, Kane and Culhane was a demonstration that was initiated in 2010 and studied the housing methods in the United States for homeless veterans. They evaluated the efficiency of the Housing First (HF) approach compared to a Treatment as Usual (TAU) approach. HF targeted those were experiencing street homelessness while TAU served more women and families. Veterans placed in HF were offered services such as social workers, vocational trainers, a housing specialist and access to a psychiatrist. Most importantly, HF would issue a housing voucher at the time of lease signing for pre- inspected apartments which were maintained by a contractor. Veterans in the TAU approach received the standard VA case management services for HUD-VASH. In TAU, they remained at their current placement, which could sometimes include an emergency shelter, or they were placed in transitional housing or residential treatment programs. The study found that the HF has the most effective model in accessing permanent housing and has shown efficiency in reducing rates of homelessness with veterans. Compared to TAU, HF was more successful at quickly moving veterans into permanent housing, their moving process took approximately one month while the TAU approach took about six months. The housing retention rate for HF was 98% and 86% for TAU, meaning that those using the HF model were more likely to maintain housing stability. =Charity= JROTC cadet from Wilson High School assists at a \\"Stand Down\\" event. In addition to government provided aid, private charities provide assistance to homeless veterans as well. These include providing some homeless veterans vehicles to live in, and building permanent housing for others. Advocating for the rights of homeless veterans through policy implementation and recommendations. Throughout the nation, multiple organizations and agencies host \\"Stand Down\\" events where homeless veterans are provided items and services; the first of these was held in San Diego, organized by Vietnam veterans, in 1988.  Ending Veteran Homelessness  In November of 2009, Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Erick Shinskei set out the goal of ending veterans experiencing homelessness by 2017. While not all veterans are housed, the current housing initiatives such as the housing first model are ensuring that housing is obtained for a larger portion of veterans experiencing homelessness. In 2019, the HUD-VASH program was able to house more than 11,000 veterans. Overall, since 2008, more than 114,000 veterans experiencing homelessness have been served through the HUD-VASH program. Also, more resources are being implemented to assist with mental health and addiction. As of 2019, more than 78 communities and the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware and Virginia have effectively ended homelessness among veterans.

It was first released on November 28, 2011 for feature phones, and compatibility was extended to iOS and Android devices on December 16, 2011. The game is based on The Idolmaster franchise, and features a cast of new idol characters. In September 2015, a music video game developed by Cygames titled The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls: Starlight Stage was released on the Google Play Store and Apple Store in Japan. The story in Cinderella Girls follows the career of a producer in charge of leading and training prospective pop idols to stardom. Its gameplay follows a digital collectible card game format in which each idol is represented as a card, which the player may use to form a unit of idols to train in lessons, take to jobs, and compete against opponents. Cinderella Girls has made transitions to other media. An anime television series adaptation produced by A-1 Pictures aired in Japan between January 10 and October 17, 2015 and was simulcast by Daisuki. It was followed by a 3-minute short chibi slice of life anime series produced by Gathering that has been running since 2017. Various manga series, three sets of manga anthologies, two Internet radio talk shows featuring the series' voice actresses, image song singles and albums, and live concerts have also been produced. Premise The game and series takes place at the 346 Pro talent agency, where a producer is raising a group of idols to stardom in what is known as \\"The Cinderella Project\\". The anime follows three such girls, Rin Shibuya, Uzuki Shimamura, and Mio Honda, along with their fellow idols, as they become part of the Cinderella Project. Gameplay An example of gameplay in Cinderella Girls depicting Uzuki Shimamura finishing up work. Cinderella Girls is a free-to-play, simulation social network game based on The Idolmaster franchise. Like its forerunners The Idolmaster and The Idolmaster 2, the player assumes the role of a talent producer who is in charge of training prospective pop idols on their way to stardom. Idols are represented in the game as collectible cards divided into three categories: cute, cool, and passion. The player begins by choosing one of the three categories, and he or she will then receive an idol belonging to the category. Each idol has several statistics points that influence gameplay: attack, defense, cost, and affection rate; each idol is also designated one of three rarities: normal, rare, or S rare, all of which also have a \\"plus\\" variant. There are several activities which the player may take his or her idols to participate in, such as work, live battles, and lessons. Work are jobs that the producer and idols can take in different regions of Japan. During a job, the player earns in-game money and fans, receives new idols or costumes, and may also increase an idol's affection rate. As work progresses, the player also earns experience points and increases his or her producer level. The amount of progress the player may make at a given time is limited by the amount of stamina he or she has, which depletes during work. To continue working after the stamina has been completely depleted, the player must either wait for the stamina gauge to replenish over time or use in-game items. The amount of stamina the player has is determined by his or her producer level, but it can also be increased by allocating earned bonus points. After completing a number of jobs in an area, the player and idols are occasionally challenged by a computer-controlled rival idol. To finish working in the area, the player must compete against this opponent with the idol he or she has chosen as the leader. By defeating the rival idol, the player receives the idol's corresponding card or in-game items. Live battle is an asynchronous multiplayer gameplay mode in which the player can compete against other players on the Mobage platform. To initiate live battles against other players, the player must first assemble an idol unit for attacking. The player can add a maximum of five idols to his or her unit, but only the first idols whose costs are cumulatively equal to or lower than the player's attacking cost limit are played during battle. Like stamina, the player's cost allowance is determined by his or her producer level, but it can also be increased by allocating additional points. If the player has cost remaining in the unit, then additional idols whose cost can fit the gap are played as back members. In order to win the live battle, the player must obtain a higher score‚Äîdetermined by the idol units' total attack, defense, and skills‚Äîthan his or her opponent. By defeating his or her opponent, the player earns additional fans and money, and receives a costume from the opponent. Similarly, the player may assemble a unit for defense, which is limited by the player's total defending cost. For either units, the player may add the same idol character to the unit more than once, but the same idol card is only permitted once. To raise the attack and defense competency of an idol, the player can have her participate in lessons. To participate in a lesson, the player must first choose up to ten other idols as lesson partners, who will then be removed from the player's roster in exchange for raising the level, attack, and defense of the idol who partakes in the lesson. The player can also increase an idol's attack and defense by raising her affection rate to the maximum. Lastly, the player can choose to participate in training, and combine two identical idols to obtain her \\"plus\\" variant. Development and release The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls was developed by Cygames for DeNA's Mobage social network platform for mobile phones. It was first announced on October 14, 2011 under the tentative title \\"Idolmaster Social Game\\", and pre-registration for the game was opened to the public on November 16, 2011. It was first released on November 28, 2011 for Japanese feature phones, and compatibility was extended to Android and iOS devices as a web application on December 16, 2011. To commemorate the game's third anniversary, native applications for Android and iOS were respectively released on November 17 and November 25, 2014. A Google Chrome App version for the Google Chrome browser was also released on October 28, 2015. The game was later released in South Korea for the Daum Mobage platform as an application for Android devices on December 2, 2014, and it featured a new idol character exclusive to the version. The Korean language version of the game shut down on March 14, 2016. In May 2012, the Consumer Affairs Agency determined that the gameplay mechanic's usage in social network games violated Japanese law, and announced it would issue a request to DeNA and other social game platforms for its removal. Cinderella Girls was cited as an example of a game that employed the tactic. The mechanism was later removed from the game, following separate announcements by DeNA and Bandai Namco that the companies would cease its usage in their social games.

He has also worked as an entrepreneur in advertising business from 1959 to the 1990s, when he retired. However, he is perhaps best known for his work as a songwriter and for having played the vibraphone and the accordion in numerous bands. Biographical details Jukka Haavisto passed the matriculation exams in Kauhava in 1948 and studied to become a teacher, graduating from the Jyv√§skyl√§ Pedagogical Institute in 1956. He worked in the advertising agency SEK from 1959 to 1968, in the end as the person in charge of liaisons. After that he worked in the advertising agency Artifex as the vice-CEO until 1978. He founded his own advertising agency PRAX in 1975, and worked there in the capacity of CEO and chairman. Career as a musician Haavisto performed publicly for the first time at the age of 10, when he played a harmonica together with a friend in a broadcast by Yle. He had received the harmonica as a Christmas present from his mother the previous Christmas, on the very same day when his father was killed in the Winter War at Taipaleenjoki. Haavisto‚Äôs dearest genre in music became swing, which he played with the accordion and the vibraphone. Haavisto‚Äôs most important bands have been the Happy Swing Band, the Jukka Haavisto Band and the Haavisto Swingers. Haavisto performed publicly for the last time on 27 February 2020. He has been suffering from borreliosis and his hands no longer execute the orders coming from the brain to perfection. He had already made the decision to retire as a musician, but when he was listening to the Happy Swing Band, he felt that he had to perform once more with his friends. He played a vibraphone solo, ‚Äúwhich went relatively well, considering the circumstances. But a promise of playing relatively well is not enough for a new start. [‚Ä¶] I decided that it is better to quit out of my own accord, not when I‚Äôm forced to, demanded by the public.‚Äù Haavisto is pleased to see the talent of the new generations of jazz musicians in Finland. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhilarated to see these new generations, which have raised the Finnish jazz to new national and international levels. Finnish jazz is no longer based on imitation, not even on copying from one‚Äôs idols.‚Äù Organizational activities Haavisto acted as the head of the Finnish Jazz Archive, later the Finnish Jazz & Pop Archive (the current Musiikkiarkisto (‚ÄòMusic Archive‚Äô)), during 1991‚Äì97. He says he is ‚Äúeasily provoked to reckless undertakings, it is easy to talk me into new things.‚Äù Haavisto was one of the founders of the Association for the Promotion of Finnish Popular Music in 1994. He acted as its director until 2004. The association launched a virtual museum (www.pomus.net) in the internet in December of that year. Haavisto is also a published author. His book Puuvillapelloilta kaskimaille (‚ÄòFrom the cotton fields to the land of slash-and-burn‚Äô) (1991), is still the most recent general treatise of jazz in Finland. He has wondered why no one has written an up-to-date work more recently. His book has some 400 pages, and in it he writes about 1.500 Finnish jazz musicians. Awards Haavisto has received the following awards and prizes for his services to Finnish jazz and popular music: *1995 The Andania Prize of Jazz Finland *1995 The Louis Armstrong Award of Classic Jazz Association (Finland) *2000 Prix ELVIS of the Elvis Association (Finland) *2007 honorary title of music councilor * 2010 Archive feat of the year for groundbreaking work for the national heritage in the fields of jazz and popular music Family Haavisto's sons Janne and Olli are well-known musicians in Finland and even internationally. Janne has played in J. Karjalainen & Mustat Lasit, Laika & The Cosmonauts, and Olli has played in J. Karjalainen & Mustat Lasit, Freud Marx Engels & Jung and with Mikko Kuustonen and Tuomari Nurmio.

She is best known for developing a model of historical trauma for the Lakota people, which would eventually be expanded to encompass indigenous populations the world over. She is Hunkpapa/Oglala Lakota. Early life Research In 2000, Brave Heart published the article, \\"Wakiksuyapi: Carrying the Historical Trauma of the Lakota.\\" Using the historical trauma research conducted in survivors of the Holocaust, Brave Heart would identify a comparable cluster of events correlated with massive group trauma across generations, including the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre and the forced removal of children to federal boarding schools. She conceptualized the current form of historical trauma in the 1980s as a way to comprehend what she observed as many Native Americans being unable to fulfill \\"the American Dream\\". Her most significant findings came in a cluster of six symptoms: # 1st Contact: life shock, genocide, no time for grief, a Colonization Period in which the introduction of disease and alcohol occurred, and traumatic events such as Wounded Knee Massacre. # Economic competition: which resulted in loss from spiritual and tangible dimensions. # The occurrence of Invasion/War Period, which involved extermination and refugee symptoms. # A Subjugation/Reservation Period where confinement and translocation occur, a relationship of forced dependency on oppressor is formed, and a lack of security occur. # Boarding School Period: in which the family system is destroyed, beatings, rape, and prohibition of Native language and religion ensue. The lasting effect being ill-preparation for parenting, identity confusion. # Forced Relocation and Termination Period: transfer to urban areas, prohibition of religious freedom, racism and being viewed as second class; loss of governmental system and community. She also proposed a three- pronged intervention mode: education, sharing the effects of trauma and grief resolution through collective mourning and healing. Since 1976, Brave Heart has worked directly in the field to gather information on the impact of historical trauma within the indigenous communities. These groups include the Lakota in South Dakota, multiple tribes in New Mexico, and populations of indigenous and Latinos in Denver, New Mexico and New York. Dr. Brave Heart is also responsible for hosting and presenting over 175 presentations on subject matter related to historical trauma as well as training numerous tribes across the United States and First Nations populations in the country of Canada. In 1992, Brave Heart established the Takini Network, a Native nonprofit organization dedicated to healing the wounds inflicted on Native Americans through the experiences of intergenerational trauma, located in Rapid City, South Dakota. Career Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart is known for developing a model of historical trauma, historical unresolved grief theory and interventions in indigenous peoples. Brave Heart earned her Master of Science from Columbia University School of Social Work in 1976. Brave Heart returned to school in 1990 after working in the field of social work, and in 1995, she earned her doctorate in clinical social work from the Smith College School for Social Work. The dissertation was entitled, \\"The Return to the Sacred Path: Healing from Historical Trauma and Historical Unresolved Grief Among the Lakota.\\" Dr. Brave Heart was a tenured faculty member at the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work and Coordinator of the Native People's Curriculum Project, which operated in the Denver and the Four Corners region and covered the Navajo and Ute reservations. In addition to a career as an associate professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, Dr. Brave Heart also served as a clinical intervention research team member at the Hispanic Treatment Program, located at the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical School. The unresolved grief intervention developed by Brave Heart was considered an outstanding model, one which won a special minority Center for Mental Health Services grant award for Lakota Regional Community Action Grant Historical Trauma in 2001. Dr. Brave Heart was also responsible for the incorporation of techniques designed to intervene and enhance reservation parenting through a number of successful grants. She was also known for the coordination and directing of several Models for Indigenous Survivors of Historical Trauma: A Multicultural Dialogue Among Allies Conferences between 2001-2004, and served as both member and host of conferences for the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. Dr. Brave Heart was also on the Board of Directors for the Council on Social Work Education and acted as an adviser/consultant to the National Indian Country Child Trauma Center. Brave Heart currently serves as a research associate Professor at the University of New Mexico Department of Psychiatry. She also serves as Director of Native American, Disparities Research and Community Behavioral Health. Maria has areas of interest which include indigenous collective trauma, grief and loss, historical trauma, healing intervention and mental health in indigenous populations, and substance use disorders and co- occurring mental health disorders in indigenous populations.

It is an encrusting tubular sponge that grows anchored on rocky surfaces of coral reefs. Name The name of the species relates to its blue color: Latin caeruleus: cerulean blue, like the sky, or the ocean. Morphology Haliclona (Soestella) caerulea takes the form of an encrusting mass of cylindrical to volcano-shaped projections between 2 and 15 cm, with oscula at the high end. The oscula are circular or oval, and between 1.3 and 5.0 mm in diameter. The body has radial symmetry and consists, on the outside, of flattened cells known as pinacocytes. The inner part is formed by cells called choanocytes, equipped with a flagellum. These cells have a dual function: ingesting food particles, and maintaining the flow of water through the sponge's body. Between the two layers a more or less gelatinous substance called mesohyl. Sclerocyte cells are responsible for secreting a kind of skeleton for supporting the sponge's body, formed of spongin fibers. As its name suggests, the most common color is blue, but individuals may be beige or white. Distribution Its geographic distribution includes the western tropical Atlantic, from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, to the Caribbean Sea, reaching the West Indies and the Pacific coast of Mexico and Panama. is also found on the islands of Hawaii and Guam, and its unintended introduction that reached these islands from biofouling on the hulls of ships. Habitat and Ecological roles It is commonly seen growing in beds of the seagrass Thalassia, and in rocky coral rubble habitats. Studies reported their symbiosis with calcareous alga Jania adhaerens.

The coffins date from the 14th to 10th centuries BCE and have been found at Deir el-Balah, Beth Shean, Lachish, Tell el-Far‚Äôah, Sahab, and most recently in the Jezreel Valley in 2013.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, pg. 285] The coffins show Egyptian influence in the Ancient Near East and exhibit many Egyptian qualities in the depictions on the face masks on the lids. The lids can be separated into two artistic categories, the natural and grotesque, and the bodies are separated into type A, tapered from the shoulders, and type B, cylindrical.[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 2] The graves contain wealthy funerary offerings from a variety of origins from Cyprus, Mycenae, Egypt, Phoenicia, and Canaan. The graves appear to be originally reserved for Egyptian officials and then later became a part of Canaanite and Philistine culture.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327] Anthropoid Clay Coffins. History The anthropoid clay coffins are generally believed to have been a product of the First Dynasty in Egypt that were gradually disseminated to other regions and peoples.[Perry, W.J. \\"Sumer and Egypt.\\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 20.] They were one of several forms of burial utilized by Sumerians at Ur and the Egyptians.[Perry, W.J. \\"Sumer and Egypt.\\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 30.] There is some disagreement about the social and economic associations of this form of burial among scholars, which can also be said to vary depending on the site. The various forms utilized originally by the Egyptians can be described as inhumation, clay coffins, and tombs with stairways and vaulting. Typically the graves that utilized inhumation or vaulting contained bodies in wooden coffins, which were more valuable than their clay counterparts as well as items of wealth and even human sacrifices. Clay coffins are often associated with the poorest graves in Egyptian society, though not always in Levant.[Perry, W.J. \\"Sumer and Egypt.\\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 29‚Äì30.] Notably, Egypt continued to develop new methods of burial whereas Sumer stagnated.[Perry, W.J. \\"Sumer and Egypt.\\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 31.] In 1929 George Horsfield, who was the Director of Antiquities for Transjordan, was made aware of a tomb near the city of Sahab. He notified W.F. Albright who personally visited the site. He describes the tomb as cistern-like and located on a hill [Albright 295]. He notes that the writing found here has no known identification, being dissimilar to both Semitic and Arabic.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 296‚Äì297.] Albright describes his finds at this tomb as similar to findings at Beth-shan and Tell el-Far‚Äôah, examined by Rowe and Petrie respectively.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 298.] The objects found here are in stark contrast to those found at Canaanite tombs and are more closely associated with the Philistines.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 298-299.] Generally, the findings suggest a date between the 11th and 12th centuries for the creation of these tombs.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 299‚Äì300.] In Egypt, Petries discovered several burials near Tell Nebesheh in 1885. As a result of the pottery he located here, he described the tombs as Cypriote and suggested that they were from the 5th to 7th century B.C.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 301.] At Tell el-Yahuidiyeh in 1888, Naville discovered several tumuli tombs. He described the pottery he found as Cypriote because he thought it was similar to Petries findings. However, it was actually Palestinian in origin.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 303.] A scarab found at this site dates to the 11‚Äì12th century. Some have suggested that the Philistines influenced the development of these sites, however it is more likely that they are a result of Egyptian influence.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 305-306.] In 1973, Trude Dothan described recent findings at the cemetery of Deir el-Balah in Canaan. Items found here can be said to have arrived from a variety of sources. However, there is evidence of strong Egyptian influence on local items as well as items imported from Egypt.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 134‚Äì135.] This is the earliest site of anthropoid coffins in Canaan. There is speculation about the source of the development of anthropoid coffins at this site, but Dothan believes that the source is more likely Egyptian than Philistine.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 145.] Items here date from the 11-13th centuries.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 135.] The Coffins In a cemetery south of Deir el-Balah anthropoid coffins where found when locals were reclaiming sand dunes.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 1] The coffins were found among a few simple burials and when unearthed appeared to be in pristine shape, however they were actually being held together by the sand that had filled the cracks and was supporting the frame of the coffin from external pressure.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 3] In antiquity many coffins had fallen prey to grave robbers. These disturbed coffins, even though looted of their valuable objects, still hold a great deal of importance. Examining the coffins themselves proves to be of great value. In earlier times, at the end of the Pre-Dynastic Period and during the First Dynasty of Sumer and Egypt, clay coffins were imitations of ornamental wooden ones.[Perry, W.J. \\"Sumer and Egypt.\\" Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 28‚Äì33.] Although most commonly found in single graves, at Tell el-Yahudiyeh there were many coffins placed next to one another in rows. These coffins were painted and plain, painted coffins are not commonly mentioned.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.] =Ceramics= :Local clay was used for the building of these coffins. Due to the large length, girth, and the weight it seems ideal for the construction to take place near. Moving them long distances wouldn‚Äôt have been feasible as the heavy clay would have been fragile. The material makeup of the clay has many impurities; rocks, sand, pot shards, and straw can be found in the shards.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 99] The inconsistencies in the property of the clay would not have been detrimental to the coffin‚Äôs stability, it would in fact have helped the structure. Rocks, sand, grit, and broken shards in the clay would have allowed for less stress on the form while it was drying. This stronger clay would have made the surface require more smoothing attention. =Construction, Building Technique= :The coffins where coil built, this technique is done with large amounts of clay formed into coils and then layered upon one another with water or slip to act as a binder between layers.[Ibid] Whinding and forming the structure, large objects can be built in stages this way as a result of the lower sections being allowed to dry to support the continued addition of clay. Tapered at one or both ends.[Bloch-Smith, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúLife in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead.‚Äù Near Eastern Archaeology, Vol. 65, No. 2, The Archaeology of the Death (Jun., 2002), 135.] There is evidence that the lids were cut out of the forms after the initial building to be reworked and molded, this would have been done at the leather hard stage when the clay was firm but still mailable.[Ibid] The facial features tend to be formed by molding with the clay that is part of the formed lid, though with lids of the grotesque style applying more clay to the surface.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.] Attention was paid most notably to the face lids, secondly to the exterior of the coffin, which was smoothed down and compressed back into itself. And lastly the interior was left rough and undefined with coils still notable.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.] Some times handles can be found along the sides of the coffins, used for carrying as well as adapted and molded into representing the facial features on the lids.[Ibid.] Handles seem to be one of the local variations that coffin sport; they are found in Transjordan and Beth-shan. The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.] There are instances of painted or scribed hieroglyphs on the exteriors of the coffins, though they are usually crudely rendered.[Ibid] =Completing and Firing= :The lids of the coffins are more often in better shape then the main bodies. The coffins found in Tomb 116 at Deir el-Balah have the lids close to intact while the body of the coffin, being fragile, broke easily upon excavation.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30] The stability of the clay is determined by how it was treated and how it has been fired. More durable ceramic pieces have been fired to a higher temperature, allowing the clay to dehydrate and burn off all of the water that was mixed into it to create a malleable material to craft and mold with. With the smaller face masks, where more time was devoted to sculpting, molding, and carving the features, more care has then been taken to ensure that they would last. ‚ÄúThe coffins were fired in an open fire at a low temperature, which would account for the sometimes crumbly and mottled material.‚Äù[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 90] =Face lids= Face Lids fall into two categories, naturalistic or grotesque.  Natural  :Naturalistic Coffin Lids have a clearly shown face. Anthropoid Clay Coffin with face lid and crossed arms. An example of a naturalistic face lid. ::Naturalistic style coffins have well defined heads and facial features. These coffins are often molded in relief and have large Egyptian features, i.e. almond shaped eyes, arched eyebrows, straight noses, and full lips. The hair or wigs tend to be molded less sharply.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 10] The face lid of the coffins are molded separately and then later replaced upon the larger coffin, the shape of the lid hole also took into consideration the interning of bodies and is large enough for its purpose.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 13] Distinctive features are the high curved forehead, arched eyebrows and eyelid, broad turned up nose with deeply indented nostrils, plump cheeks, and protruding chin.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 10] Flat planes and consistent lines complete the face. Arms are often thin and stick like, crossed or holding objects such as lotus blossoms.[Dothan, Trude. ‚Äò‚ÄôExcavations at the Cemetery of Deir el- Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 50] The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.]  Grotesque  :Grotesque Coffin Lids have no delineated facial outlines.[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 100] Anthropoid Clay Coffin with face lid and crossed arms. An example of a grotesque face lid. ::Grotesque style coffins have eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, and beard that have been applied separately to the leather hard clay. This can be done with a slipping and scoring that joins two separate pieces of clay together. \\"The fact that the lid is the face gives a bizarre somewhat caricature-like effect.\\"[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30.] The grotesque lids are associated with the later coffins of the 11th-10th centuries BCE and the construction practices of the Philistines. =Coffin Type= :Typologically the coffins have been divided into two groups according to the outline of the lids and coffins. The groups are:  Group A  ::This style is the dominant shape at Deir el- Balah, it is mummy shaped with delineated head and shoulders in various proportions and silhouettes. The shape follows he traditional concept of Egyptian anthropoid coffins.  Group B  ::Cylindrical Coffins, or Group B, have a head and shoulders that are not delineated. There is sometimes a round opening at the top of the head with a molded pithos like rim, this can appear like the opening of a vase. This style can also have a round opening in the base. The bottoms of both the feet are outlined. The lid is small in proportion to the coffin.[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 100] =Egyptian Similarities= :There are many similarities to Egyptian burials and iconography found in Near Eastern Clay Coffins. Coffins with face lids from Egypt‚Äôs poor have been dated to 18th and 19th Dynasties (ca. 1575-1200).[Wright, G. Ernest. ‚ÄúPhilistine Coffins and Mercenaries.‚Äù The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Sep., 1959), 52‚Äì66.] Lotus flowers carved into head masks as a symbol of rebirth. The features of the face have visibly Egyptian, the slanting shape of the eyes, arched eyebrows, and representation of the hair and the wigs are the most notable.[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah‚Äô‚Äô. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 50.] Roman coffins, from an later period then our Near Eastern coffins, are poor earthenware imitations. Both the Near Eastern coffins and those of the Roman‚Äôs are imitations of Egyptian style coffins with individual features being characteristic of the regions they were crafted.[Albright, W. F. \\"Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan.\\" American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep.,1932), 295‚Äì306.] Burials There were burials containing anthropoid ceramic coffins excavated at the sites of Deir el-Balah and Beth Shean predominantly, however there were coffins found in smaller numbers at Lachish, Tell el-Far‚Äôah, Sahab, and the Jezreel Valley. Many of the excavated anthropoid ceramic coffins from Deir el-Balah were buried in similar ritual contexts dating from the 14th-11th centuries BCE. The coffins were cut into a foundation of Kurkar (sandstone) or hamrah (red sand) and lined with rough stones and oriented to the west.[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 1] The coffins at Deir el-Balah were marked with large pithoi at the head of the burial with dipper jugs inside and bowls on top serving as lids, these deposits served as the grave markers. At Deir el-Balah the coffins typically contained more than one individual and contained up to four people in some cases. At Beth Shean the coffins were placed into rock cut tombs also facing the west from the same time period as Deir el-Balah.[The Northern Cemetery at Beth Shean, p. 91 ] The northern cemetery at Beth Shean contained roughly fifty coffins with surviving face lids.[Ibid] These graves had been disturbed in antiquity and the amount of information left was sparse. The coffins from Beth Shean were unique and were adorned with headdresses, which some have suggested to mean they are of Philistine origin.[Biblical Archaeology Review] At Lachish and Tell el-Far‚Äôah the several rock cut tombs found there containing anthropoid ceramic coffins date from a later period, 12th‚Äì10th centuries BCE, and are mostly associated with Philistine offerings.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 283] Offerings Interior of an Anthropoid Clay Coffin, ceramic vessels. These burials were typically associated with a large variety of expensive grave offerings. The offerings consist of ceramics, bronzes, and jewelry of precious metals and stones. Wide ranges of ceramic offerings are found with the burials such as Cypriot, Canaanite, Egyptian, Mycenaean, and Philistine pottery.[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 3 ] The pottery can be separated into two categories, that which is found within the coffin and that which is found outside of the coffin. The pottery found outside of the coffin is typically larger and of a more utilitarian variety, such as storage jars, pithoi, stirrup jars, and cooking pots. The pottery found inside the coffins is smaller and of a higher quality, including Cypriots milk bowls, Egyptian alabaster cups, pilgrim flasks, and juglets. The earlier burials (14th‚Äì12th centuries BCE) were associated with more Egyptian influenced pottery and finds, whereas the later burials (12th‚Äì10th centuries BCE) were associated with the Philistine culture. Bronze tools and implements were another common burial offering associated with anthropoid ceramic coffins. The bronze items are usually Egyptian in style and consist of bowls, pitchers, knives, and in one case a wine set. The wine set consisted of a bronze pitcher and a strainer and is one of only a few complete sets found.[Anthropoid Clay Coffins from a Late Bronze Age Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, p. 10] In a rich coffin of a woman at Deir el-Balah an Egyptian New Kingdom style bronze mirror was found. Bronze was not the only type metal artifact found; in one of the tombs at Tell el- Far‚Äôah one of oldest pieces of Iron in the Levant was found.[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 103] These anthropoid ceramic coffins appear to have been associated with wealthier individuals and consequently have a trove of expensive small finds. Many beads from necklaces and bracelets made of expensive materials were found inside the coffins.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 298] Golden beads in the shapes of palmettes and lotus blossoms were common and showed the incorporation of Egyptian and Near Eastern art motifs in the funerary adornment. Many of the beads found were made out of a semi-precious stone, carnelian.[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 27 ] Another interesting find associated with one of the coffins at Deir el-Balah was a makeup spoon in the shape of a diving woman.[The Cemetery at Deir el- Balah, 1973, p. 48] This is a common motif found in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom period. One of the more important small finds associated with the coffins from all sites they were found at are scarabs. Scarabs bearing imagery and the cartouches of New Kingdom Pharaohs, including one of Rameses II, have been found in context with most of the coffins and suggest that the people buried in the coffins were possibly Egyptian officials.[Life in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead, p. 125] Conclusion Most of the information known about these burials has been taken from the associated finds due to the lack of written evidence. Only on two occasions was there writing associated with the burials; one, a badly preserved funerary stele lining a grave at Deir el- Balah and two, a coffin lid from Lachish that had poorly written and preserved hieroglyphs on it.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 285 ] There are still some mysteries associated with these burials, one being sets of stone and bone pellets found inside many of the coffins.[The Cemetery at Deir el- Balah, 1973, p. 98] The use of the pellets has yet to be discovered. The biggest unknown still surrounding these coffins, that the offerings have helped to unravel, is who were the coffins made for. Scholars have suggested they are for Egyptians, Canaanites imitating the Egyptians, and the Philistines.[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327] From the dates associated with the finds, it appears that the coffins originated with Egyptians and Egyptian influence in Canaan and then was adopted by the Philistines later.

Fed by four small tributaries from a basin of about in Curry County, it lies about north of Port Orford and west of U.S. Route 101. It was probably named for Fred Flora, a 19th-century settler and miner who lived nearby. The lake, with a mean elevation of about above sea level, empties north into Floras Creek, where the combined streams form the New River. The river flows north behind a foredune until veering west and entering the Pacific Ocean through a break in the dune. Relatively remote, the lake and the Floras Lake State Natural Area, can be reached on foot from the south along a trail that begins at Cape Blanco Airport. More common is to approach by car on Floras Lake Road off U.S. Route 101. This leads to Boice‚ÄìCope County Park, at the northeastern corner of the lake. The area near the lake, between Bandon to the north and Cape Blanco to the south, includes many state, federal, and county parks, recreation areas, and wildlife sanctuaries. Among those are the New River Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), overseen by the Bureau of Land Management north of the lake and west of the county park. The county park, which has campsites and day-use facilities, offers access to the New River ACEC as well as the lake. Recreation Sailboarding, especially for beginners because of the lake environment and wind conditions, is popular at Floras Lake. Boice‚ÄìCope County Park provides a boat ramp for sport fishing at the lake, which is stocked with rainbow trout and supports a small population of largemouth bass. It is also part of the migratory route for Chinook salmon and other seagoing fish on their way to and from the lake's feeder streams. The Floras Lake Trail, one of the four trails in the New River ACEC, connects the county park to the Floras Lake State Natural Area. About long, it passes between the lake and the foredune on the west. The beach west of the foredune is part of a stretch of sand between Bandon and Cape Blanco named part of the Oregon Coast Trail by the Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation. Canoers and kayakers can launch at Floras Lake and float down the outlet and down New River to a takeout at the ACEC's Storm Ranch, a trip of about , or an ACEC takeout at Lower Fourmile Road, a mile further downstream.

In his 1972 article \\"On the idea of a management control system\\" he listed the following four reasons for the need for a planning and control system: :The need for a planning and control system within a business organization flows from certain general characteristics of the nature of business enterprises, the chief of which are follows: :* firstly, the enterprise has (by definition) organizational objectives, as distinct from the separable and individual ones of the members constituting the 'managerial coalition'; :* Secondly, the managers of the sub-units of the enterprise must necessarily be ambivalent in view of their own personal goals, as well as have a good deal of discretion in deciding how they should behave and in formulating their part of any overall plan to achieve organizational objectives; :* thirdly, business situations (and people's behaviour) are full of uncertainty, internally as well as externally to the business enterprise. :* fourthly, there is a necessity to economize, in human endeavours we are invariably concerned with an allocation of effort and resources so as to achieve a given set of objectives...Lowe, Ernest A. \\"On the idea of a management control system: integrating accounting and management control.\\" Journal of management Studies 8.1 (1971): 1-12.

The original church was small, with red tile roofing. Its ruins are across the al-Estwan River, away on a hilltop surrounded by pine and oak trees. The church, which may have dated to the fifth or sixth century, was surrounded by Maronite (Christian) villages on both sides of the Al-Estwan River. Sunni (Muslim) villages have been built near the ruins of the church over the past 200 years, replacing the Christians in the area after the invasion by the Ottoman Empire. Other church ruins exist in the village of Mazraate Baldah; one is the church of Al-Saaidah, the Virgin Mary. A 500-year-old oak tree with branches extending over 15 meters is revered by the Islamic villagers, who refer to the tree and surrounding ruins as Al-Saaidah.

McLeod, written by Bayard Veiller from his 1927 play of the same name. It had previously been made as a 1929 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer in her first all-talking role. There are significant differences in the two movie versions. The 1941 remake starred Laraine Day, Robert Young, Tom Conway, Frieda Inescort, John Litel, Marsha Hunt, Marjorie Main and Henry O'Neill. It was released on February 14, 1941, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Released from a reformatory after two years there for stealing $500, Mary Dugan is advised by a friend there, Agatha Hall, to change her name. Mary decides to go by Mary Andrews and her friend Aggie becomes a showgirl, now called Irene. Mary's father is hit by a car and killed. The car's owner, wealthy businessman Edgar Wayne, offers her a job. She eventually becomes his private secretary. She also meets the company's attorney, Jimmy Blake, and falls in love. But when Jimmy gets a job in South America, she can't marry him and go along because a birth certificate, required for a passport, would reveal Mary's true identity. A year later, Jimmy returns because Wayne has been murdered and Mary charged with the crime. He dislikes the way attorney West is handling her case and volunteers to replace him. Wayne's widow testifies that Mary and her husband were having an affair. Jimmy proves that West and the widow schemed to kill her husband, who was leaving her, and make Mary the scapegoat. She is found not guilty.

Lydia Escher was one of the richest women of Switzerland in the 19th century, patron of the arts and established the Gottfried Keller Foundation.  Life  = Origins and family = Lydia Escher was born into the Escher vom Glas family, an old and influential Z√ºrich family dynasty, as daughter of Augusta Escher-Uebel (1838‚Äì1864) and Alfred Escher (1819‚Äì1882). A scandal surrounding Alfred Escher's immediate forebears had, however, damaged her family line's reputation. Hans Caspar Escher-Werdm√ºller (1731‚Äì1781) had fathered a child out of wedlock with a maidservant in 1765 and emigrated. His son Hans Caspar Escher-Keller (1755‚Äì1831) almost brought Z√ºrich to financial ruin when he went bankrupt. Finally Alfred Escher's father Heinrich Escher (1776‚Äì1853) made a new fortune through speculative land deals and trading in Northern America. In 1814 Heinrich returned to Z√ºrich and married Lydia Zollikofer (1797‚Äì1868) in May 1815, having two children, Clementine (1816‚Äì1886) and Alfred. In 1857 Alfred Escher married Augusta Escher-Uebel (1838‚Äì1864): Lydia was born in 1858, but her sister Hedwig (1861‚Äì1862) died while still a baby. Lydia's suicide on 12 December 1891 brought the end to Alfred Escher's family line.Jung: Alfred Escher. 2009, pp. 464‚Äì492; Jung: Lydia Welti-Escher, 2009. = Childhood and youth = Lydia and her father Alfred Escher, around 1865 Lydia, probably around 1875 Belvoirpark in Z√ºrich Lydia Escher's grandfather Heinrich Escher had built the country house Belvoir on the left shore of Z√ºrichsee in the then village of Enge, as of today a district of the city of Z√ºrich, where Lydia grew up and lived. Heinrich Escher was able to devote himself fully to his passion for botany and his entomological collection, that also was cared by her father, and by Lydia. At the age of four years, Lydia lost her younger sister, and Lydia's mother died in 1864. So Alfred Escher was able to see his daughter several times a day, he rented for Lydia and her governess an apartment near his workplace in the city of Z√ºrich. Since he is no longer married, Lydia is increasingly becoming also a close friend and started to support his work actively. Alfred Escher tried as often as possible to spend time with his daughter, and they maintained a cordial relationship. Lydia Escher's youth differed substantially from those of other young women of Z√ºrich from bourgeois origin: Lydia conducted her father's correspondence, ran the household in the Belvoir estate, and she grew into the role of the hostess and entertainer of the numerous guests of Alfred Escher, among them the Swiss poet Gottfried Keller which was also a fatherly friend. Lydia Escher was a self-confident young woman, who read extensively, mastered several languages and gladly attended music and theatre performances. In her letters to her childhood friend, the painter Louise Breslau, she told to take singing and piano lessons, and Lydia was inspired by her creative genius. In addition to personal attacks from political opponents, Lydia's father faced serious health problems. He suffered repeated bouts of ill health throughout his life and on many occasions was obliged to spend long periods in convalescence. During the critical phase of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel construction in the mid-1870s, Escher nearly worked himself to death. In 1878 he fell so badly ill that he was unable to leave Belvoir for weeks. His life became a constant alternation between illness and recovery. However, fulfilling his political and business obligations, in late November 1882 Alfred Escher fell badly ill again, and in the morning of 6 December 1882 Alfred Escher died on his Belvoir estate. Throughout, Escher has been lovingly cared of his daughter, and she was regarded to be his only confidante, who oversaw much of his correspondence and accompanied her father on his many travels. = Marriage with Friedrich Emil Welti = Because the relationship between Alfred Escher and his former protege Emil Welti had deteriorated before, Escher was against Lydia's engagement with Welti's son Friedrich Emil. Since the engagement was already published, Lydia married after her father's death on 4 January 1883. Friedrich Emil Welti was the son of the Swiss Federal Councillor (Bundesrat) Emil Welti, one of the then most powerful people in Switzerland, and former companion and later opponent of Lydia's father. Welti rose in the Swiss economic circles thanks to his marriage with Lydia and sat on numerous board of directors. Meanwhile, Lydia Welti-Escher bored rapidly, not fulfilled by the management of Welti's comparatively modest household, and was missing interesting guests and stimulating conversations as she had in her father's household. Through her husband, she finally came in contact with his childhood friend Karl Stauffer-Bern, a known Swiss painter, in August 1885, and henceforth Stauffer was on occasion of his travels to Z√ºrich a guest at the Belvoir mansion. In his own atelier in the spacious park area, Stauffer portrayed Lydia Escher, but also Lydia's fatherly friend Gottfried Keller. Lydia and Emil Welti-Escher enabled Stauffer to work in Rome. In October 1889 Lydia and her husband moved to Florence, but shortly after, Friedrich Emil Welti went for financial reasons back to Switzerland, and left his wife in care of Karl Stauffer. = Liaison with Karl Stauffer-Bern = Lydia and Stauffer fell in love, and Lydia told to Stauffer's mother to marry him. In 1888, still under the sponsorship of his patrons, the Welti-Escher family, Karl Stauffer-Bern went to Rome to study sculpture. While there, the liaison of Lydia Welti-Escher with him got in the public focus, the Welti family was outraged, and Lydia and Karl escaped to Rome. Even the divorce from her husband was proposed, but Welti contacted the Swiss Embassy in Rome and used his considerable influence to separate them. Lydia was placed in a public insane asylum in Rome, and Stauffer-Bern was jailed after being charged with even kidnapping and rape. While staying there, Lydia posted the feminist (emancipatory) publication Gedanken einer Frau (literally: Thoughts of a woman) and planned to publish it. The document is still disappeared, as well as the majority of Lydia Escher's comprehensive correspondency was probably destroyed during this time. It is significant that still an important part of the Welti family archives is not accessible to researchers and historians. In May 1890, a full psychiatric report showed no sign of mental illness and Lydia Welti-Escher was released, she returned to her husband, although she soon filed for a divorce, which was eventually granted. In a state of despondency over the loss of his love, Karl Stauffer- Bern suffered a nervous breakdown, spent some time in the San Bonifazio mental hospital, and after his release, he attempted suicide by gun. In January 1891, unable to work and apparently suffering from persecution mania, he committed suicide. = Stigmatization and suicide = Tomb of Lydia Welti-Escher, Kings Cemetery, Geneva. After four months of internment in the public psychiatric hospital in Rome, Lydia Escher was finally brought back by her husband to Switzerland. She approved his desire of divorce and a financial agreement, which committed Lydia to a payment of 1.2 million Swiss Francs 'compensation' to Welti. In the 'high society' of Z√ºrich, Lydia was no longer accepted, and she was ostracized as an adulteress. Therefore, she moved into a house in Gen√®ve-Champel in the late summer of 1890. There Lydia Escher finished her last goal in life, the establishment of an Arts foundation, later named Gottfried Keller Stiftung, which she devoted to her fatherly friend from her youth. Lydia Welti-Escher decided to end her life on 12 December 1891; she opened the gas tap in her villa near Geneva. It was controversial discussed, whether according to Josef Jung's biography, Lydia had been examined after her detention in the psychiatric clinic in Rome, and upon returning to Switzerland (again) in the clinic of K√∂nigsfelden, if she resided there. The biographer Willi Wottreng claimed, for a further stay in K√∂nigsfelden, there are no sources; This is important, because it shows that Lydia Welti-Escher had resisted the will of her husband and father-in-law, thus demonstrating to be an emancipated woman after the events in Italy. The recently published psychiatric report about Lydia Escher, dated 27 May 1890, showed that her internment in the clinicum in Roma and the diagnosis of systematic madness was fictitious.Jung: Lydia Welti-Escher. 2009, p. 146 (Psychiatrisches Gutachten); Wottreng: Die Million√§rin und der Maler, p. 146; Von Arx: Der Fall Stauffer, p. 269. Also from today's perspective, the argument way of the reviewers and their conclusion, that Lydia Escher was in possession of their full mental health, convinced.Daniel Hell: Das Gutachten aus heutiger Sicht, in: Jung: Lydia Welti-Escher. 2009, p. 359.Jung: Lydia Welti-Escher. 2009, p. 163; von Arx: Der Fall Stauffer, p. 275.

With her remaining substantial asset ‚Äì Villa Belvoir and marketable securities totaling nominally 4 million Swiss Francs ‚Äì Lydia Escher established the foundation's base. According to the will of Lydia Escher, the foundation was established on 6 June 1890, and was managed by the Swiss Federal Council, thus, Lydia Escher wished to accomplish a patriotic work. The foundation should also promote the independent work of women, at least in the field of the applied of Arts, according to the original intention of the founder. This purpose was adopted ‚Äì but at the urging of Welti not in the deed of the foundation. The Gottfried Keller Foundation became though an important collection institution for art, but the feminist concerns of Lydia Escher but was not met.  Aftermath and monuments  Gottfried Keller foundation in Winterthur The Gottfried Keller foundation, as of today is based in Winterthur, and it is listed as a Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance. Lydia Escher is considered an outstanding woman of the Belle √âpoque in Switzerland, she blew up close social and moral standards of existence by their liaison with an artist, to which she open stood; and, on the other hand, Lydia Escher's historic achievement is in the creation of a Swiss art foundation of national importance.
