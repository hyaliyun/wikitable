The objectives were to provide an unbiased, industry-based source of educational information; to ensure interoperability among disparate, standards-based components and systems; to support the development of standards that support Ethernet technology; and to bring together the Ethernet industry to collaborate on the future of the technology. Organization The Ethernet Alliance work groups are called subcommittees. These subcommittees are focused on efforts around specific standards-based Ethernet initiatives. These standards can be developed in any Ethernet standards body, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Small Form Factor committee as well as supporting standards from organizations such as the Optical Internetworking Forum, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). , the working subcommittees within the Ethernet Alliance included: * 10G EPON focuses on the support of IEEE Std. 802.3av-2009 that extended the speed of EPON networks to 10 Gbit/s. * 10GBASE-T supports IEEE Std. 802.3an-2006 which defined a specification for running 10 Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair copper designated 10GBASE-T. * Carrier Ethernet helps guide work being done to support the specific, evolving and growing demands of Ethernet from carriers and service providers. * Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) work is largely based up EEE Standard 802.3az-2010. * Ethernet in the Data Center focus includes protocols such as Data Center Bridging (DCB), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), iSCSI, Remote direct memory access over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) and iWARP. * Higher Speed Ethernet encompasses all aspects of 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gbit/s Ethernet largely based op the work of IEEE Std. 802.3ab-2010. * Next Generation Enterprise Cabling whose goal is to gather and analyze data relative to observed deployment models, applications, and reaches, and then to share that information via a white paper with Ethernet Alliance members and standards bodies. * Power over Ethernet and Power over Ethernet Plus promotes the current capabilities of IEEE802.3at-2009, as well driving consensus with efforts to extend the power delivery and port-level resiliency capabilities of IEEE802.3at in the Ethernet community. * High Speed Modular Interconnects helps drive the adoption through demonstrating interoperability of compliant HS Modular Interconnect devices and ports including optical modules and copper cables. History In previous Ethernet technology iterations, an alliance was formed to support the adoption of that new technology into the market. The Ethernet Alliance was preceded by the Fast Ethernet Alliance, the Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (GEA), the 10 Gigabit Ethernet Alliance (10 GEA), and the Ethernet in the First Mile Alliance (EFMA). These alliances would dissolve a few years after the completion of the standards effort they supported. Unfortunately, this was often long before the technology would reach volume adoption and there was seldom support for smaller Ethernet standards projects. Brad Booth noticed that upon the dissolution of the 10GEA that there was still a strong desire by the end users and media for information about 10 Gigabit Ethernet and some of the new technology being created for 10 Gigabit Ethernet, primarily 10GBASE-T. He worked with others in the industry and the standards bodies to create an alliance that would exist as long as Ethernet technology existed. The Ethernet Alliance was formed with the goal to support IEEE 802 Ethernet standards, but later expanded its scope to include all standards that rely upon or are dependent upon IEEE 802 Ethernet standards. The Road to 100G Alliance was formally announced on June 19, 2007 at the NXTcomm 2007 show in Chicago, Illinois to promote 100 Gigabit Ethernet. The founding members were Bay Microsystems, Enigma Semiconductor, Integrated Device Technology, IP Infusion (part of the Access Company), and Lattice Semiconductor. It was headquartered in the Silicon Valley area of California. With the expanded charter and the formation of the HSE and Carrier Ethernet subcommittees, the Road to 100G alliance merged with the Ethernet Alliance on December 31, 2008. There were eighteen founding members of the Ethernet Alliance: 3Com (now HP), ADC (now Tyco Electronics), Agere Systems (now LSI), Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (now AppliedMicro), Aquantia, Broadcom, Force10 Networks (now Dell), Foundry Networks (now Brocade), Intel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Pioneer Corporation, Quake Technologies (now AppliedMicro), Samsung, Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation), Tehuti Networks, Tyco Electronics, the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH- IOL), and Xilinx. Education The Ethernet Alliance offers white papers, presentations, frequently asked questions and videos that provide comprehensive technical overviews of many different Ethernet technologies. These materials are available on the Ethernet Alliance public website and are available free of charge. These papers provide educational materials with an industry-based perspective. They may be based upon the work of Ethernet Alliance subcommittees or support the activities inside Ethernet standards bodies. The papers are intended to help buyers and users of Ethernet technologies better understand the status of various Ethernet technologies in the standards process, the interoperability tests that the Ethernet Alliance has tested, the capabilities of these technologies and much more. In addition to the library, the Ethernet Alliance gives members discounted or complimentary entrance to events, holds public demonstrations of various Ethernet technologies at trade shows where those interested in learning more about Ethernet can ask questions face-to-face and hosts Ethernet Alliance sponsored events called Technology Exploration Forums, or TEFs. TEFs offer face-to-face events to bring together members of the various Ethernet communities to discuss and explore the future of Ethernet technology. The Ethernet Alliance offers an opportunity for academic institutions to become involved in the organization for no fee. The Ethernet Alliance University Program (EAUP), allows professors and students to become involved in the organization and have access to member generated data, collaborate on educational materials, students can participate in an internship program and universities can contribute to the EAUP Intellectual Property Data Base.

It primarily focuses on two major muscle groups in the face, the corrugator supercilii group which is associated with frowning and the zygomaticus major muscle group which is associated with smiling. Uses Zygomaticus major muscle (associated with smiling) Facial EMG has been studied to assess its utility as a tool for measuring emotional reaction. Studies have found that activity of the corrugator muscle, which lowers the eyebrow and is involved in producing frowns, varies inversely with the emotional valence of presented stimuli and reports of mood state. Activity of the zygomatic major muscle, which controls smiling, is said to be positively associated with positive emotional stimuli and positive mood state. Facial EMG has been used as a technique to distinguish and track positive and negative emotional reactions to a stimulus as they occur. A large number of those experiments have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments using a range of stimuli, e.g., still pictures, movie clips and music pieces. It has also been used to investigate emotional responses in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Although commonly used as an index of emotional responses, facial muscle activity is also influenced by the social context in which it is measured. Using facial EMG in immersive virtual environments, Philipp, Storrs, and Vanman showed that even relatively impoverished social cues in a virtual environment can cause increases in zygomaticus major activity that are unrelated to self-reported emotional states. In 2012 Durso et al. were able to show that facial EMG could be used to detect confusion, both in participants who admitted being confused and in those who did not, suggesting that it could be used as an effective addition to a sensor suite as a monitor of loss of understanding or loss of situation awareness.Durso, F.T., Geldbach, K.M. and Cotbalis, P., \\"Detecting Confusion Using Facial Electromyography\\", Human Factors, Vol. 54, No. 1, February 2012. = Market research and gaming = Two areas where facial EMG techniques have been used are in advertising researchBoll, P.D., Lang, A., Potter, R.F., The Effects of Message Valence and Listener Arousal on Attention, Memory and Facial Muscular Responses to Radio Advertisements. Communication Research, Vol. 28 (2001). and in video gaming. # Advertising research - Of late, facial EMG has been used to test audience response to commercial advertising. Facial EMG activity measures during a viewing of commercials embedded in TV program clips have been used to describe a commercial's level of emotional activation and engagement. Measurement of the corrugator and zygomatic muscles, yield an overall positive and negative emotional activation score. The moment to moment activation that are recorded are said to measure the dynamic emotional response to a commercial and yield useful insights about the elements of the commercials. Lou et al. showed that facial EMG activity can be used to forecast how game players would be addicted to an online game before the game is officially introduced to the market. # Gaming and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) - Ravaja, Hazlett and Mandryk used facial EMG techniques to demonstrate that positive and negative emotions can be measured in real time during video game play. The emotional profiling of games give a useful evaluation of a game's impact on a player, how compelling they find the game, how the game measures up to other games in its genre, and how the different elements of the game enhance or detract from the game's approach to engaging the player.  Advantages  Proponents of Facial EMG point to the following advantages: # Facial Electromyography (or fEMG) is a precise and sensitive method to measure emotional expression. # Unlike self- reports, fEMG does not depend upon language and does not require cognitive effort or memory. # fEMG is capable of registering the response even when subjects were instructed to inhibit their emotional expression. # Yields a lot of data and is continuous and scalar (hence more credible.) # It is able to measure facial muscle activities to even weakly evocative emotional stimuli. # Less intrusive than other physiological measures like fMRI and EEG. # Like other physiological measures, facial EMG measurement technique is often the only useful approach when movement is not visible.  Criticisms  # The technique is intrusive and may alter natural expression. # The number of muscles it can employ is limited by how many electrodes can be attached to the face. # Certain medicines that act on the nervous system, such as muscle relaxants and anticholinergics, can change electromyography (EMG) results.

That same year the World Health Assembly endorsed the establishment of a Global Partnership to Stop TB.Stop TB Partnership  About Us Global Plan to End Tuberculosis The Global Plan 2016-2020 is a 5-year investment plan that represents the roadmap to accelerating impact on the TB epidemic and reaching the targets of the WHO End TB Strategy. This is the 4th Global Plan since the inception of Stop TB Partnership in 2000. This plan, based on the End TB strategy, aims to end TB and \\"walks away\\" from the limited approach aimed to \\"controlling\\" the diseases only. Specifically it speaks about preventing TB, active case finding and contact tracing, focusing attention to key vulnerable and marginalized groups, developing and roll out of new tools, and implementing TB services packages that are comprehensive and work in different type of epidemic and socioeconomic environments.  Main activities  The Partnership's activities focus chiefly on raising awareness about TB and advocating for greater commitment to and funding for TB prevention, treatment and research. The Partnership consists of a Coordinating Board, a Partnership Secretariat hosted by UNOPS in Geneva, Switzerland, and seven Working Groups (WG). It also provides TB drugs directly to countries heavily affected by the disease through its Global Drug Facility. External reviews  GiveWell review = Charity evaluator GiveWell first reviewed the Stop TB Partnership in July 2009.GiveWell's July 2009 review of Stop TB Partnership At the time, the Stop TB Partnership was given a 3 star rating (the highest possible). Until November 2011, the Stop TB Partnership was among GiveWell's top-rated charities, second only to VillageReach. In November 2011, GiveWell published an updated review of Stop TBGiveWell's 2011 review of Stop TB and concluded that \\"The Stop TB Partnership does not currently qualify for our highest ratings.\\" They elaborated by saying that: \\"As of November 2011, we do not have a clear understanding of Stop TB's room for more funding. We have discussed this question with Stop TB and hope to improve our understanding of this in the future.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The Stop TB Partnership * International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, Health Partnerships: Developing World - 2008 * The Stop TB Partnership‚Äôs response to the economic crisis.

Simon. The building uses an attenuated Classical style that was popular with Federal buildings in the 1930s. The post office opened on January 29, 1938, following delays in the start of construction. It closed in 2002, and was reopened in 2005 as a convention center for the nearby Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall. That year, it was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The building footprint is about , with a symmetrical facade. The building is one story in front, with a two-story section at the loading dock to the rear. The primary building material is brick, with cast stone accents. The building's most distinctive feature was removed in 1977 as part of accessibility improvements, when the original classical pediment and entry doors were removed and replaced by an aluminum storefront. The interior consists of a public lobby furnished with plaster walls and tile wainscot and floor. A work area and offices occupy the remain two thirds of the main level. A basement contains storage and utility spaces. History The Ely Post Office was built as part of an appropriation for post offices in Ely, Elko, Las Vegas and Reno, passed in June 1932. Plans to construct the post office were delayed because of a price dispute between the federal government and the owner of the preferred building site. The issue was settled in court in July 1933, and construction was to begin that month. However, from July 1933 to April 1937, the Nevada and federal governments disputed which of the two would have ownership of the land, with the federal government refusing to construct the post office until it was given complete jurisdiction of the property. Construction began in June 1937, and the post office was completed in late January 1938. It opened with a dedication ceremony on January 29, 1938. The post office closed in 2002, following the opening of a new postal facility in 1999. In October 2003, following efforts by U.S. Senator Harry Reid, it was announced that the postmaster general would make the building available to Ely for community use. In November 2003, the White Pine County commission approved a tentative plan to lease the building from the Postal Service for a nine- month term, on the condition that the county could receive federal funding to renovate the building. The county determined that the building would need an expansion to accommodate various county offices that were intended to be relocated there. The post office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 7, 2005 as US Post Office, Ely, Nevada. The post office remained vacant until it was purchased by the nearby Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall, which reopened the building as its Postal Palace convention center on December 15, 2005.

Early life Glasser was born of Jewish parents in Leeds, but when he was only a few months old his family moved to a tenement flat in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, which had gained notoriety as one of the biggest slums in Europe. His mother died when he was six and his two older sisters quickly decamped, leaving him to be raised alone by his father, who had a gambling addiction. > \\"The streets were slippery with refuse and often with drunken vomit. It was > a place of grime and poverty...The Victorian building, in red sandstone > blackened by smoke... was in decay. Splintered and broken floorboards > sometimes gave way under your feet. Interior walls carried patches of stain > from a long succession of burst pipes. Rats and mice moved about freely....\\" The kind of housing Glasser describes survived until the 1960s.\\"Housing Markets and Housing Institutions: An International Comparison\\" by Bj√∂rn H√•rsman and John M. Quigley, Springer, 1991, , p. 289. Glasser recalled the \\"recurrent struggle on the frontier of survival: mutuality and the informal economy\\".\\"Cultures of Selling: Perspectives on Consumption and Society Since 1700\\" ed. John Benson and Laura Ugolini, Ashgate Publishing, 2006, , p. 159. Displaying a precocious intellect, Glasser studied the Theory of Relativity as a boy and attended a lecture by Albert Einstein when he was thirteen. Family circumstances meant that he could not pursue academic studies and he went to work first as a \\"soap boy\\" for a barber then as a presser in a garment factory. In his spare time he studied at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. He attended socialist camps but retained throughout his life a sceptical outlook about politically constructed utopias.  Oxford  Glasser continued his studies and in the late 1930s won a scholarship to Oxford. His response to one of the set questions \\"Has science increased human happiness?\\" was an emphatic \\"No.\\" He cycled more than 300 miles to Oxford wearing a pair of khaki shorts. He first attended Ruskin College, then moved to Magdalen College, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He described the difficulties people had relating to a working-class student: > \\"In pre-war days for a Gorbals man to come up to Oxford was unthinkable as > to meet a raw bushman in the St James club, something for which there were > no stock responses. In any case for a member of the boss class, someone from > the Gorbals was in effect a bushman, the Gorbals itself as distant and > unknowable as the Kalahari Desert\\".Access, Participation and Higher > Education: Policy and Practice, ed. Annette Hayton and Anna Paczuska, > Routledge, 2002, , p. 8, He tended to hide the fact that he was Jewish, in view of the prejudice prevailing in the society of his day, which \\"burdened every step of our lives\\" and resulted in the need \\"to bury it beneath some protective colouring, so that we might go our private ways like everybody else\\".The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000, Todd M. Endelman, University of California Press, 2002, , p. 201. At Oxford Philip Toynbee tried unsuccessfully to recruit him to the Communist Party. After serving in the Second World War he resumed his studies, and met such celebrities of the time as Victor Gollancz, whose daughter he dated for a while, and Harold Laski.  Post-war years  Glasser took another degree in economics at the London School of Economics and began work in public relations, the British Council and advisory roles for Asian and African governments. He met many famous people as his horizons expanded but he felt \\"the Gorbals at my shoulder always, like the Hound of Heaven\\". He moved for a time to a village in Italy which resulted in a book, The Net and the Quest and a documentary by the BBC. On the Council of Christians and Jews he worked with Father Tom Corbishley and Hugo Gryn.  Autobiography  Growing Up in the Gorbals, the first volume of his highly praised autobiographical trilogy, was published in 1986. It was followed by Gorbals Boy at Oxford in 1988 and Gorbals Voices, Siren Songs in 1990. In his last book, Gorbals Legacy (2000), he looked back again at how his \\"Faustian Familiar\\" had moulded and influenced his path through life.

After the discovery of oil in Venezuela in the early 20th century to the 1940s, agriculture has declined rapidly, and with the beginning of large-scale industrial development in the 1940s, agriculture and land reform was largely neglected by successive governments (although a 1960 land reform law did see 200,000 families receive land, largely in the early 1960s). Since 1999, under the Bolivarian Revolution of President Hugo Ch√°vez, agriculture has had a somewhat higher priority. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela imports most of its food, mainly from Colombia and the United States. History Prior to the 1950s and the initiation of large-scale oil exports, agriculture, fishing, and forestry were central to the Venezuelan economy, producing more than half the gross domestic product (GDP). As late as the 1930s, agriculture still provided 22% of GDP and employed 60% of the labor force. As the petrochemical industry expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, however, the proportion of the labor force in agriculture dropped from one- fifth to about one-tenth. By 1988 agriculture contributed only 5.9% of GDP, employed 13% of the labor force, and furnished barely 1% of total exports. Agriculture has continued to decline, accounting for about 5% of GDP and 10% of employment in 2004.Venezuela country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (March 2005). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. According to a 1997 government survey, 3.4m hectares of land are suitable for farming (and a further 17.1m hectares suitable for pasture) - but only 0.7m hectares were employed in grain production.USDA, Venezuela: Agricultural Overview , accessed 21 May 2009 Venezuela saw several attempts at land reform before 1998. During the brief first period of democracy (El Trienio Adeco, 1945‚Äì48), the Democratic Action government redistributed land which it said had been gained illicitly by members of previous governments,Alexander, Robert. \\"Nature and Progress of Agrarian Reform in Latin America.\\" The Journal of Economic History. Vol. 23, No. 4 (Dec., 1963), pp 559-573. and in mid-1948 it enacted an agrarian reform law. Most of the land redistributed in this way was returned to its previous owners during the 1948-58 dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. After the 1958 restoration of democracy, a new land reform law was enacted in March 1960, with reform in the early 1960s concentrated in the northeastern states of Miranda, Aragua and Carabobo, and coming largely from expropriated private landholdings. The reform was accompanied by a considerable increase in agricultural production. Ultimately the reform saw about 200,000 families receive transfers of land, largely in the early 1960s.Gregory Wilpert, \\"Land for people not profit in Venezuela\\", in Peter Rosset, Raj Patel, Michael Courville, Land Research Action Network (2006), Promised land: competing visions of agrarian reform. Food First Books. p251 Bolivarian Revolution Venezuela's present-day agriculture is characterized by inefficiency and low investment, with 70% of agricultural land owned by 3% of agricultural proprietors (one of the highest levels of land concentration in Latin America). According to the Land and Agricultural Reform Law of 2001 (see Mission Zamora), public and private land deemed to be illegally held or unproductive is to be redistributed. As of January 2009, the Venezuelan government had redistributed nearly 2.7 million hectares of idle land (6.6 million acres‚Äînearly 1/3 of the latifundio land existing prior to 1998) to 180,000 landless peasant families. A new Bolivarian Mission, Mission Vuelta al Campo was announced in 2005; it seeks to encourage impoverished and unemployed urban Venezuelans to willingly return to the countryside. This has involved using land recovered from private owners where ownership could not be demonstrated, as well as nationalisation. For example, in 2008 the government expropriated El Frio, a 63,000 hectare estate in Apure (larger than the tourist island of Isla Margarita), as its owners (reputed to include Nelson Rockefeller) could not demonstrate legal land title.Venezuelanalysis, 8 September 2008, Venezuelan Government Turns Large Estates Into Socialist Production Centers The Venezuelan government has also employed foreign expertise to develop Venezuela's agricultural potential, for example by working with Vietnamese agronomists to develop planting techniques and rice seed hybrids appropriate to Venezuelan agricultural conditions.Venezuelanalysis, 15 May 2009, Venezuela Uses Recovered Land to Plant Rice with Vietnamese Assistance The land reform program has nevertheless been the subject of criticism from a variety of sources, with farmers said to be lacking sufficient government support,In Venezuela, Land Redistribution Program Backfires by Juan Forero, NPR, 15 July 2009 particularly in the case of urban residents moving to the countryside to develop farming cooperatives. The government has confiscated and expropriated much of the industry . State intervention has seriously damaged the agricultural sector , and Venezuela imports most of its food. There are persistent shortages of common foodstuffs. The government blames \\"hoarders\\" and \\"speculators\\" for food shortages. The government created Misi√≥n Agro-Venezuela to support small and medium farm production of the basic foods most commonly consumed in the country.

He did however introduce a Private Members' Bill into the House of Commons on behalf of the Surveyors' Institution, for the registration of the profession and to protect the public from employing unqualified personnel as surveyors, land agents or auctioneers.The Times, 12 April 1923 p8 However the Bill failed to pass as Chatfeild-Clarke did not achieve a sufficiently high placing in the Private Members' Ballot but the seed of future regulation of the profession had been sown.http://www.francisbennion.com/pdfs/fb/1968/1968-003-estate-agents- registration.pdf PoliticsLocal politics= Chatfeild-Clarke did however inherit his father's politics. He was first elected to the Isle of Wight County Council in 1900 and remained a member up until the time of his death in 1925. He also served as a Justice of the Peace, a member of the Isle of Wight Education Committee and as a member of the IoW Advisory Committee re the appointment of Magistrates. He was an officer of the Island Liberal Federation, being its President in 1920.The Times, 18 June 1920 p13 =Parliament=1922 Chatfeild-Clarke stood for Parliament on one occasion only, at the 1922 general election in the Isle of Wight constituency. The seat had been represented by the Conservatives since January 1910 but it had elected Liberals in 1880 and 1906. In 1904, John Seely who had been elected as a Conservative in 1900 defected to the Liberals, so there was some radical tradition for Liberals to exploit there in 1922. Although there was a Labour candidate standing in 1922, dividing the progressive vote, he lost his deposit gaining 11.2% of the poll. The Conservative vote was also badly split by the intervention of an Independent Conservative candidate, who took 21% of the poll. This allowed Chatfeild-Clarke to top the poll with a majority of 1,582 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p379 1923 Chatfeild- Clarke decided that he did not wish to stand again for Parliament again.

Two were built but insufficient torsional stiffness in the wings led to control problems and the DH.52 was rapidly abandoned. Development The DH.52Flight, October 1922 was de Havilland's only glider, built to compete for the ¬£1000 prize in the Daily Mail Gliding Competition, held at Itford, Sussex in 1922. It was a high-wing monoplane with an aspect ratio of 11.4; the wing was wire braced, with pairs of wires from the keel to the front and rear wing spars at about ‚Öì and ¬æ span. Similar pairs of wires to a central kingpost supported the weight of the wings and kept the bracing in tension. The kingpost consisted of two members, one from each wing spar at the centre line, meeting about above the wing. The resulting triangular structure appears to have been covered with cambric.The light coloured kingpost does not show up well in reproduced photos, the bracing wires even less Unbalanced ailerons with an unusually large angular travel were fitted, in order to maintain control at low speeds. The square section fuselage was built from cross braced spruce longerons and covered with plywood. At the nose these longerons curved together, giving the glider a slight boat-like look. The single seat cockpit was just in front and below the wing. There was a cambric fairing round the cockpit and also behind the wing to the tail, the latter made by stretching the material over a wire that ran from the wing mounting to the rear fuselage. The fin and generous rudder were a slightly pointed version of the characteristic de Havilland shape; the elevator area was also large compared with that of the fixed tailplane. Two DH.52s were built. The first machine (competition no.4) had a single cross axle, strutted undercarriage for its first flight on 5 October 1922, but this was replaced by a pair of smaller wheels mounted close to the fuselage sides on an axle fixed to the lower longerons. The second (no. 33) had this undercarriage from the start. Both aircraft flew in the competition on 16 October with rubber rope launches. They each flew for about 2¬Ω mins, but both were damaged on landing. Both showed problems with lateral control, the wings twisting under the aileron loads, cancelling their effects. No. 33 was flying again three days later, now with wing warping to try to beat the control problems, but the wing twisted so much after tow release that the centre section failed and the aircraft was lostFlight, November 1922 The pilot was not seriously hurt, but it was clear the torsional stiffness of the wing was insufficient and nothing could be done about within the competition time limits, so no more flights were made and the two DH.52s were scrapped.

It was then proposed that he become a monk like his brother, but instead he entered the French army as a trooper, receiving his discharge at Aire after six months. He spent some time in Douai at the English College, then moved to Paris. It was in Paris in about 1676 (although he was vague about the precise date) that he claimed to have met the English Catholic peer William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford. Stafford for his part insisted at his trial in 1680 that he had never seen Turberville in his life, and this was probably true, although Stafford was often abroad, and he was certainly in France in 1678.Kenyon p.46 Popish Plot Turberville claimed that Stafford had tried to hire him to assassinate King Charles II of England but never explained why he waited so long to reveal the fact.Kenyon pp. 231-2 He first told this improbable tale at the Bar of the English House of Commons in November 1680.

Edward had already acted briefly as a priest-hunter, using his local knowledge of the large Catholic community in South Wales, but without much success, on one occasion suffering the embarrassment of being arrested himself.Kenyon p.245 Turberville duly gave evidence against Stafford at his trial before the House of Lords on a charge of high treason. Largely on this testimony, Stafford was found guilty and beheaded on 29 December 1680.Kenyon p.232 There were discrepancies between the dates Tuberville gave at the trial and those in the affidavit he had sworn previously. Also, presumably in an effort to add convincing background detail to his story (Titus Oates had always been good at this) he claimed that Stafford suffered from gout, which was untrue. However Stafford, like all those charged with treason before the Treason Act 1695, was denied legal counsel: he did catch Turberville out in one or two mistakes, but did not exploit his advantage as a good lawyer might have. Crucially the Lords were not told that on being received into the Church of England, Turberville told William Lloyd, Bishop of Worcester, that he knew nothing of any Catholic plot, other than a little gossip. His motives for turning informer seem to have been purely financial: he was a poor man, and remarked that \\"he was fit for no trade but an informer\\". His later change of stance he justified by saying that \\"if the Protestants deserted him, goddamn it he would not starve.\\" Family loyalty seems to have been no part of his character: during his career as a priest-hunter he attempted to arrest a priest at the home of his brother Christopher at Sker, although Christopher would in theory be liable to the death penalty for harbouring a priest as a result.Kenyon p.245: in practice the penalty was obsolete, but during the Plot the Government issued two warnings to the Roman Catholic laity as to the risks they were running by sheltering priests. After the Plot In 1681 the Crown at last turned on the instigators of the Plot, beginning with the unsavoury minor informers Edward Fitzharris and Stephen College. After the trial of Fitzharris, Turberville reading the straws in the wind, or as Gilbert Burnet thought, being \\"under new (i.e. Crown) management\\" gave evidence against College who was found guilty of treason and executed.Kenyon p.276 This led to a breach between Turberville and Titus Oates, the inventor of the Plot, whom Turberville now denounced as a villain. He also gave evidence against his former patron Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who was indicted for treason in November 1681. The following month he fell ill of smallpox and died, supposedly fulfilling a prophecy of Lord Stafford that Turberville would not outlive him by even a year. Despite rumours that he returned to the Catholic faith at the end, in fact he was attended by Thomas Tenison, the future Archbishop of Canterbury. To the surprise of many, he maintained to the end the truth of his charges against Stafford.Kenyon p.279 Gilbert Burnet wrote that the truth of the matter was a mystery not to be solved in this life.Kenyon p.380 NotesReferences * Category:1648 births Category:1681 deaths Category:British perjurers Category:People associated with the Popish Plot ","title":"Edward Turberville"},{"id":"22887892","text":"The 519th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit.

The squadron did not receive aircraft to begin training until October, after it had moved to Drew Field, Florida. It served as an operational training unit with various aircraft, providing cadres to \\"satellite groups\\" and as a replacement training unit, training individual pilots.See Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi However, the AAF was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each AAF base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 In this reorganization the squadron was disbanded in 1944 as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. It was replaced, along with other units at Woodward Army Air Field, by the 267th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Fighter) in a reorganization of the AAF in which all units not programmed for deployment overseas were replaced by AAF Base Units to free up manpower for assignment overseas. =Cold War air defense= During the Cold War the squadron was reconstituted, redesignated as the 519th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated at Sioux City Municipal Airport, Iowa in December 1954, where it was assigned to the 521st Air Defense Group.Cornett & Johnson, p. 83 The squadron replaced the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved to England from Sioux City.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 299‚Äì300 At Sioux City, the squadron flew airborne intercept radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabre aircraft.Cornett & Johnson, p.128 The 521st Group was inactivated and replaced by the 53d Fighter Group (Air Defense)Maurer, Combat Units, p. 115 in 1955 as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to reestablish the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.Buss, Sturm, Volan, & McMullen, p.6 The squadron was inactivated along with the group and its equipment and personnel were transferred to the 13th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was simultaneously activated.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 73 Lineage * Constituted as the 637th Bombardment Squadron (Dive) on 23 March 1943 : Activated on 5 April 1943 : Redesignated 519th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 10 August 1943 : Disbanded on 1 April 1944 * Reconstituted and redesignated 519th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 4 November 1954 : Activated on 8 December 1954 : Inactivated on 18 August 1955 =Assignments= * 408th Bombardment Group (later 408th Fighter- Bomber Group), 5 April 1943 ‚Äì 1 April 1944 * 521st Air Defense Group, 8 December 1954 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 =Stations= * Key Field, Mississippi, 5 April 1943 * Drew Field, Florida, 24 September 1943 * Abilene Army Air Field, Texas, 10 November 1943 * DeRidder Army Air Base, Louisiana, 11 February 1944 * Woodward Army Air Field, Oklahoma, 26 March ‚Äì 1 April 1944 * Sioux City Municipal Airport, Iowa, 8 December 1954 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 =Aircraft= * Douglas A-24 Banshee, 1943‚Äì1944 * North American A-36 Apache, 1943‚Äì1944 * Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, 1943‚Äì1944 * Republic P-47 Thunderbolt 1943‚Äì1944 * North American F-86D Sabre, 1954‚Äì1955 ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Buss, Lydus H.

When it received the request, a Barclays employee replied that it had frozen the bank account. But it had not, and the customer proceeded to empty all of the money from the account.

It held, however, that in this case, because the bank was required by law to comply with the freezing order, there could not be said to have arisen any assumption of responsibility on Hedley Byrne grounds. Applying then the Caparo test, it was held to not be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability. The bank was therefore not required to reimburse Customs and Excise for the dissipated money.

Set mainly in Paris in 1920, it is based on a possible real-life affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky. Plot summary Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring has its Paris premiere on 29 May 1913. Coco is mesmerised by the power of Igor's composition, but the audience is scandalised by its discordant, rhythmic music and Nijinsky's primitive choreography. Coco finally meets Igor seven years later, at a dinner hosted by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. Igor has been forced to flee Russia ‚Äì with his wife and four children ‚Äì following the Russian Revolution. Coco invites him to bring his family to stay with her at her villa in Garches ‚Äì 'Bel Respiro'. Couturi√®re and composer soon begin an affair. Both experience a surge of creativity; while Coco creates Chanel No. 5 (with perfumer Ernest Beaux), Igor's compositions display a new, liberated style. But Igor's wife, Katerina, becomes ill with consumption and an unbearable tension takes hold of 'Bel Respiro' and its occupants. Structure The piano keyboard operates as a framework for the novel. There are eighty-eight chapters, corresponding to the number of keys on a piano.

The film was selected to occupy the prestigious closing slot at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 24 May 2009. The riotous premiere of The Rite of Spring at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es on 29 May 1913 is legendary (see: The Rite of Spring#Premiere). Historical context In the spring of 1920, Chanel was introduced to Stravinsky by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. During the summer, Chanel discovered that the Stravinsky family was seeking a place to live. She invited them to \\"Bel Respiro\\" until they could find a more suitable residence (they arrived in the second week of September and stayed until May 1921). Chanel also guaranteed the 1920 Ballets Russes production of The Rite of Spring against financial loss with an anonymous gift to Diaghilev, said to be 300,000 francs. The personal relationships depicted in the novel are largely fictionalised. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer who had several affairs, including one with Chanel. Whereas Stravinsky never publicly referred to this alleged affair, Chanel spoke about it at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946 (the conversation was published thirty years later as l'Allure de Chanel). The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed both by Stravinsky's second wife, Vera, and by his close musical collaborator, Robert Craft. The Chanel fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.Fact-or-fiction Chanel-Stravinsky affair curtains Cannes. Swiss News, 25 May 2009.

Its architectural style is Gothic Revival with a mixture of Early English and Decorated. It is built in stone which is ashlar both externally and internally. The internal furnishings are in detailed joinery which were designed by Douglas. The windows contain a compete set of stained glass by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. Within a south buttress is a crucifixion panel which was formerly part of a 14th-century churchyard cross.

Briscoe, Randall S. Schuler, Routledge, 2004, p. 189. It was founded in 1986 by Frits Philips, president of Philips, and Olivier Giscard d'Estaing, along with Ryuzaburo Kaku, president of Canon. Frits Philips had been alarmed to hear from reliable sources that the Japanese were dumping their products on the Western market and he feared a growing trade war. He saw the need for trustbuilding between international executives and for Corporate Social Responsibility practices. The CRT‚Äôs Principles for Business were published in 1994, incorporating western concepts (human dignity...) and Japanese ones (kyosei, interpreted as ‚Äúliving and working together for the common good‚Äù). An international code of good practices written by such senior industrialists from such varied backgrounds remains exceptional today. It was presented to the UN Social Summit in Copenhagen in 1994. It has since become a standard work, translated into 12 languages, and has been used as basis for their internal ethical assessments by international companies such as Nissan. The CRT's principal activities are an annual meeting and the publication of best- practice guides for various types of organization. Every three years, the annual meeting is held at Caux, Switzerland, where the original initiative took place in 1986.Thomas W. Dunfee and Thomas J.

Young; it has set up chapters in many regions of the world. Stephen. B. Young is the Global Executive Director of the Caux Round Table, an international network of experienced business leaders who advocate a principled approach to global capitalism. Young has published Moral Capitalism, a well-received book written as a guide to use of the Caux Round Table ethical and socially responsible Principles for Business. In 2008 Prof. Sandra Waddock of the Carroll School of Management of Boston College listed Young among the 23 persons who created the corporate social responsibility movement in her book The Difference Makers. For the Caux Round Table, Young has partnered with scholars at the International Islamic University of Malaysia to formulate interpretations of Qur'anic guidance for good governance that emphasize the convergence between Qur'an teachings and the global standards advocated by the Caux Round Table.

He was born in 1880 in Doha, the capital city of Qatar. He then abdicated in favour of his crown prince and second son, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, in 1940. Sheikh Hamad died eight years later and Sheikh Abdullah assumed office once again until 1949, when he stepped down from office in favour for his eldest son, Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani. Oil was also discovered for the first time during his rule. BiographyEarly life and reign= Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani was born in the year 1880, in Doha, the capital city and state of Qatar, by his father, Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani. Although his mother is still unknown, he was born along with his eighteen siblings, with him being the 5th eldest among his siblings. He then ruled Qatar until 1940. Sheikh Abdullah's heir apparent, Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, ruled Qatar from 1940 until his early death in 1948. Sheikh Abdullah became the ruler of Qatar once again until 1949, when he abdicated in favour of his eldest son. Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani, his eldest son, then ruled Qatar after his father's abdication. = Contributions =Ottoman Empire and Great Britain era *Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire accorded their recognition to Sheikh Abdullah and his successors' right to rule over the whole of the Qatari Peninsula. The Ottomans renounced all their rights to Qatar and following the outbreak of the First World War; Sheikh Abdullah forced the Ottomans to abandon Doha on 19 August 1915. =Treaties for protection= *On 3 November 1916, Britain, to bring Qatar under its Trucial System of Administration, signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah. While Sheikh Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without prior consent of the British Government, Percy Zachariah Cox, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who signed the treaty on behalf of his government, guaranteed the protection of Qatar 'from all aggression by sea'. *On 5 May 1935, Sheikh Abdullah was able to obtain Britain's agreement for the protection of Qatar from inside as well as any attacks from external forces. Structures built *In 1927, Sheikh Abdullah built the Al Koot Fort, also known as Doha Fort, in the Al Bidda neighbourhood, in the midst of Souq Waqif, near Doha Corniche, in Doha, the capital city and state of Qatar, to serve as a police station, at the same time, to protect the Souq Waqif from thieves. *In 1938, Sheikh Abdullah built the famous Zubarah Fort, in the town of Zubarah, which in turn, is located in the Al Shamal municipality, on the northwestern coast of the Qatari peninsula, about 105 km from Doha. Discovery of oil *Following British recognition of Sheikh Hamad, the second son of Sheikh Abdullah as the Heir Apparent of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah signed the first Oil Concession Agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on 17 May 1935. Accordingly, in October 1938, drilling of the first well in Qatar began and the discovery of oil was made at Dukhan structure in January 1940. However, the oil wells were capped as the Second World War progressed. *Sheikh Abdullah's last act as ruler was the signing of a Seabed Concession with Central Mining and Investment Corporation Ltd. on 5 August 1949. He died on 25 April 1957. Appointment of the next Emir *On 30 June 1948, Sheikh Abdullah appointed Sheikh Ali Bin Abdullah Al-Thani as the Deputy Ruler of Qatar, following the death of Sheikh Hamad on 27 May 1948, and after abdicating for his eldest son. =Marriage and children= Although Sheikh Abdullah's first wife is Sheikha Maryam bint Abdullah Al Attiyah, he further married a second wife named Sheikha Fatima bint Isa Al Thani, daughter of Sheikh Isa bin Thamer Al Thani, to whom he bore his third son, Sheikh Hassan bin Abdullah Al Thani. In total, Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani had three sons. He also had a daughter that she left at the age of 20 with a lover from Chania Greece *HH Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani *HH Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani *HE Sheikh Hassan bin Abdullah Al Thani Death Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani died on 25 April 1957 by a natural death.

It served as an operational training unit with various aircraft, providing cadres to \\"satellite groups\\" and as a replacement training unit, training individual pilots.See Craven & Cate, Introduction, p. xxxvi However, the AAF was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each AAF base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 In this reorganization the squadron was disbanded in 1944 as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system and was replaced, along with other units at Woodward Army Air Field, by the 267th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Fighter) in a reorganization of the AAF in which all units not programmed for deployment overseas were replaced by AAF Base Units to free up manpower for assignment overseas. =Cold War air defense= During the Cold War the squadron was reconstituted in December 1954.

History  Based in the San Fernando Valley, Moore Industries, started out over four decades ago when company founder Leonard W. Moore, wanted to solve integration problems in the process management industries. Working out of a friend‚Äôs garage, Moore designed and built the first Moore Industries SCT signal converter, which soon evolved into a product line of six signal interfaces. In 1974, he built the current headquarters in North Hills, CA to facilitate the company‚Äôs growth. Today, Moore Industries is an international company with direct sales offices in worldwide locations including the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, and the People's Republic of China. These offices oversee an expansive network of independent representatives and agents serving every corner of the globe.http://www.miinet.com/aboutus/ In the early 1980s, Moore invested heavily in a before-its-time brain child called the Moore 1002. The numeric designation came from the company initials [MII] which in Roman Numerals equals 1002. The 1002 was designed to be a signal processing computer, taking the place of rack upon rack of individual signal conditioners by centralizing and offering the first ever digital processing of control signals. The 1002 was a hybrid device which stood six feet high and while it had digital internal processing, it offered true analog output on a per channel basis, not a stepped or fake analog based on digital sampling. The 1002 was massive and expensive and since each signal had to be brought in on two wires and back out on two additional wires, it was unwieldy and required a large space just for cabling. While a complete flop as a product, the 1002 pointed the way forward in signal conditioning for the future. In the late 1980s, Moore sought to push back market complaints over the then-industry-standard 8-week lead time for hand-soldered signal conditioners in order to meet market demand. Rather than changing production methods from hand assembly and risking a compromise to quality, Moore created the STAR Center which could stage nearly complete modules which would be assembled rapidly based on customer specifications for 48-hour shipment. This customer service came at a price of $150 per unit which in some cases was a 100% premium, but it allowed Moore to fill priority orders where the company had been losing orders due to lead time. http://www.miinet.com/Portals/0/Manuals/PIX_Installation_Manual_Moore_Industries.pdf In June 2009, Moore Industries was granted ISO 9001:2008 certification for their Quality Management System by UL DQS Inc., an ANSI-ASQ Accredited Registrar.

He earned the medal as an enlisted man for ignoring heavy fire and his own severe injuries to drag a wounded marine to safety. Although he lost his left leg in the fight, he went on to complete two more terms of service with the Navy, one as a radio operator during World War I and another as a 50-year-old commissioned officer in World War II. Early life and career Born on June 14, 1892, in Providence, Rhode Island,Steve Fitzgibbon. \\"Edward Gisburne Hoed Own Row and it was Rough.\\" Boston Daily Record, September 5, 1932, p. 13. Gisburne attended school in Quincy, Massachusetts. He came from a family with a tradition of naval service, with six generations having served in the Navy since the American Civil War. An only child, Gisburne's father died when he was 5, and his mother died months later. He eventually moved in with his paternal grandparents in Washington, D.C., where he lived for the next ten years. In 1910, he graduated from Washington's McKinley Manual Training School. He held a childhood interest in electricity and later wireless telegraphy which led to a career in radio technology. After his graduation, Gisburne worked for an electrical company in Boston for a few months before finding work at the Boston Navy Yard. While there, he and a group of friends decided on a whim to join the Navy; Gisburne enlisted for a four-year term of service on August 30, 1910. He was first stationed as a signaler on the battleship and then on the supply ship . Veracruz and World War I In early 1914, Gisburne, by then an electrician third class, was transferred to the and became the battleship's chief radio operator. On April 21, 1914, in the midst of the ongoing Mexican Revolution, Florida was one of three U.S. Navy ships which landed a combined Navy and Marine Corps force at Veracruz, Mexico, in response to the Tampico Affair. The landings began a three-day battle which ended with U.S. occupation of the city. alt=Round portrait of a young man wearing a military hat and jacket. Accompanying Florida's landing party, Gisburne and others made their way to the roof of Veracruz's Terminal Hotel in order to establish a communications station. When the position came under fire, a Marine Corps rifle squad was sent to provide protection. The first marine to reach the roof, Private Daniel A. Haggerty of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was almost immediately shot in the stomach and fell such that he was partially hanging off the roof. Gisburne himself was severely wounded in the legs, leaving him unable to walk. Despite this, he crawled through the continuous heavy fire to reach the unconscious Haggerty, pulled him fully onto the roof, and then dragged him to a place of shelter before falling unconscious himself. The two were found still sitting on the roof, with Haggerty dead in Gisburne's arms. Gisburne eventually recovered from his injuries, but his left leg had to be amputated at mid-thigh. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Veracruz two months after the battle, on June 15, and was discharged from the Navy after a further two months, on August 17. Gisburne's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > On board the U.S.S. Florida during the seizure of Vera Cruz, Mexico, 21 and > 22 April 1914, and for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession > during this action. On April 5, 1917, exactly one day before the U.S. entered World War I by declaring war on Germany, Gisburne rejoined the Navy at the warrant officer rank of gunner (radio). Due to his missing leg, he had to get a waiver from the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, before he could rejoin. He was promoted to the commissioned officer rank of ensign on January 12, 1918, and to lieutenant (junior grade) on December 5 of that year (retroactive to November 20). A radio operator, Gisburne handled communications for all cruisers and transports operating in the Atlantic Ocean during the war. He was serving on the transport when it carried President Woodrow Wilson to Europe for the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Gisburne was given a medical retirement on August 9, 1920, two years after the end of the war. Civilian life After his first enlistment in the Navy, Gisburne settled in Milton, Massachusetts, where he would live for 35 years. He married Ena Frye of Boston and the couple had two sons, Edward Jr. and John. He held a number of jobs, including as a teacher of classes about radio at Boston College, a reporter for The Patriot Ledger in Quincy,\\"Ex-Reporter of Ledger to Join WEEI.\\" Quincy (MA) Patriot-Ledger, January 7, 1928, p. 1. and a district manager for the Boston Edison Company. He began a broadcasting career with Boston radio station WEEI in late 1927. He started as an editor and, from 1928 through the 1930s, was an announcer. Gisburne was an avid golfer with the Wollaston Golf Club and participated in the Engineers Club of Boston. He was also active in civic affairs, becoming a member of the Milton Town Club and twice being elected to the Milton School Committee, in 1935 and 1938. World War II and later years Despite being both an amputee and 50 years old, Gisburne began a third stint in the Navy after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He served as a lieutenant at Naval Air Station Quonset Point in Rhode Island. Both of his sons also served in the war. The older son, Edward Jr., fought in the Pacific theater with the 40th Bombardment Group and earned the Air Medal for his actions in aerial combat with the Japanese; he was killed in action at age 29 on May 26, 1945, when his B-29 Superfortress went down. Gisburne and his wife moved to Duxbury, Massachusetts, in 1950. He died at age 63 on August 29, 1955, at Chelsea Naval Hospital in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

The experiment, part of the Operation Grommet nuclear test series, tested the unique W71 warhead design for the LIM-49 Spartan anti-ballistic missile. With an explosive yield of almost , the test was the largest underground explosion ever detonated by the United States. Prior to the main five-megaton test in 1971, a test took place on the island on October 2, 1969, for calibration purposes, and to ensure the subsequent Cannikin test could be contained. This test, Milrow, was included in the Operation Mandrel nuclear test series. The Cannikin test faced considerable opposition on environmental grounds. The campaigning environmental organization Greenpeace grew out of efforts to oppose the test. Siting The Cannikin test was too large to be conducted safely in Nevada. Amchitka had been considered in the 1950s as a potential nuclear test site, but had been deemed unsuitable at that time. In 1965, a single nuclear test, Long Shot, was carried out on the island for the purposes of seismic test detection development, under program Vela Uniform. Preparation Preparation for the test took place over five years and involved hundreds of staff from the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, later the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Drilling for the shaft for the Milrow test began in March 1967, with drilling for the Cannikin test commencing in August 1967. To perform the test, 400 tons of equipment was placed in a shaft deep and wide. Test support equipment was designed to survive a ground upheaval of at test time. The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, James R. Schlesinger, brought his wife and two daughters to Amchitka for the test to emphasize the safety of the test. Opposition Both the 1969 calibration test and Cannikin itself attracted protest.

The ship was turned back by the U.S. Coast Guard. However, under this name, the organization created for the protest continued to exist as the campaigning environmental organization Greenpeace. In July 1971, the anti-nuclear Committee for Nuclear Responsibility filed suit against the Atomic Energy Commission, asking the court to stop the test.

She initially performed professionally as a classical musician, but was persuaded to move to night club playing by Mischa Rosenbaum. She then performed under the name of Tania Lubova and/or Tania Lee Lova. She was murdered by Rosenbaum, 31, who had become her manager/ director in a West 43rd Street, Manhattan, New York rehearsal studio, in 1937. Rosenbaum was a married man when he became infatuated with Nussenbaum, although he had been separated from his wife for two years. On the day prior to the slaying Rosenbaum telephoned Nussenbaum and arranged a meeting, to which she reluctantly agreed. Prior to their rendezvous at the studio Rosenbaum became intoxicated drinking red wine. Rosenbaum found a hammer at the Hotel Normandie which he brought with him to the meeting. He claimed that Nussenbaum struck him on the arm and shoulder with a stick before he hit her on the forehead, causing injuries from which she subsequently died. Rosenbaum hid her unconscious body behind a soundproof curtain, where she was found some hours later by Moya Engels, a dancer. She was taken to hospital, where she died six hours after admittance. Nussenbaum's Aunt, Mae Stock Rich, later told the papers that Nussenbaum had been threatened by Rosenbaum on numerous occasions, and that her father had been to see him and warned him to desist. However, Rosenbaum was still annoying her, hence her reluctance to meet with him on the fatal day. Although initially charged with first degree murder, Rosenbaum pleaded guilty to second degree murder on June 7, 1937. Judge Saul S. Streit accepted the plea on the recommendation of New York City District Attorney William C. Dodge. Samuel Leibowitz, the famous defense lawyer employed by Rosenbaum's brother, Zachary, had already stated that he planned to use the 'homewrecker' defence that had proved successful in earlier cases, although Nussenbaum's family was adamant that she had not known that Rosenbaum was married. In agreeing to the plea, Dodge believed it wise to uphold the reputation of Nussenbaum and to forgo the $800 daily expense New York would save by not having an extended trial. Rosenbaum said that he regretted killing Nussenbaum. He intended to become supervisor of prison theatrical productions after his June 21, 1937 sentencing.Violinist's Slayer Makes Guilty Plea, The New York Times, June 8, 1937, pg. 21. He was sentenced to 35 years to life. Judge Streit stated, \\"I can't see why he brought that hammer there, or why he struck her from eight to twelve blows with it.

S. 2013. Ceramic Petrography: The Interpretation of Archaeological Pottery & Related Artefacts in Thin Section. Archaeopress, Oxford. Samples are ground to a thickness of 0.03 mm and mounted on a glass slide. The approach relies heavily on the geological principles of optical mineralogy, thin section petrography and soil micromorphology. It combines these with an appreciation of the craft of ceramic manufacture and interprets data within an archaeological framework. Ceramic petrography is used in academic archaeological research and commercial archaeology to address a range of issues. A common goal is tracing the movement of pottery and associated trade through provenance determination. The principle of provenance ascription with ceramic petrography relies on the fact that \\"the mineral and rock inclusions within a paste are a reflection of the geology of the source area of the ceramics\\"Freestone, I. 1995. Ceramic Petrography. American Journal of Archaeology 99: 111‚Äì115. and that potters did not transport ceramic raw materials over significant distances.Arnold, D. E. 1988. Ceramic Theory and Cultural Process. Cambridge University Press. An equally important concern is the nature of ancient ceramic production and its meaning in terms of the knowledge, skills, identity and traditions of potters. As synthetic materials, ceramics are \\"sensitive indicators of human decision making and materials interaction\\".Whitbread, I. K. 2001. Ceramic Petrology, Clay Geochemistry and Ceramic Production ‚Äì from Technology to the Mind of the Potter. In: (Brothwell, D. R. and Pollard, A. M.) Handbook of Archaeological Sciences, Wiley: 449‚Äì458. By examining microstructural evidence for processes such as clay paste preparation, forming and firing, ceramic petrographers can reconstruct the steps involved in the production of ceramic artefacts. Ceramic petrography originated in the American Southwest with the work of Anna O. ShepardShepard, A. O. 1936. The Technology of Pecos Pottery, In: Kidder, A. and Shepard, A. O (eds.). The Glaze-Paint, Culinary and Other Wares.

Early life Douglas Dodson was born in Pickardville, Alberta, Canada, the son of James Floyd and Emma Dodson. His family moved to a ranch in Elk River, Idaho when he was still a child and as a small boy he learned to ride horses and rope steers. His parents moved to Burns, Oregon where at age fifteen he was working as a shoeshine boy when trainer Harry Walters told the diminutive boy shining his shoes about racing Thoroughbreds. Deciding that he wanted to try his luck as a jockey, Dodson soon traveled to the Longacres Racetrack in Renton, Washington. There he was hired by trainer Walter Neilsen and, while still an apprentice jockey in 1939, won the Pacific Northwest's most prestigious race, the Longacres Mile. At age seventeen, he was the youngest jockey to ever win the Longacres Mile. Riding career In 1940, the then nineteen-year-old Dodson was signed by Warren Wright, Sr. to join Eddie Arcaro as a rider for his Calumet Farm stable of Lexington, Kentucky. In September of previous year, Wright had hired Ben Jones as head trainer. The result saw Calumet Farm record the most successful decade of any racing stable in the history of American Thoroughbred racing. Between 1945 and 1961, Douglas Dodson made twelve appearances in the Kentucky Derby without winning. His best result came with his first ride in 1945 aboard Pot O' Luck when he ran second. Later that year he rode Pot O' Luck to victory in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Dodson finished third in the Derby on three other occasions. He had much better luck in the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes. After finishing second by a neck in 1946 aboard Maine Chance Farm's Lord Boswell, he won the race in 1947 aboard Faultless defeating, among others Phalanx, later to be voted outstanding three-year-old male horse that year. The following year he earned another second-place result with Vulcan's Forge. Dodson made his fourth and last Preakness start in 1956, earning third place aboard No Regrets. His association with Calumet came to a bitter end in 1948 when Dodson quit the racing stable after being denied a mount on Citation, soon to win the Triple Crown, in favor of the colt's regular rider Albert Snider. Achievements Among Douglas Dodson's other accomplishments in racing, he was the Leading jockey at Arlington Park in 1945 and 1946. In 1949, he made a return visit to his native Canada to ride the future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame colt Arise to a win in the Canadian Championship Stakes. In 1951 Dodson became the first jockey to win three editions of the then richest race in Florida, the Widener Handicap at Hialeah Park. Dodson had his greatest success in 1946 and 1947 with the Calumet colt, Armed. Voted the U.S. Champion Older Male Horse both years, on September 27, 1947, Armed and Dodson defeated U.S. Triple Crown champion Assault in a $100,000 winner take all match race at Belmont Park. That year, Armed received the highest honor in horse racing when he was voted Horse of the Year and in 1963 would be inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. For Dodson, he won a National riding title in 1947 when he led all American jockeys in total purses won. Retirement Dodson retired from riding at the beginning of the 1960s but remained in the horse racing industry as a trainer. In 1965 he was the top trainer at Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. Douglas Dodson was living in Hollywood, Florida at the time of his death in 1982.

It educated girls rejected from the heavily oversubscribed Blue School (now Isleworth and Syon School). The name supposedly originates from the fact that the school away gave free green clothes for the girls to wear as a uniform. In 1906 the Duke of Northumberland whose estate was Syon Park donated a new building at Busch Corner in London Road, Isleworth, which is still occupied by the school. The junior school closed in 1919. Some of the buildings suffered damage during the Blitz on three separate occasions. The school campus underwent some renovations and additions over the years but still largely occupies the original buildings.

It was entered into the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. It is adapted from Anton Chekhov's The Shooting Party. Plot The film is set in the end of the 19th century and takes place at an aristocratic estate in the forests of central Russia. The daughter of a forester, Olga Skvortsova (Galina Belyayeva) is a beautiful nineteen-year-old woman. Three middle-aged men who live in the manor and the surrounding area fall in love with her: a 50-year-old gloomy widower Urbenin (Leonid Markov), an even more senior in age but youthful and lighthearted Count Karneev (Kirill Lavrov) and the stately, handsome, 40-year-old court investigator Kamyshev (Oleg Yankovsky). Olga wanting to escape poverty marries the nobleman Urbenin without love. On the day of her wedding she runs away from the celebration and declares her love to Kamyshev but refuses to leave with him. Kamyshev erupts with passion and jealousy and he secretly hopes that he can persuade Olga to be with him. She is under the impression that Kamyshev is rich and that with him she will be able to break out of poverty but soon finds out in what lowly conditions her lover lives. After this disappointment she becomes a mistress of the jovial Count Karneev, while her lawful husband Urbenin slowly ruins himself with drink and degenerates in the city. During the autumn hunt and picnic an intense argument happens between Olga and the fiercely jealous Kamyshev and after a few minutes under mysterious circumstances Olga receives a gunshot wound in the depths of the forest thicket. The young woman dies a few days later from severe blood loss without informing the investigators who attacked her at the shooting party. Her husband Urbenin is the main suspect and he is exiled to Siberia and four years later sentenced to death. Tormented by pangs of conscience Kamyshev writes a story about the dramatic events and submits it for publication in a journal. After reading the story by Kamyshev it becomes clear to the astute publisher (Olegar Fedoro) who was Olga's real murderer. Music The wedding waltz composed for the film by Eugen Doga became famous worldwide. Ronald Reagan called it \\"the waltz of the century\\" when he visited Moscow.

He was formerly a professional football player who played in the National Football League and World League of American Football from 1988 to 1997. He played two seasons with the New England Patriots, one season with the Indianapolis Colts, and four seasons with the Barcelona Dragons, winning World Bowl V in his last season. While with the Dragons, Naposki recorded 16.5 sacks in 3.5 seasons with one touchdown, one interception, and several blocked punts and field goals. He was also a reserve player in camps with the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Jets. On May 21, 2009, Naposki was arrested in Connecticut and charged with a murder committed in December 1994 in Newport Beach, California. He was charged with killing Bill McLaughlin so that McLaughlin's girlfriend, Nanette Johnston, could collect his life insurance. Naposki was romantically linked to Johnston at the time. On July 14, 2011, Naposki was convicted of the murder. He was scheduled to be sentenced on October 21, 2011; however, on that date sentencing was delayed until 2012. On January 23, 2012, a jury also convicted Nanette Johnston for the murder. On August 10, 2012, Naposki was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Education Naposki, a native of Tuckahoe, New York, played Pop Warner Football with the \\"Blue Devils\\" out of Eastchester, New York, for eight seasons. He later attended Tuckahoe H.S. as well as Roosevelt H.S., the latter in Yonkers, New York, before transfer during his junior year to Eastchester High School. At Eastchester, he led the team in sacks and tackles for two years, with the team going 17-3 during his tenure at linebacker position. Naposki also played safety, tight end and running back in goal line situations. He was named All County in 1982, and All State in 1983 and graduated from Eastchester in 1984. He was offered partial scholarships by New Hampshire, New Haven and Buffalo, but decided to attend the University of Connecticut (UConn) on a full football scholarship. At the time, UConn played as a Division 1-AA in the now defunct Yankee Conference. However, midway through his third year at UConn, he quit the football team over a disagreement with his coach, Tom Jackson. Naposki, who had NFL aspirations, decided to forgo his scholarship and withdrew from the university. He returned to UConn to complete his degree in 1987, although he left again for two years to pursue the NFL and received his degree in physical education in 1991. Murder conviction On July 14, 2011, an Orange County jury found Naposki guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of William \\"Bill\\" McLaughlin in his Newport Beach home on December 15, 1994. The panel also found true a special circumstance allegation that Naposki committed the murder for financial gain and that he personally discharged a firearm, which would have made him eligible for the death penalty, although ultimately the state did not seek the death penalty. The jury heard during more than three weeks of testimony, which included 28 witnesses and more than 240 exhibits, that Naposki had conspired with Nanette Johnston, his secret lover, to murder McLaughlin for financial gain.Orange County Register coverage of McLaughlin murder trial Witnesses testified that Johnston, also known in court documents as Nanette Packard McNeal (her married names), was a young woman with two small children who seduced McLaughlin, who was a quarter century her senior, after the wealthy health care entrepreneur had gone through a contentious divorce with his first wife of 24 years. Johnston began living with McLaughlin in his luxury home in a tight-knit gated community in Newport Beach, and managing his personal financial affairs. The case went unsolved for 15 years before Naposki was charged in 2009. Johnston met McLaughlin after placing a magazine ad seeking the companionship of a wealthy man.Eric Naposki convicted of murder On August 10, 2012 Naposki received a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole at his hearing before Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg. He was sentenced for the murder of McLaughlin. For her role in the murder, Nanette Johnston Packard McNeal was convicted of first-degree murder in January 2012.Nanette Johnston found guilty in Newport cold-case murder  abc7.com She was also sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on May 18 of that year. On September 15, 2012, Naposki was transferred to the California Correctional Center at Susanville, California; on October 12, 2013, he was transferred to the California Correctional Facility at Corcoran. On September 12, 2014, a California Court of Appeal rejected a four-pronged effort by Naposki. In September, an appellate lawyer working for Naposki told a three-justice appellate panel based in Santa Ana that there were four errors in the trial, including the government's 15-year delay in filing charges, faulty jury instructions, biased jury and improperly excluded evidence. Justice William Rylaarsdam's 18-page opinion backed by colleagues Raymond Ikola and David Thompson analyzed and rejected each point, saying they found \\"no prejudicial error.\\" The panel noted that authorities charged Naposki and his girlfriend, Nanette Packard‚Äîthe victim's live-in girlfriend‚Äîafter an Orange County district attorney's office (OCDA) cold case detective discovered new incriminating evidence; a female juror describing the ex-football player as \\"creepy\\" did not merit her removal; and that Judge William Froeberg did not err by blocking a police officer from answering a question about Naposki's facial expressions during a post-murder interview or refusing to give a defense-proposed jury instruction on the elements murder for financial gain. The ruling left Naposki, whose professional football career soared in Europe as a member of the Barcelona Dragons during the 1990s, continuing to serve a life sentence without the possibility for parole inside Corcoran State Prison, also home to infamous killer Charles Manson. Naposki has always maintained his innocence and is currently appealing his conviction. Naposki was convicted on strictly circumstantial evidence, as no weapon was ever found. There was no DNA, no fingerprints, no eyewitnesses and no surveillance tape. Naposki's defense contends that the sixteen-year delay in charging resulted in the loss of exculpatory evidence which backed up his alibi (which was found valid by the DA in 1995, before it was discovered that the club where he worked as a bouncer was only a few hundred yards from the murder scene). The TV series American Greed showed an episode about the murder in January 2017. The CBS TV series 48 Hours aired, on 29 October 2011, the episode titled \\"Murder in the O.C.\\". Naposki claims that he is innocent and is interviewed about his conviction. As of March 11, 2018, the Orange County Innocence Project has begun review of Naposki's case and conviction with an emphasis on the analysis of circumstantial evidence and the dealings of the Orange County Prosecutor who brought the charges to the grand jury 16 years after the fact, with special emphasis on lost records from the initial investigation that might have cleared Naposki.

Marriage  On 6 May 1326 and with only eleven years old, Elisabeth married Duke Bolko II of Opole. Thanks to the marriage, Bolko II had a temporary close connection with the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (paternal grandfather of his wife). However, this alliance was short-lived: on 5 April 1327 in Wroc≈Çaw, he paid homage to King John of Bohemia; he was the last Silesian Duke who became vassal of Bohemia. Bolko and Elisabeth had seven children:According to old chronicles, Bolko II remarried after the death of his wife Elisabeth. The name of his second wife was possibly Margareta, and together they had a daughter, called Agnes, later wife of Margrave Jobst of Moravia, later King of Germany. However, modern historians have debated (and even denied in some cases) the existence of the alleged second wife and daughter of Bolko II. According to the latest researches, this Agnes could be identical to Elisabeth, daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk and first (or only) wife of Jobst. The confusion was in the fact that Elisabeth probably also used the name Agnes (Elisabeth-Agnes), a custom which was not unusual at that time (for example, Viola of Cieszyn or Richenza of Poland, later Queens of Bohemia, changed their names to Elisabeth after their marriages; see their Wikipedia articles).

It is open to the public daily without charge. The Arboretum's history began in 1948 when the University acquired its site. Professor Earl Lemley Core (1902-1984), chairman of the Biology Department, then convinced President Irvin Stewart to set the property aside for the study of biology and botany. In 1975 the Arboretum was named in Core's honor. The Arboretum is now managed by the WVU Department of Biology, and consists of mostly old-growth forest on steep hillside and Monongahela River flood plain. It includes densely wooded areas with of walking trails, as well as of lawn planted with specimen trees. The Arboretum has a variety of natural habitats in which several hundred species of native WV trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants may be found. Some of the large trees are likely over 200 years old. The Arboretum is well known as a superb site to see spring ephemeral wildflowers from late March to early May. Varied habitats and riverside location also make the area an excellent site to observe birds and animals.

The wind farm is planned to be situated between the Sugarloaf and the Saddleback Maine ski resorts on Redington Pond Range and Black Nubble Mountains. The 30 wind turbine project is estimated to have a cost of $180 million and would have a capacity of over 90 megawatts, enough to power roughly 40,000 Maine homes.  History  The Sugarloaf Community Wind Farm was derived from the Redington Wind Farm, a previous project proposed by Maine Mountain Power, a joint venture of Endless Energy and Edison Mission Group. In 2007 a permit for this project was denied by the Land Use Regulation Commission although their staff had recommended approval. The developer proposed an alternative project cut down to being only on Black Nubble, which was rejected by LURC a year later.  Public opinion  There has been some controversy over the possibility of a wind farm on the Mount Redington area. Numerous positive environmental effects of wind power have been cited, including pollution avoided from electricity generation from fossil fuels as well as the fact that unlike electricity production from fossil fuel power plants such as coal or petroleum, wind power does not need to use water for cooling. A survey by the Potholm group in 2006 showed 9:1 statewide public support for a wind farm on Redington Mountain (with a margin of error of 5%). The same survey found that 74% of dues paying members of environmental groups in the state were also in favor. In a 2006 survey, Maine residents and environmentalists overwhelmingly supported a wind farm on Redington Mountain However, the boards of various Appalachian Trail affiliates have opposed the project due to its proximity to the trail. Maine Audubon has also expressed concerns for the fragile environment of the mountains of western Maine. The Natural Resources Council of Maine opposed the full project, but supported the cut down Black Nubble version.  Annexation  At a selectmen's meeting on January 5, 2009, Endless Energy spoke to Carrabassett Valley residents about the possibility of the town to annex the site of the proposed wind farm in the adjacent Redington Township. The town would benefit from the additional property taxes it would receive from the project as well as other benefits of wind farm development such as stable priced power and job creation. The wind farm would benefit from being included in Maine‚Äôs expedited wind power permitting zone, as designated by the Governor‚Äôs Wind Power Task Force which was put into state law in 2008. The selectmen unanimously voted in favor of sending a Bill into the Maine Legislature. The annexation bill (SP288)LD741 passed Maine‚Äôs Joint Standing Committee on State and Local Government 8-3 on May 11, 2009 with the amendment that all of Redington Township be annexed. To become law it would have required a positive vote from the Senate and House as well as a majority vote in a Carrabassett Valley referendum. For the wind farm to get permits, it would then have then applied to the Department of Environmental Protection instead of the Land Use Regulation Commission. On June 1, 2009, the Maine Senate voted against the annexation 29-6, and two days later the House also voted it down.

Lawrence's TortoisesThomas Seltzer (February 22, 1875, Russia ‚àí September 11, 1943, New York City) was a Russian-American translator, editor and book publisher. Life Signature of Thomas Seltzer Born in Russia, Thomas Seltzer moved to the United States with his family as a young child. He attended the University of Pennsylvania on scholarship and graduated in 1897, going on to do post- graduate work at Columbia University. In addition to speaking his native Russian, Seltzer was conversant in Polish, Italian, German, Yiddish, and French and it was his language skills that led him to a career as a translator. He parleyed his way with words into work as a journalist and editor, writing for newspapers and magazines, notably Harper's Weekly and in 1911-1918, Seltzer worked with Max Eastman, Charles Erskine Scott Wood, and others as editor of the socialist magazine, The Masses. As an editor, Seltzer gained experience at Funk & Wagnalls and beginning in 1917 the New York publishing firm Boni & Liveright. It was during his tenure with Funk & Wagnalls that Seltzer met his wife Adele Szold and the couple were married October 21, 1906. In 1919 Seltzer established his own publishing venture, Thomas Seltzer, Inc., and is credited with bringing D. H. Lawrence's works to the American public. His work also brought him into contact with such authors as Henry James and Theodore Dreiser. As a result of publishing controversial writers, Seltzer was attacked by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice in 1922 and all copies of D. H.Lawrence's Women in Love, Arthur Schnitzler's Casanova's Homecoming, and the anonymously written A Young Girl's Diary were confiscated. Seltzer refused to back down, retaining a lawyer and fighting the attempted censorship in the court case People v. Seltzer. Although victorious, it was not to be the end of Seltzer's fight against censorship, as he was charged with publishing \\"unclean\\" books in 1923; once again, D.H. Lawrence's Women in Love was the impetus for the charges. Fighting censorship charges eventually led Seltzer's publishing efforts into bankruptcy. The business was taken over by Seltzer's nephews Charles and Albert Boni.Levin, Alexandra Lee. \\"Thomas Seltzer: Publisher, Fighter for Freedom of the Press, and the man who 'Made' D. H.

The resort's focus is providing accommodations and access to donated theme park tickets. Families that visit Give Kids The World must be referred by one of over 250 wish- granting organizations or foundations, such as Make-A-Wish Foundation. The resort includes 168 villas on 79 acres. Eighty-eight of the villas were refurbished in a renovation as of 2014.Kissimmee, Business Briefs Florida Trend March 2014 History Give Kids The World was founded by Henri Landwirth, a Belgian Holocaust survivor who spent 5 years in the Auschwitz and Matthausen concentration camps . Landwirth immigrated to the United States, where he studied hotel management. While operating a hotel in the Orlando area, he became passionate about helping sick children fulfill their dream of a family vacation. Landwirth took to providing hotel accommodations for families of children with critical illnesses who wanted to visit Walt Disney World and other nearby attractions and theme parks. After an incident in which two sick children had died before they were able to go on their trips, because hotel rooms were not available in time for them to stay in Orlando, Landwirth had an interest in creating a facility where travel arrangements could be made quickly with no waiting list and which would not turn away any child. The Village Themed carousel at Give Kids the World Village The Village has a whimsical theme. It features 168 family villa accommodations, the Gingerbread House Restaurant, the Castle of Miracles and its Enchanted Carousel, Henri's star light scoops, that is replacing the ice cream palace and will be open in early 2020, Julie's Safari Theatre, Matthew's Boundless Playground, and many other attractions and facilities for its guests. The Village is operated by a small professional staff augmented by thousands of volunteers each year. Roughly 1600 volunteer shifts are completed each week. Every year, the Village welcomes more than 7,000 families from across the United States and 75 countries; in 2016, it welcomed its 150,000th family. =Wish program= Children between the ages of 3 and 18 who have been diagnosed with a critical illness by a licensed doctor are eligible for a GKTW wish. One of over 250 wish-granting organizations worldwide coordinates transportation to Central Florida, while Give Kids The World provides accommodations at its resort, meals for a week-long vacation, and donated admission tickets to local attractions including Walt Disney World Resort, SeaWorld, and Universal Orlando Resort as well as other Central Florida attractions. Tickets are also available for other attractions if requested. Busch Gardens in Tampa is one of the many places that can be requested. The location of the \\"Give Kids The World Village\\" is relatively close to most of the popular attractions. This is set up in a way so the families do not have to travel far. The child with a critical illness is given a special badge with his or her name on it that grants access to shorter lines or the disability entrance to many of the parks. The organization partners with corporations for volunteers, donations and in the case of Boston Market and Perkins Restaurant and Bakery, restaurants supplied with both food and volunteers inside the resort. Families are also provided a complimentary rental car courtesy of Avis Rent a Car during their stay which they pickup at the VIP counter at the Orlando airport. With the exception of certain souvenirs, there is no charge to the children or their families for rooms, food, ice cream, treats, transportation, activities, or anything else on site (known as being \\"Within The Village\\").

Fossil remains were found in Europe and Asia. Characteristics This animal was very similar to the modern musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) of East Asia. However, Micromeryx (its name means \\"tiny ruminant\\") was much smaller: it perhaps reached 5 kilograms. Teeth were very similar to those of the extant Cephalophus but more primitive. Like in the present moschids, the males of these animals were equipped with long upper canines, protruding from the mouth when it was closed. The body was slender and short, while the legs were extremely elongated. Systematics Micromeryx was a primitive representative of the moschids, a group of primitive ruminants related to deer and cattle. They had a remarkable expansion during the Miocene and Pliocene and are currently represented by a few species, such as the aforementioned Moschus moschiferus. Micromeryx probably originated in Western Asia and then spread to Europe and East Asia. Many fossils of this animal have been found in a vast geographical area ranging from Anatolia (Turkey) to Spain and China. A somewhat similar animal was Hispanomeryx, which lived in about the same area but went extinct during the middle Miocene. Further reading * S√°nchez, I. M., and J. Morales. 2006.

The officers of the 20th Corps, led by Liu Di retreated to the town of Yongyang, where they raised banners reading 'Down with Mao Zedong!' and sent appeals to the CCP Central Committee.

His writing & art began appearing in publications of experimental literature under various pseudonyms, most notably Doktor Bey and Norman Conquest.

Using a remarkable range of formal discourses and methods, Pell's work often employs elements of intertextuality, metafiction and reflexivity, decenterization, pastiche, appropriation, found materials, and sampling. Through various mediums such as mail art, text-and-collage, gallery exhibits, and book object (Artist's book), his style uses satire, sarcasm, wit, and humor (wordplay, dark humor, absurdist humor, shock humor, visual and textual puns) to comment, criticize, and occasionally openly mock America's traditional cultural attitudes and values though work that is as much conceptual and performance art as it is fiction.Some other frequency: interviews with innovative American authors By Larry McCaffery Edition: illustrated Published by University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996  Pseudonyms  Derek Pell has published work under various pseudonyms, some with fictional biographies, which serve to question the concept of authorial originalitySee Textual criticism#Uninfluenced final authorial intention intention while giving focus and outlet to his different faucets of creative expression.Some other frequency: interviews with innovative American authors By Larry McCaffery Edition: illustrated Published by University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996 page 286 ;Doktor Bey Bey is a fictional scholar, born in New York City and Tibet in 1877.

He is noted for his imitation of Cato the Younger, his espousal of the Cynic philosophy, and for his appearance as the Poet in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar. Life Aerial view of Terracina with the Circeo promontory in the background Favonius was born in around 90 BCDudley, Donald R. A History of Cynicism ‚Äì From Diogenes to the 6th Century A.D., Read Books, 2008, p. 120‚Äì1, at books.google.com, accessed 29 May 2009 in Tarracina (the modern Terracina), a Roman colony on the Appian Way at the edge of the Volscian Hills.F. X. Ryan, The Praetorship of Favonius, at accessmylibrary.com, accessed 22 May 2009 Political career Favonius, with the support of Cato, was chosen aedile at some time between 53 and 52 BC. According to Plutarch, As well as being chosen aedile, he was also chosen quaestor and served as legatus in Sicily, \\"probably after his quaestorship\\". Although many classical reference works list Favonius as having been a praetor in 49 BC, it is a matter of some controversy whether or not he was a praetor at any time between 52‚Äì48 BC. According to F. X. Ryan, in his 1994 article 'The Praetorship of Favonius', the matter hinges on the meeting at the senate at which he bade Pompey \\"stamp on the ground\\". \\"When we are forced to decide whether a man who spoke at a meeting summoned by consuls was a praetor or a senator, all we can say is that probability greatly favors the latter alternative.\\" Imitation of Cato Cassius Dio wrote of Favonius' relation to Cato that Favonius \\"imitated him in everything\\",Cassius Dio, Roman History, XXXVIII, at uchicago.edu, accessed 29 May 2009 while Plutarch wrote that Favonius was \\"a fair character ... who supposed his own petulance and abusive talking a copy of Cato's straightforwardness\\".Plutarch, Life of Pompey An instance of his imitation of Cato's plainspeaking that was ruder and more vehement than the behaviour of his model might have allowed came in 49 BC; in a dispute in the Senate, Pompey, challenged as to the paucity of his forces when Julius Caesar was approaching Rome from Gaul, answered that he not only could call upon the two legions that he had lent to Caesar but could make up an army of 30,000 men. At which Favonius \\"bade Pompey stamp upon the ground, and call forth the forces he had promised\\". According to Plutarch, Favonius was known amongst his fellow Roman aristocrats as a Cynic because of his outspokenness,Plutarch, Life of Brutus but a modern writer on Greek philosophy labels him as an \\"early representative of [the] pseudo-Cynic type\\" who fell short of the (possibly unattainable) ideal cynicism of the earliest Greek proponents of the doctrine (a slightly later example of the type was Dio Chrysostom).Dawson, D. Cities of the Gods: Communist Utopias in Greek Thought OUP, 1992, p. 247, at books.google.com, accessed 24 May 2009 Despite his \\"wild, vehement manner\\", Favonius was capable of acts of humility, such as he performed to Pompey when he entertained Deiotarus I of Galatia aboard ship. Opponent of CaesarAgainst the triumvirate= Favonius was a member of the optimates faction within the Roman aristocracy; in a letter to Caesar on ruling a state (Ad Caesarem senem de re publica oratio), traditionally attributed to Sallust but probably by the rhetorician Marcus Porcius Latro, Caesar is told of the qualities of some of these nobles. Bibulus and Lucius Domitius are dismissed as wicked and dishonourable while Cato is someone \\"whose versatile, eloquent and clever talents I do not despise.\\" The writer continues, Like Cato, Favonius opposed the corruption of many of Rome's leading politicians in general and the rise of the First Triumvirate in particular. When Caesar returned from his praetorship in Spain in 59 BC and successfully stood for consul, he allied himself with Pompey (to whom he gave his daughter Julia in marriage) and Clodius. Following an incident in which Cato prevented Caesar from both having a triumph and standing for consulship by a filibustering tactic, after which Cato and Bibulus were physically attacked by Caesar's supporters, Caesar's party demanded two things of the senate: first, that it sign a law concerning the distribution of land; second, that all senators swear an oath promising that they would uphold the law. Silver denarius of Cato the Younger (47-46 BC) According to Plutarch, \\"heavy penalties were pronounced against such as would not take the oath\\", which in this case meant exile.Dillon, M. and Garland, L. Ancient Rome, Taylor & Francis, 2005, p. 582, at books.google.com, accessed 25 May 2009 A party led by Cicero, Lucullus and Bibulus, to which Cato and Favonius allied themselves, opposed these measures, but eventually either swore the oath or abstained. Cato, however, feared these laws and the oath as not being for the common good but as extensions of the power of Caesar and Pompey; Plutarch writes of Cato that \\"he was afraid, not of the distribution of land, but of the reward which would be paid for this to those who were enticing the people with such favours.\\" Eventually all senators except Cato and Favonius agreed to Caesar and Pompeys's measures, whereupon Cicero made an oration urging Cato to soften his attitude. According to Plutarch, Finally Cato was persuaded to give up his opposition, followed by Favonius, the last to submit. Plutarch writes, \\"By these and similar arguments and entreaties, we are told, both at home and in the forum, Cato was softened and at last prevailed upon. He came forward to take the oath last of all, except Favonius, one of his friends and intimates.\\" Upon hearing the news that of the members of the Triumvirate, Caesar was to be given a fresh supply of money, and Pompey and Crassus were to be consuls again the following year, Favonius, \\"when he found he could do no good by opposing it, broke out of the house, and loudly declaimed against these proceedings to the people, but none gave him any hearing; some slighting him out of respect to Crassus and Pompey, and the greater part to gratify Caesar, on whom depended their hopes\\".Plutarch, Life of Caesar =Assassination of Caesar= Despite the fact that he opposed Caesar, Favonius, like Cicero, was not invited by Brutus and Cassius to participate in the plot to assassinate Caesar in 44 BC. In his Life of Brutus, Plutarch wrote, =Shakespeare's Julius Caesar= Facsimile of the first page of Julius Caesar from the First Folio of 1623 Favonius is the character known as the Poet who appears in Act IV Scene III of William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar.Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, ed. D. Danniel, editorial note on p. 154. Julius Caesar at books.google.com, accessed 22 May 2009 Shakespeare took the details of this scene from Plutarch's Parallel Lives, in which, on Brutus' journey to Sardis, Plutarch writes that Brutus and Cassius fell into a dispute in an apartment (Shakespeare assigns this scene to Brutus' tent), which ultimately led to their sharing angry words and both of them bursting in tears. Their friends attempted to break into the room to see what the dispute was about and forestall any mischief, but were prevented from doing so by a number of attendants. Favonius, however, was not to be stopped. According to Plutarch, In Shakespeare's version of this encounter in Julius Caesar, Favonius' opening lines in his role as Poet are: POET. [Within] Let me go in to see the generals; There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet they be alone.Shakespeare, Julius Caesar, IV, III, 123‚Äì132 Forcing his way into Brutus' tent, he addresses Brutus and Cassius: POET. For shame, you generals! what do you mean? Love, and be friends, as two such men should be; For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye. To which, Cassius replies: CASSIUS. Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! and Brutus drives him from his tent. Here Shakespeare departs from Plutarch's account of the scene, as Favonius does not feature in Brutus and Cassius' subsequent drinking bout. Execution after Philippi After Caesar's death in March 44 BC, Favonius became an opponent of his successors in the Second Triumvirate. According to Cicero's letter to Atticus of 8 June 44 BC, Favonius was present at a meeting of the Liberatores who opposed Antony's near-dictatorial regime. Also present at this meeting were Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Porcia Catonis, Servilia and Junia Tertia.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, 15.11 Along with Cicero, his brother Quintus Tullius Cicero, and Lucius Julius Caesar, Favonius was proscribed by the triumvirate, and imprisoned after Antony and Octavian (later Augustus) defeated the forces of Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC). His imprisonment did little to assuage his intemperate behaviour. According to Suetonius, \\"Marcus Favonius, the well-known imitator of Cato, saluted Antonius respectfully as Imperator when they were led out in chains, but lashed Augustus to his face with the foulest abuse.\\"Suetonius, Life of Augustus, XIII Favonius' abuse was apparently as a result of Octavian's brutal treatment of the prisoners captured at Philippi. Of his death Cassius Dio wrote, Favonius' slave Sarmentus, who was bought after his master's death when his estate was sold, is claimed to have become a catamite of the emperor Augustus.Osgood, J. Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire, CUP, 2006, p. 263, at books.google.com, accessed 25 May 2009 Modern-day historian Josiah Osgood says this might have been as a slander \\"planted by supporters of Marc Anthony\\",Osgood, J.

He was by the Hall of Fame stallion Ack Ack out of the Hoist The Flag mare Hay Patcher. Bred and owned by Robert E. Meyerhoff and trained by Richard W. Small, Broad Brush won a number of stakes races at age two before being prepped for the 1986 Kentucky Derby.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Broad Brush won a number of stakes races, including the Inner Harbor Stakes at Pimlico Race Course, the grade two Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park, the grade one Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack, the grade three Federico Tesio Stakes (also called the \\"Preakness Trial\\") at Pimlico, the grade two Pennsylvania Derby at Philadelphia Park, the grade two Ohio Derby at Thistledown, and the grade two Meadowlands Cup. The Pennsylvania Derby win was notable for Broad Brush bolting to the outside rail on the final turn, seemingly costing him the race as several competitors passed him. Jockey Angel Cordero, Jr gathered the colt and directed him along the outside rail to pass his rivals late in the stretch for the win. Broad Brush also placed third in two of the most coveted races in the country in the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, showing in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. He finished a close third behind Ferdinand two lengths back and Bold Arrangement (by a head) in the grade one Kentucky Derby in 1986 in a field of 16 colts. Broad Brush also was third as the local Maryland favorite in the $1,000,000 grade one Preakness Stakes behind eventual Eclipse Award winner Snow Chief and Derby champ Ferdinand. Snow Chief was named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse in large part due to his Preakness win.  Four-year-old season  At age four, Broad Brush won some of the most prestigious races in the handicap division, including the $1,000,000 grade one Santa Anita Handicap and the grade one Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park. He placed second in the Massachusetts Handicap and Grade I San Fernando Stakes, and he was third in the Grade I Metropolitan Handicap, Grade I Strub Stakes, and Grade I Whitney Handicap.  Retirement  After his retirement in April 1988, Broad Brush became a very successful sire, being awarded Leading sire in North America for 1994. He was one of the leading draws for Gainesway Farm's Kentucky breeding operation and was ranked in the top 10 leading sires for four straight years. His progeny include the stakes-winning Concern, Include, Farda Amiga, Hesanoldsalt, Nobo True, Best Of Luck, the Japanese champion mare Broad Appeal, Justenuffheart (dam of the champion filly Dreaming of Anna) and Arlucea (dam of 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Fort Larned). Broad Brush was pensioned in 2004 and was euthanized on May 15, 2009.  Pedigree  Broad Brush is inbred 3x3 to Turn-to, meaning this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree.

R. Nanda, Road to Pakistan: The Life and Times of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Routledge, 3 Jul 2013 The Punjabi view of the \\"Muslim interest\\" formulated by Husain was a success. The implementation of the Communal Award and Government of India Act 1935, allowed the majority Muslims in Punjab and Bengal to retain their separate electorates yet also granted them more seats than any other community in their respective assemblies. Whilst this allowed Muslim politicians in the Punjab to increase their autonomy it brought them into conflict with Muslims in Hindu majority provinces, who would now look to Jinnah and the Muslim League for support.Sugata Bose, Ayesha Jalal, Modern South Asia: History, Culture, Political Economy, Psychology Press, 1998 In 1932 he led the Indian delegation to the Indo-South African conference and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1932.Viewing Page 3571 of Issue 33831.

The body of the candle should be at the low end of the trading range and there should be little or no lower wick in the candle. The long upper wick of the candlestick pattern indicates that the buyers drove prices up at some point during the period in which the candle was formed, but encountered selling pressure which drove prices back down to close near to where they opened.

The entirety of I-490, along with a portion of what later became I-90 westward from the I-71/I-90/I-490 interchange, was built as a result of this project. However, the road was initially proposed to extend to the Outer-belt East Freeway (I-271). The route was ultimately truncated to East 55th Street as a result of freeway revolts. Later plans for a highway along this general routing included a plan to build a freeway northeastward from East 55th Street to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway (I-90 and State Route 2, SR 2), but this plan was rejected in 2002. The route was again proposed by Ken Blackwell during his failed bid for governor in 2006. =Active project= The current project , part of the Inner-belt reconstruction project, involves building a boulevard to connect I-490 to the University Circle neighborhood. This iteration was conceived in 2008; its record of decision was issued in May 2014. Construction began in March 2015 along the portion east of East 93rd Street; this portion opened in two segments in late 2017 and November 2018. The target date for the completion of the rest of the road is 2021. The Ohio Department of Transportation has proposed that the road receive an extension of the Ohio State Route 10 designation. The project was estimated in April 2013 to cost $331.3 million by the Federal Highway Administration, or about $100 million per mile. =Opposition= The Opportunity Corridor has a number of opponents, including a grassroots group, Clevelanders for Transportation Equity. Many of the objections are rooted in the upheaval of the local community, which is predominantly lower income and African-American. Other local critiques include a report by the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative in which concerns are raised regarding a lack of comprehensive vision, lack of meaningful community engagement, poorly designed green infrastructure, and the absence of true multi-modal integration.

Akutagawa first published the story when he was twenty-nine.Morris (1962), 174. The story tells the tale of a painting, supposed to be the greatest ever made. However, when the speaker sees the painting, it does not meet the expectations of the promised masterpiece of unparalleled beauty. However, even though the speaker does not know if the painting actually exists, he realizes that he can see the beauty in his mind. In the short story, Akutagawa deals with the subjects of truth and beauty. Plot summary While visiting his friend Y√ºn Nan-t'ien, Wang Shih-ku tells a story about a masterful painting called Autumn Mountain by the artist Ta Ch'ih. He explains that a man named Yen-k'o, a great admirer of Ta Ch'ih, learned of the painting, which was supposed to be the finest of the artist's works. Seeking the painting, Yen-k'o ends up at the house of a Mr. Chang, who shows him the painting. Yen-k'o stands in awe of the painting, declaring it of \\"godlike quality\\". Convinced he has witnessed perfect beauty, he attempts to purchase the painting a number of times over many years, but Mr. Chang refuses to sell it. Fifty years later, Wang Shih-ku himself, after hearing of it from Yen-k'o, attempts to see the painting. He learns that Mr. Wang has obtained the painting from Mr. Chang's grandson. Wang Shih-ku goes to see the painting; he is, however, disappointed when it is hung. The painting, while a masterpiece, does not live up to the description Yen'ko had given. He and Yen-k'o show their disappointment, though the renowned critic Lien-chou lauds it as one of the greatest paintings ever produced. After Wang Shih-ku finishes the story, he and Y√ºn Nan-t'ien muse over whether the painting had another version, or if the masterpiece Yen-k'o saw never existed outside of his head. Wang Shih-ku announces, that even if it never existed, he can still see it in his head, so there is no loss. The two men clap and laugh after realizing this. Characters in Autumn Mountain *Wang Shih-ku ‚Äì The narrator of the tale, he once saw Autumn Mountain, but realized it did not live up to the description of his friend Yen-k'o. He realizes that the amazing painting exists in his head, even if it does not reside in the real world. *Y√ºn Nan-t'ien ‚Äì The friend of Wang Shih-ku who invites him to tea to tell the story. *Y√ºan Tsai ‚Äì Master who first informs Yen-k'o of Autumn Mountain and tells him where to find it. *Yen-k'o ‚Äì Art collector who greatly admirers the master Ta Ch'ih. He seeks out Autumn Mountain, and, upon seeing it, does everything in his power to purchase it. After passing on the absolute perfection he finds in the painting to Wang Shih-ku, he sees the painting a final time, only to not find the same mastery. *Mr. Chang ‚Äì The original owner of Autumn Mountain, he seems uneasy about the painting, not sure if its beauty lies only in his own mind, or if others can see it as well. He maintains a run-down yet grand residence where the painting is kept. *Mr. Chang's grandson ‚Äì The inheritor of Mr. Chang's estate who gives the painting to Mr. Wang's death upon obtaining it. *Mr. Wang - The man who obtains the painting from Mr. Chang's grandson. The painting is the pride of his collection, and invites critics to come and see it. After witnessing Wang Shih-ku's and Yen-k'o's negative reactions, he tries to see if there is another, grander copy of the painting. *Lien-chou ‚Äì A renowned art critic who declares Autumn Mountain a great masterpiece. Themes Like many of his works, Autumn Mountain deals with the objectivity of truth.Liukkonen (2008). The two friends do not know if the masterpiece ever really existed, but do realize that such a painting exists at least in the reality of their minds. Though the painting appears to be nothing more than a figment of imagination. However, Akutagawa comments on the nature of supreme beauty by asserting that ultimate beauty did exist, even if only in the observer's mind.

She began her career singing with the New York City Opera (NYCO) during the early 1960s, after which she embarked on a long and fruitful partnership with The Santa Fe Opera which lasted from 1965 through 1987. In 1970 she joined the roster of singers at the Metropolitan Opera where she remained a fixture until 1989. She has also performed as a guest artist with many other opera companies throughout the United States during her career. In 2005 Opera News stated that Kraft was \\"a gifted mezzo and observant, imaginative actress who lent distinction to a wide range of character roles. By the end of her Met tenure, she had sung nearly 800 performances and become a solid audience favorite.\\" Early life and education Born in Menasha, Wisconsin,https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr90000700.html Kraft began her career working as pianist as a teenager and was also a proficient clarinet and trumpet player. After working as a pianist for four years she decided to reorient her path towards a singing career, at this point more interested in the concert repertoire than in opera. She entered the Curtis Institute of Music where she studied voice under Giannini Gregory. She later continued with further studies under Theodore Harrison in Chicago, William Ernest Vedal in Munich, and Povla Frijsh in New York City. Early career: 1960‚Äì1969 While still a student, Kraft sang the role of Laura Gates in the world premiere of Mark Bucci's Tale for a Deaf Ear at the 1957 Tanglewood Music Festival in a student production directed by Boris Goldovsky and conducted by James Billings. She made her professional opera debut on February 18, 1960 as the Mother in Hugo Weisgall's Six Characters in Search of an Author at the NYCO with Beverly Sills as The Coloratura. She appeared with the NYCO in several more productions during the 1960s including, Miss Jessel in Britten's The Turn of the Screw (1962), the Forewoman in Charpentier's Louise (1962), Marcellina in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro (1962), Maud Lowder in Moore's The Wings of the Dove (1962), Death in Stravinsky's The Nightingale (1963), Flora in Verdi's La traviata (1963), Sarah Chicken in Robert Ward's The Lady from Colorado (1964), and Penelope in Menotti's Help, Help, the Globolinks! (1969) among others. She had sung the role of Penelope the previous year for the works world premiere at the SFO. =At The Santa Fe Opera= Kraft was also highly active with The Santa Fe Opera during the 1960s. In 1965 she made her debut with the company as Adelaide von Waldner in Strauss's Arabella. Her other performances with the company during these years included Marcellina (1965); Thisbe in Rossini's La cenerentola (1966); Madame de Croissy in Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites (1966); Mother Goose in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (1966); Maddalena in Verdi's Rigoletto (1966); Margret in Berg's Wozzeck (1966); Giannetta in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (1968); the Third Lady in Mozart's The Magic Flute (1968); Annina in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier; and Ninon in the United States premiere of Penderecki's The Devils of Loudun (1969) among others.Santa Fe Opera Archives =Performances in New York and elsewhere= While mostly busy performing in operas in New York City and Santa Fe during the 1960s, Kraft also performed with other opera companies and in concerts throughout the United States during these years. In May 1962 she gave her New York City recital debut at Carnegie Recital Hall with pianist and composer Yehudi Wyner accompanying her in a program that included the premieres of several pieces by Wyner. In Philadelphia Kraft sang the roles of The Monitress in Puccini's Suor Angelica (1962) and Rossweisse in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre (1963) with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company.Free Library of Philadelphia: Box: Phila. Lyric Opera Company: 782.1 P5326p Bal Two [1968 - 1975] In April 1964 she sang in the New York City premiere of Jack Gottlieb's Tea Party at the Donnell Library Center for the New York Composers Forum. Metropolitan Opera years: 1970‚Äì1989 In 1969 Kraft was offered a contract by Rudolf Bing to join the roster of singers at the Metropolitan Opera. She leapt at the opportunity after recently having turned down a number of similar offers from a few different European opera houses. She made her Met debut on February 7, 1970 as Flora in La Traviata with Gabriella Tucci as Violetta, Nicolai Gedda as Alfredo, Robert Merrill as Germont, and Francesco Molinari-Pradelli conducting. Thus was the beginning of a nineteen-year-long artistic relationship which resulted in several CD recordings, eight \\"Live From the Met\\" recordings for television and video release, and well over 80 Saturday Texaco \\"Met\\" Broadcasts. Kraft became a favorite at the Met very quickly in roles like Emilia in Verdi's Otello, the drug-addicted Mrs. Sedley in Britten's Peter Grimes, and Mamma Lucia in Franco Zeffirelli's production of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana. She was also an admired Mother Jeanne of the Holy Child Jesus in the critically acclaimed 1977 John Dexter staging of Dialogues of the Carmelites. In describing the haunting finale of that production, Opera News stated, \\"No one who has seen Dexter‚Äôs staging of the finale will ever forget it: the chorus of doomed nuns, singing the ‚ÄúSalve Regina,‚Äù was diminished, one voice at a time, as each woman marched to the guillotine. Finally, only Sister Constance and Mother Jeanne were left. Slowly, Kraft‚Äôs Jeanne picked herself up and, supporting herself with her cane, hobbled defiantly to her death.\\" Kraft later took over the role of Madame de Croissy in subsequent mountings of that production during the 1980s. Although Kraft's performances at the Met were largely in comprimario roles, she occasionally got starring parts, such as Herodias in Strauss's Salome (1973, 1977) initially with Grace Bumbry in the title role and Robert Nagy as Herod; Ulrica in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (1970, 1976) initially with Elinor Ross as Amelia, Carlo Bergonzi as Riccardo, Merrill as Renato, and Roberta Peters as Oscar; Federica in Verdi's Luisa Miller (1971, 1978, 1979) initially with Adriana Maliponte as Luisa and Pl√°cido Domingo as Rodolfo; Gertrud in H√§nsel und Gretel (1971‚Äì1983) initially with Judith Forst as H√§nsel and Joy Clements as Gretel; and Suzuki in Madama Butterfly (1973‚Äì1981) initially with Gilda Cruz-Romo as Cio-Cio-San and William Lewis as Pinkerton. Some of the many supporting roles she portrayed were Berta in Il Barbiere di Siviglia (with Marilyn Horne), Countess di Coigny in Andrea Ch√©nier, the Duchesse of Krakentorp in La Fille du R√©giment (with Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland), Gertrude in Rom√©o et Juliette, Grandmother Buryjovka in Jen≈Øfa (with Astrid Varnay), Hecuba in Les Troyens (with Jon Vickers and Shirley Verrett), Ines in Il Trovatore, Marcellina (with Teresa Stratas and Frederica von Stade), Marthe in Faust (with Franco Corelli), Ninetta in I Vespri Siciliani (with Cristina Deutekom), and the Madrigalist in Manon Lescaut (with Dorothy Kirsten and John Alexander) among others. Her final and 784th performance at the Met was on April 5, 1989 as Larina in Eugene Onegin with Mirella Freni as Tatiana, Jorma Hynninen in the title role, and conductor James Levine.Metropolitan Opera archives During her years working for the Met, Kraft continued to return periodically for performances with the Santa Fe Opera. Her roles with the company during these years included Flora (1970), Mother Goose (1970), Marcellina (1970, 1973, 1976, 1985, 1987), Penelope (1970), Death (1970), Suzuki (1972), Lap√©rouse in the United States Premiere of Aribert Reimann's Melusine (1972), Herodias (1972, 1979), Kate Julian in Britten's Owen Wingrave (1973), The Countess Geschwitz in Lulu (1974), The Third Lady (1974, 1984, 1986), Meg Page in Falstaff (1975, 1977), Genevieve in Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1977), Larina (1980), Berta (1981), Miss Pick in Hindemith's News of the Day (1981), The Notary's Wife in Strauss's Intermezzo (1984), May in the United States premiere of Hans Werner Henze's We Come to the River (1984), and Juno in the world premiere of John Eaton's The Tempest (1985). Her last performance with the company was as Widow Zimmerlein in Strauss's Die schweigsame Frau in 1987. Kraft was also active performing in concerts and operas with other organizations during the 1970s and 1980s. As a concert singer she drew particular acclaim for her performances in several of Mahler's symphonies, notably singing his Symphony No. 8 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1977 and performing/recording his Symphony No. 2 with the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein. Some of the opera companies she performed with during these years included the Houston Grand Opera, the Dallas Opera, the New Orleans Opera, and the Opera Company of Boston. In 1976 she made a highly praised portrayal of Augusta Tabor in Moore's The Ballad of Baby Doe with Tulsa Opera. In 1984 she made her debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Larina, returning there to portray the Fortuneteller in Arabella (1984), and Annina (1989).Lyric Opera of Chicago Archives She also portrayed Mrs. Sedley in 1984 in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's critically acclaimed production of Peter Grimes at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Italy. In April 1986 she portrayed Dinah in Bernstein's A Quiet Place at the Vienna State Opera under the baton of the composer. Kraft recalled in 2005 interview, \\"Keeping the hand in and knowing all the right people ‚Äî I never did that. They came into my life, like Bernstein. I did A Quiet Place in Vienna, and after we recorded it, he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt write an aria for you.‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòI am, too!‚Äô.\\" Her last opera appearance was in 1990 at the Seattle Opera as the Duchesse of Krakentorp in Donizetti's La Fille du r√©giment. Later life: 1990‚Äìpresent After retiring from the opera stage in 1990, Kraft divided her time between her family and teaching singing in Santa Fe. Her husband, the late violinist Richard Elias, had played in the Met Orchestra during Kraft's tenure at the house and had retired with her. The couple had built a house in Santa Fe in 1974 where they had lived when not in New York City. Elias died in 2003. A few years after the death of her husband, Kraft moved back to New York City. Since 2017, Jean Kraft has resided at the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey.

It was a founding member of the Popular Front.  Gaston Bergery and the 'Common Front Against Fascism'  Bergery had originally been the leading figure of the most left-wing faction of France's dominant centre-left progressive party, the Radical-Socialist Party. An undersecretary to the President of the Council (prime minister) during the first Cartel des Gauches (coalition of the left) in 1924, he had been heavily disappointed by the coalition's collapse in 1926. Thereafter, he advocated a close cooperation of the left-wing parties - chiefly the Radical-Socialists and the Socialist Party - around a programme of state-intervention in the economy and opposition to fascism. This policy found little popularity within the Radical-Socialist Party (where Bergery was mocked as a \\"Radical-Bolshevik\\"), and in early 1933 Bergery quit the party. In the wake of the anti-parliamentary riots of February 1934 the mood in France changed: the centre-left coalition collapsed bringing down the Radical-Socialist government, replaced by a government of the right which the Left feared was a prelude to fascism. Dissidents from the three major left-wing parties, Bergery the ex-Radical-Socialist, Jacques Doriot the number-two Communist leader, and the prominent socialist Georges Monnet, broke with their respective parties to form a 'Common Front Against Fascism', designed as a network where anti-fascists could coordinate resistance against further dictatorial trends, independently of party lines. Bergery had though that the Common Front would fill a much-demanded empty niche in French politics: a centre-left progressive party that was explicitly committed to opposing fascism and defending parliamentary institutions, while also addressing financial and economic issues through state intervention, and formally allying with the Socialist Party to do so. But it found no support from the main parties: the Socialist and Communist parties banned their members from participating, while the Radical-Socialist Party initially sided with the National government before gradually adopting the very ideas that Bergery had advocated. Bergery imagined that the public would prove more enthusiastic than the party leaders. To prove the point he resigned from Parliament (20 February 1934) to run again in the name of the antifascist Common Front; instead, opposed by the leadership of the Radical-Socialist Party and supported only by the local socialists and Radical-Socialists, he ended up losing his seat.  Georges Izard and Troisi√®me Voie  This electoral setback prompted Bergery to look to other like-minded allies. However, while the Communist, Socialist and Radical-Socialist Parties all had factions with similar ideas, none would quit their party over the issue. This led Bergery to turn to the small Catholic-socialist group Troisi√®me Voie (Third Way). Troisi√®me Voie had begun as a reflection circle linked with Esprit, a progressive Catholic journal concerned with discovering a solution to the economic crisis, via a 'third way' between socialism and laissez-faire liberalism. Georges Izard, a Catholic intellectual and former ministerial undersecretary, disagreed with the prevailing tendency within Esprit to pursue this third way through a modernised social-Catholicism. In 1933 he left to found Troisi√®me Force.  The Social Front  In November 1934 Bergery's Common Front and Izard's Troisi√®me Voie held an assembly and merged into a unified party. This was initially named the Social Front, as the Socialist and Communist parties had formed an alliance also labelled the term 'Common Front' had recently begun to be largely associated with the recent alliance of the Marxist PCF, PUP and SFIO parties. In July 1935 an alliance of anti-fascist parties and civil society organisations was founded, known as the Popular Front. The Social Front was one of the original signatories. In early1936, to avoid confusion between the Popular Front and Social Front, the latter renamed itself as the more distinctive Frontist Party.  The Frontist Party and the Popular Front  By mid-1935 all of the three major left-wing parties had converged onto an agreement on the need to cooperate on a programme of anti- fascism, state-intervention and the defence of liberal parliamentary institutions. The existence of the Popular Front, therefore, undercut the Frontist Party's very raison d'etre. In the elections of 1936, the Frontist Party had little success. Its two co-founders, Bergery and Izard, were both elected to Parliament, but two deputies was too few to form a distinct parliamentary group and thus during the 1936-1940 legislature had to sit among the other left-leaning independents and minor parties, in the Independent Left technical group. The fact that the Frontist Party had just two deputies, each of them a co-founder of the party and each originally from a distinct political tradition, Radicalism and social-Catholicism, meant that the party was permanently split in two. The Troisi√®me Force wing of the party concluded that the weak showing in the elections of 1936 signalled the failure of the Frontist Party's political goals, and in November 1937 they broke away from the Frontist Party. Meanwhile, under the L√©on Blum government (1936‚Äì37), Bergery grew increasingly critical of the Soviet Union and the French Communist Party. He distanced himself from the rest of the Popular Front, and increasingly adopted a tone of 'national revolution' that converged in some aspects with the very same fascist right that he had originally set out to oppose. This trajectory would ultimately bring him on board with the Vichy Regime. ReferencesSources *Burrin, Philippe. La d√©rive fasciste : Doriot, D√©at, Bergery (1933-1945).

The Shooting Star looks exactly the same as the Inverted hammer, but instead of being found in a downtrend it is found in an uptrend and thus has different implications. Like the Inverted hammer it is made up of a candle with a small lower body, little or no lower wick, and a long upper wick that is at least two times the size of the lower body. The long upper wick of the candlestick pattern indicates that the buyers drove prices up at some point during the period in which the candle was formed but encountered selling pressure which drove prices back down for the period to close near to where they opened. As this occurred in an uptrend the selling pressure is seen as a potential reversal sign. After encountering this pattern traders often check for a lower open on the next period before considering the sell-signal valid. As with the Inverted hammer most traders will see a longer wick as a sign of a greater potential reversal and like to see an increase in volume on the day the Shooting Star forms.

The club was founded in 1888 and has achieved hurling success at county, provincial and national level. Glenmore has also provided the Kilkenny intercounty team with several top players. History Glenmore first distinguished itself in Kilkenny on the football field, and it was only in the 1940s that hurling started to take over. Early success came in 1953, when the hurlers won the County Junior Championship. By the 1960s, Glenmore were among the top sides in the county, narrowly losing out to Bennettsbridge in the 1960 and 1964 county finals. Things soon took a turn for the worse, however, when the club was relegated to Junior status in 1967. They reached the final at that grade in 1968, but lost out to Johnstown. Glenmore finally broke back into the senior grade in 1980, winning the double of junior and Under 21 (Roinn A) championships. Glenmore went from strength to strength in the 1980s, and finally reached their first Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship final in 1987. They met Ballyhale Shamrocks in the final, and claimed the Tom Walsh Cup for the first time with a victory, 4-10 to 3-9. Glenmore were back in the final again in 1989, but Shamrocks got revenge for the 1987 defeat, despatching Glenmore with a score 2-11 to 1-13. A second county title came in 1990, when they got the better of Clara, champions from 1986, with a score 3-15 to 2-6. This gave the club a shot at the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship title, and they duly collected their medals after defeating Camross from Laois. Glenmore then secured a place in the All- Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship final, and managed to win the biggest prize in the game after defeating Patrickswell from Limerick 1-13 to 0-12. Ray Heffernan captained the All-Ireland winning side, which featured such Glenmore legends as Eddie O'Connor, Eddie Aylward, Liam Walsh, Christy Heffernan, Willie O'Connor, Denis Mullally and Michael Phelan. Glenmore took their third county championship in 1992, seeing off Tullaroan 1-14 to 2-6. They added their fourth in 1995 with a 3-19 to 1-14 win against Fenians, and soon added a second Leinster medal to their collection. They did not book a date in the final, however, losing out to Ulster champions Dunloy from Antrim. Glenmore won their fifth and final county title in 1999, defeating Graigue-Ballycallan by 1-14 to 2-8. Glenmore lost their senior status in 2005, losing out in a relegation play-off against Fenians. In 2014, Glenmore lost their Intermediate Status losing in a relegation play off to Conahy Shamrocks by 2-22 to 3-16. This was a bitter blow for a famous club who not so long ago were a force to be reckoned with at the top table of Club Hurling both in Kilkenny and on the National Stage. In 2016, Glenmore won another All Ireland title, this time in the Junior grade, edging out Eoghan Rua of Derry in the All Ireland final.

Mission  CAA conducts analyses across the spectrum of conflict in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) context to inform critical senior level decisions for current and future national security issues. Mission of CAA is to conduct analysis of Army forces and systems in the context of joint and combined warfighting. The CAA provides analytical studies focusing on theater-level, Joint and combined operations, and Army-wide processes providing required Army forces and systems. These studies help senior Army leadership, the Army Staff, and operational commanders address transformation, programming and budgeting, and operational issues. Full-time analysts are deployed in Afghanistan, Africa, and the Pacific, providing operations research and analysis support to senior commanders. CAA further supports deployed forces with more sophisticated operations research and analytical capabilities through its real-time reach back operations at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. History The Center for Army Analysis (CAA), originally labeled the Concept Analysis Agency, was formed as a result of the 1973 STEADFAST Army reorganization which combined missions, functions and elements of the Combat Developments Command (CDC) and the Strategy and Tactics Analysis Group (STAG), organizations that had their origin in the early 1960s, into one analytical organization. CAA was created to function as the central force analysis activity for the Department of the Army and its leadership and was initially under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army. In 1974, the Army Staff was reorganized and CAA was placed under the jurisdiction of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). As the scope of its analytical mission grew, CAA was designated as a Field Operating Agency in 1977, and was reassigned to the Army Chief of Staff's Organization in 1979. In 1991 the Vice Chief of Staff for the Army designated CAA as the Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation. In 1998 the Secretary of the Army directed the United States Army Concepts Analysis Agency be renamed the Center for Army Analysis with the primary mission of helping the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) determine requirements and establish objectives for theater-level joint/combined forces. CAA force analyses focus on integrating scenarios, operating concepts and objectives, unit and material performance characteristics and operating parameters of the regions for which the forces are constituted. These analyses form the baseline for analyses of lower-level forces and systems. In March 1999 CAA relocated to its present location, the Dr. Wilbur B. Payne Memorial Hall at Fort Belvoir, VA. As part of the HQDA 2002 realignment, CAA was aligned under the Deputy Chief of Staff G-8. The G-8 has responsibility for the future Army through programming, material integration, program analysis and evaluation and centralized management of HQDA studies and analysis programs including the Army Study Program. With this realignment CAA's role as the major source for HQDA analysis support was strengthened. When the office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (Operations Research) closed in 2006, the Director of CAA was designated Senior Analyst of the Army with responsibility for periodic Army Senior Analyst Reviews, sponsorship of the Army Operations Research Symposium and of the Military Operations Research Society and oversight of international operations research partnership activities. Effective 12 April 2009, the Army Modeling and Simulation Office (AMSO) was transferred form the Deputy Chief of Staff G-3/5/7 to the Deputy Chief of Staff G-8. The transfer included the current AMSO missions of acting as the proponency for the Military Functional Area (FA) 57, Simulation Operations and the civilian Career Program (CP) 36, Modeling and Simulation and the simulation and modeling school. The Center for Army Analysis has twice been awarded the Army Superior Unit Award, for the periods 1999‚Äì2000 and 2010‚Äì2012. CAA and its predecessor organizations have provided continuous analytical support to HQDA since 1960. Much has changed at CAA over the years. CAA once did lengthy studies of 9 months to 1¬Ω years; now it performs quick-reaction analyses that take days, weeks, or a few months. CAA once focused almost exclusively on analysis of the Central Front in Germany; now it conducts analyses ranging over all areas of the globe. CAA once almost exclusively supported the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. While the primary role of CAA remains to support HQDA and Army leadership, its analytical activities have expanded to encompass a wide range of analytical services performed in support of many Army elements and, occasionally, other Department of Defense and US government organizations. The one thing that has not changed at CAA is our unwavering dedication to providing the Army's top leadership with responsive, high- quality analytical support.

Apples, bananas, melons, apricots, and tomatoes, among others, are climacteric fruits; citrus, grapes, and strawberries are not climacteric (i.e., they ripen without ethylene and respiration bursts). However, non-climacteric melons and apricots do exist, and grapes and strawberries harbor several active ethylene receptors. Climacteric is the final physiological process that marks the end of fruit maturation and the beginning of fruit senescence. Its defining point is a sudden rise in respiration of the fruit, and normally takes place without any external influences. After the climacteric period, respiration rates (noted by carbon dioxide production) return to or dip below the pre- climacteric rates. The climacteric event also leads to other changes in the fruit, including pigment changes and sugar release. For those fruits raised as food, the climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste and texture for consumption. After the event, fruits are more susceptible to fungal invasion and begin to degrade by cell death.

The Constitution The Constitution gives a unifying structure of governance to all Nizaris and their religiously-based institutions, who are established in more than 25 countries and territories around the globe. Due to the differing social, economic, and political realities faced by the Nizari diaspora, the constitution has built- in flexibility, allowing various communities the ability to propose rules and regulations unique to individual communities, while retaining the overall unity of framework with all other communities, through detailed provisions within the constitution. =The affirmation of fundamental Islamic beliefs= The Constitution affirms all the fundamental Islamic beliefs and then clearly focuses on the doctrine of the Imamate as envisioned within Nizari theology. It sets out the essence of Isma'ili Shi'i beliefs, affirming the Shahada and that Islam, as revealed in the Quran, is the final message of God to mankind, and is universal and eternal. The Preamble states the authority of the Imam in the Isma'ili tariqa (path) and that allegiance to the Imam unites all IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ Muslims worldwide in their \\"loyalty, devotion and obedience to the Imam within the Islamic concept of universal brotherhood\\". It further states that, from the time of Ali bin Abu Talib, the Imams have given rules of conduct and constitutions in conformity with \\"the Islamic concepts of unity, brotherhood, justice, tolerance and goodwill\\". =The development of the constitution= The development of the constitution began in March 1964, after Imam Karim al- Husayni, known as \\"Aga Khan IV\\", ordained the formation of a Constitutional Committee of Review which sought to produce a report on the needs and circumstances facing diaspora communities. In 1984 a series of field reports were conducted in Africa, Europe, North America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The reports were submitted to the Secretariat of the Imam at Aiglemont outside of Paris, France. Community leaders were then encouraged to offer constructive input. The constitution was signed into effect by the Imam on 13 December 1986, at 11 am, at a ceremony in Geneva, Switzerland. The 1986 constitution has been repealed and the new Constitution was promulgated by Mawlana Hazar Imam on July 11, 1998 coinciding with completion of forty one years of his spiritual leadership. and the flag is used in official meetings of the Imam. Establishment of Ismaili Institutions As Daryoush Mohammad Poor explains in his book Authority without Territory, the Nizari Ismailis have formed a diaspora, and the Imam has directed them to stay loyal to the governments of the countries they live in. Institutions help the Ismailis also have a connection to their religion so that they stay faithful, even as they prioritize their countries of residence.These institutions provide leadership for the community, and an outlet for the community to stay loyal. This Constitution sets up the institutions, and ultimately ‚Äúregulates the relationship between the Imam and the members of this community.‚Äù =Leaders‚Äô International Forum= Article 4 of the Ismaili Constitution establishes the Leaders‚Äô International Forum, which according to Section 4.3, meets periodically to discuss ‚Äúany matters, activities, interests or questions affecting the Jamat‚Äù to the Imam.The Constitution of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims (1986) It can make suggestions on how to respond to these matters, but only the Imam has the power to act on these recommendations. Section 4.4 establishes the structure of the Forum: there will be a Chairman and members chosen from Presidents of the National Councils and otherwise appointed by the Imam. The Chairman cannot be a National Council President. Both the Chairman and the non-President members have term limits set by the Imam, while the members who are National Council Presidents serve on the National Council as long as they are Presidents. =Councils= Article 5 establishes various Councils. Section 5.1 creates three levels of councils: national, regional, and local. The purpose of the Councils, as described in Section 5.5, is to aid in the ‚Äúsocial governance, administration, guidance, supervision and co- ordination of the activities of the Jamat.‚Äù This can manifest in any different goals, including facilitating volunteering, preserving Ismaili history, and developing programming to improve the Jamat‚Äôs quality of life. Section 5.2 establishes National Councils in the 14 countries specified in the First Schedule, and Section 5.4 allows those National Councils to establish Regional and Local Councils as necessary. According to Section 5.7, every National Council has a President, Vice-President, and the Chairmen of the Central Institutions, and if applicable, the Presidents of Local and Regional Councils. The Councils may also consist of other appointed members. Section 5.8 sets the term limit for the President and Vice-President to be three years, and for the other members to be the same as the term of their coexisting positions (i.e. a Local Council President would be a member of the National Council as long as they serve as the President of their Local Council). =Apex Institutions= Apex Institutions, established in Article 6, are created to serve specific goals. Section 6.2 establishes them according to the Second Schedule, which lists four institutions: the Aga Khan Foundation, Aga Khan University, Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, and Aga Khan Trust for Culture. =Tariqah and Religious Education Boards= Section 8.1 establishes a Tariqah and Religious Education Board for the various countries listed in the Fourth Schedule. Some of the duties of the Tariqah and Religious Education Boards, listed in Section 8.4, include developing and teaching a religious education curriculum, and supporting research and book publications centered around Islam and Ismaili Tariqah. Each board is composed of a Chairman, Honorary Secretary, and other appointed members (all of whom serve terms of three years), as well as Regional and Local Board Chairmen, and the Mukhi of the region (whose terms on the Board are to last as long as the terms of these other positions they hold). =Grants and Review Boards= The Imam and Jamats may grant money to other institutions, which is facilitated by the Grants and Review Boards created in Article 9. These Boards distribute the grant money, and ensure that the money is being used properly. Each has a Chairman, Honorary Secretary, and other appointed members. All of these members have terms of three years. The Fifth Schedule outlines the 11 territories that have a Grants and Review Board, which may create smaller Local and Regional Boards. =Darkhanas and Principal Jamatkhanas= Article 10 grants the Imam power to designate a jamatkhana as a darkhana, which is the Imam‚Äôs regional headquarters. According to the Sixth Schedule, the six darkhanas are in: Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada; Khadak, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; Moi Avenue, Nairobi, Kenya; Garden East, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan; Mosque Street, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; Cromwell Gardens, South Kensington, London, UK. =Mukhis and Kamadias= The Rules and Regulations of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims in the United States of America clarifies the responsibilities of the Mukhis and Kamadias of jamatkhanas.The Rules and Regulations of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims in the United States of America in The Constitution of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims (1986), pp. 34 These duties include performing rituals, registering events like births and marriages, maintaining order at their jamatkhana, and helping the Councils and other local institutions. Article 11 of the Constitution states that the Imam will decide ‚Äúthe appointment of Mukhis and Kamadias and their powers, duties, functions, term of office and other related matters.‚Äù =Conciliation and Arbitration Boards= Article 12 establishes an International Conciliation and Arbitration Board, composed of a Chairman and six members, all of whom have three-year terms. This Board is a judicial body that resolves dispute, both civil and domestic, between an Ismaili and a party in another country. It also hears disputes that are unresolved from the National Conciliation and Arbitration Boards, which are created in Article 13. There are eleven National Conciliation and Arbitration Boards as defined in the Seventh Schedule, for the following countries: Canada, France, India, Kenya, Malagasy Republic, Pakistan, Portugal, Syria, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They have the same judicial responsibilities as the International Board, but focus on disputes between an Ismaili and another party in the same region. Each has a Chairman and four members, all of whom have three-year terms. As described in Article 14, Regional and National Conciliation and Arbitration Boards are also in charge of disciplinary action. They have the authority to make an Ismaili take actions such as paying compensation, observing religious rites, or even be expelled from the Jamat for the following offenses: Anyone charged with an offense may appear before the National Council, who can approve, deny, or modify the proposed disciplinary action. Those who are expelled may submit an application to the National Council to be re-admitted, and if they die, may still have Ismaili burial and funeral rites. Article 15 says that Ismailis‚Äô personal law (i.e. law relating to personal relationships) is defined by the Shia Imami Ismaili School of Thought of Islam, which only the Imam may interpret. =Other Institutions= Article 16 creates the Ismaili flag and the Imamat Crest. It also protects the flag, the Imam‚Äôs name and personal information, and photos of the Imam from being used for non-approved purposes. Article 17 declares that only the Imam can create and grant titles, awards, and medals.

Green practices Plastic Ingenuity has made various efforts to go green by providing renewable resource packaging as an option to petroleum based products. Other materials include PLA, PSM, and wood pulp. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources acknowledged PI as a member of their Green Tier Program where qualified businesses make binding commitments to superior environmental performance. Smart recycling and energy strategies also set a strong example for other businesses to follow by bringing business and environmental goals together. Located next to Black Earth Creek, a Class I trout stream, PI's Cross Plains facility has implemented rain gardens, a rock weeper dam, runoff filters and grassed swales to remove pollutants from stormwater. Also implemented was a stringent pellet loss program to prevent spills of the small plastic pellets that serve as raw material, and 99% of scrap plastic is either reused or sold. Due to the heat generated by compressors and vacuum pumps in the thermoforming process, Plastic Ingenuity has engineered a system to capture the heat from this process and utilize it to heat the warehouse during the winter months, thus reducing natural gas usage and capturing a potentially wasted heat source. PI Installed 50 200-watt photovoltaic solar panels on the Cross Plains, WI roof top, which produce about 13,262 kilowatt hours of electricity per year. Producing that amount of energy from non-renewable sources would dump 29,176 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Through its National Security News Service (NSNS) and Natural Resources News Service (NRNS), PEC employs career investigative journalists to develop nationally significant, general- interest news stories that would otherwise be ignored by the mainstream media and places them in targeted commercial media. NSNS covers topics such as weapons of mass destruction, nuclear issues, conventional arms, the intelligence community, terrorism, and government waste, fraud, and secrecy. NRNS focuses on such topics as air and water pollution, habitat protection and reclamation, public land management, and environmental regulation. Reporters for PEC develop these investigative stories by locating and interviewing sources and finding relevant scientific and government information, often utilizing the federal Freedom of Information Act. The organization then offers the work to the commercial media, who utilize PEC‚Äôs contacts and extensive background research to write and produce the final stories themselves.

The settlement was on both sides of the Humber River, in both the former Etobicoke Township and York Township, within today's City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It extended as far west as Royal York Road at Dundas, as far north as the still-existing CPR rail line north of Dundas, as far east as Scarlett Road and as far south as today's Queen Anne Road. The area on the east side of the river is still known as Lambton, although the current neighbourhood encompasses very little of the original Lambton Mills village. History The Gamble General Store The crossing at the Humber dates to pre-European times. It was the crossing of the 'Davenport Trail' and the 'Toronto Carrying Place' trail used by local First Nations. The name was linked to the mills (grist, saw mills, woolen mills) that operated along the Humber River from 1850 to 1915. Originally called Cooper's Mills (c. 1806) after William Cooper's Grist and Saw Mill, it was renamed in 1838 in honour of John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham (High Commissioner and Governor General of British North America, who visited to the area. By 1857, the Village of Lambton Mills contained about 500 people and began to identify the community on both banks of the Humber River at Dundas Street. Earlier, the community on the west bank was frequently referred to as Milton Mills, although Milton Mill (owned by Thomas Fisher) was further downstream in what is now Home Smith Park. Lambton Mills was served by a church, school, and post office which received mail daily. It became an important commercial centre that included stores, a variety of milling operations, taverns, and hotels. Within ten years the population had declined to 250 people as steam-powered mills replaced the water-powered mill, although Lambton Mills continued well into the next century, becoming part of the Borough of York. Aerial Photograph showing Etobicoke and York Township sides of Lambton, 1937 The railway crossing the Humber to the north of Dundas was completed in November 1874 as part of the Credit Valley Railway. The bridge as constructed was long and high. The Credit Valley Railway had a station in Lambton although this no longer exists. Today, the CPR operates the rail line and the Lambton Yard, located east of Scarlett Road. In 1915, most of the buildings on the east side of the Humber were destroyed by fire, including the original Lambton Flour Mills, by then already converted into a hotel and tavern named the Lambton Mills Inn. The Lambton House Inn was spared; it was the only brick building in the area. =Today= Only the Lambton House inn and the Berry House exist from the days of Lambton Mills. The Berry House is located at the present address of 125 Kingsway Cres. and is a listed historic property built in 1892 and owned by the then treasurer of Lambton Mills, John Berry. The immediate vicinity is a residential area, primarily single-family dwellings. Most homes are post-World War II although some cottages date to the 19th century. The name Lambton lives on in \\"Lambton Arena\\", \\"Lambton Park\\", \\"Lambton Woods Park\\" and \\"Lambton Golf and Country Club.\\" To the west, on Royal York Road, is the Lambton Mills Cemetery. Lambton-Kingsway Junior Middle School at Prince Edward and Government, is the third school built on the site. The original school was named Lambton Mills School, dating from approximately 1875.

Vann (1903) Irving Goodwin Vann (January 3, 1842 in Ulysses, Tompkins County, New York - March 22, 1921 in Syracuse, Onondaga County, New York) was an American lawyer, judge and politician from New York. Biography Irving Goodwin Vann Irving Goodwin Vann was the only child of Samuel R. Vann and Catherine H. (Goodwin) Vann. Vann received no formal education until he attended the Trumansburg Academy and then Ithaca Academy, in preparation for college. He enrolled at Yale College in 1859 and graduated B.A. in 1863. Vann initially pursued a career in education, becoming a high school principal and teacher in Owensboro, Kentucky; however, he resigned after a year to pursue a career in law instead. He began to study law at the office of Boardman & Finch in Ithaca, New York, and then entered Albany Law School in the fall of 1864, graduating in the spring of 1865. Upon graduation from Albany Law School, Vann worked briefly for the Department of Treasury in Washington, D.C., but within a year he returned home to central New York and joined the law firm of Raynor and Butler in Syracuse. Vann married Julie Florence Dillaye (1846-1934), the daughter of a Syracuse real estate developer, on October 11, 1870. They had two children, Florence (1871-1942) and Irving Dillaye (1875-1944). He was Mayor of Syracuse, New York from 1879 to 1880. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (5th District) from 1882 to 1895. On December 31, 1895, he was appointed by Governor Levi P. Morton to the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Rufus W. Peckham, Jr, who had been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1896, he was elected on the Republican ticket to a full term on the Court of Appeals, was re-elected in 1910, and remained on the bench until the end of 1912 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years. In 1913, he was one of the lawyers representing William Sulzer at his impeachment trial, and the only one who refused to receive monetary compensation from the State, noting that no further payment was necessary since he was already an employee of the state. (After his retirement as a judge, he had been appointed an official referee to hear claims arising out of the construction of the barge canal). Vann was buried at the Oakwood Cemetery. His son Irving Dillaye Vann (1876‚Äì1944) was a Deputy New York Attorney General.

France entered the war with the hope of achieving a lasting victory against Prussia, Britain and their German allies and with the hope of expanding its colonial possessions.(1) While the first few years of war proved successful for the French, in 1759 the situation reversed and they suffered defeats on several continents. In an effort to reverse their losses, France finished an alliance with their neighbor, Spain, in 1761. In spite of this the French continued to suffer defeats throughout 1762 eventually forcing them to sue for peace. The 1763 Treaty of Paris confirmed the loss of French possessions in North America and Asia to the British. France also finished the war with very heavy debts, which they struggled to repay for the remainder of the 18th century. Background Louis XV ruled France from 1715 to 1774. The previous major conflict in Europe, the War of the Austrian Succession, ended in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. This peace agreement was very unpopular with the French populace who saw the terms as excessively lenient to France's enemies, specifically Britain and the Dutch Republic, and many regarded it as a breathing space before war resumed. France and Britain were engaged in an intensifying global rivalry after they superseded Spain as the leading colonial powers. Hoping to establish supremacy, both countries engaged in several minor wars in North America. French colonies in Louisiana, Illinois, and Canada had largely surrounded British colonies strung out in a narrow strip along the coast. All the French needed to totally envelop the British was control of the Ohio Country. Attempting to gain control of this territory, France built a complex system of alliances with the area's Native American tribes and brought them into conflict with Britain.Anderson, pp. 12‚Äì32 Madame de Pompadour In the mid-18th century, France was an absolute monarchy: all power resided with the King. Louis XV was a weak personality easily manipulated by his advisors and confidants. Chief amongst them was Madame Pompadour, his mistress who exercised enormous influence over appointments and matters of grand strategy. Other advisors rose and fell with rapid succession, continuing the lack of the stability which had plagued the monarchy in the early 18th century. War in Europe While the war began in North America, in 1756 France became drawn into a major war in Europe. Allied to Austria, Sweden and Russia the French tried to defeat the Prussians who had only the British as major allies. Despite repeated attempts between 1757 and 1762, the French and their allies failed to win the conclusive victory against Prussia despite a constant war of attrition. They were partly frustrated by an army led by the Duke of Brunswick made up of British forces and troops from the smaller German states which operated in West Germany. The Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759 destroyed French hopes of invading Britain France had opened the war against Britain in Europe by capturing Menorca and until 1759 they believed they held the upper hand. The British navy, however, had initiated a tight blockade of the French coast which prevented supplies and troops moving freely and sapped morale. Realizing that Prussia was unlikely to be defeated until its ally Britain was, the French foreign minister, Choiseul developed a plan to invade Britain in three separate places at Portsmouth, Essex and Scotland. He oversaw the construction of a massive fleet of transports to convey the troops during 1759. Defeats of the French navy at Lagos and Quiberon Bay put an end to these plans and he was forced to call off the invasion in the late autumn. A diversionary force under Fran√ßois Thurot had managed to land in Northern Ireland before he was hunted down and killed by the British navy. In the wake of the disaster at Quiberon, Thurot was lionised as a hero in France. By this stage France's finances were in a poor state, despite the efforts of Silhouette to keep down expenditure, and France was only kept afloat by a major loan from neutral Spain. Despite the Spanish government's official policy of neutrality, they were slowly shifting towards supporting an outright pro-French position, encouraged by Choiseul. In December 1761, war finally broke out between Britain and Spain - but the Spanish involvement did not provide the relief to the French that had been hoped. Instead French troops were needed to bolster Spanish efforts to invade Portugal, and became bogged down there.Anderson, pp. 497‚Äì98 Spain also suffered defeats in Cuba and the Philippines in 1762, and by the end of the year both Spain and France were urgently seeking peace.Anderson, pp. 498‚Äì502 War in North America France began asserting control over the Ohio Country as early as 1749, issuing warnings and threats to British colonial traders active in the region. When the French began constructing a series of forts in the Ohio River watershed in 1753, the British responded with claims and demands of their own. In 1754, George Washington sparked the beginning of the war with an attack on a French scouting party near present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When they learned that the British were planning to send regular army troops to the area for the 1755 campaign, the French sent a large body of troops to New France before the British could blockade their ports. These troops, combined with a strong alliances with native tribes and poor British military administration, gave France a string of victories from 1755 to 1757; its only significant loss was Acadia, whose remaining territories fell into British hands after the 1755 Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour, inaugurating the expulsion of the Acadians. France was able to maintain control of the Ohio Country as well as the strategically important Great Lakes. After their initial successes in North America, however, France began to starve the theatre of forces and supplies, preferring to concentrate on the war in Europe rather than risk large numbers of troops on expeditions across the British-dominated Atlantic Ocean. Montcalm leading his troops into battle during the failed attempt to defend Quebec in 1759. This contrasted sharply with the British, who put great emphasis on the war for control of North America. In 1758 the British launched several major offensives, capturing Louisbourg, Fort Duquesne, and Fort Frontenac, although they were stopped at Fort Carillon. The following year a large force under General Jeffery Amherst took Carillon and Fort Niagara, while a second large force under General Wolfe sailed up the St Lawrence River to besiege Quebec City. The French commander in Quebec, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, had orders to try to hold out until the winter spell, with the promise that major reinforcements would arrive from Europe the following year. Montcalm almost achieved this, delaying British attempts to capture Quebec until the autumn, when the British finally won the Battle of Quebec and captured the city. In spite of this, a large force of French escaped westwards, intent on resuming the campaign the following year. In 1760 the French launched a surprise effort to re-capture Quebec, which succeeded in blunting one British advance on Montreal. Other British armies advanced on Montreal from the south and west, completing the Conquest of Canada. In the West Indies the French saw the valuable sugar islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique captured by British forces. A final attempt to capture Newfoundland from the British failed in late 1762. War in Asia The French position in India had been severely weakened following the Second Carnatic War, which had ended in 1754 with the Treaty of Pondicherry. In spite of this they held several strong trading posts, particularly that at Pondicherry and they maintained relations with several major Indian Princes who were also enemies of the British. The French war in India started badly, with the loss of the Chandalore which saw the last French trading post in Bengal destroyed. A major French force under the Comte De Lally was despatched from Europe, and it threatened to turn the balance in India. However, an attempt to seize Madras failed, while Lally's force was unable to prevent the eventual British capture of Pondicherry and a comprehensive British victory in India. In the wake of Britain's domination of India, they were able to launch an expedition from Madras to the Philippines which captured Manila from France's ally Spain - further weakening the Bourbon position in Asia. The Mughals led by Shah Alam II were joined by Jean Law and 200 Frenchmen and waged a campaign against the British during the Seven Years' War. Jean Law's Memoire: M√©moires sur quelques affaires de l‚ÄôEmpire Mogol 1756-1761 contains detailed information about the campaign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II and his French allies against the British East India Company.

War in Africa In April 1758 a British expedition conceived by the merchant Thomas Cumming and authorised by Pitt captured the French settlement of Saint-Louis in Senegal. The scheme had been so successful and profitable that two further expeditions were despatched the same year which captured the island of Gor√©e and the French trading station on the Gambia. The loss of these valuable colonies further weakened France's finances. In 1762 a force was prepared to retake the Senegal territories, but had to be abandoned. Peace treaty and aftermath Choiseul took much of the blame for the French defeat in the war, although he later masterminded French successes in the American War of Independence. The French began negotiations in Paris in late 1762. Because of a change in the British government, they were offered more lenient terms than might otherwise have been expected. While they lost Canada to the British, Martinique and Guadeloupe were returned to them in exchange for Menorca. The French defeat had a devastating impact on French political life, and a number of senior figures were forced out of public office. Realizing the deficiency in the French navy, Louis XV began a massive rebuilding program to match British naval strength. Choiseul drew up a long-term plan to gain victory over the British which was partially put into action during the American War of Independence after France joined the conflict in 1778, as did its ally Spain.

The expansion continues touching Parma and Bergamo, up to the new large complex in Mestre in the city center, developed on six floors with an area of nearly 20,000 m2, plus a PAM supermarket in the basement. Between 1966 and 1974 warehouses were opened in Verona, Brescia, Vicenza, Varese, Pordenone, Vigevano, Mantua, Genoa, Livorno, Udine, Piacenza, Naples, Taranto and Ferrara. Coin was the first retailer to develop a fidelity card program in Italy in 1986. Coin Group The Coin Group owns OVS (Oviesse) (midmarket apparel department stores) and, since January 2010, UPIM, a midmarket apparel, home and beauty department stores chain previously part of La Rinascente Group.

It is frequently but incorrectly assumed to be a toll house for the \\"Vanderbilt Motor Parkway\\" which ran considerably south of this location. Over the years as development continued, the North Hempstead Turnpike was moved about 150 feet south of its original path (now called Northern Blvd.) and the Roslyn Cemetery (owned by the Roslyn Presbyterian Church) slowly surrounded the \\"East Gate Toll House\\". There was a \\"West Gate Toll House\\" on the western side of the Roslyn viaduct on Northern Blvd. but either due to massive renovation or removal it is no longer recognizable. With the demise of the toll road the Roslyn East Gate Toll House became no more than a storage shed for cemetery tools. In the early 1980s, Dr. Roger Gerry (President of the Roslyn Landmark Society) desired to have the Roslyn East Gate Toll House restored. Due to budget constraints of the Roslyn Presbyterian Church, this was not possible. A solution was found by a three way agreement between the Roslyn Landmark Society, the Roslyn Presbyterian Church and Richard Hahn whereby Richard Hahn would restore the building at his time and expense to the specifications of the Roslyn Landmark Society. In return, Richard Hahn would utilize the building for his own residence. A historical architect prepared detailed drawings, microscopic paint analysis was done on all painted surfaces to determine original paint colors and after two years of work by Richard Hahn the project was completed to specifications. The Roslyn East Gate Toll House has been included in the annual \\"Roslyn Walking Tour\\" and a very detailed description of its history written by Dr. Roger Gerry which can be found in one of the \\"Roslyn Landmark\\" tour guides.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and industry. It was nominated for its association with a local family that expanded Stillwater's lumber interests into northwest Minnesota, and as the city's leading example of Queen Anne architecture. Description The Albert Lammers House is a two-and-a-half-story wood-frame building on a prominent corner lot. Queen Anne architectural elements include the massing, turrets, wraparound porch, woodworking detail on the gables, ornamented roofline, and surface texturing. The house boasts an octagonal turret on the south and a round turret on the northeast corner. The complex front fa√ßade has recessed balconies on both the second and attic levels. The lower balcony has a latticework frieze while the upper has a seashell motif in its shape and flanking cartouches. Much of the detailed woodworking was done by Scandinavian carpenters, which may explain the Viking-style ornamentation on the roofline. History Albert Lammers was born in Minnesota and married Emma Kroon in 1882. He spent decades in the lumber business with his brother George. Primed by their success in Minnesota's initial logging region‚Äîthe St. Croix Valley‚Äîlumbermen like the Lammers Brothers and Isaac Staples were instrumental in expanding the industry to other parts of the state. In 1898 the Lammers' operation cut of lumber from the Red Lake Indian Reservation and transported it to sawmills in Crookston in northwest Minnesota. The Lammers didn't operate their own sawmills but contracted to cut and bark logs for other companies. Several of the early lumbermen in the valley were motivated to build elaborate, monumental houses to boast of their success in industry. Besides the Albert Lammers House, other houses of industry pioneers include the Roscoe Hersey House, the Captain Austin Jenks House, and the Ivory McKusick House. These houses are also listed on the National Register. As the Minnesota pineries became depleted, Albert Lammers traveled extensively, visiting his logging camps and searching for new business opportunities. He helped establish logging operations in South Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas, and also diversified into mining. Albert and Emma Lammers had four children. She died in 1910. Albert Lammers died in 1920 while in British Columbia, still attending to his lumber empire.

When she died of a heart attack in 1955, a British official said she had, \\"the exterior of an English woman and the mind of a Palestinian.\\" Early life and education Newton was born in Mickleover Manor, near Derby, to Charles Edmund Newton, a banker, and his second wife, Mary Henrietta Moore. She and her several sisters were educated at home by a governess.Brown, Clare. (2009) \\"Newton, Frances Emily,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Newton first visited Palestine in 1888 to see her stepsisters, Constance and Edith Eleanor. Edith was a missionary with the Church Missionary Society (CMS), and within a year, Newton had signed up with the CMS as a volunteer, learning Arabic and travelling throughout Palestine and Jordan. Her mother died in 1893, leaving Newton sufficient funds to be able to volunteer indefinitely. She was trained in nursing and social work in Birmingham, and in missionary work at The Olives in Hampstead, the CMS training centre. She left for Jaffa on October 3, 1895. World War I Newton volunteered to serve as a police officer in Leicester Square during the war, but instead she became the secretary of the Syria and Palestine Relief Fund, which had been set up by Rennie MacInnes, an Anglican bishop in Jerusalem. She represented the Fund on a committee with the Red Cross and the order of St John of Jerusalem, which led to her recognition by the latter as a lady of grace, and later as a dame of justice. She became acquainted with T. E. Lawrence and with King Faisal, the latter visiting her at her home on Mount Carmel. Activism Jonathan Dimbleby writes that Newton was scrupulous in keeping notes of the cases she examined. On February 22, 1938, she visited the village of Igzim, near Haifa, which had undergone a collective punishment after the assassination of a British officer, a Squadron Leader Alderton. She wrote: \\"I entered many of the houses and can only say that the havoc which had been wrought was indescribable, and, unless seen with one's own eyes, unbelievable.\\" In sixty houses, she found that doors had been torn from their hinges, mirrors smashed, cupboards emptied, furniture smashed to pieces, bedding and clothing soaked in olive oil. Nine hundred sheep and goats had been rounded up by British soldiers and taken to Haifa. The owners had to buy the animals back for eight shillings a head. A month later, the village's residents left after the British installed 40 police officers, requiring the villagers to pay the cost of their upkeep, which was 90 pounds a month. Rather than wait for the authorities to seize their possessions in lieu of payment, the villagers fled, some of them moving to shelters made of sacks under olive trees in nearby fields. =Anti-Zionism= Newton was criticized for the virulence of her anti-Zionist activity, which stretched to publishing in 1946 a defence of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who had met Adolf Hitler in 1941. The pamphlet, The Truth about the Mufti, was published by the Anglo-Arab Friendship Society, which she controlled, and excused his collaboration with the Nazis. In her autobiography, Fifty Years in Palestine, Newton blamed the British for the Mufti's relationship with Hitler.Karsh, Efraim. Israel: Israel's transition from community to state, Taylor & Francis 2000, p. 219. =Deportation= Newton exclusion order was issued under Regulation 15 of the Emergency Regulations Act, 1936, as amended by Defence (Amendment) regulations (No. 19), 1938. It was appealed in December 1939 but was upheld by the Chief Secretary of Palestine. Newton appealed again, pleading that her exclusion affected her ability to safeguard her business interests in the country, and the order was eventually lifted in September 1943.Karsh, Efraim. Israel: Israel's transition from community to state, Taylor & Francis 2000, footnote 40, p. 223. Death St Simon Zelotes Church, Milner Street (2009) Newton died in her sleep of a heart attack in 1955 at home in Flat 8, 9 Wilbraham Place, Chelsea. Her funeral was held at St Simon Zelotes church, Milner Street, Chelsea, followed by cremation at Putney Vale. She left 44,675 pounds and two shillings, a substantial sum at the time, all or most of which went to provide medical services for Palestinian refugees in Jordan.Probate, August 31, 1955, CGPLA Eng. & Wales, cited in Brown 2009.

Terms ;Hysteresis loop: Induction B as function of field strength H for H varying between Hmin and Hmax; for ferromagnetic material the B has different values for H going up and down, therefore a plot of the function forms a loop instead of a curve joining two points; for perminvar type materials, the loop is a \\"rectangle\\" (Domain Structure of Perminvar Having a Rectangular Hysteresis Loop, Williams, Goertz, Journal of Applied Physics 23, 316 (1952); in fact it is rectangle if B-Œº0H is used instead B on the plot); ;Remanence, Br; \\"induction which remains\\": After magnetization to saturation, a value of induction B in the material in a closed magnetic circuit without external field H; the point where hysteresis loop crosses B axis; ;Coercivity, Hc: After magnetization to saturation, a value of field strength H at which induction B in the material becomes 0; the point where hysteresis loop crosses H axis; ;(Maximum) energy product, (BH)max: Largest possible field of a rectangle on the hysteresis loop plot, which has two edges on the B and H axes, and a vertex on the hysteresis loop in the second quadrant (B positive, H negative); range from below 1J/m3 for some soft materials (permalloy, 3E4 ferrite), to above 400kJ/m3 for hard ones (neodymium magnets); ;Magnetic viscosity: When an external field H is changed, and then kept at a new value, the induction B first changes almost at once, then some smaller change of B follows in a time; for a permanent magnet typically the time dependence is B(t) = B(t0) ‚àí S¬∑ln(t/t0), where t is time since H change, t is some reference time, and S is a constant of the process (but not of the material, as it varies with magnitude of the H and its change); a theory describing this kind of time dependency was developed by Louis N√©el (J. de Phys. et Radium, 11, 49 (1950)) and by Street and Wooley (A Study of Magnetic Viscosity, Proc.

She was previously a Dutch ship and had been built in 1787 for the Dutch Republic as the Wilhelmina. She was renamed Furie in 1795, after the establishment of the Batavian Republic as a client state of the First French Empire. Like other Dutch ships at that time, she was pressed into service as part of French plans to support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in the hope of destabilising Britain. The British captured her and the Dutch corvette Waakzaamheid in 1798 while the two were supporting French and Irish forces involved in the Irish Rebellion. The Royal Navy took both into service, with Furie regaining her original name. Sailing as HMS Wilhelmina, she spent the bulk of her later career in the East Indies, serving mostly as a troopship. Here she fought an unequal battle against a large French privateer, and succeeded in driving her off and protecting a merchant she was escorting. Wilhelmina was almost the ship that faced a superior French squadron at the Battle of Vizagapatam, but she was replaced beforehand by the larger . She spent the rest of her days as a guardship in Penang, and was sold there in 1813. Dutch career and capture Wilhelmina was built at Flushing in 1787, and armed with 32 guns. She sailed under that name for eight years for the Dutch Republic until the invasion of the Netherlands by the French in 1795 and the establishment of the Batavian Republic led to her being renamed Furie. In 1798 she was part of the Dutch contribution hastily assembled to support the uprising of the United Irishmen in 1798. Furie, under the command of Captain Bartholomeus Pletz, and the 24-gun corvette Waakzaamheid under Captain Meindert van Neirop, were dispatched to carry men and supplies to Ireland. Furie embarked 165 troops and Waakzaamheid 122. In addition, the ships carried over 6,000 stands of arms and large quantities of other military stores with which to arm the Irish irregular forces that they expected to meet. The two ships sailed from the Netherlands on the night of 23/24 October, and by 08:00 were northwest of the Texel, sailing westwards towards the English Channel. There the British frigate , under the command of Captain Richard King, spotted them. Sirius had been stationed off the Texel to watch for Dutch movements and intercept any ships of smaller or equal size entering or leaving the waterway. Although van Neirop's squadron outnumbered King's ship, the British vessel was much larger and faster, and the Dutch were also hampered by their position: the two ships were more than apart, too far to offer mutual support against their opponent. King first attacked the smaller and slower Waakzaamheid, avoiding contact with the larger Furie as he did so. At 09:00 Sirius came alongside Waakzaamheid and fired a gun at her, prompting van Neirop to surrender immediately. King secured Waakzaamheid and set off in pursuit of Furie, which was attempting to flee to the west. The chase lasted the rest of the day, with Sirius eventually coming within range at 17:00. The two ships exchanged broadsides for half an hour, as Pletz attempted to maneuver out of King's range. Furie was soon badly damaged whereas only one shot Dutch shot had struck Sirius, and that on the bowsprit. At approximately 17:30, Pletz surrendered, having lost eight dead and 14 wounded; Sirius had only one man wounded. King transferred the prisoners and placed a prize crew on Furie before returning to the Nore with his prizes. British career Furie came into Sheerness on 17 November 1798. She was commissioned as HMS Wilhelmina under Captain David Atkins in January 1800 and was then fitted as a troopship at Woolwich between January and September 1800 for the sum of ¬£10,914. Captain Charles Herbert took command in April that year and Commander James Lind succeeded him in 1801. Wilhelmina was among the vessels that served during the British campaign in Egypt between 8 March and 2 September. She carried troops for General Ralph Abercromby's landing at Ab≈´ Qƒ´r, in the face of strenuous opposition, which is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army. Because Wilhelmina served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 2 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal, which the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants. Lind sailed Wilhelmina to the East Indies later that year. In 1802 she was in the Red Sea, supporting General Baird's expedition to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. On 14 June 1802 the transport Calcutta wrecked on the Egyptian coast in the Red Sea. She was carrying 331 men of the 80th Regiment of Foot and 79 native Indian followers. arrived the next day, as did two transports. Only Romney was able to get her boats out but they were able to rescue and deliver to the shore all but seven men who had died in an early attempt to reach shore. Captain Sir Home Riggs Popham left to salvage anything that could be salvaged and then sailed to Suez from whence he dispatched Wilhelmina to pick up the troops on the 15th and carry them back to India.The Asiatic Annual Register; Or, A View of the History of Hindustan,: And of the Politics, Commerce, and Literature of Asia, ... (1803), pp.152-3. Lind remained with Wilhelmina until 1803. She then came under the temporary command of Lieutenant William Dobbie. In May 1803 Commander Henry Lambert took command. In September Whilhelmina stopped briefly at Hambantota, Ceylon, where she dropped off an eight-man detachment from the Royal Artillery, who reinforced the British garrison there and later helped it repel a Kandian attack. =Battling the Psyche= On 9 April 1804 Wilhelmina was escorting the country ship William Petrie to Trincomalee when she sighted a strange sail. The unknown ship was the 36-gun French privateer Psyche, under the command of Captain Trogoff. Psyche outgunned Wilhelmina, which was armed en fl√ªte. Nevertheless, Lambert sailed towards Psyche to give William Petrie a chance to escape. Light winds meant that the engagement did not begin until 11 April, when both ships opened fire, exchanging broadsides and attempting to tack around to rake their opponent. After several hours fighting, Psyche broke off and fled. Both ships had sustained heavy damage, Wilhelmina to her masts and rigging, while Psyche was in a near-sinking condition. Wilhelmina had nine of her crew wounded, three mortally and six slightly, while Psyche lost ten killed and 32 wounded, 13 of them mortally. Wilhelmina put into port, while William Petrie also arrived safely at her destination. Almost a year later, on 14 February 1805, Lambert, now Captain (Acting) of would meet Psyche, now a frigate of the French Navy, in battle off the Malabar Coast of India. Lambert was victorious in a sanguinary action that resulted in the British taking Psyche into service as HMS Psyche. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"San Fiorenzo 14 Feby. 1805\\" to any still surviving claimants from the action. =Missed battle= In mid-1804 Wilhelmina was assigned to escort a small convoy of East Indiamen. Because a French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois was raiding merchant shipping in the East Indies, the British commander in the area, Admiral Peter Rainier decided to replace Wilhelmina with the larger . Consequently, it was Centurion that resisted Linois's forces at the Battle of Vizagapatam in September 1804. Fate Captain Charles Foote took command of Wilhelmina in 1807, followed in an acting capacity by Commander William Hext in April 1809. She remained in the East Indies during this entire period. Commander Samuel Leslie took over in March 1811, followed in 1812 by Lieutenant George Norton. She became the guardship at Prince of Wales Island (Penang), and was sold there in January 1813.

The group was led by the Pakistani Shahed Hussain, a criminal who was working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to avoid deportation for DMV fraud.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/nyregion/limo-owner-fbi-informant- shahed-hussain.html Shahed Hussain has never been charged in the USA with any terrorism related offenses and was paid nearly $100,000 US Dollarshttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/shahed-hussain-fbi- informant/ by the FBI for his work on this plot. The FBI's use of two informants, and offers of money and food incentives to the four men in the case has led to accusations that the FBI engaged in entrapment. On August 23, 2013 by a 2 to 1 vote an appeal to overturn the convictions was denied by a Manhattan appeals court. Judge Jon O. Newman cited Cromitie's statements as proof of intent. In dissent, the Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs said there was scarce evidence of pre intent and that Cromitie was \\"badgered\\" into joining the plot. All three judges unanimously rejected the entrapment claims by the three other defendants and rejected all four defendants‚Äô arguments that their convictions should be overturned on grounds of government misconduct. Background The attempted attack is cited as one of a series of plots and failed attacks on military installations in the United States, including the 2005 Los Angeles bomb plot, the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting, and the September 11 attacks. Previous attacks in Riverdale include the 1989 firebombing of the Riverdale Press during the controversy over The Satanic Verses and the 2000 New York terror attack. Suspects The terrorist suspects were four Muslim men; three are African-American U.S. citizens, and one is a Haitian immigrant. Cromitie was first recruited by Shahed Hussain, an Albany hotel owner and FBI informant at the Masjid al-Ikhlas mosque in Newburgh, New York, which he attended on only a few occasions. The FBI informant posed as a wealthy business man and enticed Cromitie with an offer of $250,000.Newburgh mosque leaders: We don't preach hate By Alex Weisler ¬∑ May 25, 2009 Cromitie and his three accomplices, David Williams, Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen, had no serious offences on their records, but were described as \\"extremely violent men\\" by prosecutors. The defense argued that these men would never have contrived this plot without the leadership of paid informants, which many have considered a wasteful use of government resources, i.e., to create terrorism plots where there wouldn't have been any to begin with. None of the men had the money, knowledge or skills to obtain materials or assemble a bomb. Cromitie (also known as Abdul Rahman), the reported leader, claimed he was born a Muslim and that his parents live in Afghanistan. He told the FBI informant that he was angry about the US military killing Muslims in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He had lived in Brooklyn and had a record of 27 arrests for minor crimes both in upstate New York State and New York City. In April 2009, the FBI informant coaxed Cromitie and his three alleged accomplices into accepting their targets. They were to bomb the Riverdale Temple and nearby Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx. They were also to fire Stinger surface-to-air guided missiles at military planes at a nearby air base, although it was not clear if they were to target any manned aircraft. In late August 2010, Hussain testified that Cromitie \\"hated Jews and Jewish people and he hated the American people, American soldiers. He was full of hate on those subjects. He said he would kill the president (then George W. Bush) 700 times because he's the Antichrist.\\" Plot Satellite photo of Stewart Air National Guard Base, where the accused were planning to shoot down a military aircraft. Masjid al-Ikhlas Shahed Hussain, a Pakistani immigrant, agreed to serve as an FBI informant after being arrested in 2002 over a scam involving driver's licenses. He previously served as an informant in an unrelated terrorism investigation in Albany, which resulted in the convictions of Yassin M. Aref and Mohammed Mosharref Hossain. In the Bronx case he was reported to have used audio and video taped many of his meetings with the attackers. In 2008 Hussain showed up at the Masjid al-Ikhlas mosque under the name \\"Maqsood\\", talking of jihad and violence. Members of the congregation interviewed after the plot was exposed said that \\"most\\" members of the congregation had believed Hussain to be an informant. No one reported his talk about Jihad to the authorities.Newburgh mosque leaders: We don‚Äôt preach hate . By Alex Weisler. May 25, 2009. Cromitie expressed interest to the informant of returning to Afghanistan, and hopefully becoming a martyr. In April 2009, Cromitie and his three accomplices chose their targets. They planned to both bomb the Riverdale Temple and nearby Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx, and, using Stinger surface-to-air guided missiles, shoot down military planes flying out of a nearby air base. The accused attackers bought cellphones, as well as cameras, from Wal-Mart, to scout out the synagogues. They attempted to buy guns from a dealer in Newburgh; however, the dealer had sold out. They then drove downstate and bought a $700 pistol from a Bloods gang leader in Brooklyn. On May 6, 2009, the men traveled to Stamford, Connecticut, to pick up what they believed to be a surface-to-air guided-missile system and three improvised explosive devices, all of which were incapable of actually being used. On the way there, one of the men believed they were being followed by federal agents. They returned to Newburgh until they were satisfied that they were safe, and then turned around and headed back to Stamford. The men also conducted surveillance of military planes at the Air National Guard base, including taking photographs to prepare for the attack there. Attempted attack and arrest The men placed fake bombs wired to cell phones in three separate cars outside the Riverdale Temple and nearby Riverdale Jewish Center, both in the Riverdale community of Bronx. New York City Police Department Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said one of the suspects placed explosives, while the other three suspects served as lookouts. The men were returning to their vehicle and heading to attack aircraft at the Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York, with the fake Stinger missiles when law enforcement stopped them. The air base shares facilities with the civilian Stewart International Airport. As the men were returning to the vehicle, the signal was given for the arrest. An 18-wheel New York City Police Department vehicle blocked the end of the street. The FBI informer also served as the driver of the suspects' vehicle. Another armored vehicle arrived, and officers from the department's Emergency Service Unit smashed the blackened windows of the S.U.V., removed the men from the vehicle, and handcuffed them on the ground. None offered resistance. Both the car bombs and the missiles were actually fakes given to the plotters with the help of an informant for the FBI. Each of the two homemade bombs was equipped with about 37 pounds of inert material designed to look like C-4 plastic explosive, and \\"there was no danger to anyone,\\" Kelly said. Trial and sentencing Cromitie, Onta Williams, David Williams, and Payen and were charged with conspiracy and weapons offenses at their first court appearance on May 21, 2009 and were ordered to be held without bail. The charges they faced ‚Äì conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in the United States and conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles ‚Äì carried a maximum sentence of life in prison. All four men pleaded not guilty. In March 2010, defense lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case on grounds of entrapment. Relying on materials provided by the government (including recordings and FBI agents' affidavits), the defense argued that the plot was proposed and closely directed by the FBI's informant, who \\"suggested the targets, paid for the defendants' groceries, bought a gun, provided the fake bombs and missile, assembled the explosive devices and acted as chauffeur\\". In late August 2010, government informant Shahed Hussain testified, stating that ringleader James Cromitie \\"hated Jews and Jewish people and he hated the American people, American soldiers. He was full of hate on those subjects. He said he would kill the president 700 times because he's the Antichrist.\\" After a six-week trial, the four were convicted. The lawyers for the four have filed a motion for a new trial claiming that Hussain committed perjury during the trial. David Williams told the Village Voice that the four were not part of plot to hurt people but to swindle Hussain, and the incriminating statements were made to make Hussain believe the four were credible terrorists. On June 29, 2011, Cromitie, Onta Williams, and David Williams were each sentenced, for their part in the attempted attack, to 25 years in prison by Manhattan Federal Judge Colleen McMahon. The judge criticized not only the defendants, but also what she viewed as the government's overzealous handling of the investigation. Referring to Cromitie, she said, \\"The essence of what occurred here is that a government, understandably zealous to protect its citizens from terrorism, came upon a man both bigoted and suggestible, one who was incapable of committing an act of terrorism on his own. It created acts of terrorism out of his fantasies of bravado and bigotry, and then made those fantasies come true.\\" She added, \\"The government did not have to infiltrate and foil some nefarious plot ‚Äì there was no nefarious plot to foil.\\" She said the defendants were \\"not political or religious martyrs,\\" but \\"thugs for hire, pure and simple.\\" Each of the men apologized before the sentencing. Cromitie said, \\"I've never been a terrorist and I'll never be a terrorist. I'm very sorry I let myself get caught up in a sting like this\\" and added that he did not truly believe the anti-Semitic statements heard on the audiotapes at trial. On September 7, 2011, McMahon also sentenced Laguerre Payen to 25 years prison, but repeated her criticism of the government's handling of the investigation. In 2013, a federal appeals court, by a vote of two to one, upheld convictions that the three defendants were guilty as charged. Judge Newman, in rejecting the misconduct claims, stated that, \\"As with all sting operations, government creation of the opportunity to commit an offense, even to the point of supplying defendants with materials essential to commit crimes, does not exceed due process limits....[FBI] agents would have been derelict in their duties if they did not test how far Cromitie would go to carry out his desires. When a government agent encounters a Muslim who volunteers that he wants to 'do something to America' or die like a martyr, the agent is entitled to probe the attitudes of that person to learn whether his religious views have impelled him toward the violent brand of radical Islam that poses a dire threat to the United States.\\" Imprisonment James Cromitie is currently serving his 25-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood Medium, a medium-security facility in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled for release in 2031. Onta Williams is currently serving his 25-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, McDowell, a medium- security facility in West Virginia, and is scheduled for release in 2031. David Williams is currently serving his 25-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto, a medium- security facility in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled for release in 2030. Laguerre Payen is currently serving his 25-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Tucson, a high-security facility in Arizona, and is scheduled for release in 2032. Reactions and aftermath Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, praised the New York City Police Department. Other local politicians also praised law enforcement and expressed relief. New York Governor David Paterson said the plot illustrated the constant terrorist threat New York faces. On May 30, 2009, New York Governor David Paterson announced he would give the Riverdale Jewish Center and the Riverdale Reform Temple $25,000 each to improve their security. The money will come from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and will primarily involve the installation of alarms and surveillance equipment.Targeted Bronx synagogues to get security funds , Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), June 2, 2009. An award-winning 2014 HBO documentary about the case, The Newburgh Sting, showed that the attack plans and materials were all supplied by the FBI informant who coaxed the accused into participating by offering incentives including $250,000, described as a clear case of entrapment. The arrest was described (by the documentary) as having been expertly stage-managed in the style of a Hollywood production, needlessly deploying multiple armoured vehicles and over a hundred officers from various departments, including bomb squads although there was no bomb. The FBI, it was claimed, was motivated throughout by a desire to maintain public fear of terrorism and to enhance their reputation for effectiveness.

Content Idries Shah Wisdom of the Idiots is a book of Sufi teaching stories designed to influence the reader using traditional Sufi psychology. Many stories are reminiscences of encounters with Sufis of long ago but experiences highlighted are valuable even from today's perspective. The carefully selected stories contain several levels of meaning and work like psychological mirrors in which the reader may see himself and Reality reflected, and come to understand these better. 'In Idries Shah's Wisdom of the Idiots, the 'idiots' are Sufis, called this because their wisdom penetrates to a depth which renders it inaccessible to the merely intelligent or academically-knowledgeable.' Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, Wisdom of the Idiots can be read as part of a whole course of study. Reception As part of the corpus of teaching stories/traditional psychology, Wisdom of the Idiots has grabbed the attention of modern researchers into psychology. Various techniques that modern science has claimed for itself are clearly present in materials provided centuries before. The psychologist Robert Ornstein has researched the psychological nature of human mind and brain and their relationship to thought, realised potential, and the applicability of traditional techniques for today's applications. Arthur Deikman, a clinical professor of psychiatry and pioneer investigator of mystical states from scientific point of view, studied under Shah and wrote extensively on functional approaches to mysticism. M.Y. Shawarbi, an authority on Islamic culture, scientist and author, says of this book \\"In comparative religion and metaphysics, the release of over five hundred \\"teaching stories\\" in Tales of the Dervishes, and Wisdom of the Idiots, and several other books was recognized in religious and philosophical journals as elucidating a hitherto very imperfectly known system of teaching.\\" Wealth, volume and entertainment factor of these stories have spurred establishment of many organizations and colleges of story tellers.

Meals on Wheels America is a non-profit organization which works towards improving information and services provided to senior citizens.  Vision  The vision of Meals on Wheels of America is to see no senior go hungry. Approximately 10,000 people in the United States turn 65 each day. One quarter will live to the age of 90. Many will not be able to keep up with daily tasks. According to the website, These seniors already represent the fastest growing population segment in the U.S. A major factor in living longer is that cost of living increases and funds do not. This becomes a contributing factor for seniors in the decision to sell their homes to move into a nursing facility. Meals on wheels provides a solution to this issue by providing meals to seniors at a fraction of the cost of living in a senior facility. Through this program, billions of dollars are saved everyday in Medicare and Medicaid costs annually. The greatest benefit of the Meals on Wheels program is that it provides seniors with improved health, security, and independence.

Extending for , the ditch includes a tunnel as well as wooden flumes. The project also includes a rock dam and headgate on Stella Lake. The ditch's terminus at Osceola, Nevada became disused during the early 1900s and was destroyed entirely by a fire in the 1940s. Much of the East Ditch is included within Great Basin National Park. Osceola Mine Gold was first discovered by James Matteson and Frank Heck in 1872 in what would become the Osceola mining district, to the west of what would become Great Basin National Park. Placer gold was discovered by John Versan in 1877. The town of Osceola grew to 1500 residents, extracting almost $2 million in gold, including a nugget. Gold was found in nearby Dry Gulch, but its extraction would require large scale engineering. The Osceola Gravel Mining Company formed to exploit the deposit using hydraulic mining techniques, constructing the West Ditch in 1884-1885. The water proved to be inadequate for the purpose, so the East Ditch was surveyed in 1885. Water rights were purchased from Absalom Lehman, discoverer of Lehman Caves. The ditches Osceola Ditch tunnel The project was built to serve the Osceola Gravel Mining Company's placer gold mine, which required enormous quantities of water to blast apart gold-bearing gravel and rubble deposits, and was capable of delivering 2500 miner's inches of water. A companion project, the West Ditch could provide 1100 miner's inches. The East ditch was built at a cost of $108,222.65, with a width of at the bottom, in width with a uniform grade of per mile (1.6 km). The ditch could carry per day. The East Ditch included 14 sections of wood flume, including in Lehman Canyon. Flumes were wide and deep, with a uniform grade of per mile (1.6 km). Accessory structures included four ditch keepers' houses. Extensive improvements were made to the mining area, including expansion of the receiving reservoir, new sluices, and two hydraulic monitors. Despite all of these measures, there was never enough water available for the mining operation to reach its full potential. Operations had to be curtailed in 1894 and again in 1896. After eleven years, the Osceola Mine shut down for good. An abortive 1906 plan to organize a new company, the Nevada Amalgamated Mines and Power Company, with plans for reduction works, a power plant, three towns and a railroad spur, never reached fruition. The West Ditch predated the East Ditch, extending to the west side of the Snake Range. It is not included in the historic district designation. Little remains of the West Ditch. The East Ditch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The East Ditch no longer carries water and is overgrown, but sections of flume remain. The tunnel at Strawberry Creek has partially collapsed. Little remains of Osceola itself.

Written by Jimi Hendrix, the song details the scenario of a male protagonist addressing his female love with whom he plans to leave home, only to be shot dead by her father. Despite not being released as a single, \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" has been recognised as one of the strongest songs on the album. Background and style \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" was one of the first \\"situation song[s]\\" written by Hendrix and is said to be influenced by soul artists such as the Isley Brothers (with whom Hendrix performed before forming the Experience) and stylistically similar to guitarist Steve Cropper. A \\"head-on boy‚Äìgirl song\\", \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" was one of the final songs recorded for the album on October 26, 1967, before the album was completed with the recording of title track \\"Bold as Love\\" three days later. In an AllMusic review, Matthew Greenwald described the progression and style of the song: Reception Reviews of Axis: Bold as Love have generally mentioned \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" in a positive light. Matthew Greenwald of allmusic identifies the \\"playful song\\" as \\"one of the low-key highlights\\" of the album, while Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone describes it as a \\"taut, funky, could've-been-hit.\\" In reviewing the album for the BBC, Chris Jones summarised \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" as \\"a wry, funky little tale,\\" while Sputnikmusic reviewer \\"Broken Arrow\\" comments: Personnel ;The Jimi Hendrix Experience *Jimi Hendrix ‚Äì lead vocals, guitars *Noel Redding ‚Äì bass, backing vocals *Mitch Mitchell ‚Äì drums, tambourine, backing vocals ;Additional personnel *Chas Chandler ‚Äì production *Eddie Kramer ‚Äì engineering Cover versions American blues-rock band the John Mayer Trio have performed \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" a number of times, with live performances featured on their 2005 live album Try! and lead vocalist and guitarist John Mayer's 2008 live album Where the Light Is: John Mayer Live in Los Angeles. Brazilian musicians and social activists Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso covered \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" on their 1994 CD, Tropicalia 2. Gil's & Veloso's adaptation takes the song outside its original timing and puts it into Brazilian rhythm. While the lyrical spirit of the song is consistent with the original, Gil's & Veloso's history of activism in Brazil adds a social element to the personal \\"situation song\\" style that Hendrix was experimenting with in his writing at the time.

The first edition was published on 5 January 1843. The formal title of the newspaper is English Churchman and St James' Chronicle. St James Chronicle dates from 1761. The paper has a reputation for being outspokenly and unashamedly Protestant, Evangelical, Reformed and anti-ecumenical, believing that the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England are good and true and so it does not recognise non-evangelical Churches as being truly Christian because they have erred in doctrine and practice. Ironically, and contrary to general ecclesiastical trends, the English Churchman began life as an Anglo- Catholic newspaper but it was soon taken into evangelical hands where it has remained ever since. While the doctrinal basis of the English Churchman is the 39 Articles of Religion, the newspaper is not an organ of the Church of England. The current editor is a minister in the Church of England (Continuing) which also holds to the old Evangelical and Reformed Anglican position as won by the Protestant Reformation. At the time of the death of Pope John Paul II the English Churchman was one of the first evangelical publications to state that it did not believe the Pope was a Christian, but rather, as historically Protestants have almost universally believed, that the papacy is Antichrist.Edition 7660 of 15 April 2005 The newspaper was originally weekly but has since the 1970s been published fortnightly.

The movement was strong from 1880 till the fall of the Republic in 1940. At first, the Independent Socialists were a diverse set of socialists who refused to affiliate with an organized party. Indeed, before the creation of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1905, French socialism was divided between the French Socialist Party (PSF), the Socialist Party of France (PSdF) and the French Workers' Party (POF). Later, the name was applied to parliamentarians and local politicians who believed they held their legitimacy from voters and thus refused to follow the instructions of party leaders. Indeed, the SFIO, the main socialist party, had a strong party organization, something relatively unique in the Third Republic. In the end, following the creation of the SFIO, the name was used to refer to those who did not wish to join the SFIO. A number of those people later joined the Republican-Socialist Party (PRS).

It was designed by architect George W. Orff in a mix of Eastlake and early Queen Anne style. Roscoe Hersey (?1841‚Äì1906) was a key figure in Stillwater's lumber and mercantile development, the son and local representative of Isaac Staples' Maine-based business partner Samuel F. Hersey. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, and industry. It was nominated for its embodiment of the commercial success of the Hersey‚ÄìStaples partnership, the ties between the St. Croix Valley and Bangor, Maine, and the peak of Stillwater's lumber industry. Description The Roscoe Hersey House is an irregular wood-frame building with 18 rooms. Besides its elaborate exterior decoration, its dominant feature are four two- story bays projecting from the north, east, and south elevations and the southeast corner. The house originally rose to another half-story, with the east bay above the main entrance extending into a three-and-a-half-story belvedere tower, but the building's upper reaches were destroyed in a 1926 fire, after which the roofline was restructured in its present configuration. The house's decorative woodwork was made possible by the advent of machine production. Embellishments include friezes beneath the second-story windows and above the porches, scrolled brackets, and fluted columns. History Maine natives Samuel Hersey and Isaac Staples formed the firm of Hersey, Staples and Company in 1851 to harvest the rich pineries of the St. Croix Valley. With Hersey based at home in Bangor and Staples in charge of local operations, the firm grew into the largest timberland owner in the region, operator of a leading sawmill, and partner in other commercial endeavors. Samuel Hersey's eldest son, Roscoe, served in the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment during the Civil War. Severely wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Roscoe Hersey mustered out at the rank of colonel. In 1867 the younger Hersey moved to Minnesota with his wife Eva to look after the family's business interests there. Initially managing the firm's Lake City branch, he relocated to Stillwater in 1872 and partnered into the company of Hersey, Bean and Brown. In 1878 he served one term as a state senator. Seeking to build a residence to befit their station, the Herseys purchased three adjacent lots in May 1879, and their grand home was completed the following year. Several of the early lumbermen in Stillwater were motivated to build elaborate, monumental houses to boast of their success in industry. Besides the Roscoe Hersey House, other houses of industry pioneers include the Captain Austin Jenks House, the Albert Lammers House, and the Ivory McKusick House. These houses are also listed on the National Register. The Herseys only lived in this home for seven years, selling it in 1887 to move to Cathedral Hill, Saint Paul. Successive later owners John G. Nelson and James E. McGrath were both lumbermen as well.

He was born in Eaton, Derbyshire, but is considered a Wolverhampton artist, as he moved to Wolverhampton by 1881, together with his widowed mother and brothers Richard and John.1881 census In the 1880s, his address was Osborne Cottage, Sweetman Street, Wolverhampton, but later he moved to Compton, a suburb of Wolverhampton. Vickers de Ville was not professionally trained and did not consider himself a professional artist, however, his artistic gift was recognised and appreciated. In Compton, he maintained a studio in Tettenhall Wood. From 1887, he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Between 1876-1920, sixty eight his works were shown at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, a full member of which he was elected in 1917. He also exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, Fine Art Society, The Royal Glasgow Institute for the Fine Arts, Royal Scottish Academy, and at the Salons in Paris. J Vickers de Ville. The Silent Pool.1886. Wolverhampton Art Gallery Vickers de Ville worked in both oils and watercolours. His favourite subject was North Wales where \\"he first obtained his inspiration amid the grand and imposing scenery\\",Express and Star, 22.03.1915. with particular inclination to coastal landscapes and streams and rivers, and investigation of light effects in open air. It was noticed that \\"few can rival him in depicting torrent, rock, river and trees.\\"Express and Star. 22.03.1915. His landscapes of the Cotswolds, Malvern, Cheshire and Staffordshire are also well known. Often they expressed the mood of melancholy and solitude, like his painting 'The Moonlight' which was to illustrate Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata'.Express and Star, 22.03.1915. Vickers de Ville's personal exhibition was successfully held at Wolverhampton Art Gallery in 1915. It presented sixty-four paintings and numerous sketches, many of which were loaned by Scottish, Liverpool and London patrons. The exhibition was favourably reviewed and it was particularly mentioned that \\"a great many of his pictures are in the United States, and others have found owners in France, Germany and South America. Most of them were bought by the Americans. The demand from abroad is one of the reasons why Wolverhampton people have been able to see so little of his work.\\"Express and Star, 22.03.1915.

A number of paintings by Vickers de Ville have been preserved at Wolverhampton Art Gallery. His works also can be found at McLean Museum and Art Gallery, Greenock, Sheffield Museum and Art Gallery and other public and private collections. Little is known about de Ville's personal life. He married in 1894, and with his wife Mary had at least one child - the son Claude (born in 1895).

Additionally, the athletic booster club sponsors 5th and 6th grade basketball teams. =Mascot history= The teams mascot and nickname, the Wildcats, has its roots in the mid-1920s. The 1925-26 boys basketball team was one of the most successful in school history, reaching the \\"Elite 8\\" in the Missouri state high school tournament after beating much larger schools like Kirksville and Moberly. At first the word was split, Wild Cats, which was 1920s slang for \\"crazy guys\\" or \\"cool guys\\", however by the end of the decade the word had been consolidated and linked to the animal. Wildcats are not native to Missouri, but a close cousin, the Bobcat can be found in substantial numbers in the Chariton River valley around Novinger and elsewhere in northeast Missouri. Novinger and other small schools in the area were some of the first in the state to have girls basketball teams. The Novinger girls began using \\"Wild Kittens\\" around the same time as the boys adopted their name, and would continue to be known as such until the mid-1970s wen the more politically correct \\"Lady Wildcats\\" was put into usage. Among the extra curricular activities offered are: FBLA, FFA, Cadet teaching, varsity and junior varsity Academic teams, National Honor Society, Choir, and Band. The Novinger band has consistently received high marks over the years with several first-place finishes at parades in Missouri and Iowa, and several \\"1\\" ratings for concert band excellence in Missouri district music contests.

It is located on the Saint Lawrence River, between Quebec City and Trois-Rivi√®res. The Portneuf River runs on the east side of the town centre. The town of Portneuf is named after a seignory that was founded in 1636, and first settled in 1640. The municipal territory consists of 2 non-contiguous areas, separated by the municipality of Sainte- Christine-d'Auvergne. The smaller northern portion is undeveloped, whereas the southern piece is the main inhabited part with the population centres of Portneuf (south of Autoroute 40), and the adjacent Notre-Dame-de-Portneuf, north of A-40. The present-day municipality was created in 2002, when the old city of Portneuf merged with the town of Notre-Dame-de- Portneuf.http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/pdf/modjuillet02.pdf The town is located on the Chemin du Roy, a historic segment of Quebec Route 138 that stretches from near Montreal to Quebec City. The town is also close by to A-40, where Provencher Street connects to the town at Exit 261. One of Portneuf's major employers is a local paper mill owned by Metro Paper Industries, a Toronto-based paper company.Web page for MPI's Portneuf plant Paper had been a major part of Portneuf's development since the first paper mill opened in 1839.University of Western Ontario: \\"Business and History - J. Ford & Co. Limited\\" History In 1636, the area was granted by the Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France as a seignory to Jacques Leneuf de La Poterie (1606-after 1685), who arrived in Quebec only some months later and became substitute governor of Trois-Rivi√®res from 1645 to 1662. The first colonizers came around 1640 and settled at the mouth of the \\"Port Neuf\\" River (meaning new harbour). In 1817, the Portneuf post office opened. In 1861, the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-Portneuf was formed, and two years later in 1863, it was incorporated as a parish municipality. In 1896, it lost a large portion of its territory when the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Christine was formed. In 1914, the village centre itself separated from the Parish Municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Portneuf and was incorporated as the Village Municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Portneuf. In 1961, this latter one changed status and abbreviated its name, becoming the City of Portneuf. On July 4, 2002, the parish municipality was amalgamated into the new City of Portneuf.

With two-thirds of its length in Boise County, it passes by historic Idaho City and the village of Lowman to the western edge of the Sawtooth Mountains, then along their northern boundary to Stanley. The road is designated as one of Idaho's scenic byways and provides access to Sawtooth National Recreation Area from Boise and the Treasure Valley. It primarily follows the Boise River and its tributary Mores Creek to the Boise Basin and beyond, and then the upper South Fork of the Payette River and a tributary from Lowman to Banner Creek Summit. Route description Lucky Peak Dam near Boise McGown Peak & Stanley Lake Northern terminus of SH-21 at Stanley SH-21 begins at exit 57 of Interstate 84 southeast of Boise, exactly above sea level. The highway is an eastern extension of Gowen Road, which runs along the southern and western perimeter of the Boise Airport (and the Air National Guard's Gowen Field) to connect with Orchard Road at exit 52 of I-84. After eastbound from I-84, Highway 21 descends and crosses the New York Canal and Boise River on a bridge constructed in 1996, and connects with Warm Springs Avenue, old SH-21, from east Boise. The highway heads upstream, briefly as a four-lane divided highway, along the north bank of the river in a basalt canyon. The route passes the century-old Boise River Diversion Dam (1909), and several miles later the Lucky Peak Dam, completed in 1955. Above the Lucky Peak Dam, SH-21 climbs over the Highland Valley Summit (), then descends to just above the reservoir. It then crosses the Mores Creek tributary and ascends with it to the Boise Basin gold mining area centered around Idaho City, leaving the sagebrush to enter the Ponderosa pine forest of the Boise National Forest. After Idaho City, the highway continues to climb with Mores Creek for another to the Mores Creek Summit at , and with Beaver Creek to the Beaver Creek Summit at further. Following this summit, SH-21 descends in switchbacks to the village of Lowman at above sea level. At Lowman is the intersection with the Wildlife Canyon Scenic Byway, which descends with the South Fork of the Payette River through a canyon popular for whitewater rafting, westward to Banks at Highway 55. A devastating wildfire ravaged the area around Lowman in 1989; it destroyed and 26 structures, but without injuries or fatalities. North of Lowman, SH-21 ascends the South Fork of the Payette River to Grandjean, on the west side of the Sawtooths, and climbs the Canyon Creek tributary to the Banner Creek Summit at , the route's maximum elevation, over above Lowman. At the Banner Creek Summit, SH-21 enters Custer County and the Challis National Forest, and descends northward with Banner Creek and Cape Horn Creek, tributaries of the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. At \\"Cape Horn\\" the highway turns southeast to gradually climb with Marsh Creek to the border of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, where SH-21 enters the drainage of the main Salmon River, and gently descends to Stanley. About west of Stanley is the turnoff for the spur road to the photogenic Stanley Lake at , framed by the jagged McGown Peak at . In Stanley, SH-21 terminates at at the junction with SH-75, the Sawtooth Scenic Byway from Galena Summit and Ketchum to the south, originating in Shoshone. North of the intersection in Stanley, Highway 75 becomes the Salmon River Scenic Byway, and continues due north for a mile, then veers east with the twisty main Salmon River as it descends to Clayton, then north towards Challis, where the route terminates and rejoins US-93 just south of the city limits. The upper elevations of SH-21 are often closed during the winter months, History Portions of the highway originated in the 1860s, as a toll road connecting Boise with the gold mining areas near Idaho City.

Parrish has received a number of awards from public and private organizations. In 2011, it had 65.9% of its admissions through the emergency room, somewhat above the state average of 61.6%.

Film Criticism; Meadville Vol. 26, Iss. 3, (Spring 2002): 52-0_3. The tag line for the movie is: \\"From beachhead to battlefront!

To keep up the momentum, Allied HQ establishes an elite military truck route. One (racially integrated) platoon of this Red Ball Express encounters private enmities, German resistance, minefields, and increasingly perilous missions. Lt Chick Campbell, head of the platoon, clashes with Sgt Red Kallek over an incident when they were civilian truck drivers where Kallek's brother died.

His interest in the culture later led him to Brazil, home to the western hemisphere's largest population of African descent. P√°ez Vilar√≥ was invited to exhibit some of this work by the Director of the Modern Art Museum of Paris, Jean Cassou, in 1956. He traveled to Dakar, Senegal, later that year ‚Äì his first visit to Africa.La Naci√≥n He was one of the \\"Grupo de los 8\\", a movement of Uruguayan artists formed in 1958 together with Oscar Garc√≠a Reino, Miguel √Ångel Pareja, Ra√∫l Pavlovsky, Lincoln Presno, Am√©rico Sposito, Alfredo Testoni and Julio Verdie in order to promote new tendencies in painting. In 1960 they were invited by art critic Rafael Squirru to join the international exhibition at the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art (of which he was creator and first director) with artists such as Willem De Kooning, Roger Hilton and Lucio Fontana. The experimental tendencies of the Grupo de los 8 have since gained a place of unquestionable relevance not only in the panorama of Uruguayan art but also at an international level, some of their works forming part of museums and collections worldwide. Increasingly well-known, P√°ez Vilar√≥ was commissioned in 1959 to create a mural for a tunnel connecting a new annex to the Organization of American States' Washington, DC headquarters, the Pan American Union building. Originally intended to be no more than in length, the completed mural (Roots of Peace) measured long and nearly high when unveiled in 1960. Extensive damage from humidity prompted the artist to repaint the mural in 1975.Access My Library: The Bright side of the tunnel Casapueblo, his \\"livable sculpture\\" and best- known creation near Punta del Este, has been a leading tourist destination in Uruguay since the late 1960s. He purchased a sea-front property on eastern Uruguay's scenic, then-desolate Punta Ballena in 1958, building a small, wooden lodge that over time became \\"Casapueblo\\" (\\"House-Village\\"). The sprawling compound, a whitewashed cement citadel reminiscent of Mykonos, was built in stages by the artist to resemble the mud nests created by the region's native hornero birds, and became his home, atelier and museum.ONSC: Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥ Though he resided in Casapueblo - his \\"livable sculpture\\" - by 1968, P√°ez Vilar√≥ continued to add on to the structure, at times creating a room for a particular guest.

P√°ez Vilar√≥ joined the search and rescue mission for the 45 passengers, of which 16 survived, including his son, with whom he was reunited shortly after their 23 December rescue.Viven P√°ez Vilar√≥ experienced difficulties in other areas of his life. He met Annette Deussen, an Argentine tourist, in 1976, and she had his child in 1984. Deussen was married to another man at the time, and the marriage dissolved in 1986; she and P√°ez Vilar√≥ married in 1989.

He was recognized as a world authority on solar physics and the effect of solar flares on the Earth. Life He was born at Fethard-on-Sea in County Wexford, Ireland, the third son of Reverend William Frederick Archdall Ellison, and was home tutored until the age of nine when his father became the director of Armagh Observatory. Mervyn was entered into the Royal School, Armagh, and during his spare time he developed an interest in astronomy. In 1927 he began his undergraduate work at Trinity College Dublin, where he studied physics and was elected a Scholar. He also served as President of the University Philosophical Society in 1931-32. In 1931-32 he worked on radium emanations for the Dublin hospitals under a Fitzgerald Research Scholarship. He was awarded a M.Sc. in 1932 and a Sc.D. in 1944. Ellison became senior science master at Sherborne School in Dorset, 1933, then married Patricia Herron in 1934. The couple had two daughters and a son. He also completed his own spectrohelioscope during this period, to study the Sun following the sunspot minimum. With the start of the world war, he organized an Air Cadet Training Corps, then joined the Operational Research Group at the Admiralty. In 1946 he became a member of the International Astronomical Union. The following year, he joined the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, where he continued studies of solar activity, including flares and prominences. In 1948 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He remained at the observatory for eleven years and published multiple scientific papers on his work. He also was invited to lectured on astronomy, and gave radio and television interviews about solar activity. Mary Br√ºck completed her PhD with him in 1950. For five years he was joint editor of The Observatory. He also played a leading role in the scientific work during the International Geophysical Year, serving as solar reporter and working to erect a heliograph at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope. Ellison published the book The Sun and its Influence in 1955. In 1958 he was appointed director of the Dunsink Observatory, and worked on several astronomical publications. He fell ill in 1963 and died. At the time of his death he was senior professor of Astronomy at the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies. Ellison crater on the Moon is named after him.

Background Teeling was a native of Dublin. Both the 1901 and 1911 censuses lists him as living at 7 Jane Place Upper. He was one of ten children born to Christopher Teeling and Sarah Mc Grane of whom only four survived childhood.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000048941/ The 1901 census also lists three children born to Sarah Teeling from a previous marriage.http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai003682748/ Bloody Sunday On 21 November 1920 Teeling was one of a group of IRA men who entered 22 Lower Mount Street to assassinate Lieutenant Angliss, alias McMahon, and Lieutenant Peel. Angliss was shot dead in his bed while Peel, hearing the shots, blocked his bedroom door and survived. When members of Fianna √âireann on lookout reported that Auxiliaries were approaching the house, the unit of Volunteers split up into two groups. One left by the front door, the other left by the laneway at the back of the house. Teeling was wounded in a gun battle with the Auxiliaries in the laneway and arrested. Teeling was the only Bloody Sunday participant to be captured at the scene. He was court martialled in January 1921, was sentenced to hang, and was held at Kilmainham Gaol. On the night of the 15 February he escaped from Kilmainham along with Ernie O'Malley and Simon Donnelly. Civil War Although Teeling was made a Lieutenant in the army of the newly-founded Irish Free State, his behaviour and escalating alcoholism became a cause for concern. He had become an embarrassment to the army, but his record of service during the War of Independence made it awkward to publicly discredit him or discharge him. The commander-in-chief of the National Army complained that Teeling had been \\"publicly misconducting\\" himself and \\"bringing serious discredit on us\\". In October 1922 he accidentally shot a sergeant major dead in Gormanstown camp, Co. Meath. The subsequent investigation cleared him of any malice in the incident. Plans were made to give him a sum of money in order to encourage him to emigrate to Australia. On 19 March 1923 the Department of Finance made out a cheque to Teeling for the sum of ¬£250. The money was apparently to be drawn down from funds authorised by the Free State cabinet for use by the Secret Service. p 349 However, on 27 March, Teeling shot and killed William Johnson, a member of the Citizens' Defence Force. It seems a drunk Teeling objected to the fact that Johnson had brought a bag of tomatoes into the bar at the Theatre Royal and shot him dead in the ensuing altercation. At his trial Teeling claimed he had acted in self-defence, citing the fact that Johnson had also drawn his gun. The jury found him guilty of manslaughter and recommended clemency \\"on account of the state of his mind\\". Teeling was imprisoned for eighteen months. Later life Teeling remained in Ireland, continuing to live at Jane Place Upper. He was imprisoned on at least one further occasion in 1931. He died in January 1976.

Background Proceeding under orders from Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, the monitors , , the armed tug , and the collier proceeded from Port Nipe to Cape San Juan, on the northeastern tip of Puerto Rico, arriving late afternoon on August, 1. The ships anchored behind a series of keys: Icacos, Isla de Lobos and Isla Palominos, out of sight from the mainland. Cape San Juan (Fajardo) was the designated landing site for the US Army forces under Major General Nelson A. Miles. However, sometime between July 21‚Äì24, 1898, Miles had unilaterally changed the invasion site from Fajardo to Guanica on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico. Expecting a rendez-vous with Miles' troops, but finding no transports save for Arcadia and Mississippi that \\"had been ordered to make a landing, but were at a loss what to do\\", the senior officer present, Captain Frederick W. Rodgers, USN, of Puritan ordered Leyden, Ensign Walter S. Crosley, USN, commanding, to stand out for the telegraph office at St. Thomas to communicate with the Navy Department in Washington, D.C.\\"Some Experiences on a U.S. Naval Tugboat\\", by Ens. Walter S. Crosley, USN; Proceedings of the US Naval Institute, vol. XXV, 1899, p. 77‚Äì79 Rodgers ordered two boat parties of bluejackets ashore from Puritan led by Lt. Herman G. Dresel, USN, for reconnaissance. The sailors traveled to within half a mile of the nearby town of Fajardo. Upon spotting Spanish troops, the boat party turned back, seizing a schooner as a Prize of war before returning to Puritan. The next morning, Captain Rodgers ordered another boat party ashore led by Lt. Commander James R. Selfridge, USN. The sailors seized the \\"Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan\\" (Cape San Juan lighthouse), posted the American flag and ordered the lighthouse keepers to continue working. The Spaniards in Fajardo, about 5 miles away, did not become aware of the Americans until the early hours of August 3, when an employee of the telegraph office in Fajardo phoned the lighthouse and overheard voices speaking English. This information was immediately telegraphed to Governor General Manuel Mac√≠as y Casado at La Fortaleza in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Macias ordered the remaining Spanish troops in Fajardo to withdraw and remove the telegraph equipment. When Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada, an influential Fajardo civic leader, realized that the Spaniards had withdrawn and the city was defenseless against the invading Americans, he entreated the Spanish authorities in San Juan over the next two days to dispatch troops to defend Fajardo. Believing that the Spanish forces would not come to his aid, on August 5, Veve went to the lighthouse to seek American protection of his town from the Spanish. Obtaining an invitation from Captains Rodgers and Charles J. Barclay of Amphitrite, Dr. Veve and other Fajardan civic leaders rowed out to the American monitor on the morning of August 5, and persuaded the naval captains to protect the women and children of the prominent town families from a feared Spanish reprisal. Leyden had since returned from St. Thomas and Puritan, Hannibal and the two army transports proceeded on to Ponce. On the afternoon of August 5, Captain Barclay, Ensign Albert Campbell, a few prominent Fajardan leaders, including Veve and a landing party of 14 bluejackets boarded the shallow-draft Leyden and navigated through the shoals to shore. The American bluejackets and the contingent of Fajardans posted the American flag at the Customs House in the harbor and marched to the town where they hoisted the United States flag over the City Hall. Before the sailors returned to their ship, Barclay organized a citizens militia to patrol the town and appointed Dr. Veve as military governor of the eastern region of Puerto Rico. Captain √Ångel Rivero M√©ndez was ordered to investigate the situation in Fajardo. He was told that the Americans no longer occupied the city and that it would be an easy task to capture the people of Fajardo that had betrayed Spain. Rivero M√©ndez passed the information to General Ricardo de Ortega y Diez who suggested to Governor Macias that they take the town with 200 soldiers and an artillery battery. Macias was told to capture Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada and all those involved in the revolt, including the Americans in the lighthouse even if it meant the destruction of the structure. On August 5, Governor General Macias dispatched Colonel Pedro del Pino and 200 men, including provisional troops and civil guardsmen from San Juan to recapture Fajardo. When the citizenry learned that the Spanish troops were coming, panic and fear ensued among those who had sided with the Americans. The citizen militia was disbanded and the citizens who had joined in the sedition fled to neighboring towns and into the hills. Dr. Veve and several other town leaders went to Amphitrite. Moving by rail from Hato Rey to Carolina and then marching the rest of the way, the Spanish troops entered Fajardo the afternoon of August 7. Battle Early on the evening of August 6, with anchored about 1,800 yards offshore, Captain Barclay ordered a landing party of 14 petty officers and men from Amphitrite, armed with rifles, pistols and a 6mm Colt machine gun under Ensign Kenneth M. Bennett, with Assistant Engineer David J. Jenkins, Naval Cadets William H. Boardman, Paul Foley and Pay Clerk O.F. Cato to reoccupy the Cape San Juan lighthouse. Almost immediately, a second boat of 14 armed petty officers and men under naval Lt. Charles N. Atwater with Assistant Surgeon A.H. Heppner was dispatched, with Atwater to take command of the landing parties. Atwater ordered Bennett's men to proceed ahead to reoccupy the lighthouse and light the lamp, while his boat squad first secured both boats before following them up to the lighthouse. Though no attack materialised the first night, Cadet Boardman was mortally wounded when his revolver dislodged from its faulty holster, fell to the marble floor and fired into his left inner thigh as he was entering the darkened lighthouse with three sailors. Assistant Surgeon Heppner initially believed it was a flesh-wound, although Boardman suffered a large loss of blood. He died two days later on the Amphitrite where he was evacuated that night after the ship's surgeon came ashore to accompany him and Dr. Heppner back to the ship. Boardman was one of only 23 combat-related U.S. Navy deaths during the entire Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, two Navy deaths during Puerto Rican operations and the only Annapolis cadet to die out of 123 who served on ships in combat operations. Meanwhile, in Fajardo, when Spanish Col. Pino first led his troops into the city they found it mostly deserted; about 60 of the women and children of the cities prominent families, including Dr. Veve's wife and children and a few Europeans that were deemed most at risk, had been authorized by Captain Barclay to be quartered in the lighthouse with the American petty officers and men, while some 700 Fajardans that could not be accommodated were camped out in the adjacent hills. On the 7th, Jenkins and Foley returned to Amphitrite and on the 8th, Jenkins returned to the lighthouse with Gunner Herbert Campbell and a relief party for half the men, who returned to the ship, including Ensign Bennett and Pay Clerk Cato. The cruiser , and collier Hannibal joined Amphitrite and Leyden off Cape San Juan on August 8. That day, the Amphitrite landing party engaged in arms practice and fortified the lighthouse for the expected assault by Spanish troops. Windows were blocked, sentries placed, and the Colt machine gun was mounted on the roof to \\"sweep the lane\\". On the 7th and 8 August, native horse-men repeatedly galloped up to the Navy men \\"with the wildest of rumors\\" estimating the Spanish were planning attacks with 500 men, a figure hyperbolically increased to 800. Just before 11:00 on the night of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, on the edge of the woods 250 yards from the lighthouse. At 11:45, with moonlight breaking through the clouds, he saw several men in the brush on the edge of the woods. Without giving an alarm, he instructed the lookouts to be on heightened vigilance. As he was heading to the yard gate to order the corporal of the guard and sentry to come inside the light-house, those men came running up and announced they had seen Spanish troops in the road. Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops. At about 12:30am, an errant 6 pound naval shell crashed through the 2 foot thick walls of the parapet, \\"within touch of six men not one was hurt\\" when the shell failed to explode. Lt. Atwater immediately ordered the lighthouse lamp relit. At about the same time, gunfire from the Spanish troops ceased and Atwater gave the order to cease firing shortly thereafter. 1,100 shots were fired from the 22 rifles of the navy men in the lighthouse. Lt. Atwater estimated the Spanish force was probably 72 infantry, 24 cavalry, with 2 killed and three wounded, one of them a Spanish lieutenant. The Americans retained control of the lighthouse and suffered no casualties. Aftermath Early the next morning, Captain Barclay decided to withdraw the landing party and civilian refugees as the advantage of continuing to hold the lighthouse seemed slight. The U.S. Marine guard from Cincinnati under the command of 1st Lt. John A. Lejeune and a like number of men from Amphitrite (30) landed and covered the withdrawal. The women and children refugees were soon on board the USS Leyden which transported them to Ponce, Puerto Rico. After the Americans had departed, Col. Pino's men tore down the two U.S. flags that flew over the Customs House and City Hall and returned to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned, leaving only the civil guard behind to police Fajardo. The flags, as trophies of war, were sent to Madrid, Spain where today they can be seen at the army museum there. While the Battle of Fajardo was the only instance in the Puerto Rican Campaign where American forces withdrew from a position, it was not a defeat. President McKinley mentioned the engagement in his State of the Union address, remarking, \\"With the exception of encounters with the enemy at Guayama, Hormigueros, Coamo, and Yauco and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan, there was no serious resistance. The campaign was prosecuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of August much of the island was in our possession and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time.\\" See also * Puerto Rican Campaign * Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War * Satellite View of Fajardo lighthouse and offshore keys (Reserva Natural de las Cabezas de San Juan) * Photo of Fajardo Customs House * Photo of Fajardo City Hall ReferencesExternal links * Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial site * Category:Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Category:Battles of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Category:Military in Puerto Rico Category:Military history of Puerto Rico Category:United States Marine Corps in the 18th and 19th centuries Category:August 1898 events ","title":"Battle of Fajardo"},{"id":"22892627","text":"Walter Cesar Nogueira da Silva (12 January 1942 ‚Äì 21 May 2009) was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a striker.

A few areas have gas stations that use electronic tolling transponders as a method of payment, such as Via Verde in Portugal. The system was built at Mobil Oil Co by a team led by Late Mr William Fessler, his wife Nancy Fessler and the concept was provided to them by Paul Luthra in 1978. The system was introduced in 1982 in Europe, and was first used in the United States by Mobil in 1986. Only 13 percent of convenience stores had the technology by 1994, but 80 percent of U.S. convenience stores used the technology by 2002, and virtually all U.S. stores do today. In 2004, Sheetz was the first to use touch-screen kiosks by the pump where customers can also order in-store foodservice items that they pick up after fueling.The History of Gasoline Retailing In 2012 Zarco USA was the first to have ordering touch screens on the pump. Pay at the pump is seen as a way to keep the cost of gasoline down by reducing the need for employees at filling stations. It is considered to be a major change from the days in which full service was the norm at filling stations, and the attendant not only pumped fuel, but also washed the windshield, and checked the fluids and tire pressure, all while the customer remained in the vehicle Full service is legally mandated in the U.S. states of New Jersey and parts of Oregon. Oregon allows for commercial self serve of gasoline for business use through a cardlock network such as Pacific Pride or CFN cardlock networks. Some filling stations are totally unattended and only allow customers to purchase fuel by paying at the pump. Fraud Those who use the pay at the pump feature could be putting themselves at risk for fraud, as thieves attach skimmers to the pumps that can steal the information off the cards used to make purchases. Many debit cards can be used to make the purchase either as debit or credit. But those who make the purchases as debit are potentially feeding their information into the skimmers. Without the human interaction, there is no verification system when credit cards are used to make purchases, and no signature is required. This enables those in possession of stolen or cloned credit cards, or those who are otherwise making unauthorized use of another's card to purchase gasoline without a signature. Many stations now require customers making credit-based transactions to enter their zip code (United States) or equivalent (other countries) in order to be allowed to make a fuel purchase. The receipts issued by the pumps, if not taken by the customer, often bear the number of the credit card used to make the purchase. If found later by a thief, this could be used to commit fraud against the customer. Laws in some places prohibit the full credit card number from being displayed on the receipt. These risks are balanced against the risk of fraud by employees copying credit card numbers or retaining receipts. Cost to consumers The vast majority of gas pumps with pay-at-the-pump capabilities will place a temporary hold on a certain amount of money, generally $75-$150, in a customer's account following the use of a debit or credit card to make a purchase. The pump must do this pre- authorization before allowing a customer to pump fuel to guarantee funds are available to pay for said fuel. The length of time the funds are placed on hold, and are unavailable to the customer, is totally dependent on how fast the customer's bank processes the transaction. Depending on the bank, it can take a few minutes to a few business days before the funds on hold are released. While this amount is placed on hold, the customer could be penalized for non-sufficient funds when making other purchases on the same account. To avoid pre-authorizations and holds placed on their accounts, customers can pay for fuel inside the gas station and not use pay-at-the-pump services. Cost to businesses and employees The pay at the pump feature has led fewer customers to enter the area of filling stations that sell other items typically sold at convenience stores, thereby hurting the profits stations make from such sales. This is seen as an advantage to the customer not just for saving money, but also by reducing clutter and mess in the vehicle. The feature is also criticized for causing the loss of some jobs. While stations continue to have an attendant on duty, the customers are performing many of the former tasks of the attendant, thereby leading to less availability of employment.

It was first identified in 2003 in Cornwall, UK when scientists were surveying for the presence of Phytophthora ramorum. This made it the third new Phytophthora species to be found in the UK in a decade. It was named Phytophthora kernoviae, after the ancient name for Cornwall, Kernow. It causes large stem lesions on beech and necrosis of stems and leaves of Rhododendron ponticum. It is self-fertile. It has also been isolated from Quercus robur and Liriodendron tulipifera. The original paper describing the species, stated it can infect Magnolia and Camellia species, Pieris formosa, Gevuina avellana, Michelia doltsopa and Quercus ilex. Since then many other plants have been identified as natural hosts of the pathogen. Molecular analysis has revealed that an infection on Pinus radiata, recorded in New Zealand in 1950, was caused by P. kernoviae. Symptoms Since Phytophthora kernoviae has such serious symptoms it should be seen as a serious threat to both trees and shrubs. On the shrubs of Rhododendron, the disease starts with the blackening of the leaf petiole sometimes extending to the base of the leaf, affecting old and young leaves equally. In addition to this darkening lesion on the stem, leaves can get severe enough lesions to become necrotic and cause entire leaf death. These lesions begin as a progressive blackening of the leaf tissue and spread across the leaf surface. In some cases this necrosis causes dieback and cankers on the infected plant. While symptoms for trees hosts are similar they have a few distinct differences. For the European beech (Fagus sylvatica) host symptoms include dark brown to blue black lesions on the trunk ranging in size and shape depending on severity of the infection. Tulip trees Liriodendron tulipifera are another susceptible host. The pathogen infects and causes many smaller bleeding lesions along the trunk and can even cause lesions on leaf tips. Both shrubs and trees share the characteristic symptoms of leaf necrosis with lesions on the stem and trunk proving the severity of this disease. Diagnosis of the disease can be difficult as symptoms for Phytophthora ramorum and Phytophthora kernoviae can be very similar. One should test samples with DNA extraction of the plant tissue tested against conventional PCR and real- time PCR. If either of these tests come back negative you have a negative sample for P. kernoviae. While positive samples indicate the presence of this pathogen. In addition to this you can use isolation followed by morphological identification. Environment Phytophthora kernoviae spreads most quickly and detrimentally in moist conditions such as direct rainfall and also those of heavy humidity. Rain and heavy winds help in the dispersal of spores for further infection. This disease has an optimal growing range of . This range suggests that it may have originated in a temperate climate, possibly China, before being introduce to the UK. In some genus of the disease such as P. ramorum water transportation through the use of streams and rivers is seen from outbreak sites. This is a unique characteristic of the P. ramorum and has not been seen in the kernoviae species While there are no known insect vectors for the disease humans can transport spores via agricultural equipment, on shoe bottoms and direct plant movement. These are the most significant vectors for the disease. Management Since this disease has more recently been identified management practices are still developing. For best management it is most important to remove the sporulating plants in the area of infection. Along with this the clear cutting of trees or complete removal of shrub growth and thorough sanitation including removal of plant debris and leaves in infected area have been attempted to control the spread of the disease. Removal of standing water, properly timed watering and proper irrigation help to prevent the spread of spores through water.In areas of large infection bans can be placed on the removal of host plants and foliage from them. In addition to this bans on hiking trails can be enforced to manage spore transport through human activity. Anti-Phytophthora fungicides may be used in some cases, while these fungicides do not actually kill the organism but prevent it from becoming established or continued growth. Another method currently being used is controlling by culling Rhododendrons within diseased regions. In 2008, an infected Rhododendron ponticum was found in Ireland. More studies will need to be conducted in the spread and reproduction of this disease before more advanced chemical management methods become available. Life cycle Phytophthora kernoviae can survive as an oospore, a thick walled resting structure and has been found to survive on infected plant tissues and in soil. Chlamydospores, long term resting structures that are seen in Phytophthora ramorum and other Phytophthora species are not observed in Phytophthora kernoviae. Production of sporangia, oospores, and zoospores were observed on Phytophthora kernoviae. Sporangia are only formed on hosts with susceptible foliage, trunk cankers have not exhibited sporulation and do not spread disease. This creates a simple life cycle for Phytophthora kernoviae. Oospores can germinate and create mouse-shaped sporangia. Sporangia serve as dispersal structures and create and release Zoospores, motile infectious spores. Once released, oospores germinate on the host and infect target host tissues. After infection if the conditions are correct, Phytophthora kernoviae produce sporangia that are dislodged by natural occurrences and spread to nearby plant tissue. In lab settings the production of these sporangia are documented within one week, with the sproangia present six days after inoculation causing documented disease in new plant tissues. The sporangia of Phytophthora kernoviae are spread locally through wind and water dispersion, infecting nearby susceptible tissues, long distance travel is occurs through the movement of infected plant tissues and in soil carried on vehicles, animals and footwear. Importance Since 2003, Phytophthora kernoviae has caused marked damage to ornamentals and species of trees in the Southwest United Kingdom. The oomycete pathogen was first discovered in the 1990s, yet only gained widespread attention when it was identified as one of the causal agents, along with P. ramorum, of sudden oak death. Although the main concentration of this pathogen is primarily in South West England, its reach has extended to South Wales, Cheshire, and even further north into Scotland. Recently, this pathogen has been found on the steams and foliage of Rhododendron, most significantly on R. ponticum.Brasier, C. M., et al. \\"Comparative host range and aggressiveness of Phytophthora ramorum and Phytophthora kernoviae sp. nov. on North American and European trees.\\" Proceedings of the Second Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium: The state of our knowledge. 2005. Furthermore, the aggressive nature of Phytophthora kernoviae makes it an even more significant concern considering that the mainland of the UK has diverse ecosystems that are susceptible to the impact of this plant pathogen. From the Rhododendron host, infection is able to spread via the air to the bark of tree species, with the European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) being especially susceptible. As of 2005, it was confined to a relatively small area of Cornwall but has also been found in Wales and Cheshire suggesting that the pathogen may be being spread by the horticultural trade. Due to the national and international demand of these plant products, Phytophthora kernoviae has initiated recent concern after being found Vaccinium myrtillus, commonly called Bilberry. This pathogen causes significant necrosis on leaves, bleeding stem lesions, and stem dieback as the primary symptoms, which occur at an impressive rate. Countless species including V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and Rhododendron ponticum are all especially vulnerable to P. kernoviae. Pathogenesis Phytophthora kernoviae infect through release and wind dispersal of zoospores. It is quick to take advantage of wounds already present on its host, but does not require the host to be injured. One interesting aspect of P. kernoviae is that in one study, only two thirds of typical infections were symptomatic, making it easy for this pathogen and infection to go unnoticed from typical visual inspection. Before infecting the inner bark of European Beech trees, the pathogen causes leaf necrosis and the dieback of shoots in the under-foliage of the forest along with ornamental species. It is here where the sporulation occurs on the infected shoots and foliage, and is able to cause infection of the surrounding trees, giving rise to bleeding cankers on the stems. This pathogen's adaption for aerial dispersal is a key factor in its transmission from initial ornamental host to tree species. Once on European beech trees, infected phloem will generally show bleeding lesions and discoloration. The color varies based on exposure to oxygen and elapsed time from infection. Often, these lesions will have pink or orange fluid-filled cavities called lagoons in the underlying phloem. The pathogen then occupies the xylem underneath the phloem lesions, which enables it to spread further throughout the vascular plant tissue and give rise to new phloem lesions. Furthermore, the pathogen present in the xylem leads to local dysfunction that furthers to damage the plant tissues, and move into previously healthy bark. Once P. kernoviae has penetrated the xylem, it can continue penetrating for well over 24 months. Tree mortality soon follows, in the matter of a few years from the initial time of infection.

It was first described by Jeremy John Wright and Lawrence M. Page in 2006. The species name \\"lucipinnis\\" is derived from a combination of the Latin luci, meaning bright or clear, and the Latin pinnis, meaning fin. This refers to the light coloration in a patch on the base of the fins of this species.  Description  Like all members of the genus Synodontis, S. lucipinnis has a strong, bony head capsule that extends back as far as the first spine of the dorsal fin. The head is about of the standard length of the fish. The head contains a distinct narrow, bony, external protrusion called a humeral process. The shape and size of the humeral process helps to identify the species. In S. lucipinnis, the humeral process is triangular and rough, with a poorly defined ridge on the bottom edge. The top edge is convex and the end is sharply pointed. It is covered with many small, thin, papillae and is about half of the length of the head. The diameter of the eye is about of the length of the head. The fish has three pairs of barbels. The maxillary barbels are on located on the upper jaw, and two pairs of mandibular barbels are on the lower jaw. The maxillary barbel has a narrow membrane attached near the base and is straight without any branches. It extends at least as far as the base of the pectoral spine, about as long as the head. The outer pair of mandibular barbels extends just past the front of the pectoral girdle, about of the length of the head, and contains four to six short, weak branches, usually without secondary branches. The inner pair of mandibular barbels is about to as long as the outer pair, about of the length of the head, with four to six pairs of branches, with many secondary branches present. The skin of S. lucipinnis has a large number of tiny vertical skin folds. The exact purpose of the skin folds is not known, but is a characteristic of the species of Syndontis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika. papilla are present on the head, but not the body. The front edges of the dorsal fins and the pectoral fins of Syntontis species are hardened into stiff spines. In S. lucipinnis, the spine of the dorsal fin is short, about as long as the head, slightly curved, smooth on the front and serrated on the back, and ends with short, white filament. The remaining portion of the dorsal fin is made up of seven branching rays and one unbranched ray. The spine of the pectoral fin is slightly curved, about as long as the dorsal fin spine, smooth on the front and with large serrations on the back. The pectoral spine ends in short, white filament. The rest of the pectoral fins are made up of eight to nine branching rays. The adipose fin does not contain any rays, is long and well developed, and has a convex shape. The pelvic fin contains one unbranched and six branched rays. The front edge of the pelvic fin is vertically aligned halfway between the back end of the dorsal fin and the start of the adipose fin. The anal fin contains four unbranched and eight to nine branched rays; it is vertically aligned with the center of the adipose fin. The tail, or caudal fin, is forked, with rounded lobes, and contains eight rays on the upper lobe, nine rays on the lower lobe. The mouth of the fish faces downward and has wide lips that contain papilla. All members of Syndontis have a structure called a premaxillary toothpad, which is located on the very front of the upper jaw of the mouth. This structure contains several rows of short, chisel-shaped teeth. In some species, this toothpad is made up of a large patch with several rows in a large cluster. In other species of Syndontis, this toothpad is clearly divided into two separate groups, separated by a thin band of skin that divides the toothpad. This character is used as a method of differentiating between two different but similar species of Syndontis. In S. lucipinnis, the toothpad is interrupted, or separated into two distinct groups. On the lower jaw, or mandible, the teeth of Syndontis are attached to flexible, stalk-like structures and described as \\"s-shaped\\" or \\"hooked\\". The number of teeth on the mandible is used to differentiate between species; in S. lucipinnis, there are 35 to 51 teeth on the mandible, arranged in six short rows. Some of the species of Synodontis have an opening or series of openings called the axillary pore. It is located on the sides of the body below the humeral process and before the pectoral fin spine. The exact function of the port is not known to scientists, although its presence has been observed in seven other catfish genera. Fish in the genus Acrochordonichthys are known to secrete a mucus with toxic properties from their axillary pore, but there is no scientific consensus as to the exact purpose of the secretion or the pore. S. lucipinnis does not have an axillary pore. The back of the fish is yellowish to copper brown, and is covered with large, irregularly shaped black spots. The underside is lighter, with more regularly shaped black spots. Most of the species of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases of all of the rayed fins, present in S. lucipinnis, and the back edges of the fins are white in color. In addition, the fins have large, lightly-colored windows at the bases, most noticeable in the dorsal and anal fins. The caudal fin has a black bar that runs from the base of each lobe to the top of the fin. The barbels are white. The maximum standard length of known specimens is with a total length of . Generally, females in the genus Synodontis tend to be slightly larger than males of the same age. Habitat and behavior In the wild, the species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika, which has an observed temperature range of , an approximate pH of 8.5 ‚Äì 9, and dH range of 4-15. The exact habitat is unknown, but like other small species of Syndontis, it probably inhabits fairly shallow, rocky coastal areas. The reproductive habits of most of the species of Synodontis are not known, beyond some instances of obtaining egg counts from gravid females. Spawning likely occurs during the flooding season between July and October, and pairs swim in unison during spawning. As a whole, species of Synodontis are omnivores, consuming insect larvae, algae, gastropods, bivalves, sponges, crustaceans, and the eggs of other fishes. The growth rate is rapid in the first year, then slows down as the fish age.

Game play A game of beach polo consists of two three-player teams as opposed to the usual four-player teams in field polo. A game consists of four seven-minute periods of play, called chukkers. The game is played in an enclosed sand arena with sideboards of approximately four feet in height, designed to keep the ball in play. Depending on playing areas available, some of the playing arenas have enclosed ends while others allow for 20 yards of run out room for the horses, past the end line, and utilize standing goal posts. Two umpires are suggested for tournament play which may be stationed outside the arena to officiate the game. Penalties are called and resulting free hits are awarded to the fouled party. Traditional polo ponies are used with players changing horses following each chukker. Unlike the hard plastic ball used in field polo, beach polo employs a leather or rubber inflated ball no less than 12.5 inches in circumference. Other equipment employed is the same as that used in field or arena polo. History Dubai's Rashid Al Habtoor and Sam Katiela have been credited with the creation of the game in 2004, followed by the Miami Beach Polo World Cup in the United States in 2005. Additional tournaments and matches have arisen in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, Thailand, The Netherlands, Uruguay and Wales. Tournament competition ranges from entry level in Austria (on Lake Worthersee in Carinthia, Austria) to Miami Beach's higher-handicapped team play. International polo players include Argentine 10-goaler Gonzalo Pieres, Mexico's Carlos Gracida (9), USA 9-goaler Mike Azzaro and Australian 8-goaler Ruki Baillieu. In 2008, the International Beach Polo Association was created, by current Chairman Alex Webbe, in an effort to increase the number of participating countries, to assist in promoting these events and to make rules and handicaps for the game more uniform. In 2009 the Miami Beach Polo Club held the first South Beach Women's Polo Cup, a competition that fielded eight teams of women from six countries. Following the 2010 AMG Miami Beach Polo World Cup, Matias Magrini (Argentina) became the first player elevated to a 10-goal handicap in the history of beach polo play. The island of Jersey (off the coast of Normandy, France) staged its first beach polo tournament in September 2012 while New Zealand planned staged a tournament in December 2013, and Croatia created their first beach polo event in 2016.

Their goal was to create something unlike anything else they could find in Boston; a weekly performance space, open to the public, sustainable and safe, devoid of social competition, and pushing the boundaries of consciousness, experience and thought. The Treemausers spread their ideas around JP by word of mouth and through their popular publication, the Treemausers Gazette. As Hootennanies began to grow, the Treemauses moved into a five story mansion that was recently re-built from a state of dilapidation. The carpenters working on the site had nicknamed it ‚Äúla casa blanca‚Äù, so the Whitehaus was born.How the Treemausers became The Whitehaus Family RecordPerformer Mag  JP LABEL KEEPS IT IN THE FAMILY The house itself has had a strong reputation in the music community for a while as it hosted a show by Nirvana in the late 80's before their first LP came out. In February 2008, Many Mansions organized a show in the Whitehaus called Psych-Fest and this marked the beginning of the WFR movement away from Hootenannies and toward Happenings. The success of Psych- Fest gave the WFR the impetus to organize their biggest event at that time, Blastfest.Boston GlobeThe Boston Phoenix Since the Blastfest, the label has had over 40 releases, over 20 artists and has organized shows for Anis Mojgani, Guatemala City, Christians & Lions, The Needy Visions, Baxia, and many other artists.DIY Venue Spotlight: The Whitehaus Family Record ReferencesExternal links * Official site Category:American independent record labels Category:Indie rock record labels Category:Alternative rock record labels Category:Social centres in the United States Category:Culture of Boston Category:Music venues in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Boston ","title":"The Whitehaus Family Record"},{"id":"22892904","text":"George Eric McCarthy Marthins (24 December 1905 - 23 March 1989) was an Indian field hockey player who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics as a member of the Indian field hockey team, which won the gold medal.

As a captive, he was sent to the Marshalsea prison where he was examined on 15 August 1588. Here he admitted he was a Catholic priest and was sent for trial with the others to Canterbury, England.

He was for some time in the service of Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre. On 22 February 1586 he left England to study for the priesthood in Rheims.

New York: Robert Appleton Company (1908); retrieved 12 January 2013. He had a lengthy and difficult journey across Europe, calling in at Rheims on his way to Dieppe. Word had already reached the continent concerning the government's plans to exile or execute the priests then held in prison. A Dr. Darbishire in Paris directed Buxton to delay his departure for the time being, and in obedience complied. But having learned that Darbishire's counsel was not a directive of Father Persons in England, Buxton crossed to Kent in early September 1587. He was arrested in Kent about two minths later, and taken to the Marshalsea prison. On 15 August 1588, he was examined at which time he admitted he was a priest. As he was so young, it was thought that his constancy might be shaken by the sight of the deaths of his companions, and his life was offered him if he would conform to the new religion; but he answered that he would not purchase a corruptible life at such a price, and that if he had a hundred lives he would willingly surrender them all in defence of his faith. While in the Marshalsea Prison he wrote a Rituale, the manuscript of which is now preserved as a relic at Olney, Buckinghamshire. He sent this manuscript to a priest, as a last token of his friendship, the day before he was taken from the prison. He was taken to Canterbury for trial and execution. Buxton died at the age of twenty-six. Christopher Buxton was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929. Robert Widmerpool Robert Widmerpool, a layman, was born in Nottinghamshire. He attended Gloucester Hall, Oxford, but did not graduate. He obtained a post as tutor at the home of the Countess of Northumberland, and was arrested there for giving aid to a Catholic priest. He was imprisoned with the others at the Marshalsea. When he had the rope round his neck, he thanked God for the glory of dying in Canterbury for the cause for which St. Thomas died.

It was first introduced in IREX ‚Äì world's largest robot trade fair ‚Äì held in Tokyo, Japan in November 28, 2007.Play ping-pong or feed the baby at Tokyo robot fair, updated 11/29/2007 While TOPIO 1.0 runs on water power, measures 1,8m, weighs 500 kg, has 6 legs and cannot move, TOPIO 2.0 is 2,1m but only weighs 60 kg, has 2 legs and can move. As it is considered a much more advanced version compared to the former one, TOPIO 2.0 has 28 DoFs and runs on electricity. Its ability to move, dance and play ping pong is based on modules such as high-speed image sensor, artificial neural network, movement controller, etc. The newest TOPIO 3.0 is as tall as 1,88m and weighs 120 kg with 32 DoFs. The biggest challenge in designing TOPIO 3.0 is to fulfill 2 requirements: to be able to move & to play ping pong. In robotics engineering, it is not an easy task to combine these two factors. Nevertheless, TOPIO has undergone a thorough research and development procedure so that it could move fluently in 2 foot.Topio The Ping Pong Playing Robot, updated 1/22/2009 Ho Vinh Hoang, the CEO and Chief Designer of the TOPIO project, stated that \\"the robot is getting special attention from experts and exhibition visitors, particularly major international technology companies and the mass media\\".I, the Ping-Pong Robot!, updated 12/5/2007 Image:TOPIO 1.0.jpgTOPIO 1.0 Image:TOPIO 2.0.jpgTOPIO 2.0 *SketRobo SketRobo is a humanoid robot that can draw over 200 pre-loaded images, using a hand-held pen and a sheet of paper clipped to a table in front of it.

These tomatoes are usually pre-treated with sulfur dioxide or salt before being placed in the sun in order to improve colour and appearance. Typically, tomatoes spend 4‚Äì10 days in the sun in order for the sun-drying process to be complete. Cherry tomatoes will lose 88% of their initial (fresh) weight, while larger tomatoes can lose up to 93% during the process. As a result, it takes anywhere from 8 to 14 kilograms of fresh tomatoes to make a single kilogram of sun-dried tomatoes. After the procedure, the tomato fruits will keep their nutritional value. The tomatoes are high in lycopene, antioxidants, and vitamin C. The final products may contain up to 2‚Äì6% of salt and could provide a significant contribution to the day's intake. Sun-dried tomatoes can be used in a wide variety of recipes and come in a variety of shapes, colors, and tomatoes. Traditionally, they were made from dried red plum tomatoes, but they can be purchased in yellow varieties. Sun-dried tomatoes are also available in the form of pastes or pur√©es. Sun-dried tomatoes may also be preserved in olive oil, along with other ingredients such as rosemary, basil, dried paprika, and garlic. History Tomatoes were originally salted and dried to preserve the fruit.Sun-Dried Tomato History Salting and evaporating the moisture out of tomatoes (as with most foods) significantly delays the process of decomposition. By drying ripe tomatoes, these foods could be enjoyed and provide valuable nutrition in the winter when it is difficult or impossible to grow fresh produce. The true origin of sun-dried tomatoes is unclear. Italians originally dried their tomatoes on their ceramic roof-tops in the summer sun. Sun-dried tomatoes surged in popularity in the United States in the late 1980s to early 1990s, where they were often found in antipasto, tapas, pasta dishes and salads, becoming a trend before losing popularity from overuse by the end of the 1990s.

History  Thermique Technologies is a wholly owned subsidiary of Engineered Glass Products (EGP), which was founded in 1947 in Chicago. EGP is best known for manufacturing heat-reflective glass panels for use in high- temperature home appliances such as self-cleaning ovens. In 2002, EGP introduced a glass panel that not only reflected heat but also generated it. These glass panels could be used as a heating element in home appliances and other commercial applications. EGP marketed these glass panels under the brand name \\"Thermique heated glass\\". The first commercial use of Thermique heated glass was in a display case for warm foods. In 2005, EGP introduced a towel warmer with a glass heating element called the Thermique Towel Warmer. That same year, EGP became the first company to earn UL approval to manufacture a heated glass pane for architectural window units.http://www.aecdaily.com/en/1424943/default/content/show_detail In 2006, EGP created Thermique Technologies as a separate entity in charge of its heated glass products and product development.http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi- bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY;=/www/story/06-13-2006/0004379913&EDATE;= EGP also continues to manufacture heat-reflective glass under another subsidiary, Marsco Glass Products.http://www.mgpglass.com/  Corporate management  In 1995, general manager Mike Hobbs engineered a management buyout of EGP, then known as Marsco Manufacturing. As the new owner and CEO, Hobbs invested in developing new technologies to diversify the company‚Äôs product offerings. He oversaw the development of Thermique heated glass and the creation of Thermique Technologies as a separate entity. Today, Hobbs serves as CEO of both EGP and Thermique Technologies.  Heated glass technology  Electrically heated glass was first developed in World War II to prevent aircraft windshields from frosting over and obscuring visibility. Since then, this technology has been become almost universally used in aviation as well as supermarket freezers, where glass doors must remain clear for customers to see the merchandise.http://www.appliancedesign.com/CDA/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000371271 In order to electrically heat glass, a microscopic tin(II) oxide coating is applied to a pane of ordinary float glass. This coating is perfectly transparent and conducts electricity. An electrical current is supplied by two busbars located on opposite sides of the glass. The electrical resistance of the Tin Oxide coating produces heat energy. This heat radiates from the glass in the form of infrared energy. The busbars are typically connected to a power control unit that regulates the flow of electricity and thus the temperature of the glass.http://www.appliancemagazine.com/ae/editorial.php?article=134&zone;=215&first;=1http://www.whatisheatedglass.com Thermique Technologies developed and patented a specialized control unit that provides adjustable temperature control up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Most commercial applications require much lower temperatures.

One of the five children of Ann and Bennie Woolley Sr., he grew up in Dalhart, Texas, where his parents lived until 2019, when his father died and his mother moved to Amarillo, Texas. After graduating high school he studied for two years at Frank Phillips College in Borger, Texas. At age twenty he moved back to New Mexico to pursue a career in the horse racing industry. An accomplished rider who often exercises his own horses, Chip Woolley has operated a public stable since 1991. Based at Sunland Park Racetrack in Sunland Park, New Mexico, he trains both Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds for flat racing. In late 2008, the New Mexico racing partnership of Mark Allen (Double Eagle Ranch) and Dr. Leonard Blach (Buena Suerte Equine) turned over a gelding named Mine That Bird to the care of Chip Woolley. The horse had won four straight races in Canada but ran last in the October 25th Breeders' Cup Juvenile in his debut for his new American owners. Making his debut for Woolley on February 28, 2009, Mine That Bird finished second in the Borderland Derby and on March 29 had a fourth-place finish in the Sunland Derby. However, based on his career earnings in graded stakes races, he qualified as one of the twenty Kentucky Derby starters. Trainer Chip Woolley loaded Mine That Bird into a horse trailer attached to 2008 Ford F-450 pickup truck, and drove 1,700 miles over 21 hours from New Mexico to get to the big race. Under jockey Calvin Borel, Mine That Bird won the Kentucky Derby, instantly making Chip Woolley one of the most talked about racing personalities in America. The horse was then loaded into his trailer and driven by Woolley to Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Under jockey Mike Smith, Mine That Bird came from last through difficult traffic to earn a second-place finish in the Preakness Stakes. Following the race, Chip Woolley announced that the horse's owners would be sending him to Belmont Park in Elmont, New York for the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes, where he placed third. In 2011, a book was published on him in French and English.

They existed during the Paleozoic Era, in the Middle Ordovician and Silurian Periods, until their extinction in the Devonian Period. Description Cystoids are distinguished from other echinoderms by triangular pore openings. Superficially, cystoids resembled crinoids, but they had an ovoid, rather than cup-shaped, body. The mouth was at the upper pole of the body, with the opposite end attached to the substratum, often by a stalk, although some stalkless species did exist. The anus lay on the side of the body. Five, or less commonly three, ambulacral areas ran along the outside of the body, radiating outwards from the mouth. A number of small tentacles either surrounded the mouth, or projected outwards in a row from the ambulacral areas, depending on species. The most distinctive feature of cystoids was the presence of a number of pores in the rigid skeleton encasing the body. These were most likely respiratory in nature, allowing fluid to flow in or out of the body. In some species, the pores were clustered in distinct regions, but in others they were distributed quite widely over the body surface. See also List of echinodermata orders.

During World War II the squadron was a replacement training unit until disbanded in 1944 when the Army Air Forces converted training units to Army Air Force Base Units. It was reconstituted in 1955 and served as a fighter interceptor squadron until 1969. HistoryWorld War II= Activated in 1943 as a IV Fighter Command P-38 Lightning Replacement Training Unit (RTU). The squadron trained P-38 pilots until March 1944 when it was disbanded as part of the switchover of numbered training units in the Zone of the Interior (ZI) (Continental United States) were replaced by \\"Army Air Force Base Units\\".

It performed the air defense mission over the Mid-Atlantic states with F-102 Delta Daggers. In April 1961, ADC initiated Operation Southern Tip, deploying six Convair F-102 Delta Dagger aircraft from its test and training unit at Tyndall AFB Florida to Homestead AFB, Florida in a two-week test of a contingency plan to augment air defense forces in Southern Florida in face of the potential threat from an unfriendly Cuba. Two of the F-102s were maintained on armed five-minute alert status. However, on 17 April the Bay of Pigs Invasion occurred, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that Southern Tip continue indefinitely. However, the impact of the extended deployment on the training and testing mission led to the 482d FIS assuming the mission in July with four of its aircraft.

In 1971, Highlands Park F.C. merged with Powerlines F.C. from Nigel ‚Äì a city located 61 km southeast of Highlands North in Johannesburg, and also playing in the top flight National Football League. But after playing only two seasons with the name Highlands Power F.C. in 1971‚Äì72, the club decided to change back its name to the more well-known Highlands Park F.C. in 1973. Ahead of the 1979 season, the club signed a five-year sponsor deal with Dion, which soon revamped the club. Beside of changing the players outfit to orange, the club also made an effort to maximise publicity of their new sponsor, by renaming the club to Dion Highlands F.C. in 1979. As the media however continued referring to the club simply as \\"Highlands\\", the club made the radical decision in February 1980, to skip the long lasting historical part of their name, with the official name being changed to Dion F.C.. Apparently this change however only lasted for a very short while in 1980, as the newspapers continued referring to the club as \\"Dion Highlands F.C.\\", in the subsequent years from 1981 to February 1983. The club played its last official professional match at 12 February 1983, where the club lost the final of the special NPSL cup competition known as BP Top Eight Cup, with the score 0‚Äì2 to Orlando Pirates. Ahead of the 1983-season, the club's league franchise for NPSL, was purchased by South African international football player Jomo Sono. The professional remainder of the club was continued under the new club name Dion Cosmos, which ahead of the 1984-season was renamed to Jomo Cosmos. The amateur and youth department of the club, however continued to exist as an independent club, with the name \\"Balfour Park juniors\\" and the amateur seniors playing with the name \\"Highlands Park\\"; and they managed to re-establish the grand old amateur club as a new top-level professional phoenix club, when they got promoted to play in National Soccer League for the 1991-season. After the 1991-season, the club had played well enough to avoid relegation, and was then bought by the relegated NSL club Port Elizabeth Blackpool, as part of a merger deal, where the new team continued to play in Johannesburg and continued to compete with the name \\"Highlands Park FC\\". When this merged club, once again had managed to avoid relegation after the 1992-season, this at the same time meant, that they ceased to exist. The professional side of the club and its NSL licence, were bought by the new club Welkom Eagles, with a relocation of the team for the 1993-season, now to play 267 km away from Highlands North, in the city known as Welkom. A second phoenix club with the name \\"Highlands Park FC\\", was established with some more long-lasting success in 2003. This club started out to play in the fourth tier of the South African Football league, known as SAFA Regional League; and then got promoted in 2007 to compete at the third tier, known as Vodacom League. History The Balfour Park Sports club was founded by the Jewish Norman Lourie. During the years, the club facilitated amateur teams within the sports disciplines Lawn Bowling, Cricket and Football. The club was located at Balfour Park in Highlands North, which is one of the northern suburbs of Johannesburg. In 1935, Lucke Matus (also known as Louis Matus) became a Foundation Member of Balfour Park, and when he ended his playing career as a footballer, he became the chairman of \\"Balfour Park football section\\" from 1937 until 1951, and also worked as a member of the Southern Transvaal Football Association Executive Committee from 1947 until 1959. Despite only being involved with amateur football in his previous career, he had the vision to found Highlands Park FC, as a new professional football club in November 1959. The new professional club would coexist and share the same facilities, with the amateur side of the club, known as \\"Balfour Park Sports club\\". Current Squad As of 9 March, 2020.

Some years later, the junior team merged with North City F.C., and the base of the club moved 4 km south from the previous Balfour Park Stadium, now to be located at Gemmel Park in Linksfield. The name of the merged junior club, however continued to be \\"Balfour Park juniors\\". In 1990 a newly formed professional team with the name Highlands Park FC, was created at the top of the amateur club. This new phoenix club, straight away managed to get promoted to play in the 1991 National Soccer League, where the club finished at a respectable 9th place. Fellow National Soccer League team Port Elizabeth Blackpool then opted to purchase the franchise and perform a merger with the club, after their own relegation in the same season. The name of the new merged club continued to be \\"Highlands Park FC\\", and the home matches of the club also continued to be played in Johannesburg. After the club also in the next season, had managed to play well enough to avoid relegation, the team however ceased to exist, as the club's sponsor Sharp Electronics did not want to prolong their sponsorship. Hence the club was forced to shut down, and sell their league licence to new owners. The new owners created a new club Welkom Eagles, to play in Welkom and replace \\"Highlands Park FC\\" in the National Soccer League 1993. As the city Welkom is located 267 kilometres southwest of Highlands North in Johannesburg, the new owners only had interest to buy the club's league licence and professional players, while the junior teams and senior amateur teams were not a part of the deal, and remained to exist as an independent amateur club for the following years, with matches still to be played at the Balfour Park Stadium. =Highlands Park FC (2003)= Larry Brookstone got involved as the new owner of the Highlands Park amateur and junior club, already in 1996. When he subsequently in 2000, also opted to purchase a 50% ownership of the football club Silver Stars, he decided together with the other owner of Silver Stars, to create a fruitful collaboration between the two clubs. This meant that the professional Silver Stars top club, became renamed to \\"HP Silver Stars\\", while the Highlands Park junior team for a couple of years worked as the nursery team for the club. As HP Silver Stars played their matches at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, 309 km northeast of Highlands North, it was however soon decided also to create a Silver Stars junior team in Polokwane. The collaboration between the two clubs now slowly ceased to exist, and after a few years \\"HP Silver Stars\\" decided to shorten their name to just \\"Silver Stars\\". Larry Brookstone however continued to work as the managing director of Silver Stars right until May 2007, where he sold his majority of shares to Royal Bafokeng Nation, who moved the playing ground from Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane to Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Phokeng, and also renamed the club to Platinum Stars. After the short term affiliation with Silver Stars, the Highlands Park amateur club had also continued to develop on its own. In 2003 the club had managed to create a second semi-professional Phoenix Club with the name Highlands Park FC. During the first four seasons, the reborn \\"Highlands Park FC\\" competed in the fourth tier of the South African football league, known as SAFA Regional League. When the club had gained promotion in May 2007 to Vodacom League, Larry Brookstone at the same time made the decision to dedicate all his energy and further investments to Highlands Park FC, where he today work as the CEO. The new long term official goal for the club was accordingly set, to become a re- established club in the top flight Premier Soccer League. In the next three seasons, at the Gauteng division in Vodacom League, Highlands Park FC competed consistently at the top level, with a 3rd place, 8th place, and 6th place. At the subsequent 2010‚Äì11 season, the club even managed to win the Gauteng division. Thereby they qualified to the playoff stage, held in May 2011, between the nine divisional winners divided into two round robin groups. The team was promoted to the National First Division in 2014 after winning the ABC Motsepe League Group B Play-offs by beating Natal United 2‚Äì0. Stadium In November 1959, at the same time when the Balfour Park amateur club decided to create the professional club Highlands Park FC, the club also started to construct Balfour Park Stadium. The first home match for the team in 1960 was however played at the nearby Rand Stadium, located 12 km south of Balfour Park Stadium, presumably because the club's new stadium was not yet finished. In subsequent years, the club normally played all their home matches at Balfour Park Stadium, except for some of the bigger international club matches, which they instead opted to play at the nearby Rand Stadium, with a higher capacity. The record home attendance at Balfour Park Stadium was set at the match against Durban City in 1963, when 13,500 spectators watched a 3‚Äì0 victory for Highlands. The new phoenix club moved to play their matches at Gemmel Park, at Gemmelstreet in Linksfield, about 4 km south of the previous Balfour Park Stadium, because the previous stadium was rebuilt as today's Balfour Park Shopping Mall. Because of the rebuild, the memorial gates from Balfour Park was given away to the Jewish Guild club in Rivonia, 12 km north of the old Balfour Park Stadium. Even though the Balfour Park Stadium no longer exists, there are still two training pitches next to the mall, where the junior clubs \\"Maccabi Team\\" and \\"Balfour Alexandra F.C.\\", also known as \\"Balfour Park F.C.\\", are now located. However these junior clubs are in no way associated with the Highlands Park F.C. phoenix club. When Highlands Park FC won promotion to the Vodacom League in 2007, the professional side of the club moved their training and home venue, 10 km northeast of Gemmel Park, to the Modderfontein Sports Club. This bigger facility was used until 2009, and was also used as the training ground of the Platinum Stars football club, in which the owner of Highlands Park, Larry Brookstone, continued to hold some personal shares until November 2008. But apart from sharing the training facility for a couple of years, there was no revival of the collaboration between the two clubs, which had taken place in 2000‚Äì2003. They currently play their home matches at Makhulong stadium. See also *National Football League (South Africa) Former players 1\\\\.

Lapidus is a fictional character on the ABC television series Lost played by Jeff Fahey. Frank is introduced in the second episode of season four as a pilot hired on a mission to the island where Oceanic Flight 815 crashed. He aids the survivors of the crash against mercenary Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and helps to rescue a group who become known as the Oceanic Six. Three years later, Frank encounters the group again while working as a commercial airline pilot. His plane lands back on the island, and he is forcibly taken in by a group of his passengers headed by Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) and Bram (Brad William Henke), who are working for the island's highest authority figure Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). In the series finale, he ultimately escapes the island with a few of his fellow inhabitants. Frank's name was created by co-executive producer Edward Kitsis, who had been pitching the name \\"Lapidus\\" for years and had also used it for an unseen character in the episode \\"Expos√©\\". Fahey was the producers' first choice for the role, which was developed to suit his personality. As a result of the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Frank's role in the first half of season four was diminished, and some planned storylines were carried over into the fifth season. Frank's introduction, along with the three other new characters from the freighter introduced in season four, was well received, as was his return in season five. Lost executive producer Damon Lindelof confirmed in an interview that Lapidus would be a series regular for the show's sixth and final season. Arc Originally from The Bronx, New York, Frank was the intended pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, which crashed on an island in the South Pacific. He is first encountered in The Bahamas, ringing the NTSB to state that the body of the pilot of Flight 815 shown on the sea bed, on the Television news, is not who it is claimed to be. Frank is later recruited as a pilot on behalf of Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who is chartering a freighter destined for the island upon which Flight 815 crashed. Frank reveals himself to be a conspiracy theorist who believes there are still survivors of Flight 815. He goes on to pilot a helicopter from the freighter to the island, which malfunctions on approach. His team‚Äîconsisting of Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung)‚Äîparachute to safety, and Frank is able to land the helicopter without incurring significant damage. Lapidus identifies Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) as a \\"local\\" and in response to the return of Charlotte, who was being held hostage by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), flies Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to the freighter. Later, Frank disagrees with the actions of fellow freighter passenger Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand), a mercenary hired to capture island inhabitant Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson). He helps a group of survivors avoid Keamy's team, and later attempts to resist Keamy's command. When Keamy murders the freighter's captain (Grant Bowler) in a display of power, he is forced to comply, but is able to secretly transfer a satellite phone to the survivors as a warning. When a group of survivors overpower Keamy's mercenaries, Frank attempts to fly them to safety. Due to a lack of fuel, the group‚Äîconsisting of Lapidus, Sayid, Desmond, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Hugo Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Aaron Littleton‚Äîcrash into the ocean, where they take to a lifeboat and are later rescued by the Searcher, a ship belonging to Desmond's girlfriend Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger). Following their rescue, Frank begins working for Ajira Airways. He encounters the survivors again three years later, while piloting Flight 316 to Guam. Frank realizes the Oceanic Six intend to return to the island, and minutes later, the flight experiences extreme turbulence. Frank and his co- pilot are able to land the plane on the adjacent Hydra Island, although the co-pilot is killed. After gathering the survivors of Flight 316 together, Frank accompanies Sun and Ben to the main island. They meet Christian Shephard (John Terry), who reveals that the remaining survivors have travelled through time to 1977. Christian instructs them to await the arrival of John Locke, which they do. Sun is determined to remain with Locke and find her husband Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), so Frank parts from her, returning to Hydra Island intent on repairing the jet radio to call for help. Upon his return, Frank finds that passenger Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) has found guns on the island and claimed leadership of the group. After he is unable to answer her cryptic question \\"What lies in the shadow of the statue?\\" she attacks him and knocks him out. Frank later regains consciousness in an outrigger, being transported back to the main island by Ilana, Bram (Brad William Henke) and three other Flight 316 survivors. He overhears them discussing whether or not he may be a potential \\"candidate\\", though when he asks what he may be a candidate for, they refuse to elaborate. Frank accompanies the group through the jungle to meet up with the island's native inhabitants The Others, at the foot of the aforementioned statue. In the season six premiere \\"LA X\\", Frank tells Sun that he does not trust Ilana and her men. He then witnesses The Man in Black (also O'Quinn), who was posing as Locke all along, knock out Richard Alpert, the Others' ageless advisor. He then participates in the burial of the real Locke. Frank then accompanies Ben, Sun and Ilana to rescue any inhabitant of the attacked Temple. They only rescue Miles. They eventually decide to head for the beach. Frank overhears Miles saying that Ben killed Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). He then tells Ben that he was the original pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. He is at the beach when Jack, Hurley and Richard arrive. In order to stop the Man in Black from leaving the island, Richard suggests that they destroy the Ajira plane. After Ilana is killed while holding dynamites, Frank goes to the Black Rock with the group in order to get more dynamite. However, Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks; destroying all the dynamite supplies. After Hurley tells of his plan to talk to the Man in Black and Richard goes with his plan to destroy the plane, Frank joins Hurley, along with Jack, and Sun. Their group then merge with the Man in Black's camp. Later, Charles Widmore's second in command, Zoe, arrives at the camp and threatens to destroy the camp with artillery shells if the Man in Black does not give back Desmond. Frank, Jack, Hurley, Sun, and Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) go with Sawyer's plan of betraying the Man in Black by joining Widmore, and they escape from the Man in Black's group. After Jack leaves the group, due to his reluctance to leave the island, the remaining group reach Hydra Island. However, Widmore betrays them, and has them locked in the animal cages at Hydra Station. The Man in Black attacks Widmore's camp as the Smoke Monster; allowing Jack, who has joined the Man in Black, to free Frank and the rest of the group. They then head to the Ajira plane to leave the island. But when they get to the plane, the Man in Black reveals the plane is rigged with C4. He then suggests they leave the island by Widmore's submarine. Frank and the group reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 as far away from the others as he could until it explodes. The explosion causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it to the surface of the water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home. Development After Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) landed on the island in season three, the producers began to plan who else would be on the boat she came from.\\"The Freighter Folk\\". Lost: The Complete Fourth Season ‚Äì The Expanded Experience, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Featurette, disc 6. Released on December 9, 2008. They wanted these new characters to be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. The team created consisted of Frank, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume, referred to as the \\"freighter folk\\". Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season. Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name \\"Lapidus\\" for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus.Lindelof, Damon & Cuse, Carlton, (March 21, 2008) \\"The Official Lost Audio Podcast\\", ABC. Retrieved on 2009-07-10. Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character \\"Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot\\". According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Jeff Fahey \\"was the first and only choice for the role\\". Cuse had enjoyed Fahey's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal, and he and Lindelof commended his \\"intense eyes\\", stating that \\"he has exactly the right sensibilities\\" for the part. Fahey was offered the part without having to audition. At the time the producers began to consider him for the role, he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan, doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul. When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show, Fahey was on the top of a mountain in Caracas, Venezuela during a rainstorm, having just opened an orphanage. He had never seen the series before, but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role. When he was cast, Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular. Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which resulted in the fourth season being cut short. The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately, however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season. Fahey was the producers' first choice for the role, which was developed to suit his personality. Frank was not originally envisioned with a beard, however at the time of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode \\"316\\", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: \\"The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were.\\" Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weekly's Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that \\"It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others\\", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was \\"a little nomadic\\". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank \\"never takes anything at face value [and is] a true conspiracy nut [who] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [which will] pay off for him\\". Reception Producers Lindelof and Cuse were initially worried about how the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in \\"Confirmed Dead\\", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, as well as the other new characters from the freighter, as \\"great\\" and \\"exciting\\", writing that: \\"Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent.\\" TV Guide's Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters \\"fascinating\\" and wrote that they \\"totally worked for me, while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more.\\" Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback \\"mind-bending\\", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called \\"Confirmed Dead\\" the \\"perfect introduction\\" to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out more about them. Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they \\"fit seamlessly into the ensemble\\", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed \\"a real cult figure.\\" In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because \\"Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals.\\" He appended, however, that this was: \\"with the possible exception of Frank, who seems a bit too generic-drunk- hippie-guy for now.\\" Following the episode \\"Something Nice Back Home\\", TV Guide's Trish Wethman noted that she was intrigued by Lapidus' \\"seemingly heroic antics\\" in saving a group of the survivors from Keamy and his men, though overall was confused by the motivations of the freighter folk. Carabott wrote that Frank's return in the fifth season episode \\"316\\" was shocking, but seemed as though it was meant to be. He opined that: \\"The chances of Frank being on that plane are astronomical and the fact that he was supposed to be the pilot of Flight 815 just makes the situation all the more unusual. His appearance in this episode is absurd but after four and a half seasons of Lost it makes perfect sense.\\" James Yates of the Staten Island Advance wrote that it was \\"great\\" to see Frank again, as he had missed the character's presence, and hoped he would play a major part upon returning to the island.

The fractional kill hypothesis states that a defined chemotherapy concentration, applied for a defined time period, will kill a constant fraction of the cells in a population, independent of the absolute number of cells.Berenbaum, M. C. (1972). \\"In vivo determination of the fractional kill of human tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents.\\" Cancer Chemother Rep 56(5): 563-71.Skipper, H. E. (1979). \\"Historic milestones in cancer biology: a few that are important in cancer treatment (revisited).\\" Semin Oncol 6(4): 506-14.Chabner, B. and D. L. Longo (2006). Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Philadelphia, Lippincott Willians & Wilkins. In solid tumors, poor access of the tumor to the drug can limit the fraction of tumor cells killed, but the validity of the fractional kill hypothesis has also been established in animal models of leukemia, as well as in human leukemia and lymphoma, where drug access is less of an issue. Because only a fraction of the cells die with each treatment, repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor. Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient. The goal is to reduce the tumor population to zero with successive fractional kills. For example, assuming a 99% kill per cycle of chemotherapy, a tumor of 1011 cells would be reduced to less than one cell with six treatment cycles: 1011 * 0.016 < 1. However, the tumor can also re-grow during the intervals between treatments, limiting the net reduction of each fractional kill.Skeel, R. T. (2003). Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Cited cause of fractional killing: cell cycle effects The fractional killing of tumors in response to treatment is assumed to be due to the cell cycle specificity of chemotherapy drugs. Cytarabine, a DNA-synthesis inhibitor also known as ara-C, is cited as the classic cell cycle phase-specific agent. Chemotherapy dosing schedules have been optimized based on the fact that cytarabine is only expected to be effective in the DNA synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with this, leukemia patients respond better to cytarabine treatments given every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours. This finding that can be explained by the fact that S-phase in these leukemia cells lasts 18‚Äì20 hours, allowing some cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of the drug if it is given every 24 hours. However, alternative explanations are possible, as described below. Lack of cell cycle effect in drugs documented to be cell cycle phase specific Very little direct information is available on whether cells undergo apoptosis from a certain point in the cell cycle.Cotter, T. G., J. M. Glynn, et al. (1992). \\"The induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents occurs in all phases of the cell cycle.\\" Anticancer Res 12(3): 773-9. One study which did address this topic used flow cytometry or elutriation of synchronized cells treated with actinomycin D1, camptothecin, or aphidicolin, each of which had been documented to exert its effects in a particular phase of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, the authors found that each of the agents was able to induce apoptosis in all phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that the mechanism through which the drugs induce apoptosis may be independent of the drugs‚Äô biochemical targets. In fact, a trace through the literature on the S-phase specificity of cytarabine leads to studies that simply assume S-phase specificity based on cytarabine‚Äôs reported site of biochemical action,Skipper, H. E., F. M. Schabel, Jr., et al. (1970). \\"Implications of biochemical, cytokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic relationships in the design of optimal therapeutic schedules.\\" Cancer Chemother Rep 54(6): 431-50. which the later papers reference. The lack of a cell cycle effect for camptothecin has also been reported recently in a live- cell microscopy study.Cohen, A. A., N. Geva-Zatorsky, et al. (2008). \\"Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug.\\" Science 322(5907): 1511-6. Cell-to-cell variation in protein levels A recent paper by Spencer et al.Spencer, S. L., S. Gaudet, et al. (2009). \\"Non-genetic origins of cell-to-cell variability in TRAIL-induced apoptosis.\\" Nature. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08012.html. raises the possibility that cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations may contribute to fractional killing in the case of treatment with TRAIL (TNF- related apoptosis inducing ligand). TRAIL is a ligand native to the human body that is currently being developed as a cancer treatment. Spencer et al. observed fractional killing at a single cell level in several cell lines, even in genetically identical populations grown in homogeneous environments. This paper ruled out the conventional explanation (cell cycle effects) in two of these cell lines, and provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that random variation in cellular initial conditions causes some cells to die while allowing others to survive.

Founded to serve the financial needs of school district employees, in 1998 it merged with Riverside County Federal Credit Union, which served employees of Riverside County to become Riverside County's Credit Union. Over time, it grew to become, and remains today, the largest credit union headquartered in Riverside County. In 2004, the credit union expanded its field of membership to include Riverside and San Diego counties and selected cities in San Bernardino and San Diego counties. To better reflect its expanding geographic service area, Riverside County's Credit Union changed its name to Altura Credit Union, on October 1, 2004. Publicity for the name change said \\"Our new name means height, elevation, altitude.\\" Pronounced \\"all- TOUR-ah,\\" the name was accompanied by a new logo, design elements and brand identity. The colors reflect the water, agriculture and mountains of the Southern California communities served by Altura Credit Union. Merger with Visterra Credit Union Altura Credit Union and Visterra Credit Union, both based in Riverside County, Calif., announced their intention to merge their financial institutions on Feb. 19, 2015. The announcement cited a desire to better serve the needs of their combined members. The merger was finalized on Aug. 1, 2015, which created a $1.1 billion credit union with 118,000 Members.http://www.pe.com/articles/credit-760652-union-altura.html At the time of the announcement, Altura Credit Union, headquartered in Riverside, Calif., had $757.3 million in assets and nearly 84,000 Members.

CAPE recognizes organizations that demonstrate superior performance in seven key business areas including leadership; strategic planning, customer and market focus, measurement and knowledge management, human resources, process management and business results. History In the late 1950s, Peggy Green, a secretary at Riverside Middle School, decided that classified school employees needed a credit union of their own. Her husband was a teacher, and belonged to a teacher's credit union, but only certificated employees could join ‚Äì membership was not available if the person was classified. In October 1956, she invited other school secretaries to a meeting to organize a credit union for classified personnel within the Riverside Unified School District (RUSD). On August 22, 1957, they were granted a state charter as Riverside City Schools Employees Credit Union, listing the following six organizers: Ethel C. Collier, Louise Bailey, Ruth C. Klock, Frank W. Meyer, George W. Peters, and Charles Sandell. Ethell Collier handled the business from her desk at the RUSD payroll office. The credit union moved to a portable building at Palm School, and then to its own office on Brockton Avenue. On March 1, 1973, set up its headquarters and main branch at 6403 Riverside Ave., Riverside, which continues as a branch location today. In 1981 opened a branch office in Cathedral City, followed by the Corona in 1986, Moreno Valley in 1992, and the Member Service Center in 1995, which is now called the Operations & Technology Center.

It is impossible to separate the natural values from the cultural and historical heritage of Blagaj, since its distinctive quality is in the coexistence of the natural and the man-made, in the integration of the physical structure into the landscape.  Vrelo Bune  A spring of Buna inside the cavern The Buna river is a short river in Bosnia and Herzegovina and it is a left bank tributary of the Neretva river. Its source (Bosnian: Vrelo Bune) is a strong karstic spring, emerging from a huge karstic cavern beneath a high vertical cliff. This region is specific for the diversity of its above-ground and underground hydrography. The source of the Buna river is the finest example of an underground karst river. It's one of the largest and most beautiful springs in Europe, producing approx. 30 m3/s with extremely cold and clean water.  Historical and Natural Heritage  Blagaj is one of the most valuable urban-cum-rural structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Blagaj reached its peak of development in the 15th and 16th centuries, building in stone also reached its greatest extent. The first stone-built houses were the privilege of the wealthier class, but later, and lower-class families are also built sizeable stone houses and summer residences in large numbers. The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj forms a spatially and topographically self-contained ensemble. The region is also known for the diversity of its flora and a number of endemic species. At lower altitudes there are many evergreen plant and deciduous thicket species, while at higher altitudes in the hills there is sparse forest. Fertile cultivable land is suitable for the agriculture typical of the Mediterranean climate. = Blagaj Tekke = The architectural ensemble of the Blagaj Tekke (a Sufi lodge) stands by the source of the Buna river, not far from the centre of Blagaj. The musafirhana (guest house) and t√ºrbe (mausoleum) are tucked into the natural surroundings, constituting a single entity with the cliffs, source of the Buna river and mills. The musafirhana of the Blagaj tekke and the t√ºrbe have been preserved to this day. The musafirhana was built before 1664, and rebuilt in 1851 - its original appearance is not known. The building was subsequently repaired on several occasions. The ensemble of the Blagaj Tekke was presumably built very soon after Ottoman rule was established in Herzegovina, around 1520 at the latest. = Bridges = There were four bridges over the 9 km of the Buna river, two in Blagaj, one in Kosor and one in Buna village. Blagaj's bridges, the Karaƒëoz-beg bridge and Leho bridge, differ in certain features from the typological form of 16th century Ottoman architecture. * The Karaƒëoz- beg bridge was endowed by Zaim hajji Mehmed-beg, known as Karaƒëoz, and was built before 1570, on the road to town of Stolac. The bridge has five arches, of increasing span towards the centre. * The Leho bridge or Lehina ƒáuprija in Donja Mahala was built before 1664 It is assumed to have been commission by Haseƒái Ali-aga Kolakoviƒá. It had three arches, considerably wider than those of the Karaƒëoz-beg bridige. = Mills = Mill buildings on the Buna river are simple stone-built structures with gabled roofs clad with stone slabs, and with one or more mills. * The mills by the Tekke. Very close to the source of the Buna river, channels branch off leading water to power the mills. Several mills, one stamping and two fulling mills were built. There was one on each bank of the river. Part of the mill on the right bank of the river has been converted into a souvenir shop. All that remains of the rest of the structure is the stone walls. * The mills in the Velagiƒá residential complex. Part of the mill is on the bank and the greater part on the branch of the Buna river that flows beneath the Velagiƒá residential complex. The mill building consists of two parts, one built on dry land with a ground and an upper storey, and the other a single-storey structure built over the river spanning the two banks by means of a system of arches. The first part was the miller's living quarters, and the other contained seven mills arranged at regular intervals. Stamping mills were used for washing wool and fulling cloth. = Residential quarters = Residential complexes were entirely isolated in relationship with the outside world, so that the courtyard became the most important area of the house. These complexes consisted of several different buildings serving different purposes, standing on a plot that was entirely open to the natural surroundings and forming a single unit with the architecture of the buildings. * The Kolakoviƒá house is one of the most striking examples of residential architecture in Mediterranean Herzegovina, and illustrates the evolution of the \\"Ottoman Bosnian\\" house. * The Velagiƒá residential complex, built sometime before 1776, is a unique complex of the residential architecture of that time, with a large number of the functional components required for life. Although separated from the outside world, with a high wall enclosure, the interior of the complex is open to the natural environment and the Buna river. All the courtyards are interconnected and paved with river pebbles. The complex of the Velagiƒá house is the most complete example of a family house complex with outbuildings, where the full scope of the residential lifestyle of Mediterranean Herzegovina in the past is revealed.Velagic House TripAdvisor * The Kosiƒá tower, as an offshoot of mediaeval residential architecture, is a typical fortified house. It is stone-built and stands at the edge of the town, so it probably served some defence purpose, given that the Blagaj fort was on the other side.  UNESCO WHS Nomination  According to the nomination for the list of national monuments in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the title \\"Townscape ensemble of the town of Blagaj\\", drawn up by the Institute for the Protection of the Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the source of the Buna river with its cliffs constitutes a geomorphological natural monument, and the source of the Buna river a hydrological natural monument. Blagaj's architectural heritage and old urban quarters (mahalas) indicates that buildings of major monumental and townscape value occupy a relatively confined area along the Buna river. Urban structures, spatial physiognomy and organization can be traced from the mediaeval outskirts of the fort, which were transformed in the Ottoman period into a kasaba (village-town). Both Oriental and Mediterranean features are to be seen in Blagaj's urban layout, while the settlement itself was the outcome of the influence of the natural phenomenons and configuration of the terrain, as well as socio-economic relations. A perfect harmony between each buildings and its environs was achieved.

It was described in 1961 by Osvaldo Reig and named after the Cuyo Basin; the type species is C. huenei, referring to German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene. Although originally described as a proterosuchid, restudy by Julia Desojo and colleagues in 2003 found that it could not be assigned to any family.

Located on the east slope of the southern Snake Range at an elevation above , the historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. History The lake and mine are named for Alfred Johnson, who filed a mining claim in Snake Creek Canyon in 1909. A rancher who also wished to exploit the location opposed him in court, but Johnson prevailed. Tungsten was discovered in the area in 1912 by John D. Tilford. Tilford set up the Bonita Mine, while Johnson set up the Johnson Lake Mine in 1912. The mine was finally closed when a snowslide destroyed the aerial tram terminal after 1935. Description The district includes a mining adit and stope, an aerial tramway, four log structures, a log ore mill, a stable, trash dumps and a dam on Johnson Lake. Three cabins were built for accommodations, three small cabins for sleeping and storage, and a larger communal cabin. There is also evidence of tent platforms. The site is well preserved, with some of the mining equipment intact. The aerial tramway transported ore from the mine across a steep slope to a terminal building, where the ore was packing in barrels and hauled by mule to the mill. The milled ore was then packed to the location of the present Shoshone Campground and further transferred to Garrison, Utah. From Garrison the ore went to the railroad at Frisco, Utah. The mine followed an wide ore-bearing quartz vein about into the mountainside.

Life and work His father opened a conservatory in the San Telmo district, in 1913, soon becoming one of the city's best known sources for music, instruments, parts, and lessons. He and his brother, Francisco, were both taught the piano and violin, respectively; though their father ultimately granted them their wish to exchange instruments (a third brother, Emilio, learned the violin). Against his father's wishes, Julio obtained a spot as a second violinist at the Lorea Theatre for a 1915 performance of a zarzuela. Despite his father's punishment and objections, the brothers began attending Buenos Aires' popular tango recitals. Some of these early influences included bandleaders Eduardo Arolas, Juan Carlos Cobi√°n, and Roberto Firpo. At his friends' prompting, de Caro rose to the stage during a tango performance at the Palais de Glace, an elegant multi-purpose venue, in 1917. Granted an instrument by Firpo's violinist, de Caro's performance elicited a standing ovation, as well as Eduardo Arolas' offer for a permanent spot in his orchestra. The elder de Caro (who disdained popular music generally) resisted it, and the talented young musician resorted to stealth to join Arolas' orchestra, for which he wrote his first tango, Mon beguin. Eventually, his father forced the 18-year-old out of the house, a drastic move that pushed Francisco to join his brother. The two traveled with Arolas' orchestra, a success in both Argentina and neighboring Uruguay. The brothers contributed greatly to its fortunes, composing - among other standards in tango: Mala pinta (Shady Look), Mi encanto (My Charm), Pura labia (All Words), Don Antonio, A palada (In Spades), Era buena la paisana (She Was a Good Country Girl), Percanta arrepentida (Lamentful girl), Bizcochito (Lil' Biscuit), Gringuita (Blondie) y La ca√±ada (The Brook). A business disagreement led de Caro and pianist Jos√© Mar√≠a Rizzuti to leave Arolas' group in 1919. They formed a quartet with bandoneonist Pedro Maffia and violinist Jos√© Rosito, with whom they performed to acclaim at a caf√© facing the Argentine Supreme Court. The group separated in 1920, however, and de Caro and Rizzuti joined bandleader Osvaldo Fresedo, with whom they would tour in the United States. De Caro relocated to Montevideo, where he married and joined Minotto Di Cicco's orchestra (1922). He was then reunited with Maffia in Buenos Aires under Juan Carlos Cobi√°n's direction, in 1923. His marriage ended, shortly afterwards. Cobi√°n's decision to follow a love interest to New York City led to the de Caro brothers' being reunited in need of a band, at the end of 1923. Their success at a high society New Year's Eve ball led to lucrative contracts in popular downtown caf√©s and for a new medium: radio. The Julio de Caro Orchestra later received a recording contract from RCA Victor and, in April 1925, performed for Edward, the Prince of Wales. U.S. jazz bandleader Paul Whiteman introduced de Caro to the Stroh violin, later that year. The device (a violin with a cornet horn at one end) had been invented for radio performances for its ability to project sound above the rest of the orchestra, and the conductor soon found it an indispensable tool. The renowned bandleader composed numerous pieces in honor of some of the prominent figures in Argentine life that attended his performances, notably chief surgeon Enrique Finochietto and President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Old friends, Ernesto S√°bato, Ben Molar and Julio de Caro together in 1977 The orchestra toured France by invitation, in 1931. They performed at Nice's Palais de la M√©diterran√©e, for Prince Umberto di Savoia, for the Rothschilds' galas, and for Paramount Studios in the making of Luces de Buenos Aires (one of several the studio made, starring Carlos Gardel). The orchestra remained successful in Argentina, debuting at the nation's leading opera house, the Col√≥n Theatre, in 1935, and at the Teatro Opera (1936), where they presented a comprehensive \\"Evolution of the Tango\\" - leading listeners through its development from 1870, onwards. A surprise visit by the brothers' aging parents following one of these performances led to the family's reconciliation. His orchestra continued its prominence among tango fans for years, introducing young talent such as vocalist Edmundo Rivero (a consular figure in tango), for instance. His audiences later declining, Julio de Caro retired from his orchestra in 1954, however. He remarried in 1959 and returned to a recording studio only in 1975, collaborating with author Ernesto S√°bato, composer Ben Molar, composer and arranger Luis Stazo and others to make Los 14 de Julio de Caro (Julio de Caro's 14). He was honored by the national government with a declaration of December 11 (his birthday - which he shared with Gardel) as \\"National Tango Day;\\" on that day in 1977, he received a standing ovation at Buenos Aires' Luna Park Arena, complete with a rousing Happy Birthday to You. Julio de Caro died in the seaside resort city of Mar del Plata, on March 11, 1980, at age 80. He was interred at Buenos Aires' Chacarita Cemetery, beside his brother, Francisco. Other notable relatives include his cousin, the poet Julia de Caro (July 11, 1917- June 26, 2009) and his grand-niece, the American Fencer Natalie Julia Vie (b. April 19, 1986).

Singkamas is the 2nd smallest barangay in Makati in terms of land area with a land area of 12.59 hectares.  History  Singkamas was an integral part of Barrio Tejeros. It was then a sitio with about 200 houses of light materials and 150 houses of stronger built. In 1960, after the passage of Republic Act No. 2370 (Barrio Charter), Barangay Singkamas was officially recognized as a separate barrio from Barrio Tejeros. Inspired by their independent status, the inhabitants built their own house of worship ‚Äî the Holy Cross Chapel ‚Äîwhich became the rallying point of neighborhood rehabilitation. This landmark also became the center of public forum and festivities, like Christmas and Barrio Fiesta Celebrations. Being the smallest Barangay of Makati City, Barangay Singkamas struggled to sustain its existence by depending on its meager income or revenue derived from tax collections, IRA and RPT entitlements. Singkamas is a former sitio of Barrio Tejeros and was officially recognized as a separate barrio in 1960 by virtue of Republic Act 2370. The first move towards this independent status was taken in the early 1950s when the residents felt it would be more beneficial for them to have their own set of leaders and the autonomy to manage their own affairs especially its Barrio Fiesta. As a result of the separation, the residents of Singkamas decided to build their own chapel, the Holy Cross. In the past, Singkamas had the unique tradition of hanging fresh and succulent turnips instead of the usual buntings during their fiesta. This practice gave the place its distinct name, Barrio Singkamas.

The clove was formed by Kaaterskill Creek, a tributary of Catskill Creek rising west of North Mountain, and is estimated by geologists to be as much as 1 million years old.Dunn, Russell: _Catskill Region Waterfall Guide_ , Kaaterskill High Peak and Roundtop Mountain rise to the south of the gorge, while South Mountain is to its north. This makes the gorge as deep as 2,500 feet in places.Google Maps was kind enough to supply me with the elevation figures.  History  Little is known of Kaaterskill Clove's history prior to 1817, when Gilbert Palen built a tannery near the entrance to Kaaterskill Clove, giving the village of Palenville its name. After the War of 1812, with Americans free to pursue trade without fearing the interference of Great Britain, industry throughout the United States began to expand, with Palenville and Kaaterskill Clove becoming the site of many tanneries due to the large hemlock forests in the clove. Within just half a century, however, deforestation had set in, and the tannery industry collapsed, lacking the trees it required. Palenville reinvented itself as a tourist town, building several boardinghouses and proclaiming itself the home of the fictional character Rip van Winkle. The clove was popular with artists and walkers, fleeing the squalor and hubbub of the downstate cities. In particular, artists of the Hudson River School painted the Clove: examples include Asher Brown Durand's 1849 painting Kindred Spirits, depicting fellow artist Thomas Cole, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, one of the founders of the Arts Student's League had a studio there with Hart and poet William Cullen Bryant, and Sanford Gifford's 1862 work Kaaterskill Clove in the Catskills. Twentieth Century artists such as landscapist Thomas Locker (1937-2012) described the Clove as a vacation spot he returned to many times since his childhood, and many of his paintings depict the Clove and life in it according to a video he filmed for his agent, Richard Michelson of R.Michelson Gallery in Northampton, MA. Numerous mountain houses and hotels were constructed, including the Laurel House, the Catskill Mountain House, the Haines Falls House and others, and trails and walkways were constructed to the many overlooks and waterfalls in the clove. Most notable was the construction of the Rip Van Winkle Trail, now Route 23A, which wound its way up the clove from Palenville to the hamlet of Haines Falls. This opened the interior of the clove to visitors from the cities for the first time, and is still a main route into the heart of the northern Catskills (especially in winter when Route 35, which ascends through Platte Clove, is closed).  Attractions  Perhaps the most famous location in Kaaterskill Clove is Kaaterskill Falls, a 231-foot waterfall on Lake Creek (a medium-sized tributary of Kaaterskill Creek) commonly thought to be the highest waterfall in New York State. However, there are several other waterfalls in the clove including Fawn's Leap, Buttermilk Falls, and Haines Falls, although the trails that once led to these falls have long since been reclaimed by the gorge, making access difficult. Numerous hiking trails also exist in and above Kaaterskill Clove. The Long Path passes through the clove, skirting its southern rim. Trails on the northern rim visit Inspiration Point, Sunset Rock, Artist Rock and other locations providing views down into the clove and across towards Kaaterskill High Peak. There is also a campground near North-South Lakes, and access to the site of the former Catskill Mountain House, with views across the Hudson Valley from the top of the Catskill Escarpment.

It is located at the uptown lake corner of Canal Street and Rampart Street. The Saenger Theater is directly opposite the State Palace on Canal Street. The theatre was constructed in 1926 for the Loew's Theatre circuit. It had a seating capacity of 3,335 and also contained a 3/13 Robert Morton organ. Lew Cody, Buster Keaton, Jack Mulhall, Dorothy Mackaill, Conrad Nagel, Dorothy Phillips, Lloyd Hamilton, and Dorothy Mason were among the stars who appeared on stage with Marcus Loew when the theatre opened on Easter Sunday, April 3, 1926. It was named simply, State Theatre. The theatre showed silent films and hosted many live performances in the early days. As time went on, the silent films were replaced with talking pictures and eventually the prized 3/13 Robert Morton organ was destroyed in a flood. In 1976, the State Theatre was tripled. After closing as a movie house in the late-1980s, the partition was removed, and the State Theatre was restored and renamed, as the State Palace Theatre, showing classic movies and offering concerts. The State Palace Theater was the epicenter of the southern rave scene in the mid 1990s hosting the world's top DJs. The documentary \\"Rise: Story of Rave Outlaw Disco Donnie\\" highlights the rave scene at the State Palace Theater. The theater flooded in 2005's Hurricane Katrina levee failure disaster. Some clean-up was done, allowing it to open for a few raves through 2007; but the building was in need of serious renovation and was closed by the fire marshal after it was sold to new owners. Planned rebirth City Officials and Broadway South planned to reopen the theater for the 2010-11 season. Renovations were set to take place in the summer of 2009, but were never started. In August 2014 it was announced the State Palace Theater had been purchased by New Orleans developer Gregor Fox. Fox confirmed the purchase to WWL-TV. Fox indicated he planned to renovate both the interior and exterior of the historic building and put the property back into commercial use. Fox said he wanted the space to contribute to the city's arts community and was excited about the redevelopment. Fox decided to sell the theater in 2015, after learning the restoration he planned would cost as much as $40 million. A new developer, LC Hospitality Group, submitted a proposal to the Central Business District Architectural Review Committee on April 24, 2018. The proposal is to gut most of the theater's interior and construct a 9-story, 132-room hotel. The plans, drawn up by the architectural firm of Trapolin- Peer, include a parking garage.

It is located in Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park, west of the communities of Tatla Lake, Kleena Kleene and Nimpo Lake, and east of Bella Coola. It is one of the tallest waterfalls in Canada when measured as a continuous unbroken drop. Sources vary, but the official BC Parks measurement is .Tweedsmuir (South) Provincial Park: Hunlen Falls/Turner Lake Chain.

Hunlen Falls drops from the north end of Turner Lake via Hunlen Creek into the Atnarko River, a tributary of the Bella Coola River. Erosion of the canyon below Hunlen Falls has created an alluvial fan into the Atnarko Valley. The falls were named in 1947 after a Chilcotin Chief named Hana-lin, who used to fish below the falls in the autumn with a fish trap, and trap game nearby.Clayton Mack, Harvey Thommasen (1994).Bella Coola Man: More Stories of Clayton Mack. Pg. 115. In the 1930s it was sometimes called Mystery Falls and before that occasionally called Bella Coola Falls.  Access  Turner Lake in the background as the source of Hunlen Falls. There is no road to Hunlen Falls. The easiest access is by float plane from Nimpo Lake, about a 20-minute flight. Planes land on Turner Lake above Hunlen Falls and the walk on a good trail takes about 30 minutes to the unfenced viewpoint on the east rim of the canyon. There is a hiking trail to Hunlen Falls, starting from Highway #20 at the foot of the Bella Coola Hill. Starting from Highway #20 the Tote Rd offers 4x4 access to the trailhead. The trail is approximately long. The trail to Turner Lake is cleared and maintained by BC Parks and volunteers.  Nearby area  Lonesome Lake is about to the east of Turner Lake, running parallel to it. It is an S-shaped lake nearly in length and visible from the cliffs at Hunlen Falls. The south end of Lonesome Lake was the site of the pioneer homestead of Ralph Edwards, known as \\"The Birches\\", which was occupied from 1912 into the 1970s. His life was made famous by the book Crusoe of Lonesome Lake.Stowe, Leland (1957). Crusoe of Lonesome Lake. Random House.

Concurrently with his position as city councilman, Salcido served as mayor of Pico Rivera in 2002, 2010 and 2015. His derogatory comments about members of the United States armed forces, captured on video by one of his students, went viral in January 2018, leading to calls for his eventual dismissal as both teacher and city councilman in March 2018. Early life Salcido was born in East Los Angeles, California in 1968 to first-generation Mexican-Americans. His grandparents emigrated from Torre√≥n, Coahuila in northeast Mexico. His father was a steelworker. Salcido graduated from El Rancho High School, where he would later become a teacher, in 1986. Salcido received his bachelor's degree in history from Whittier College. Salcido started teaching in 1998 a few months after graduating from college. A year later, Salcido ran for and won a position on the Pico Rivera City Council. Much of his philosophy and views on life come from watching stand up comedy. One of his all time favorites was George Carlin. He mimicked his anti authoritarian values using many of his jokes to inspire and flip peoples views on life. Career and controversies as educator Salcido began his teaching career at his alma mater, El Rancho High School, in 1998. His tenure as teacher at El Rancho was marred by controversy. On three separate occasions, Salcido has been put on administrative leave. In 2005, a parent complained about a class discussion about masturbation. Investigators with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department cleared Salcido of any wrongdoing. In July 2010, Salcido was reprimanded and placed on administrative leave after a parent complained about Salcido's conduct in the classroom. A parent alleged that his Anglo-American 16-year-old daughter had been threatened by Salcido and that Salcido had made inappropriate insulting comments about race, other students and parents. One student complained that Salcido had said, \\"Shut up, Kelly, before I kill you.\\" In May 2012, Salcido was placed on administrative leave after the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department received a complaint that he had struck an Anglo-American student. Salcido admitted striking the student and said the student had been disruptive by sleeping in class. The child, named David, also alleged that Salcido bullied him in a sexually derisive and dismissive manner based on the boy's weight and appearance, calling him \\"Chaz Bono\\". In January 2018, a student recorded a video in his classroom of Salcido lecturing about the U.S. military after Salcido noticed a student wearing a Marine Corps shirt. Salcido's disparaging remarks about U.S. servicemen attracted widespread local, statewide and nationwide media attention. The video, which was laced with profanity, caused a nationwide furor, with people across the country calling for Salcido's termination by the El Rancho Unified School District and removal from the Pico Rivera City Council. In the video, Salcido said, \\"We‚Äôve got a bunch of dumbshits over there. Think about the people who you know who are over there, your freaking stupid uncle Louis or whatever; they‚Äôre dumbshits. They‚Äôre not like high-level thinkers, they‚Äôre not academic people, they‚Äôre not intellectual people, they‚Äôre the freaking lowest of our low. Not morally, I‚Äôm not saying they make bad moral decisions, they‚Äôre not talented people.\\" In the video, Salcido questioned the military's ability to succeed in its ongoing operations in the Middle East, saying, \\"We all have night-vision goggles, all that kind of stuff, and we can‚Äôt freakin‚Äô control these dudes wearing freakin‚Äô robes and chanclas [flip-flops] because we have a bunch of dumbshits over there.\\" Salcido also referred to military actions during the Vietnam War as fighting a \\"bunch of people this freakin‚Äô big throwing rice at us.‚Äù He questioned why the school would allow the military to recruit students, saying, \\"I don‚Äôt understand why we let the freakin‚Äô military guys come over here and recruit you at school. We don‚Äôt have pimps come into school. Anyone interested in being a hoe [whore]?\\" According to the student who made the video, Salcido has a history of making anti-military statements. As a result of his videotaped comments, Salcido was placed on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation. On March 21st, 2018 School Board President Aurora Villon announced that the El Rancho Unified School District had voted unanimously on March 20 to terminate Gregory Salcido from his teaching position.https://www.themaven.net/bluelivesmatter/news/city-council- eliminates-teacher-who-called-military-lowest-of-our-low- kuBrqRpIvkaHnKXMZDyOBg?full=1 In April 2018, the El Rancho Unified School District released an official report on Salcido's tenure in the school district and found an ongoing history of questionable and abusive behavior towards students who were pro-military, Christian, LGBT, Anglo-American, and Asian-American. One counselor told investigators that they had to move over 25 students from Salcido's classes over the years for the students' well-being, due to berating behavior from Salcido. The report also stated that Salcido had used his district-owned computer to save nude images of women; a violation of the district's technology use policies, used corporal punishment in the classroom, used racial slurs, refused to follow district policies and repeatedly lied during the investigation.https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2018/04/17/el-rancho-teacher- gregory-salcido-had-nude-images-on-work-computer-used-racial-slurs-report- says/ Political career Salcido has served on the Pico Rivera City Council since 2000. During his tenure, Salcido has been at odds with the council on several key issues. Generally regarded as a progressive Democrat, Salcido has taken positions on the left wing of the Democratic Party, such as his decision in January 2010 to remove the Bible from the City Council dais for violating the Constitution's Establishment Clause. In 2002, while serving as mayor of Pico Rivera, Salcido ran for California's 38th congressional district and raised $62,000, but lost in the Democratic primary to Grace Napolitano. Salcido has served as a member of the History and Heritage Society Committee and has represented the city in various countywide organizations, such as the Los Angeles County City Selection Committee and the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County. In 2004, a committee was organized to recall Salcido and two other council members after the three approved a $40,000 raise for the then city manager, but the recall effort failed. In 2012, Salcido was fined by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for campaign finance violations and fined $2,500. This fine was in connection to a cash donation by the El Rodeo Nightclub of $2,000, which is more than the California limit of $100 on cash donations. The nightclub had been raided by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation due to suspected drug money laundering. The nightclub had been a source of complaints by residents and other city council members, but Salcido never took any action as councilman on those complaints. Aftermath of video controversy On January 29, 2018 the City Council censured Salcido for his comments after his videotaped anti- military tirade, although there are questions about whether the First Amendment allows a city government to take action for unpopular speech. The City Council released a statement unanimously condemning Salcido's remarks. Salcido is forbidden from chairing or participating in any committees. A Pico Rivera eatery, Zapien's Salsa Grill, removed a popular lunch special named after Salcido after the video surfaced. The lunch special, called \\"The Mayor,\\" was a common dish consisting of two enchiladas frequently ordered by Salcido, a regular at the restaurant. In a statement, the restaurant's proprietor said, \\"I am outraged by what he said against our military personnel and our veterans.\\" On Friday, February 1st, classes at El Rancho were cancelled as a protest took place across the street from the school. The event was covered by local media sources. Salcido was finally fired by the El Rancho Unified School District on March 20, 2018. The event caused explosive cheering when the results of an investigation was announced to the general public at a school board meeting.

Doctors did not understand infection, and did little to prevent it. It was a time before antiseptics, and a time when there was no attempt to maintain sterility during surgery. No antibiotics were available, and minor wounds could easily become infected, and hence fatal. While the typical soldier was at very high risk of being shot and killed in combat, he faced an even greater risk of dying from disease. Unidentified officer in the Confederate Medical Corps. From the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs division, Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs Background Before the Civil War, armies tended to be small, largely because of the logistics of supply and training. Musket fire, well known for its inaccuracy, kept casualty rates lower than they might have been.In the several days' battle at Waterloo, a reported 47,000 were killed and wounded on both sides; perhaps one-fifth to one-quarter were killed. Barbero, Alessandro, The Battle: A New History of Waterloo. Atlantic Books, 2006. . pp. 419-420. The advent of railroads, industrial production, and canned food allowed for much larger armies, and the Mini√© ball rifle brought about much higher casualty rates.It has been reported that in terms of casualties, the Civil War saw eleven \\"Waterloos\\", Bill Kauffman, Woe Unto Those Who Transgress 'The Compromise', Free Lance-Star (Fredericksburg, Va.), March 4, 2001, p. D1, D4, although the casualty reporting may not be comparable. See also List of battles by casualties. The work of Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War brought the deplorable situation of military hospitals to the public attention, although reforms were often slow in coming. Union The hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and, especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.Kenneth Link, \\"Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life,\\" Vermont History, (1983) 51#2 pp 69-88 This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. When the war began, there were no plans in place to treat wounded or sick Union soldiers. After the Battle of Bull Run, the United States government took possession of several private hospitals in Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Virginia, and surrounding towns.Billings, p. 298. Union commanders believed the war would be short and there would be no need to create a long-standing source of care for the army's medical needs. This view changed after the appointment of General George B. McClellan and the organization of the Army of the Potomac. McClellan appointed the first medical director of the army, surgeon Charles S. Tripler, on August 12, 1861. Tripler created plans to enlist regimental surgeons to travel with armies in the field, and the creation of general hospitals for the badly wounded to be taken to for recovery and further treatment.Billings, p. 299. To implement the plan, orders were issued on May 25 that each regiment must recruit one surgeon and one assistant surgeon to serve before they could be deployed for duty. These men served in the initial makeshift regimental hospitals. In 1862 William A. Hammond became surgeon general and launched a series of reforms.U.S. Army Medical Department, The Evolution of Preventive Medicine in the United States Army, 1607-1939, chapter 6, p. 104 He founded the Army Medical Museum,Now the National Museum of Health and Medicine. and had plans for a hospital and a medical school in Washington; a central laboratory for chemical and pharmaceutical preparations was created; much more extensive recording was required from the hospitals and the surgeons. Hammond raised the requirements for admission into the Army Medical Corps. The number of hospitals was greatly increased and he paid close attention to aeration.; also p. 38 New surgeons were promoted to serving at the brigade level with the rank of major. The surgeon majors were assigned staffs and were charged with overseeing a new brigade-level hospital that could serve as an intermediary level between the regimental and general hospitals. Surgeon majors were also charged with ensuring that regimental surgeons were in compliance with the orders issued by the medical director of the army.Billings, p. 300. In the Union skilled, well-funded medical organizers took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,Mary C. Gillett, The Army Medical Department, 1818‚Äì1865 (1987) and the United States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency.William Quentin Maxwell, Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission (1956) Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the United States Christian Commission as well as smaller private agencies such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the army (WCAR) founded in 1861 by Henry Whitney Bellows, and Dorothea Dix. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness, as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet Walt Whitman. Frederick Law Olmsted, a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.Justin Martin, Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted (2011) pp 178-230 Field hospital of the 3rd Division, 2nd Corps in Brandy Station, VA in 1864 States could use their own tax money to support their troops as Ohio did. Following the unexpected carnage at the battle of Shiloh in April 1862, the Ohio state government sent 3 steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals with doctors, nurses and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to eleven hospital ships. The state also set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.Eugene E. Roseboom, The Civil War Era, 1850‚Äì1873 (1944) p 396 Field hospitals were initially in the open air, with tent hospitals that could hold only six patients first being used in 1862; after many major battles the injured had to receive their care in the open. As the war progressed, nurses were enlisted, generally two per regiment. In the general hospitals one nurse was employed for about every ten patients.Billings, p. 301. The first permanent general hospitals were ordered constructed during December 1861 in the major hubs of military activity in the eastern and western United States.Billings, p. 302. An elaborate system of ferrying wounded and sick soldiers from the brigade hospitals to the general hospitals was set up. At first the system proved to be insufficient and many soldiers were dying in mobile hospitals at the front and could not be transported to the general hospitals for needed care. The situation became apparent to military leaders in the Peninsular Campaign in June 1862 when several thousand soldiers died for lack of medical treatment.Billings, p. 303. Dr. Jonathan Letterman was appointed to succeed Tripler as the second medical director of the army in 1862 and completed the process of putting together a new ambulance corps. Each regiment was assigned two wagons, one carrying medical supplies, and a second to serve as a transport for wounded soldiers. The ambulance corps was placed under the command of Surgeon Majors of the various brigades. In August 1863 the number of transport wagons was increased to three per regiment.Billings, p. 304. Patients in Ward K of Armory Square Hospital in Washington, DC in 1865 Union medical care improved dramatically during 1862. By the end of the year each regiment was being regularly supplied with a standard set of medical supplies included medical books, supplies of medicine, small hospital furniture like bed-pans, containers for mixing medicines, spoons, vials, bedding, lanterns, and numerous other implements. A new layer of medical treatment was added in January 1863. A division level hospital was established under the command of a Surgeon-in-Chief. The new divisional hospitals took over the role of the brigade hospitals as a rendezvous point for transports to the general hospitals. The wagons transported the wounded to nearby railroad depots where they could be quickly transported to the general hospitals at the military supply hubs. The divisional hospitals were given large staffs, nurses, cooks, several doctors, and large tents to accommodate up to one hundred soldiers each. The new division hospitals began keeping detailed medical records of patients. The divisional hospitals were established at a safe distance from battlefields where patients could be safely helped after transport from the regimental or brigade hospitals.Billings, p. 305. Although the divisional hospitals were placed in safe locations, because of their size they could not be quickly packed in the event of a retreat. Several divisional hospitals were lost to Confederates during the war, but in almost all occasions their patients and doctors were immediately paroled if they would swear to no longer bear arms in the conflict. On a few occasions, the hospitals and patients were held several days and exchanged for Confederate prisoners of war.Billings, p. 306. Both Armies learned many lessons and in 1886, it established the Hospital Corps. The Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.James H. Cassedy, \\"Numbering the North's Medical Events: Humanitarianism and Science in Civil War Statistics,\\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Summer 1992, Vol. 66 Issue 2, pp 210-233 Confederacy Captain in Confederate uniform with black cuffs indicating surgeon. From the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs division, Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs Confederate Chimborazo Hospital in April, 1865 in Richmond, VA Dr. Edmund Lewis Massie of Trans-Mississippi Department, Medical Staff Confederate States Infantry Regiment The Confederacy was quicker to authorize the establishment of a medical corps than the Union, but the Confederate medical corp was at a considerable disadvantage throughout the war primarily due to the lesser resources of the Confederate government. A Medical Department was created with the initial army structure by the provisional Confederate government on February 26, 1861. President Jefferson Davis appointed David C. DeLeon Surgeon General. Although a leadership for a medical corp was created, an error by the copyist in the creation of the military regulations of the Confederacy omitted the section for medical officers, and none were mustered into their initial regiments. Many physicians enlisted in the army as privates, and when the error was discovered in April, many of the physicians were pressed into serving as regimental surgeons.Freemon, p. 28 DeLeon had little experience with military medicine, and he and his staff of twenty-five began creating plans to implement army-wide medical standards.Freemon, p. 29 The Confederate government appropriated money to purchase hospitals to serve the army, and the development of field services began after the First Battle of Manassas.Freemon, p. 30 The early hospitals were quickly overrun by wounded, and hundreds had to be sent by train to other southern cities for care following the battle.Freemon, p. 31 As a result of the poor planning, Davis demoted DeLeon and replaced him with Samuel Preston Moore. Moore had more experience than DeLeon and quickly moved to speed the implementation of medical standards. Because many of the surgeons in the regiments had been pressed into service, some were not qualified to be surgeons. Moore began reviewing the surgeons and replacing those found to be inadequate for their duties.Freemon, p. 32 Initially the Confederacy employed a policy of furloughing wounded soldiers to return home for recovery. This was a result of their lack of field hospitals and limited capacity in their general hospitals. In August 1861, the army began the construction of new larger hospitals in several southern cities and the furloughing policy was gradually halted.Freemon, p. 34 The earliest recruits for surgeons were required to bring their own supplies, a practice that was ended during 1862. The government began providing each regiment with a pack with medical supplies including medicines and surgical instruments.Freemon, p. 41 The Confederacy, however, had limited access to medicinal supplies and relied on their blockade-running ships to import needed medicines from Europe, supplies captured from the North or traded with the North through Memphis. Anesthetics were not in as short supply as medical instruments, something highly prized. Field hospitals were set up at the regimental level and located in an open area behind the lines of battle and staffed by two surgeons, one being senior.Freemon, p. 43 It was the responsibility of the regimental surgeons to determine which soldiers could return to duty and which should be sent to the general hospitals. There were no intermediary hospitals, and each regiment was responsible for transporting its wounded to the nearest rail depot, where the injured were transported to the general hospitals for longer term care.Freemon, p. 45 In some of the lengthier battles, buildings were seized to serve as a temporary secondary hospital at a divisional level where the severely wounded could be held. The secondary facilities were staffed by the regimental surgeons, who pooled their resources to care for the wounded and were oversaw by a divisional surgeon.Freemon, p. 46 Ambulance system Ambulance drill being demonstrated at Headquarters Army of Potomac after the Battle of Antietam and the formation of the ambulance corps. (March 1864) Before the formation of any organized ambulance system, a significant amount of Union and Confederate soldiers lost their lives on the battlefield in wait for medical aid. Even if an army were able to overcome the shortage of ambulances, it was really the lack of organization that made it difficult to recover the wounded on the battlefield. In some cases, those who manned the ambulances were corrupt and sought to steal from the ambulance wagon and the wounded passengers while in some situations they even refused to gather hurt soldiers. With an insufficient number of ambulances performing assigned tasks, the wounded looked to their comrades to carry them to safety and in essence this removed many soldiers from the battlefield. Due to the overall lightness of the ambulance the ride was very uncomfortable for wounded soldiers, with the terrain being torn up by shells and explosions the ambulance at times would overturn further harming its passengers. It was obvious that the ambulance system needed work for both the Union and the Confederate armies, yet only the Union would fully prosper in this area with the help of Dr. Jonathan Letterman and the beginning stages of the ambulance corps. Letterman's revolutionary ideas dramatically improved both the ambulance and the ambulance system. With new designs the common Union ambulance was now composed of a 750 lb wagon that was powered by 2‚Äì4 horses and was made to carry 2‚Äì6 wounded soldiers. Other accessories that were standard for the improved ambulances included compartments to store medical supplies, stretchers, water, and even removable benches and seats to adapt to the number of passengers.McGaugh, p.67 Letterman's ideas improved the ambulance system dramatically by setting standards to train the ambulance crew, by having routine ambulance inspections, and also by developing strategical evacuation plans to most efficiently save and transport fallen soldiers.McGaugh, p.88 Letterman's system was so efficient that all wounded soldiers at The Battle of Antietam were removed from the battlefield and sent to care within one day so this new system saved thousands of Union lives.McGaugh, p.106 Soon after The Battle of Antietam began the formation of the ambulance corps and while the Confederates were also working out a similar system their constant shortage of ambulances was not adequate enough to summon such an effective force as even some their ambulances came by capturing Union ambulances.Schroeder-Lein, p.13 Surgery and health outcomes Period painting of a US Civil War soldier, wounded by a Mini√© ball, lies in bed with a gangrenous amputated arm. The most common battlefield injury was being wounded by enemy fire. Unless the wounds were minor, this often led to amputation of limbs to prevent infection from setting in, as antibiotics had not yet been discovered. Amputations had to be made at the point above where the wound occurred, often leaving men with stub limbs. A flap of skin was saved, and stitched to the stump to cover the wound.Freemon, p. 49 There were two types of amputations, primary and secondary. The primary amputation was done between 24‚Äì48 hours after the injury. The secondary amputation was done after a longer period of time, often because of infection. During this time, there were two main methods of amputation, the flap method and circular method. The flap method was typically used when an amputation had to be done quickly. The bone was cut above flaps of skin and muscle, which were pulled together to close the wound. The circular method was a circular cut that only allowed a flap of surface skin to cover the wound. The flap method was more likely than the circular method to lead to gangrene, as the deep muscle tissue suffered from lack of circulation. Approximately 30,000 amputations were performed during the Civil War. Patients were generally sedated prior to a surgical operation. The use of ether as general anesthesia started in 1846 and the use of chloroform in 1847. Contrary to popular belief, few soldiers experienced amputation without any anesthetic. A post-war review by the U.S. Army Medical Department found that over 99.6% of surgeries performed by their staff were conducted under some form of general anesthesia. Surgeons preferred chloroform in field hospitals, while ether was more common relegated to general hospitals well beyond the range of fighting due to its explosive nature. The most popular anesthetic agent was chloroform, accounting for more than 70% of all surgeries in the North according to a study in the Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion. Ether was more commonly used behind the lines because it required a heavier dosage, took longer to induce insensibility, and was highly flammable. In some cases, a blend of ether and chloroform was used to sedate patients. When properly done, the patient would feel no pain during their surgery, but there was no structured system like the modern phases of anesthesia for gauging the proper dosage and depth of a patient's amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. In some cases, patients were insensible to pain, but did not experience amnesia. Stonewall Jackson, for example, recalled the sound of the saw cutting through the bone of his arm, but recalled no pain. Infection was the most common cause of death of injured soldiers.Billings, p. 314Freemon, p. 48 Infection occurred for a variety of reasons. Surgeons would typically go from surgery to surgery without cleaning their equipment or their hands; surgeons would use sponges that they only rinsed in water on multiple patients. These practices caused bacteria to spread from patient to patient, from all surgical surfaces, and from the environment, which caused infections in many. It has been said that the American Civil War was the first \\"modern war\\" in terms of technology and lethality of weapons, but that it was simultaneously fought \\"at the end of the medical Middle Ages.\\" Very little was known about the causes of disease, and so a minor wound could easily become infected and take a life. Battlefield surgeons were underqualified and hospitals were generally poorly supplied and staffed. In fact, there were so many wounded and not enough doctors, so doctors were forced to spend only a little time with each patient. They became proficient at quick care. Some surgeons spent as little as 10 minutes on amputating a limb. The most common battlefield operation was amputation. If a soldier was badly wounded in the arm or leg, amputation was usually the only solution. About 75% of amputees survived the operation. A 2016 research paper found that Civil War surgery was effective at improving patient health outcomes. The study finds that \\"in many cases [surgery] amounted to a doubling of the odds of survival\\". If a wound produced pus, it was thought that it meant the wound was healing, when in fact it meant the injury was infected. Specifically, if the pus was white and thick, the doctors thought it was a good sign. Roughly three in five Union casualties and two in three Confederate casualties died of disease. Women North and South, over 20,000 women volunteered to work in hospitals, usually in nursing care.Jane E. Schultz, \\"The Inhospitable Hospital: Gender and Professionalism in Civil War Medicine,\\" Signs (1992) 17#2 pp. 363-392 in JSTOR They assisted surgeons during procedures, gave medicines, supervised the feedings and cleaned the bedding and clothes.

Dorothea Dix, serving as the commission's Superintendent, was able to convince the medical corps of the value of women working in 350 Commission or army hospitals.Thomas J. Brown, Dorothea Dix: New England Reformer (Harvard U.P. 1998) A representative nurse was Helen L. Gilson (1835‚Äì68) of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who served in Sanitary Commission. She supervised supplies, dressed wounds, and cooked special foods for patients on a limited diet. She worked in hospitals after the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg. She was a successful administrator, especially at the hospital for black soldiers at City Point, Virginia.Edward A. Miller, \\"Angel of light: Helen L.

Our Army Nurses: Stories from Women in the Civil War (1895) excerpts Several thousand women were just as active in nursing in the Confederacy, but were less well organized and faced severe shortages of supplies and a much weaker system of 150 hospitals.

It disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, including the view that global warming is \\"very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas concentrations\\" and asserts that the debate is being driven by what the author regards as irrational and unscientific elements. The book received what The Age newspaper called \\"glowing endorsements\\" from the conservative press. The Australian said it gave \\"all the scientific ammunition climate change skeptics could want.\\" Other reviewers criticised the book as unscientific, inaccurate, based on obsolete research, and internally inconsistent. Ideas in it have been described as \\"so wrong as to be laughable\\". Heaven and Earth was a bestseller in Australia when published in May 2009, and is in its seventh printing, according to the publisher. The book has also been published in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Background  Heaven and Earth is a sequel to a previous work by Plimer called A Short History of Planet Earth. Published in 2001, A Short History was based on a decade's worth of radio broadcasts by Plimer aimed mainly at rural Australians. It became a bestseller and won a Eureka Prize in 2002. However, Plimer was unable to find any major publisher willing to publish his follow-up book. He attributed this to there being \\"a lot of fear out there. No one wants to go against the popular paradigm.\\" Plimer turned to Connor Court Publishing. The company has a history of publishing books on \\"culture, justice and religion\\", including many books on Christianity and Catholicism in particular. It has also published fellow Australian climate change skeptic Garth Paltridge's book, The Climate Caper, which likewise criticises the climate change consensus and the \\"politicisation of science\\". Crikey, an Australian webzine, commented that the publication of Heaven and Earth was a coup for conservatives, and said of the publisher: \\"The conservatives have a new friend in publishing\\". According to Plimer, he wrote Heaven and Earth after being \\"incensed by increasing public acceptance of the idea that humans have caused global warming\\" and set out to \\"knock out every single argument we hear about climate change.\\" Although he does not dispute that climate change is happening, he argues that \\"It's got nothing to do with the atmosphere, it's about what happens in the galaxy\\" and that climate is driven by the sun, the Earth's orbit and plate tectonics rather than the levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Plimer says his book is for the \\"average punter in the street\\" who can \\"smell something is wrong in the climate debate but can't put a finger on what.\\" Critics have regularly questioned Plimer about his commercial interests in the mining industry, but he defends the independence of his views, saying that these commercial interests do not colour his arguments, which are based on pure science. Critics note that Plimer has opposed a carbon trading scheme in Australia, saying that \\"it would probably destroy [the mining industry] totally\\".  Synopsis  In the book, Plimer likens the concept of human- induced climate change to creationism and asserts that it is a \\"fundamentalist religion adopted by urban atheists looking to fill a yawning spiritual gap plaguing the West\\". Environmental groups are claimed to have filled this gap by having a romantic view of a less developed past. The book is critical of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which he claims has allowed \\"little or no geological, archeological or historical input\\" in its analyses. If it had, the book asserts, the IPCC would know cold times lead to dwindling populations, social disruption, extinction, disease and catastrophic droughts, while warm times lead to life blossoming and economic booms ‚Äì suggesting that global warming, whether or not caused by humans, should be welcomed. The book is critical of political efforts to address climate change and argues that extreme environmental changes are inevitable and unavoidable. Meteorologists have a huge amount to gain from climate change research, the book claims, and they have narrowed the climate change debate to the atmosphere, whereas the truth is more complex. Money would be better directed to dealing with problems as they occur rather than making expensive and futile attempts to prevent climate change. The book differs from the scientific consensus in contending that the Great Barrier Reef will benefit from rising seas, that there is no correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperature, and that 98% of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapour. In the book, Plimer asserts that the current theory of human-induced global warming is not in accord with history, archaeology, geology or astronomy and must be rejected, that promotion of this theory as science is fraudulent, and that the current alarm over climate change is the result of bad science. He argues that climate models focus too strongly on the effects of carbon dioxide, rather than factoring in other issues such as solar variation, the effect of clouds, and unreliable temperature measurements.  Reception and criticism  Heaven and Earth received substantial coverage in the Australian and international media. It produced a highly polarised response from reviewers, with members of the conservative press praising the book and many scientists criticising it. A Wall Street Journal columnist called the book \\"a damning critique\\" of the theory of man-made global warming, while the Guardian writer and activist George Monbiot listed some of the book's errors with the comment: \\"Seldom has a book been more cleanly murdered by scientists than Ian Plimer's Heaven and Earth, which purports to show that manmade climate change is nonsense. Since its publication in Australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors, and its fudging and manipulation of the data.\\" = Reactions from scientists = Canadian broadcaster John Moore said it was \\"widely criticised by fellow scientists as just another collection of denier hits.\\" The Adelaide Advertiser stated that among other scientists, \\"Plimer is all but out in the cold\\". Barry Brook of Adelaide University's Research Institute for Climate Change and Sustainability, who is at the same university as Plimer and has debated climate change issues with him, described the book as a case study \\"in how not to be objective\\" and accused Plimer of using \\"selective evidence\\". Brook said that Plimer's \\"stated view of climate science is that a vast number of extremely well respected scientists and a whole range of specialist disciplines have fallen prey to delusional self- interest and become nothing more than unthinking ideologues. Plausible to conspiracy theorists, perhaps, but hardly a sane world view, and insulting to all those genuinely committed to real science.\\" He said that Plimer's assertions about man's role in climate change were \\"naive, reflected a poor understanding of climate science, and relied on recycled and distorted arguments that had been repeatedly refuted.\\" Brook also suggested that many of the scientific authors cited by Plimer actually support the consensus view and that their work is misrepresented in Plimer's book. Susannah Eliott, the chief executive of the Australian Science Media Centre, encouraged colleagues to read the book and comment on it, but took the view that \\"there isn't anything new in there, they are all old arguments\\". Many reviewers highlighted factual and sourcing problems in Heaven and Earth. Colin Woodroffe, a coastal geomorphologist at the University of Wollongong, and a lead chapter author for the IPCC AR4, wrote that the book has many errors and will be \\"remembered for the confrontation it provokes rather than the science it stimulates.\\" Woodroffe noted Plimer's \\"unbalanced approach to the topic,\\" and concluded that the book was not written as a contribution to any scientific debate, and was evidently not aimed at a scientific audience. Charlie Veron, former chief scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said every original statement Plimer makes in the book on coral and coral reefs is incorrect, and that Plimer \\"serve[s] up diagrams from no acknowledged source, diagrams known to be obsolete and diagrams that combine bits of science with bits of fiction.\\" David Karoly, an atmospheric dynamicist at Melbourne University and a lead author for the IPCC, accused Plimer of misusing data in the book and commented that \\"it doesn't support the answers with sources.\\" Karoly reviewed the book and concluded: \\"Given the errors, the non-science, and the nonsense in this book, it should be classified as science fiction in any library that wastes its funds buying it. The book can then be placed on the shelves alongside Michael Crichton's State of Fear, another science fiction book about climate change with many footnotes. The only difference is that there are fewer scientific errors in State of Fear.\\" Ian G. Enting, a mathematical physicist at MASCOS, University of Melbourne and author of Twisted, The Distorted Mathematics of Greenhouse Denial, similarly criticised what he described as numerous misrepresentations of the sources cited in the book and charged that Plimer \\"fails to establish his claim that the human influence on climate can be ignored, relative to natural variation.\\" Enting compiled a list of over 100 errors in the book. Michael Ashley, an astronomer at the University of New South Wales, criticised the book at length in a review for The Australian in which he characterised the book as \\"largely a collection of contrarian ideas and conspiracy theories that are rife in the blogosphere. The writing is rambling and repetitive; the arguments flawed and illogical.\\" He accused Plimer of having \\"done an enormous disservice to science, and the dedicated scientists who are trying to understand climate and the influence of humans, by publishing this book. It is not \\"merely\\" atmospheric scientists that would have to be wrong for Plimer to be right. It would require a rewriting of biology, geology, physics, oceanography, astronomy and statistics. Plimer's book deserves to languish on the shelves along with similar pseudo-science such as the writings of Immanuel Velikovsky and Erich von D√§niken.\\" Malcolm Walter, the Director of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology, University of New South Wales, commented on Plimer's \\"fallacious reasoning,\\" noting the \\"blatant and fundamental contradictions\\" and inconsistencies in the book. Walter told ABC Radio National that Plimer's interpretation of the literature is confused and that Plimer \\"bit off more than he can chew.\\" According to Walter, \\"reviewing this book has been an unpleasant experience for me. I have been a friendly colleague of Plimer's for 25 years or more. ... But..., in my opinion, he has done a disservice to science and to the community at large.\\" On the same network, geophysicist Kurt Lambeck, currently president of the Australian Academy of Science, said that the book was \\"sloppy\\" and that it \\"is not a work of science; it is an opinion of an author who happens to be a scientist.\\" Chris Turney, a researcher of prehistoric climate changes, of the University of Exeter's Department of Geography, stated the book was \\"a cacophony of climate skeptic arguments that have been discredited by decades of research.\\" He described the number of errors in the book as \\"disturbingly high\\": \\"statements that are at best ambiguous and in many cases plain wrong are repeated, figures purporting to demonstrate climate change is all natural are erroneous, time and spatial scales are mixed up . . . the list goes on.\\" Turney comments that Plimer \\"badly mistreats\\" the history of the development of climate science, \\"regurgitating\\" the fringe idea of global cooling to portray \\"recent concerns over warming [as] just another case of alarmism.\\" He concludes that \\"Plimer's thesis of inaction is a course we follow at our peril.\\" Writing in Earth magazine, emeritus USGS geologist Terry Gerlach commented that the book \\"illustrates one of the pathways by which myths, misrepresentations and spurious information get injected into the climate change debate.\\" He highlighted Plimer's inaccurate claims about volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide and noted that Plimer had failed to provide estimates of present-day global carbon dioxide emission rate from volcanoes. In Gerlach's view, this was ironic considering that the book professes to provide the \\"missing science\\" on climate change. Retired meteorologist William Kininmonth, a long- standing critic of climate change theory, supported the book in a commentary published in The Australian in which he wrote that \\"Plimer's authoritative book provides the excuse and impetus to re-examine the scientific fundamentals [of climate change].\\" The scientists' criticisms were rejected by Plimer, who embarked on a lecture tour following the book's publication in a bid to lobby the Australian government to change its policies on climate change to reflect what he called \\"valid science\\". He said that he had predicted that \\"The science would not be discussed, there would be academic nit-picking and there would be vitriolic ad hominem attacks by pompous academics out of contact with the community\\" and asserted that \\"comments by critics suggest that few have actually read the book and every time there was a savage public personal attack, book sales rose.\\" = Media reactions = Plimer's book has received \\"glowing endorsements in the conservative press\\" according to Adam Morton of The Age. Christopher Pearson, a columnist with the conservative broadsheet The Australian, served as master of ceremonies at the book's launch and hailed it as a \\"campaign document\\" for climate change skeptics that \\"contains all the scientific ammunition they could want, packed into 493 eloquent pages.\\" Sydney Morning Herald conservative commentator Miranda Devine called the book \\"a comprehensive scientific refutation of the beliefs underpinning the idea of human-caused climate change\\" and wrote that \\"Plimer's book, accessible as it is to the layperson, will help redress the power imbalance between those who claim to own the knowledge and the rest of us.\\" Paul Sheehan, a conservative commentator from The Sydney Morning Herald, asserted that \\"Ian Plimer is not some isolated gadfly. He is a prize-winning scientist and professor.\\" Sheehan continued, calling the book \\"an evidence-based attack on conformity and orthodoxy, including my own, and a reminder to respect informed dissent and beware of ideology subverting evidence.\\" The Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel called it \\"a damning critique\\" of the theory of man-made global warming and credited Plimer with sparking an \\"era of renewed enlightenment\\". The Spectator, a conservative British magazine, made the book the cover story of its 11 July 2009 issue. In Canada, Rex Murphy of The Globe and Mail recommended Heaven and Earth as \\"a wonderfully comprehensive and fearless book.\\" London-based banker Lakshman Menon wrote in the Leisure section of the Business Standard of India that \\"if [the book] kickstarts an honest debate about climate change, Heaven And Earth will have performed an important service.\\" Leigh Dayton, science writer for The Australian, expressed dismay at Plimer for having \\"boarded the denialist ark\\" and described his arguments, such as his claims that scientists had been playing along with the view of human-induced climate change \\"in order to keep the research dollars flowing\\", as \\"a load of old codswallop\\". Dayton criticised Plimer's \\"shaky assumptions\\" and \\"misinformation\\", describing his assertion that the IPCC's scientists \\"whip up scary agenda-driven scenarios\\" as \\"fanciful\\". In The Times, Bob Ward called the book an angry, bitter and error-strewn polemic. He said that Plimer \\"uses geology as an excuse to conclude the opposite of mainstream climate science\\", and that it is \\"hard to work out how and why he managed to produce such a controversial and flawed account.\\" The Australian's coverage of Heaven and Earth attracted criticism from Robert Manne, a lecturer on politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, who criticised the \\"gushing praise\\" given the book. Manne deplored the willingness of The Australian to \\"give books such as [Plimer's] the kind of enthusiastic welcome hundreds of others published in this country every year cannot dream of receiving\\", calling this \\"a grave intellectual, political and moral mistake\\". Similarly, George Monbiot criticised The Spectator for featuring Heaven and Earth as a cover story, calling it \\"one of the gravest misjudgments in journalism this year\\" since \\"a quick check would have shown that [the book is] utter nonsense\\". Lawrence Solomon of Canada's Financial Post commented that \\"Thanks to Plimer, the press and politicians, Australia is likely to become the developed world‚Äôs third Denier Nation\\" behind the Czech Republic and the United States. = Other reactions = V√°clav Klaus, former president of the Czech Republic and an economist, recommended Heaven and Earth in a blurb on the dust jacket: \\"This is a very powerful, clear, understandable and extremely useful book.\\" His endorsement was in response to Plimer's request for the backing of \\"the big guns\\", which Plimer asserts is indicative of \\"a great body of extremely clever and well-known people out there that do not agree with the Chicken Little arguments that are being put up.\\" George Pell, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, wrote in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper that Heaven and Earth was \\"likely to make a huge difference to public opinion\\" and defended Plimer from charges of being a climate change \\"denier\\" because \\"history shows the planet is dynamic and the climate is always changing.\\" The Archbishop concluded that Plimer's evidence \\"shows the wheels are falling from the climate catastrophe bandwagon.\\" Former Australian Federal Representative and pro-mining maverick Graeme Campbell has sought to use the book to get \\"the other side of the debate\\" on climate change into schools. In June 2009, Campbell gave copies of Heaven and Earth to every school in his home town of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Senator Steve Fielding of the conservative Family First Party has also stated that his views on climate change have been influenced by Plimer and his book. Lyn Allison, leader of the Australian Democrats from 2004 to 2008, called Plimer the \\"pet denialist\\" of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, and accused Plimer of \\"happily cashing in on his speaking tours and his book\\".
