Originally called the Nautical College of Nigeria, it was established in 1979 to educate and train shipboard officers, ratings and shore-based management personnel. The first batch of cadets graduated in 1983. In 1988 the college's mandate was expanded to training all levels and categories of personnel for all facets of the Nigerian maritime industry. By the end of 2008, the academy had trained about 4,300 Nigerian Merchant Navy officers and more than 65,000 other workers in marine operations. The academy has an active alumni association, helping members to keep in touch and assist each other, as well as promoting improvements to standards for cadet training. The current management team of the martime academy as at may 2020 include: :* Commodore Duja Emmanuel Effedua DSS, MSS, MoSS, ndc, psc+(Rtd) - Rector :* Mr. Netson Peter M. - Ag. Registrar :* Dr. Kevin O. Okonna - Director, Specialized Seafarers Training Courses :* Engr. Innocent C. Ezeala - Ag. Director, School of Marine Engineering :* Capt. Gabriel E. Okwu - Ag.

Director, Strategy, Research & Development :* Dr. John A. Adeyanyu - Coordinator Academic Affairs :* Okon O. Bassey - Ag. Bursar :* Engr. Babawale O. Ogunsola - Ag. Director, Work and Services Facilities The academy occupies a large area of land on the waterfront in Oron, close to the Cross River approaches of the Port of Calabar in Cross River State and about 200 Kilometres from Port Harcourt, Rivers State. In April 2003, President Olusegun Obasanjo directed that work should start on construction of a jetty for the academy. In February 2010 Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) said it had donated N30 million of safety training equipment to the academy. The equipment included a totally enclosed 50-person lifeboat, a davit-launched rescue boat and a twelve-person life-raft. NLNG had previously donated equipment worth over N100 million, and uses Nigerians from the academy for 60% of its crews. However, graduates of the Maritime Academy do not have access to oceangoing vessels for them to earn hours at sea, which is required for their professional qualification. Demand and capacity The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has said that 50,000 seafarers are needed for the Nigerian shipping industry to realise its full potential. As of 2009, Nigeria had less than 3,000 seafarers. About 2,000 vessels were engaged in cabotage, or local trade between Nigerian ports, with mostly foreign crews. Announcing plans to open a new academy at Badagry, the head of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency said in 2008 that over 3,000 students apply each year for admission to the Oron-based academy but less than 1,000 are accepted. In October 2009 the academy's rector explained that the academy had to restrict the number of students admitted due to shortage of classrooms and accommodations. He denied bias in admission, and said the academy in fact made it easier for candidates from disadvantaged states to gain admission. Courses In April 2008 a delegation from the Norwegian ship owners' association visited the academy and discussed a collaborative training programme with the academy. In October 2008 the Minister of State for Transport, Prince John Okechkwu Emeka, said the academy would soon be upgraded to become a degree-awarding institution. He also called for increased funding from the Federal government. Quality of training In May 2009 the academy was subject to severe criticism by the director of Lagos Channel Management. He said that even the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency had found that the academy did not meet international standards. Problems included lack of adequate teaching facilities to handle the number of students, and unavailability of seafaring vessels on which students could complete their mandatory one-year sea term. Students seeking proper training had to attend the Regional Maritime University in Accra, Ghana. Captain Thomas Kemewerighe, a graduate of the academy, said Nigeria does not have people qualified to provide proper training. He said most of the graduates ended up as \\"okada riders\\" (motorbike taxi operators). In September 2009 the government announced that a project launched by the Federal Ministry of Transport, the Nigerian Seafarers Development Programme, would send a first batch of 27 students to the Academy of Maritime Education and Training in India to study for Bachelor in Science and Bachelor in Engineering degrees in marine-related subjects. The academy was not considered for this programme. Other issues In August 2009 three human rights groups petitioned President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua to investigate alleged cases of corruption and financial malpractices at the academy. They also claimed that 43 students had died in avoidable circumstances in the past year.

Founded in 1964 by the late Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin, with 35 families, the congregation grew rapidly. At various times in its history it has been stated to be the largest, or one of the largest, Jewish congregations in the world, at one time having a membership of about 3,000 families, six rabbis, two cantors and two cantorial interns, and four schools on three campuses. As of 1994 it was the second-largest synagogue in the United States. The community was founded as the Stephen S. Wise Temple. In 2014 it was renamed the Stephen Wise Temple. History Rabbi Zeldin was raised in New York City, the son of an Orthodox rabbi. Ordained at the Reform movement's Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1946, he came to Los Angeles in 1953 as western regional director for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) and as dean of the College of Jewish Studies in Los Angeles, a UAHC program that was absorbed into Hebrew Union College in 1954. In 1958 he became rabbi at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills. In 1964 Zeldin and 35 families broke away from Temple Emanuel to establish a new synagogue in Westwood. The new congregation was named for the influential Reform rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise, under whom Zeldin had studied. The new congregation faced immediate controversy as the UAHC felt that some of its members had failed to honor existing commitments to Temple Emanuel, and the UAHC did not accept it for membership for the first five years of its existence. The new congregation was intended to have a membership limited in size to maintain intimacy between the rabbi and the member families, and it met at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Westwood. A year later, the congregation acquired a site for a permanent home; the size limit policy was changed in 1969; and in 1970, Stephen Wise Temple absorbed the existing Westwood Temple, whose membership had been declining, in part due to disruption from the construction of the San Diego Freeway. The temple's location, on a striking site in Bel Air, near Mulholland Drive and Sepulveda Boulevard, contributed to its continuing growth and success. The location, in the Santa Monica Mountains between the Westside and the San Fernando Valley, meant that the temple could attract membership from the growing Jewish population on both sides of the mountains. In order to develop the property, the temple was required to remove of the existing mountain; the resulting dirt was then used to level the adjoining property, which was acquired for the new campus of the University of Judaism, then located on Sunset Boulevard. The wild area around the Sepulveda Pass eventually developed into an \\"institutional corridor\\" with a number of schools and cultural facilities, including the temple's expanding educational ventures, which came to include Stephen S. Wise Temple Elementary School and a pre-school (now collectively called Wise School), and Milken Community High School. (On March 25, 2011, Milken Community High School and Stephen S. Wise Temple announced that the school would become independent from the temple, effective July 1, 2012.) The congregation became known for its extensive educational and service programs, parenting center, library, swimming pool, bus service, and other services designed for families at all stages. Under the leadership of Rabbi Zeldin and its education director, Metuka Benjamin, the temple was an influential proponent of the concept of the Jewish day school in the Reform movement. The temple and its cantor, Nathan Lam, also maintained an extensive program of commissioning new musical works. The religious practice at Stephen S. Wise Temple has been described as more traditional than at many Reform temples, as it uses its own prayer books rather than the official books of the Reform movement. In 1995 the temple again faced controversy in its relationship with the UAHC: a dispute over dues obligations resulted in its expulsion from the organization for a time. As of 2010, the congregational database of the Union for Reform Judaism (as the UAHC is now known) stated that Stephen Wise Temple had 2,886 members, which was more than any other congregation in the database; as of February 2012, the database reported Wise had 2,312 members, still among the largest congregations but smaller than several others. In 1990, Rabbi Zeldin retired from his duties as Senior Rabbi and was succeeded by Rabbi Eli Herscher, who remained Senior Rabbi until 2015. At that time, Rabbi Herscher became Senior Rabbi Emeritus and was succeeded by Rabbi Yoshi Zweiback. Rabbi Zeldin died in 2018 at age 97.Tom Tugend, \\"Stephen Wise Temple Founder, Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin, dies at 97\\", The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, January 27, 2018.

It is one of two hydropathic hotels left in Scotland, the other being Crieff Hydro in Perthshire. The hotel opened in 1881, but burnt down and was rebuilt in 1907. It served as a hospital for injured service personnel during the First World War before reverting to hotel use. Peebles Hydro is a category B listed building, and is still operated as a hotel. History Peebles Hydro was designed in 1878 by John Starforth.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200348 It opened by the Hydropathic Company in 1881 to provide water cures and hydrotherapy remedies (pain-relief and treating illness) to guests. It was one of many such hotels built in Britain during the second half of the 19th century. It was near to two railway stations: Peebles West railway station of the Caledonian Railway, later London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and Peebles East of the North British Railway, later London and North Eastern Railway. It began building in 1878. Work was completed early in 1881 at a cost of over ¬£70,000. The architect was John Starforth (1828-1898), a pupil of David Bryce. The Hydro burnt down in July 1905 and was rebuilt by 1907, a building designed by the architect James Miller of Edinburgh, at a more moderate cost of ¬£37,000 owing to the use of salvaged materials. During the Second World War it was turned into a hospital, the 23rd (Scottish) General Hospital T.A. with 1,200 beds. The cast of the 1970 film Tam-Lin including its star Ava Gardner, and cast members Joanna Lumley and Stephanie Beecham stayed in the hotel while filming on location at Traquair House. It was taken over by Crieff Hydro in February 2014. Treatments and regime When it first opened, the following baths and treatments were offered: Russian, Turkish, peat, Nauheim, aromatic, medicated, eucalyptus, rain, pine extract, spray, vapour, brine or sulphur baths. Many associated treatments were available: vibration- massage, the Oertel or Terrain cure, the sun and air bath, a nebular, Metchnikoff's sour milk treatment, the Johann Schroth diet, the grape cure, the Salisbury system, a high-protein weight loss diet using Salisbury Steak or the Koumiss cure. As at Crieff Hydro there were outdoor recreations, from otter hunting to tennis, shooting, croquet and cycling, and a wide range of activities for inclement weather and the evenings. Guests were encouraged to bring their musical instruments.

The region is dominated by a humid continental climate, characterized by hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Topography The Scioto River flows beside downtown Columbus According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 212.6 square miles (550.5 km¬≤), of which, 210.3 square miles (544.6 km¬≤) of it is land and 2.3 square miles (5.9 km¬≤) of it (1.07%) is water. Unlike many other major US cities in the Midwest, Columbus continues to expand its reach by way of extensions and annexations, making it one of the fastest growing large cities in the nation, in terms of both geography and population, and probably the fastest in the Midwest. While Columbus' suburban population is not as large as Ohio's other two large metro areas, (Cleveland and Cincinnati), due to its annexation policies, it is almost entirely ringed by suburbs, and it even has some land-locked suburbs which are completely surrounded by Columbus' city limits. Some of Columbus' largest suburbs are Westerville, Gahanna, Reynoldsburg, Grove City, Upper Arlington, Hilliard and Dublin. Since the 1950s the city has made annexation a condition for providing water and sewer service, to which it holds regional rights throughout a large portion of central Ohio. This policy is credited with preserving Columbus' tax base in the face of the U.S.'s suburbanization and has contributed to its continued economic expansion, much like other cities pursuing similar policies such as San Antonio, Texas. The confluence of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers occurs just west of downtown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through the Columbus metro area, including Alum Creek, Big Walnut Creek, and Darby Creek. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat topography thanks to a large glacier that covered most of Ohio during the Wisconsin Ice Age. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being 1132 ft (345 m) above sea level near New Albany, and the low point being 670 ft (207 m) where the Scioto River leaves the county near Lockbourne. Numerous ravine areas near the rivers and creeks also help give some variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone. Deciduous trees are common, including maple, oak, hickory, walnut, poplar, cottonwood, and of course, buckeye. Columbus is geographically very close to many major cities. It has a driving distance of less than four hours from Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Lexington, Louisville, Pittsburgh, and Toledo. Likewise, Chicago, Milwaukee, Nashville, New York City, Washington, DC, St Louis, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Philadelphia are all within a day's drive of the city. Climate The city has, depending on definition, a humid continental or humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa or Cfa) characterized by hot, muggy summers and cold, comparatively dry winters, and lies in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6. January averages , while July averages . Spring and autumn are mild and wet, but the latter is usually drier. The annual mean is . On average, temperatures reach on 18 days of the year and on 2.9 nights, while the first freeze occurs on October 23 and the last on April 19. The annual precipitation of peaks, but not strongly so, in the latter half of spring and then summer; July is the wettest month while February is the driest. Passing cold fronts in winter frequently produce snow that is occasionally heavy, with a seasonal average of . On average, the first date of measurable, i.e. totalling or more, snowfall is November 21 and the last March 31, with falls in October quite rare. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Columbus was , which occurred twice during the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s ‚Äî once on July 21, 1934, and again two years later, on July 14, 1936.Records for Columbus. National Weather Service. Retrieved on 2008-11-16. The coldest temperature ever recorded was , occurring on January 19, 1994. The highest daily minimum temperature was on January 10, 1881, and conversely, the lowest daily maximum was on February 9, 1899. Columbus is subject to severe weather typical to the Midwestern United States. Severe thunderstorms producing tornadoes are possible from the spring to the fall, the most recent of which occurred on October 11, 2006 and caused F2 damage. Floods and blizzards can also occur from time to time. Cityscape Columbus also has a number of distinctive neighborhoods within the metro area. The Short North, situated just north of downtown, is rich with art galleries, dining, pubs, and specialty shops. A number of large, ornate Victorian homes are located nearby, and together they comprise Victorian Village. Just to the west is Harrison West and across the Olentangy River is Grandview Heights. To the south, German Village is known for its quaint 19th- century brick cottages, and it holds the distinction as the largest privately funded historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Immediately west is the Brewery District, formerly an entertainment district which has seen a decrease in bars and an increase in residential and office development. To the east of Downtown north of Broad St. is King-Lincoln Bronzeville, or just \\"King-Lincoln\\", which was the cultural and commercial hub of the African-American community. South of Broad and also east of King Lincoln is Olde Towne East, which was a well-to-do streetcar neighborhood consisting of grand homes in a wide variety of architectural styles. Most of these neighborhoods have all undergone gentrification on a large scale. Franklinton, sometimes known as \\"the Bottoms\\", is the neighborhood immediately west of downtown. Just to the west of Franklinton is a group of smaller neighborhoods collectively known as The Hilltop. At the north end of downtown is a new development/neighborhood, the Arena District. Centered around the Nationwide Arena, the district has many pubs, restaurants, and residential projects, most notably the new 20-story Condominiums at North Bank Park tower. The Lifestyle Communities Pavilion is also an anchor for the district and the recently completed Huntington Ballpark has become the new home of the Columbus Clippers minor league baseball team. There are also the Heritage Districts, which include the Driving Park, Livingston Park and Old Oaks areas on the near east side of the city, home to a part of the city's large black population. The University area is populated by a high concentration of students during the school year (approximately 60,000) and features many old homes which have been converted to apartments for student use. The stretch of High Street that runs through the campus area caters to the student body with its abundance of bars, sandwich shops, music stores, and bookstores. Located between OSU and Worthington is Clintonville, where a mix of middle class homes can be found alongside beautiful old stone and brick-faced houses nestled among rolling hills. Further west of downtown, San Margherita is a community formed by Italian immigrants who arrived at the turn of the 20th century. Transportation Lane Avenue Bridge, University District =Grid and address system= The city's street plan originates downtown and extends into the old- growth neighborhoods, following a grid pattern with the intersection of High Street (running north‚Äìsouth) and Broad Street (running east‚Äìwest) at its center. North‚Äìsouth streets run twelve degrees west of due North, parallel to High Street; the Avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, etc.) run east‚Äìwest.Moore, p. 127 The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered Avenues begin with First Avenue, about 1¬º mile north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered Streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about one mile (along the same street). For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately one- half mile west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north‚Äìsouth streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes ‚ÄòN‚Äô and ‚ÄòS‚Äô indicate whether that distance is to measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High. Locations of numbered streets and avenues This street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east‚Äìwest, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north‚Äìsouth, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north‚Äìsouth, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non- numbered streets run east‚Äìwest, perpendicular to High Street. The addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders. Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road (SR-161), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road (SR-3), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue. =Highways= Columbus is bisected by two major Interstate Highways, Interstate 70 running east‚Äìwest, and Interstate 71 running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in an area locally known as \\"The Split\\", which is a major traffic congestion point within Columbus, especially during rush hour. U.S. Route 40, aka National Road, runs east‚Äìwest through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. U.S. Route 23 runs roughly north‚Äìsouth, while U.S. Route 33 runs northwest-to-southeast. The Interstate 270 Outerbelt encircles the vast majority of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the Interstate 670 spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), State Route 315 on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2-hour drive of Columbus. =Airports= The area has several airports, most notably Port Columbus International Airport on the east side of the city. Port Columbus provides service to a few foreign and dozens of domestic destinations, including all the major hubs except Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. Port Columbus was a hub for discount carrier Skybus Airlines and is for NetJets, the world's largest fractional ownership air carrier. Rickenbacker International Airport, in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility and is important to the Ohio Air National Guard. OSU Don Scott Airport and Bolton Field are significant general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area. =Rail= Columbus used to have a major train station downtown called Union Station, most notably as a stop along Amtrak's National Limited train service until 1977. The station itself was razed in 1979, and the Greater Columbus Convention Center now stands in its place. The station was also a stop along the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. Columbus is now the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. without passenger rail service, after Phoenix introduced a light-rail system in December 2008; however studies are underway towards reintroducing passenger rail service to Columbus via the Ohio Hub project. A streetcar was planned in Downtown Columbus, and there was a plan for light rail service between downtown and the Polaris area. Plans to open a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and Cleveland were eliminated after Governor John Kasich was elected into office.Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail Retrieved 26 july 2009. =Bus= Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). =Bicycle= Bicycling as transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population, and off-road bike paths. The city has recently put forth the 2012 Bicentennial Bikeways Plan as well as a move toward a Complete Streets policy. Grassroots efforts such as Bike To Work Week, Consider Biking, Yay Bikes, Third Hand Bicycle Co-op, Franklinton Cycleworks, and Cranksters, a local radio program focused on urban cycling, have contributed to cycling as transportation. Columbus also hosts urban cycling \\"off-shots\\" with messenger-style \\"alleycat\\" races as well as unorganized group rides, a monthly Critical Mass ride, bicycle polo, art showings, movie nights, and a variety of bicycle-friendly businesses and events throughout the year. All this activity occurs despite Columbus's lack of on-road cycling lanes and frequently inclement weather.

It is the remake of the 2007 Marathi film, Jau Tithe Khau. It was based on three short stories: Narsaiyyan Ki Bavdi by Jeelani Bano, Phulwa Ka Pul by Sanjeev and Still Waters by Jayant Kripalani.http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/mind-matters/591784/0 The screenplay was written by Jayant Kripalani and Ashok Mishra, who also wrote the dialogues.Writers IMDb. It won the 2009 National Film Award for Best Film on Social Issues. Plot The film tells the story of Armaan Ali (Boman Irani), a Muslim driver working in Mumbai, who takes a one-month leave from his employer to find a groom for his daughter Muskaan (Minissha Lamba), who lives in a village near Hyderabad, India. Armaan does not turn up for three months, and his employer makes the difficult decision to sack him, but he asks his boss to listen to why he could not come. Getting soft, his employer allows him to drive to Pune where he has a meeting. Armaan starts the story from here. In Armaan's village, many problems include a rising drought situation and financial difficulties due to the antics of his twin brother, who has a bad reputation for debt addiction and theft. In the opening, a man named Arif demands 500 rupees from Armaan. Eventually, Muskaan pays the debt to Arif and Armaan's brother is arrested, later on released. To solve the drought problem, he goes to a government office to build a well, with a friend. There, he goes through stages such as explaining what he wants and even having his photo taken. Muskaan, on the other hand falls in love with Arif, of which Armaan does not approve at first but later is pleased with. Armaan does not receive the well he wanted and sits in despair. He and Muskaan try to tell the police inspector about the well that was 'stolen', but the inspector finds the story rather silly and is even stubborn enough to not listen to what they have to say. Disturbed, Armaan and Muskaan launch a protest with several villagers against the police inspector, later on to the justice minister, where the minister punishes the inspector for his slack behaviour. The inspector, realising his mistakes and behaviour, then starts to approach the people in a more orthodox way. The justice minister then allows the government people to build the well for the villagers and punishes them all, for not doing what they are supposed to do. With the drought problem solved, Armaan decides that Muskaan should marry an Arab sheikh. Muskaan does not accept her father's offer and even has an argument about this. The issue is even more heated when she receives a letter from her friend, Sakina, which involved her getting beat up by her sheikh husband and getting kicked out, shocking Armaan and Sakina's mother. Disturbed, Armaan then decides that Muskaan should marry Arif, much to her delight. With the two of Armaan's problems solved, he ends his story at an awards ceremony, which in his perspective was a 'big drama', as the stage literally collapsed, delighting people. With his employer convinced, he then allows Armaan to work for him again.

In the United States and Canada, the Bell System network topology was the switching system hierarchy implemented and operated from the late 1940s to the 1980s for the purpose of integrating the diverse array of local telephone companies and telephone numbering plans to achieve nationwide Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) by telephone subscribers. It was the precursor of the world-wide interconnected public switched telephone network (PSTN). The ideas originated in the Bell System in the United States, but were soon adopted by other countries where telephone operators were facing similar issues, even when service smaller geographic areas. The system in the United Kingdom implemented by the General Post Office resulted in fewer switching levels than the Bell System. Bell System AT&T; PSTN central office classification hierarchy In the late 1940s the Bell System devised plans to consolidate the various incompatible local telephone numbering plans of its constituent service areas into a unified network, that later became known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). This was a prerequisite to achieve Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) by customers, first implemented in Englewood, New Jersey in 1951. In addition to devising a unified numbering plan, AT&T; reorganized the nationwide system that was spearheaded by AT&T; Long Lines of local telephone exchanges and central offices into a hierarchical network containing five levels, called classes, of switching systems. As long-distance calling was originally established, it could take up to seven minutes to complete a connection to another major city, and small points would need to have call back appointments made with long lead times for circuits to be reserved. The newly devised hierarchy was maintained into the early 1980s, when technological advances and business models rendered it increasingly obsolete, but the hierarchical features live on in terms, such as Class 4 and Class 5 telephone switch, referring to tandem and end-office switches, respectively. The PSTN in the United States was essentially restructured with the 1984 divestiture of AT&T.; The old Long Lines network remained with AT&T;, but its internal routing became non-hierarchical with the introduction of advanced computer-controlled switching. Each major long-distance carrier can have its own internal routing policies, though they generally start with the same principles and even components. With Bell System divestiture, the network in the US was divided into local access and transport areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by interexchange carriers (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect end office switches. While the following discussion refers to AT&T; and (principally) to the United States, it is important to remember that until 1975, AT&T; controlled Bell Canada and thus influenced corporate decisions north of the border. Bell Canada provided local operations in most of Ontario and Quebec, and both in its capacity as the largest telecommunications carrier in Canada and because of its historic operations in the Atlantic and Prairie provinces, dominated decisions over long-distance practices. Canadian authorities agreed that integration of Canadian long-distance services into a trans-national network was valuable to both countries, so that U.S. and Canadian services were integrated for networking capabilities at an early stage into what eventually became the foundation for the North American Numbering Plan area. By the mid-1920s, a revised manual system where \\"local\\" toll operators connected tandem routes (a process formally called Combined Line and Recording) as needed to complete telephone calls, reduced the process to an average of two minutes, but still meant that some complex routing might interconnect as many as sixteen points. As long-distance services grew in the Contiguous Continental US (48 states) and Canada, the amount of overhead equipment and people required to determine and establish Rates and Routes became excessive. As technology improved, network design included consideration of more automated and defined procedures. Thus, beginning with a switch installed in Philadelphia PA in 1943, AT&T; began to automate the system, and establish a new switch hierarchy, which lasted until the breakup of AT&T; in the 1980s. The underlying principle of the five-level hierarchy was to provide economies of scale by establishing direct connections between centralized call \\"collection points\\" (essentially the Class 4 offices) where economically feasible, and to provide additional concentration points (Class 1 through 3) to handle overflow traffic that could not be handled directly, or to handle traffic to locations which were less likely to be dialed from a given point - usually longer distances and/or smaller locations in other parts of the North American dialing plan. The North American plan differed from those of other continents in the existence of three concentration levels of hierarchy for domestic (here defined as including all those points \\"within\\" the dialing plan) calls, a need not required where the larger geographic area was broken into several national plan jurisdictions. However, it is important to note that this was not a strict hierarchy of absolute levels. If enough call traffic existed between geographic areas, for example, a Class 4 office could have direct trunk connections not only to a Class 3 office, but to a Class 2 or Class 1 office, and vice versa. For example, the Class 2 switch in Toronto (TOROON0101T2) had connections not only to the Class 1 switch in Montr√©al (MTRLPQ0201T1), but to the Class 1 switch in White Plains (WHPLNY0201T1), one of the Class 2 switches in New York City (NYCMNYAA02T2) and a Class 3 switch in Buffalo (BFLONYFR04T3). Network engineers re-worked the system as necessary to balance off call completion percentages with budgetary limitations. In fact, minor changes were made almost every month. Initially excluded from the development of the North American network were locations that eventually would become part of the North American Numbering Plan Area - Alaska, Hawaii, some other United States possessions, various outlying Northern and rural portions of Canada, and much of the Caribbean. These areas were handled as International Calls until more advanced computer hardware and software allowed them to be included in the automated, integrated systems in later decades. After the spread of stored program control switching, many services of Class 1 through 3 could be delegated to newer switches in the class 4 and 5 offices, and that portion of the network became obsolete, although it was partially replaced by the establishment of multiple long-distance carrier networks, connected to the local networks through their points of presence. =Class 1 (regional center)= The class 1 office was the Regional Center (RC). Regional centers served three purposes in the North American toll network (a) their connections were the \\"last resort\\" for final setup of calls when routes between centers lower in the hierarchy were not available (b) they were initially staffed by engineers who had the authority to block portions of the network within the region in case of emergencies or network congestion - although these functions were transferred after 1962 to the Network Control/Operations Center and the distributed Network Management Centers (see below) (c) they provided collection points (until the development of more advanced computer hardware and software for toll operators) for circuits that would be passed along to one of the international overseas gateways (which operated as special centers outside the formal North American hierarchy). The regional centers updated each other on the status of every circuit in the network. These centers would then reroute traffic around the trouble spots and keep each informed at all times. There were twelve Regional Centers in North America, ten in the United States, nine of which were operated by AT&T; (White Plains, NY, Wayne, PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Norway, IL [a rural crossroads west of Chicago at the intersection of US highway 52 and IL highway 71 - an underground office built with hardened construction to withstand nuclear attack], Conyers, GA in Rockdale County, St Louis, MO, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, and Sacramento, CA), one by GTE (San Bernardino, CA). Two centres in Canada were operated on behalf of the Trans-Canada Telephone System, one by Bell Canada (Montr√©al, PQ), and one by Saskatchewan Telephone, (Regina, SK). For control and oversight of the entire network hierarchy, AT&T; established a Network Control Center in New York City in 1962, renamed the Network Operations Center and relocated to Bedminster, NJ in 1977. Engineering supervision was also centralized in eight regional Network Management Centers. The realignment and dispersion of functions were done, in part, to ensure maximum network integrity in the event of a national emergency, a major concern in that era. The basic structure of this unit, although significantly altered since the AT&T; divestiture in the 1980s, still exists as the Global Operations Center, with domestic regional centers in Colorado and Georgia. =Class 2 (sectional center)= The class 2 office was the Sectional Center (SC). The sectional center typically connected major toll centers within one or two states or provinces, or a significant portion of a large state or province, to provide interstate or interprovincial connections for long-distance calls. At various times, there were between 50 and 75 active class two offices in the network. =Class 3 (primary center)= The class 3 office was the Primary Center (PC). Calls being made beyond the limits of a small geographical area where circuits are not connected directly between class 4 toll offices would be passed from the toll center to the primary center. These locations use high usage trunks to complete connection between toll centers. The primary center never served dial tone to the user. The number of primary centers in the network fluctuated from time to time, ranging between 150 and 230. =Class 4 (toll center)= The class 4 office is the Toll Center (TC), Toll Point (TP), or Intermediate Point (IP). A call going between two end offices not directly connected, or whose direct trunks are busy, is routed through the toll center. The toll center is also used to connect to the long-distance network for calls where added costs are incurred, such as operator handled services. This toll center may also be called the tandem office because calls have to pass through this location to get to another part of the network. Toll centers might have been operated either as interstate facilities, under the operation of AT&T; Long Lines (GTE in a few cases), or by local telephone companies, handling long-distance traffic to points within a particular operating company territory. Class 4 offices continue to exist, although with considerable changes, as they handle local exchange company interconnections, locally charged or long-distance rated, or provide facilities for connection to long-distance company points of presence. =Class 5 (local exchange)= The class 5 office is the local exchange or end office. It delivers dial tone to the customer. The end office, also called a branch exchange, is the closest connection to the end customer. Over 19,000 end offices in the United States alone provide basic dial tone services. In modern times only the terms Class 4 and Class 5 are much used, as any tandem office is referred to as a Class 4. This change was prompted in great part by changes in the power of switches and the relative cost of transmission, both of which tended to flatten the switch hierarchy. The breakup of the Bell System, and the need for each of the surviving regional operating companies to handle long-distance interconnections, also promoted the inclusion of inter- regional and international processing through larger Class 4 offices. =International overseas call centers= The special requirements of placing calls to locations outside main Canadian/United States points meant that these calls were handled by special operators in locations where connections could be monitored to other countries. The technology to automate these connections through \\"regular\\" operator traffic positions began to develop in the 1960s (see Bell Laboratories Record 42:7, July‚ÄìAugust 1964). As the decade of the 1970s progressed, North American customers who were served by electronic offices began to be able to directly dial to an increasing number of international points, a service known as IDDD (International Direct Distance Dialing), (service between ESS offices in New York and London began on March 1, 1970). However, since points could not be connected until equipment in both countries was converted to electronic switching, implementation to many locations took some time, and while the majority of calls began to be connected via automated systems by the 1990s - after the termination of the five-level hierarchy - the majority of countries were still connected via manual intervention until the beginning of the 21st century. Please note that the currently attached diagram of switch hierarchy is incorrect, as it identifies Class 1 points with International switching. International connections were located in places generally close to cable, later satellite, termination locations, and were not directly related to Class 1 switches. Major international connection points were located in Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; and New York, New York, with a number of secondary international operator toll points. Only after the rapid expansion of ESS terminal offices did operator handling of international calls begin to be off- loaded into the domestic network structure, as international calling services began to be customer dialable, ca. the mid-1980s. This in part paralleled the demise of the five-level hierarchy, so identification of international switches and class one offices is incorrect. United Kingdom The forerunner of British Telecom, the General Post Office, also organized its intercity trunk network along similar hierarchical lines to that of North America. However, because of the significantly smaller geographic area involved, fewer levels of connection were required, and no formal numbering of class offices was made. There were a few special exceptions to the following description, notably those involving Northern Ireland, some of the Channel Dependencies, and the few locations in England which were served by non-GPO companies, such as Hull (KCOM Group) and Portsmouth. In the early days of manual exchanges, outlying areas (eventually called dependent exchanges) were connected through progressively larger locations (eventually called group switching centres) into one of the main cities - Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, and Manchester. As automation began to be established in the network, this was refined into a system of approximately fifty tandem locations for Group Switching Centres, with an additional layer of perhaps a dozen Wide Area Tandems to provide for busy periods, emergency routing, etc. There were also some additional Local Tandems to handle traffic in the London Metropolitan Area without involving the GSCs, although this was a later development, as it required common control signalling for identification. =Subscriber trunk dialing= The dialing codes used by trunk operators to connect calls were originally assigned and established to ensure speed with pulse dialing equipment. With the advent of subscriber dialed calls, numbering patterns were reassigned to provide for mnemonic methods of improving customer performance. Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes all began with 0. The largest cities, which had seven digit local numbers, were allocated special codes - London, 01; Birmingham, 021; etc. Smaller towns were typically allocated a code based on the first letters of their name, translated into digits on the telephone dial. For example, OXford translated into 09 on the British phone dial, so the original STD code for Oxford was 0096. However, because of subscriber dialing errors, there was an early decision to eliminate codes that began with 00 and Oxford soon became 0865, the sequence 86 designating the first two letter of university. Some of the smallest towns connected to the trunk network only through nearby switches. In those cases, STD codes were composed of combination of the code for the nearby switch, plus some additional digits that were unused in that nearby switch, but which served two purposes (1) to identify the end location, and allow the nearby switch to complete the call (2) to \\"pad out\\" the overall length of the dialing string, since a small town might only have a three-digit telephone number, and allow the network to move to a more-standard number length. As step offices became rarer, Subscriber Trunk Dialing Codes no longer followed the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition came into the UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches. France =Early days= The early history of the telecommunications switching network in France is, unusually for this country, one of decentralized development. Early telephone exchanges were installed by local communities, often by private companies, and only later taken over by the French government. As a result, by 1930, France was served by almost 25,000 local exchanges, but almost half of these had fewer than five subscribers. Additionally, telephones were not considered important for residential customers (nor for small businesses), so France had a low penetration rate of telephone subscribers. Under these conditions, early network development revolved around two major distinctions, \\"Paris\\" and \\"not Paris.\\" Within metropolitan Paris, automated step switches appeared, with a level of tandem switching, before World War II. In the rest of the country, automation was confined to major cities, with a high level of manual intervention. The French telephone system was heavily damaged in World War II, so that by the end of the War only about 140 automatic exchanges (mostly in Paris and its \\"banlieues\\") and 228 manual exchanges were fully operational. Repair of much of the network had been deferred during the war due to lack of parts, as well as co-opting of technical personnel for German military needs. =Postwar recovery= Recovery was rapid after the war, and the extensive damage in some ways helped the modernization of the system as new technology was introduced. The DGT (Direction G√©n√©rale des T√©l√©communications) introduced automated operator dialing of long-distance connections, generally using the INSEE codes as \\"area codes\\" for the various departments - with special handling for Paris. These codes subsequently became public as customer dialing of long-distance calls began to be introduced in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The network had a minimal hierarchy, with most connections routed into a central tandem in each department, and from there to Paris. As greater installation of private telephones, for both small business and private residences, increased in the 1970s, direct connections among the tandems in adjacent regions were installed, and a three-level tier of switches, local, tandem, and regional interconnection was implemented, with final routing through Paris. Also, during the 1970s and 1980s, the smaller rural switches were replaced and combined with nearby automated offices, and a closed numbering scheme was adopted for dialing consistency. =Technological development= In common with most countries, the development of technology allowed for different networking, and the maintenance of a formal hierarchy disappeared into a distributed network. By the mid-1990s, a revised structure had appeared, reflected by the replacement of the old departmental area codes by the assignment of regional codes and a major renumbering scheme for strategic planning, privatization, and deregulation under the auspices of ART, the (Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications - since 2005, ARCEP, as responsibility for postal services was added). After 1996, the country prepared for complete deregulation of the telephone network. Thus, the local exchanges () are connected somewhat differently by various carriers. However, the largest of these, based upon the (partially) privatised former government network, is a two-level long-distance hierarchy, based on 80 CTS (centre de transit secondaire) and 8 CTP (centre de transit primaire) locations. In addition, there are 12 CTI (centre de transit internationaux) for connections to areas which are not integrated into the French telephone network [note that some overseas locations are considered \\"domestic\\" for telecommunications purposes].

It was written by Richard Curtis and directed by Jonny Campbell and featured an uncredited guest appearance from actor Bill Nighy. Intrigued by an ominous figure in Vincent van Gogh's painting The Church at Auvers, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) go back in time to meet Van Gogh (Tony Curran) and discover that Auvers-sur-Oise has been plagued by an invisible creature, known as the Krafayis, which only Van Gogh can see. The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which are out of the Doctor's reach. Curtis, inspired by the fact that Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode was mainly positive. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers praised Curran's performance as Van Gogh, but thought that the Krafayis was not a sufficiently threatening \\"monster\\". Plot Krafayis's face appears. =Synopsis= The Eleventh Doctor takes Amy to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, where they admire the work of the post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. The Doctor discovers a seemingly alien figure in a window of the painting The Church at Auvers, and decides they must travel back in time to speak to Vincent around when he painted the painting. In 1890 Auvers-sur- Oise, they find Vincent, a lonely man, at a caf√©. A young girl is murdered outside the caf√©. When the trio go out to see what happened they are stoned by locals who blame Vincent's insanity for the killing. The Doctor and Amy talk Vincent into letting them stay the night and they return to his home. That evening, Vincent confesses that his works have little value to anyone else. Amy goes outside and is attacked by a creature that only Vincent is able to see. He sketches it for the Doctor, who identifies it as a Krafayis. After initially feeling distraught that everyone leaves him, Vincent joins the Doctor and Amy at the church to paint it. Vincent begins to paint and soon spots the Krafayis inside. Vincent saves the Doctor and Amy from the Krafayis, which the Doctor realises is blind. The Krafayis is fatally impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at Vincent. Vincent empathises with its pain. The Doctor and Amy take Vincent in the TARDIS to the van Gogh exhibit at the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Vincent is stunned at the display and becomes emotionally overwhelmed when he overhears art curator Dr. Black (Bill Nighy) say that Vincent was \\"the greatest painter of them all\\" and \\"one of the greatest men who ever lived\\". They return an emotionally changed Vincent to the past and say their final goodbyes. As the Doctor and Amy return to the present, Amy is confident that there will be hundreds of new paintings by Vincent waiting for them, though the Doctor is less certain. Amy is crushed to learn that Vincent still committed suicide weeks after their adventure, at the age of 37. The Doctor explains that life is a mixture of bad and good, and while their brief encounter with Vincent couldn't undo all of the bad, they added some good to his life. The evidence is in Vincent's displayed works: the face no longer appears in The Church, and now Vase with 12 Sunflowers bears the inscription, \\"For Amy\\". =Continuity= Images of the First and Second Doctors are displayed on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS's typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fianc√© Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does not remember since Rory was consumed by a crack in the universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively. Production =Writing= Writer Richard Curtis was previously executive producer on the Doctor Who spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, a one-off comedy special written for Comic Relief by current show- runner Steven Moffat. Based on this experience, Moffat asked Curtis to write an episode of Doctor Who. Curtis had enjoyed the show's historical episodes and felt comfortable writing one. He had the idea of a story centred on Van Gogh for \\"a long while\\" and was particularly interested in the fact Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, as well as his inspirational story. Curtis was also interested in depression and the price paid for it. He wanted to convey that the Doctor could rewrite time, but Van Gogh's \\"demons\\" were out of his reach. Moffat was \\"enthusiastic\\" about the story idea. Curtis asked Moffat to criticise \\"anything and everything\\" and later said he was very honest. Executive producer Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to \\"start quicker\\" and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was \\"dull\\" and needed to be something \\"cute\\" like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was \\"rather efficient in the way that he talked\\". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was \\"fun\\" to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were \\"so delightful and modern and relaxed\\". Curtis's original title for the episode was \\"Eyes That See the Darkness\\", but he said this was vetoed. Curtis wanted to write for Doctor Who because he thought it would be \\"something my kids would like.\\" When writing \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\", Curtis put up prints of Van Gogh paintings around the house as well as a board with index cards outlining the plot. His children helped him come up with some ideas. Gillan commented that the story had a different style and approach and was more character-driven. Though it was a subject he knew \\"quite a lot\\" about, he still read a 200-page biography of Van Gogh, which was more research than he normally would have done if working on other projects; he took Van Gogh very seriously. As such, he wanted to be \\"truthful rather than cruel\\" and refused to write any jokes about Van Gogh's ears after he famously cut one of them off. However, he did incorporate other humour as he naturally wanted to \\"try to make things funny\\". =Casting and filming= The art department remade a caf√© in Croatia to resemble the one in this van Gogh painting, Caf√© Terrace at Night. Curtis stated that casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, as he wanted him to feel to the audience as Van Gogh, not \\"like a bloke they‚Äôve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig\\". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a \\"wonderful actor\\" who \\"really could not look more like\\" Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan got to know each other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Mus√©e d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were \\"very fortunate\\" to have Nighy in the role, whom he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story. The episode was filmed on location in Trogir, Croatia, in the same production block as \\"The Vampires of Venice\\", which sees Trogir depicting 16th-century Venice. Filming took place around November 2009. The scenes at the church which were filmed at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales, while the National Museum Cardiff doubled for the interior of the Mus√©e d'Orsay. Some of the sets were intended to reference paintings, such as Van Gogh's bedroom. One such set was the caf√© where the Doctor and Amy first meet Van Gogh, which was modelled after the painting Caf√© Terrace at Night. This proved challenging for the art department, who extensively looked for a suitable building in Croatia to use. Once they found the one they wanted, they had to redesign it to look like the painting; this involved putting an awning up, changing the windows, and adding a platform with tables and chairs. The song played during the ending scene is \\"Chances\\" by the British rock band Athlete. Broadcast and reception \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and simulcast on BBC HD on 5 June 2010. Initial overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 5 million, the second rated show of the day and the first on BBC One. Final consolidated ratings rose to 6.76 million, with 6.29 on BBC One and a further 0.47 on BBC HD. It was the second most watched programme on BBC One and the highest on BBC HD. It was given an Appreciation Index of 86, considered \\"excellent\\". After the original broadcast, viewers were offered a helpline if they had been affected by the issues raised in the programme. \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on 6 September 2010 with \\"The Lodger\\", \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\". It was then re- released as part of the Complete Fifth Series boxset on 8 November 2010. =Critical reception= Since its broadcast, Vincent and the Doctor has received mainly positive reviews. Dave Golder of SFX magazine gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it \\"a genuinely magical episode of Who, high on atmosphere...and bursting with charm\\". John Moore, writing on Den of Geek, also took a positive stance towards the episode, describing it as \\"life- affirming\\" as a Doctor Who fan, and, though he did criticise some elements of the plot, likewise wrote positively about the ending, ultimately finding the episode \\"utterly useless, but absolutely art\\". Keith Watson in the Metro was surprised by the \\"impressive imagining of Van Gogh's world\\", praising Curtis's humour throughout the episode. He also praised the performance by Curran as Van Gogh, feeling that, with regard to Van Gogh's depression, the producers \\"pulled it off\\" against the odds. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised it as \\"exceptionally good\\" and \\"thrilling and funny, as well as educational\\", noting its \\"historical rigour\\" and its \\"good arty jokes\\", while Deborah Orr wrote that it was \\"hardly original for someone to alight on [Van Gogh's] tale as a tear-jerker, although it is pretty shrewd to think of placing it in a popular time-travel context\\" and that \\"the feeling that I'd been gently monstered into life-affirming feel-good sobs by Richard Curtis was not new, not in the least\\". In the mainstream press, Tom Sutcliffe in The Independent praised the episode as \\"first ingenious and then decidedly poignant\\", though he felt some aspects of plot would have wider implications not addressed in the episode, and remained \\"coldly unfeeling\\" towards the death of the Krafayis. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian liked the episode, considering Curtis's dialogue to be \\"witty and clever\\" and, despite feeling that some of the moral sentiments expressed during the episode were \\"as schmaltzy as sugary gloop\\", described how the emotion of the episode eventually got to him. The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the episode a B-, explaining that it \\"didn't quite work\\" and suffered from tonal problems. Matt Wales on IGN was also mixed, giving it a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He was positive toward Curran and Gillan and that the episode \\"finally gave us a three-dimensional Amy Pond\\", but thought the \\"usually excellent\\" Smith \\"didn't get much to work with\\". He also thought that the Krafayis was \\"a nice idea\\" for being a metaphor but was not threatening, and he labelled the emotional ending as \\"self-indulgently mawkish\\". On The Guardian film blog, Peter Bradshaw considered \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" to be a \\"terrifically clever, funny, likeable wildly surreal episode\\". He praised the \\" Curtis dialogue\\" and the \\"uproariously emotional ending of the sort only Richard Curtis could get away with\\". Dan Martin on the same paper's regular Doctor Who blog was more critical, writing that its \\"main problem [was] that it doesn't feel much like a Doctor Who story\\" and would have worked better if \\"the middle section with the monster had been stripped out\\". He also criticised the script for its \\"lashings of weapons-grade sentimentality\\" and for \\"throwing up possibilities that weren't followed up\\" and the monster as an \\"afterthought [posing]...no tangible threat\\". However, he did praise Curran's \\"great performance\\" along with the episode's treatment of depression, concluding like Wollaston that he enjoyed the episode despite his misgivings. One of the most negative reviews came from Gavin Fuller in The Telegraph, who criticised it as a \\"bland, inconsequential episode that, once it set up what was a decent enough premise...completely failed to run with it\\". He compared it unfavourably with the third series episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" in being centred round a historical \\"tormented artist\\" but wrote that it lacked that episode's \\"narrative drive\\", with \\"a serious plot hole\\" in Van Gogh's ability to see the creature and that the Krafayis was \\"the most pointless monsters ever to appear in the series' long history\\". He also criticised Smith's Doctor and wrote that Van Gogh still committing suicide despite the trip to the Orsay was \\"nonsensical\\". He did, however, praise \\"the Doctor's homily about good things and bad things\\" (though Sam Wollaston criticised this speech in The Guardian) and was grateful that Curtis \\"avoided turning the Doctor into a bumbling Hugh Grant character from his romcoms\\", concluding however \\"he did little else right and a crushing disappointment was the result\\". =Awards and nominations= \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" was nominated for the Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation in the 2010 Nebula Awards and the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). It lost both of these; the Bradbury to the film Inception and the Hugo to the series finale \\"The Pandorica Opens\\"/\\"The Big Bang\\". In Canada's Constellation Awards, Curran was nominated (alongside Smith) for Best Actor and Curtis for Best Script; Curran came in sixth with 10% of the votes and Curtis came in second, losing out to Christopher Nolan's Inception by one percent of the vote.

It is the first in a two-part finale; the second part, \\"The Big Bang\\", aired on 26 June. The episode was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Toby Haynes. In the episode, the time-travelling archaeologist River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome being in the whole universe. However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fianc√©, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence from one of the cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness. Moffat wanted the episode to be \\"big\\" and \\"mad\\". Filming was done at the real Stonehenge and at a replica in early February 2010. The \\"Underhenge\\" set was the largest built on Upper Boat Studios and Haynes helped get the actors into the mood by playing music from the Indiana Jones franchise. The alliance of enemies was the first time such an assembly had been seen in the show, and the production team made sure they used the most iconic monsters that they had in good condition. \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" was seen by 7.57 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 88. The episode was well-received by critics and the two-part story won the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). Plot =Synopsis= The Eleventh Doctor and Amy, following a message from River Song, arrive in Roman Britain in 102 AD. River shows the Doctor a Vincent van Gogh painting she recovered titled The Pandorica Opens, which depicts the TARDIS exploding. The Doctor realises the Pandorica, a fabled prison for the universe's deadliest being, must be stored in a memorable location near the coordinates: Stonehenge. Beneath Stonehenge, the Doctor, Amy, and River find the Pandorica. While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found in the pocket of his jacket and feels a strong emotional attachment to. River warns the Doctor that \\"everything that ever hated [him]\\" is being drawn to the Pandorica. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is Amy's fianc√©, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by a crack in the universe and erased from existence. The Doctor urges River to bring the TARDIS to Stonehenge while he, Amy, Rory, and the legionaries prepare. When River tries to use the TARDIS, an outside force takes control of it and pilots it to Amy's house in the present day, which has been broken into. In Amy's room, River finds a story book about Pandora's box and a children's book about Roman Britain. River communicates this to the Doctor, warning him that the Pandorica must be a trap, created out of Amy's memories. Realising that River is at the onset of the time energy explosion that caused the cracks in the universe, the Doctor warns her to leave immediately, but she finds herself again trapped in the TARDIS as the central control console begins to go critical. Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor discovers that the volunteer legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, and he is quickly captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he fatally shoots Amy. The Doctor's captors reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion. As the Doctor is sealed inside the Pandorica, every star in the sky goes supernova. =Continuity= In the first episode of the series, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", Prisoner Zero tells the Doctor, \\"The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall\\". The Pandorica was also mentioned by River in \\"Flesh and Stone\\" as the next time she would meet him, and the Doctor dismissed the Pandorica as a fairy tale. In River's timeline this takes place before \\"The Time of Angels\\"/\\"Flesh and Stone\\". The painting of the TARDIS explosion passes through several characters from previous episodes: the painting is created by Vincent van Gogh (Tony Curran) after his meeting with the Doctor (\\"Vincent and the Doctor\\"). The painting is found in 1941 by Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) and Professor Bracewell (Bill Paterson) from \\"Victory of the Daleks\\", and River steals the painting from Liz 10 (Sophie Okonedo), who previously appeared in \\"The Beast Below\\". The recurring phrase \\"silence will fall\\" came to a head in the next series with the introduction of the alien species and organisation of the Silence. Production Some scenes were filmed at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire, while others were filmed using a replica. The read-through for \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" took place on 13 January 2010 in the Upper Boat Studios. It began later than planned as cold weather delayed the arrival of some of the cast and crew. The episode was filmed in the sixth production block along with \\"The Big Bang\\". Half of the scene with Liz 10 (Sophie Okonedo) was filmed in advance on 22 October 2009 along with scenes of \\"The Beast Below\\" at an orangery at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot. The other half, featuring Alex Kingston as River Song, was filmed 5 February 2010. Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat wanted the episode to be \\"big\\" and say that \\"we are turning it up to a level, we are really going mad with it\\". Atmospheric lighting was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took an hour and a half to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called \\"Foamhenge\\" over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had \\"established\\" Stonehenge at the real site and now could get away with seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind. Haynes wanted the Doctor's speech to be his \\"big, pop-star moment\\" and to look as if he was addressing a large site such as Wembley Stadium. The \\"Underhenge\\" set was the largest built in the Upper Boat Studios. Haynes wanted the chamber to look \\"dark\\" and \\"physical\\", and the art department added cobwebs and stones. As the chamber was supposed to be underground and thus there was no natural light to light the actors' faces, Haynes decided to utilise gas-fed flaming torches as the source of light; Gillan was initially nervous about working with the torches and struggled with them. The script referred to it as similar to a temple found in Indiana Jones, and Haynes actually played music from Raiders of the Lost Ark composed by John Williams to help the actors slow down as they explored the set. Haynes believed this would emphasise the awe in the scene as well as the \\"ghostly\\" and \\"haunted\\" feeling of the chamber. Gillan stated that she found the music very useful. For the scene in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the characters riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a saddle mounted on the back of a truck and act like they were riding horses. Gillan called this the \\"strangest thing\\" she had ever done, and was sure she \\"looked ridiculous\\". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses. This scene was filmed on 1 February 2010. At the episode's conclusion an alliance of many of the Doctor's enemies appear: the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, Judoon, Autons, Sycorax, Hoix, Silurians, and Roboforms. The Alliance was made up of the \\"very best\\" costumes and props they still had in good condition and of the most iconic monsters. So many enemies standing side-by-side had never been seen in the show before. The episode also features Amy battling a Cyberman; Gillan stated she \\"really wanted\\" to work with the iconic monster. As the Cyberman had been guarding the Pandorica for a long time, Haynes wanted to make it look \\"rusted, creaky, and old\\" and compared its behavior to Frankenstein. The Cyberman was originally played by an amputee with one arm, but the production team was dissatisfied with the camera angle and decided to reshoot the scene from a different angle, but a different actor who had both arms did the part as the amputee was unavailable. A simple solution was devised to cover his arm with a green sleeve made of the same material as a greenscreen, and the final sequence is a combination of both shots. The Cyberman is killed by Rory, who is unaware he is an Auton; this was meant to signify that there was something different about Rory, as he would have normally panicked in that situation. At the end of the episode Rory is overcome by the Nestene Consciousness's control and shoots Amy, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy. Broadcast and reception \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and simulcast on BBC HD on 19 June 2010. For the first time in the series, the episode was not followed by a short trailer for the next episode, the finale. Initial overnight ratings showed that 5.38 million viewers had watched the episode on BBC One, while a further 497,000 watched on BBC HD, combining for a total of 5.88 million. Final consolidated figures showed a total of 7.57 million viewers, with 6.94 on BBC One and 635,000 on BBC HD. The episode was given an \\"excellent\\" Appreciation Index of 88, higher than the previous episodes of series 5 and second highest for that series, after the final episode, which scored 89. \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on 6 September 2010 with \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\", \\"The Lodger\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\". It was then re-released as part of the Complete Fifth Series boxset on 8 November 2011. =Critical reception= \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" received positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian praised the cinematic scope and cliffhanger, calling it \\"the most audacious of showstoppers\\". He thought that so much happened in the episode that Rory's return felt like \\"a minor plot point\\", though he considered that was because the audience knew it was going to happen. Gavin Fuller, writing for The Daily Telegraph, praising it for bringing an \\"epic, cinematic tale to stick in the memory\\" that the series had \\"arguably lacked\\", though he thought the assembly of the Alliance was \\"rather fanboyish on Moffat's part\\". He also praised Smith for \\"hit[ting] the right note\\" and the revelations at the end for being \\"genuinely shocking\\". Like Martin, he said that Rory's return was \\"unsurprising\\", though \\"well-handled\\" and with some touching moments between him and Amy. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times called it \\"perhaps the most epic, salivating Doctor Who ever\\" and praised the four leads and Moffat for \\"packing in surprises and slotting together the season puzzle with a dazzling plot, urgent pace and terrific dialogue\\". IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 9 out of 10, saying it \\"managed to pack in an absurd number of standout moments\\" and was \\"beautifully delivered, if not quite as satisfying as other two-part openers thanks to its wilful evasiveness\\". However, he thought that the slow- motion ending \\"dipped a little too violently into melodrama\\", though it was \\"hard to fault that bravado downbeat cliffhanger\\". SFX magazine's Richard Edwards awarded the episode five out of five stars, praising the \\"delicious twist\\", \\"great character stuff\\", and \\"touching scenes\\" between Amy and Rory. He thought that the Alliance was \\"unlikely\\" but it worked because the series arc had been \\"cleverly constructed\\". Sam McPherson of Zap2it gave it an A+, praising it for being an improvement upon the finales of previous series. He also thought the use of the Alliance was well done, as it portrayed them as being more misguided than evil. The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave the episode an A-, though expressed concern whether the conclusion would be able to satisfy the set-up. \\"The Pandorica Opens\\", along with its conclusion, was awarded the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). This was the fifth time Doctor Who has won the award, and the fourth time a Steven Moffat episode has won. The Mill, Doctor Who computer-generated effects team, won a Royal Television Society Craft and Design Award for their work on the episode.

It was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Ashley Way. It is the second episode of a two-part story, the first episode being \\"The Hungry Earth\\", which features the return of the reptilian humanoid Silurians. Continuing from the previous episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) have taken the TARDIS deep below the ground to the Silurian city where the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), a local man named Mo (Alun Raglan), and Mo's son, Elliot (Samuel Davies), are being held hostage. Meanwhile, above ground, Amy's fianc√©, Rory (Arthur Darvill); Mo's wife, Ambrose (Nia Roberts); and Ambrose's father, Tony (Robert Pugh), keep watch over Alaya (Neve McIntosh), a captured Silurian who is the key to freeing the hostages. While the Doctor leaves Amy and Nasreen to negotiate sharing the planet with the Silurians, to help Mo find his son Eliot, it is revealed that Restac's sister Alaya has been killed by Ambrose on the surface. Chibnall was elected by executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to write a two-part episode about the return of the Silurians. Chibnall wanted \\"Cold Blood\\" in particular to be about the mistakes people make under pressure, and conflict that could come out of protecting a family. The episode is also connected to the series' story arc, as the crack in the universe returns at the end of the episode. \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\" were filmed in October and November 2009, with scenes in \\"Cold Blood\\" shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and an array of locations and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the production team did not want to look like a cave. The episode was watched by 7.49 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers were disappointed by the plot and characteristics of the Silurians, but the emotional ending was widely praised. Plot Deep under the Earth, Amy and Mo escape from Silurian doctor Malohkeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. The leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Eleventh Doctor and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities. The Doctor makes contact with Rory; Mo's wife, Ambrose; and Ambrose's father, Tony, reminding them to keep their captive Silurian, Restac's sister Alaya, alive. They are unaware that Ambrose has already killed Alaya because she would not help Tony, whom she had infected with Silurian venom. The Doctor arranges a conference between Eldane, Amy, and Nasreen; the three discuss how humans and Silurians can co- exist on the surface. Ambrose and Tony, worried about the Silurian reaction when they discover Alaya's death, set Nasreen and Tony's drill to burrow into the oxygen pockets of the Silurians' underground city fifteen minutes after they depart, which would destroy it. Meanwhile, Restac has killed Malohkeh for his betrayal and awakened other members of the warrior caste, intending to stage a coup against Eldane. The Doctor escapes with the humans and channels an energy pulse to the base of the drill before it impacts the city. Eldane returns the warriors to hibernation by initiating a \\"toxic fumigation\\"; the humans escape, and Eldane hopes that in a thousand years, peace between humans and Silurians can occur. Tony, still affected by Silurian venom, opts to stay behind to be cured, and Nasreen stays with Tony. The TARDIS fragment prop used at the end of this episode, on display at an exhibition. The Doctor, Amy and Rory find a crack in the cavern wall similar to those they have seen before. The Doctor surmises that the crack was caused by an explosion in time, which might have left shrapnel behind. He reaches in and pulls out an object which he wraps in a handkerchief. Restac, dying from the toxic exposure, crawls around the corner and fires at the Doctor, but Rory pushes him out of the way and takes the shot, dying in Amy's arms. The crack absorbs Rory's body, erasing him from existence and causing Amy to lose her memory of him. Returning to the surface, the Doctor takes out the object he pulled from the crack--a burned piece of the TARDIS's sign. Production Writer Chris Chibnall was contracted by executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to write a two-part Doctor Who episode about Silurians and a drill. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode \\"42\\" as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. \\"Cold Blood\\" is the second part of the story which began with \\"The Hungry Earth\\"; the latter built up the tension while \\"Cold Blood\\" was designed to get into the action. \\"Cold Blood\\" is also set in the bigger setting of the Silurian city, while \\"The Hungry Earth\\" was set in a small Welsh village. Chibnall wanted the Silurian city to contrast with the village. Chibnall wanted it to be a \\"story about people making mistakes under massive pressure\\" and the accidental conflict that came out of protecting a family; as such, he always intended for Alaya to die. He considered \\"Cold Blood\\" especially to be \\"so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want\\". Moffat's plan \\"from the outset\\", to tie the episode into the overarching story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in the crack in the universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now it was time for a casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene \\"incredibly challenging\\" for her to perform and tried to make it \\"truthful and believable\\". \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\" made up the fourth production block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. \\"Cold Blood\\" utilised many different locations and unusual sets to portray the Silurian city, as the production team did not want simply a \\"cave feel\\". They believed that the Silurians were also sophisticated and were able to use materials found underground, such as granite and marble. Many of the sets were given an orange glow from beneath to portray the \\"ambient glow\\" from the centre of the earth. The jungle walkway leading to the Silurian city was filmed in the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009. The set gave a sense of things growing, as these were necessary for the Silurians to survive. Set designers were able to rearrange the plants, though they had to be careful not to show the window leading to the car park or other modern amenities. The hall where the Doctor is brought for execution was filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff, and little dressing was done to the set. Broadcast and reception \\"Cold Blood\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and simulcast on BBC HD on 29 May 2010. Initial overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 5.7 million viewers, a million more than the previous week. Final consolidated ratings rose to 7.49 million (7.04 million on BBC One and 0.45 million on BBC HD), ranking the show fourth for the week ending 30 May 2010 on the channel and the highest rated show on BBC One for the day. The episode received an Appreciation Index of 85, considered \\"excellent\\". \\"Cold Blood\\" was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu-ray on 2 August 2010 with the episodes \\"Amy's Choice\\" and \\"The Hungry Earth\\". It was then re-released as part of the Complete Fifth Series boxset on 8 November 2010. =Critical reception= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, said that the episode was similar to previous Silurian stories in Doctor Who, though he said he loved the \\"tense, mad and thoughtful story\\". He expressed \\"delight\\" at Amy and Nasreen negotiating for the humans, though he thought the diplomacy scenes were \\"broadly drawn\\". Overall, he considered the strength of the episode was \\"giving you something big and moral to chew over, in a way that nothing else this series has yet\\". Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph also compared \\"Cold Blood\\"'s concept and ideas to the original 1970 Silurians story but considered this story made \\"less of an impact\\" due to a \\"black and white depiction\\" and the one-dimensional Restac. He was also critical of Matt Smith's Doctor, whose portrayal \\"lacked gravitas and conviction and was altogether too light-hearted\\". However, he praised both Smith and Gillan's \\"strong\\" performances in the final scene where Rory is killed. The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the episode a B+, noting that Rory's death had been spoiled for him by commenters on the site and thus he did not enjoy the episode as much as he might have. He called it \\"satisfying, if not extraordinary\\" conclusion and \\"another pretty solid entry in the series\\". He further praising Gillan and Amy's character for \\"[continuing] to impress\\" as well as the depths to the supporting characters by both Chibnall and Way, and the allegories that could be derived from the conflict between the humans and the Silurians and the aftermath of Rory's demise. IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, and thought that \\"even less actually happened\\" than the previous episode, though he enjoyed the \\"atmospheric build-up and more thoughtful tone\\". While he considered it predictable, he said that it \\"still offered plenty in the way of entertainment with its brisk pace, beautifully- realised underground world and a convincing cast of rounded characters\\". He praised Smith and Gillan's performances in the ending, but thought it was \\"a surprisingly downbeat denouement\\". Ian Berriman of SFX magazine gave \\"Cold Blood\\" four and a half out of five stars, positively comparing the emotional ending to episodes from the Russell T Davies era. He also had some \\"nitpicks\\" about the episode, such as the abrupt character change of Malohkeh.

Concern was expressed over renewed fighting the parties in Liberia and its negative impact on the disarmament process and humanitarian relief efforts. The role of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the peace process was commended and for the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to assist in the implementation of the peace process. The close co-operation between UNOMIL and ECOMOG was commended and this was extended to African states that had contributed to ECOMOG. It was also noted that the amended timetable for the peace process called for elections to be held on 7 September 1994. The Council extended the mandate of UNOMIL on the understanding that it will review the situation in Liberia by 18 May 1994 on whether or not the Council of State of the Liberian National Transitional Government has been fully installed and there had been substantive progress in the peace talks. By 30 June 1994, a review would take place concerning the operation of the transitional government, progress in disarmament and demobilisation, and the preparation of the elections. All parties were called upon to cease hostilities and to work towards disarmament, the installation of the transitional government and a National Assembly so that a unified civil administration of the country can be established. The parties were also urged to ensure the safety of UNOMIL personnel and contribute to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Member States were encouraged to contribute to ECOMOG financially to facilitate the sending of reinforcements by African states. Furthermore, the assistance they provided was praised and the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's efforts to encourage dialogue were welcomed.

It is located two nautical miles (4 km) north of the central business district of Ellensburg, Washington. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. History The airfield was established in 1943 as Ellensburg Army Airfield and manned by the 302d Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. Though planned as a fighter airfield for Fourth Air Force, it was taken over by Air Technical Service Command as a maintenance and supply depot, supporting transient Lend-Lease aircraft being flown to Alaska for subsequent transfer to the Soviet Union. The airfield had one auxiliary field, located at , which is now abandoned, though remains of a runway are still visible in aerial photography. Military use ended in February 1945, and the airfield was turned over to War Assets Administration for subsequent transfer to Kittitas County for development into a civil airport. Bowers Field is named in honor of Ensign Keith Bowers, the first man from Kittitas County killed in World War II. Bowers was at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked by the Japanese on December 7, 1941. The field became a training base for military pilots during the war.\\"Kittitas County History.\\" Kittitas County Historical Museum. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 August 2010. . Established in 1975, Central Washington University's aviation program is the only fully accredited public university aviation program in the Pacific Northwest. More than 90 percent of the takeoffs and landings at Bowers Field are tied to Central Washington University's aviation program. Central Washington University took over hangar space and some fixed-base functions at Bowers Field last year. At the beginning of fall quarter, Central Washington University began hiring its own flight instructors, and started leasing and purchasing its own planes. The school earned its pilot school certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. Today, large numbers of former aircraft dispersal areas are still maintained, along with an extensive system of taxiways with what appear to be modern aircraft shelters.  Facilities and aircraft  Bowers Field covers an area of 1,032 acres (418 ha) at an elevation of 1,764 feet (538 m) above mean sea level. It has one runways: 11/29 is 4,301 by 150 feet (1,311 x 46 m) with a concrete surface. The former runway 7/25 was 5,590 by 150 feet (1,704 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface, but was permanently closed in June 2018. For the 12-month period ending May 30, 2012, the airport had 60,445 aircraft operations, an average of 165 per day: 97% general aviation, 3% air taxi, and <1% military. At that time there were 48 aircraft based at this airport: 90% single-engine, 8% multi-engine, and 2% glider.

Bowers, M.D., Emeritus Professor of Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine, attended medical school at the University of Oregon and did an internship at the University of Washington. He then studied biochemistry at Cornell University and attended the Postgraduate School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. From 1961-2004 he was the director of the Section of Endocrinology & Metabolism in the Department of Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine. Dr. Bowers has served on the editorial board of several endocrine journals, was a member of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Study Section for eight years and has written over 400 articles in peer reviewed journals including chapters in books and over 200 abstracts. Research Interests Some noteworthy accomplishments include the development of TRH analogs, LHRH antagonists and the development of a new class of small synthetic peptides (GHRPs, growth hormone releasing peptides) that specifically release growth hormone in animals and humans. In 1969, the Van Meter Award was given to Drs. Bowers, Schally and Folkers for the isolation and identification of TRH. The work on TRH strongly supported that additional hypothalamic releasing hormones would be discovered which was accomplished within the next 2 years with the discovery of LHRH by Dr. Schally‚Äôs group and others followed in subsequent years. In 1998 he received the Monsanto Clinical Investigator Award from the Endocrine Society in recognition of his contribution in the field of hypothalamic hormones and his discovery of the GHRP pathway and its clinical and therapeutic importance. Some of Dr. Bowers‚Äô current and future objectives include development of 1) ghrelin receptor agonists for undernutrition, i.e., cancer, cachexia, starvation; 2) ghrelin receptor antagonists for overnutrition, i.e., obesity; 3) use of ghrelin agonists in diabetes; 4) use of ghrelin agonists to restore normal function of the GH-IGF-I axis in older men and women; 5) intranasal and long acting delivery systems for ghrelin agonists/antagonists, and to obtain licenses and funds for development of the ghrelin agonists/antagonists as well as for a completed Phase I LHRH antagonist.

Background In 1875, the Parliament of Canada established the Supreme Court of Canada as a general court of appeal. This did not, however, bar rulings from the various provincial courts of appeal from being appealed directly to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.as outlined in List of Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases originating in Canada In 1888, appeals in criminal cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council were abolished.Criminal Procedure Amendment Act, S.C. 1888, c. 43, s. 1 The JCPC voided that legislation in Nadan v The King, finding that the prohibition of appeals to the Privy Council was ultra vires the authority of the Canadian Parliament under the British North America Act, 1867, because of provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. After Nadan, the Imperial Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster 1931, following which the Parliament of Canada abolished criminal appeals to the Privy Council again in 1933.Criminal Code Amendment Act, S.C. 1932-33, c. 53, s. 17 In 1933, The British Coal Corporation and several other coal-importing companies had been convicted in the Court of King's Bench for the Province of Quebec (Crown Side) on charges under the Criminal Code and the Combines Investigation Act, and were subject to fines as well as the complete prohibition of their business in importing anthracite coal into Canada. Appeals to the Court's Appeal Side were dismissed in 1934. They sought to appeal these convictions to the Privy Council, arguing that the Statute contained no words which took away or diminished that prerogative, either expressly or by implication. The decision Lord Sankey Writing for the Privy Council, Lord Sankey first described the origins of the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, as created by the Judicial Committee Act 1833 (as amended by the Judicial Committee Act 1844). In Sankey's words, \\"It is clear that the Committee is regarded in the Act as a judicial body or Court\\" which \\"exercised as a Court of law in reality, though not in name, the residual prerogative of the King in Council.\\"British Coal v. the King [1935] A.C. 500, at 512. Having established that the JCPC had the role of a court of law, Sankey went on to outline the relevant legal history between the passage of the Judicial Committee Acts and the Statute of Westminster, including the enactment of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. Sankey distinguished Nadan from the present case by noting that the former decision had been based on the inconsistency of Canada's earlier prohibition of criminal appeals to the Privy Council with the Judicial Committee Acts and the Colonial Laws Validity Act. Specifically, the prohibition was inconsistent on two grounds:  It was repugnant to the Judicial Committee Acts, running afoul of the Colonial Laws Validity Act by implication.  To be effective, it had to have an extraterritorial dimension, which Canadian laws could not possess until the passage of the Statute of Westminster.British Coal v. the King [1935] A.C. 500, at 516 It remained to be seen, Sankey noted, whether the British North America Act gave Canada the legislative competence to prohibit criminal appeals after the Statute of Westminster had abrogated the Colonial Laws Validity Act and permitted the Parliament of Canada to pass laws having extraterritorial operation: While the Statute of Westminster had removed the two limits that prevented Canada from prohibiting criminal appeals to the JCPC in Nadan, Sankey went on to argue that such a prohibition was within the scope of Canada's legislative competence under the British North America Act. In interpreting the B.N.A. Act, Sankey approached the Act in a manner similar to that which he used in the 1931 Persons case. \\"It must be remembered what the nature and scope of the Act are,\\" he wrote. \\"In interpreting a constituent .. or organic statute such as the Act, that construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted.\\"British Coal v. the King [1935] A.C. 500, at 518 Applying this \\"large and liberal\\"Lord Sankey, citing his own judgment in Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General) method of construction to the B.N.A. Act, Sankey found that s. 91 of the Act did empower the Canadian Parliament to forbid appeals to the JCPC. While noting that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could, if it wished, repeal all or part of the Statute of Westminster, enabling it to reassert its authority over Canadian affairs at any time, Sankey noted that this was a matter of \\"theory and has no relation to realities. In truth Canada is in enjoyment of the full scope of self- government.\\"British Coal v. the King [1935] A.C. 500, at 520 Aftermath The Parliament of Canada subsequently abolished civil appeals to the Privy Council in 1949,Supreme Court Amendment Act, S.C. 1949 (2nd. session), c. 37, s. 3 after the Privy Council affirmed that Parliament had the right to do so. Nature of the Statute of Westminster 1931 The Statute of Westminster 1931 has been described as \\"the last of the Imperial Acts of the Parliament applicable to all the Dominions. It granted Canada...what amounted to independence.\\" More specifically, it removed limits on the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada. \\"The Statute of Westminster had removed any legislative incompetence from the Canadian legislature and accordingly the legislature had full power to enact the section in question.\\"* The Statute of Westminster freed Dominion legislatures from the constraints of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, under which colonial laws \\"repugnant\\" to laws, orders, or regulations imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament were to be considered \\"absolutely void and inoperative.\\", s. 2 That was the basis on which the prohibition of appeals to the Privy Council in criminal matters had been struck down in Nadan.

About Founded in 1998, MedShare collects surplus medical supplies and used equipment from U.S. hospitals, manufacturers and distributors. They process these donated materials and make them available to under-served hospitals and clinics in two ways: direct shipments to international applicant institutions and supplying medical mission teams with commonly needed medical items. Its national headquarters and Southeastern distribution center is in Decatur, Georgia, and its Western Region distribution center is in San Leandro, California. In 14 years of service, they have shipped over 750 forty-foot shipping containers of medical supplies and equipment valued at more than $100 million to needy health facilities in 88 countries around the world. History MedShare was founded in 1998 by A.B. Short, a nonprofit entrepreneur, and Bob Freeman, a retired businessman, after learning of the environmental threat imposed by hospitals and medical companies discarding thousands of tons of medical supplies and equipment, while underserved hospitals in developing countries were desperate for the most basic medical items. Short and Freeman spent some time meeting with hospitals and medical professionals to find out if there was indeed a need for medical surplus supplies to be diverted from landfills. During these meetings, not one hospital turned their medical surplus collection program down. While performing their due diligence, they also learned of the importance of shipping medical supplies that the recipient needs, not simply shipping what they had, which led MedShare to employ a technology-based inventory system, where the qualified health recipient can custom-order the medical items for their shipment. * 1999 ‚Äì MedShare shipped their first 40-foot shipping container of medical supplies to Costa Rica. * 2000 Woodruff Foundation awards their first major $250,000 grant * 2002 MedShare's medical shipments increase 50 percent from 15 to 30 medical supply shipments * 2005 Move into a larger warehouse to accommodate growing donations and operations * 2006 Reaches $35 million worth of medical supplies and equipment shipped overseas * 2007 Secure a $6.2 million capital campaign to purchase and endow its national headquarters in Decatur, GA, upgrade technology and fund a national expansion * 2008 ‚Äì Grand opening of the Western Region Distribution Center in San Leandro, California 400th forty-foot container of medical aid shipped abroad * 2009 ‚Äì Celebration of 10-year anniversary  500th forty-foot medical aid container shipped  254 medical mission teams supplied with needed medical supplies for short-term medical work abroad  Over 10,000 volunteers served at both distribution centers  The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation awards MedShare the largest single programs grant of $400,000 for shipping containers to specified hospitals in Africa. * 2010 - For the first time, MedShare ships over 100 containers of medical supplies in a calendar year. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti, MedShare responds by shipping 28 containers of medical supplies, supplying over 83 medical mission teams, and providing biomedical equipment training.  MedShare reaches 500,000 inventoried medical supplies in MedShare online inventory system.  MedShare ships its 600th container of medical supplies and equipment.  In an effort to make its warehouses more environmentally friendly, MedShare installs motion-activated lights to save energy.  For the second year running, the State of California recognizes MedShare as a recipient of the Waste Reduction Awards Program (WRAP).  MedShare enjoys a record fundraising year, increasing total support by more than 30%. *2011 - Surpassed 2 million cubic feet in material saved from landfills.  Secured partnership with The Atlantic Philanthropies that will result in substantial container shipments to Viet Nam.  Established a New York Regional Council, and explored expansion opportunities in the Mid- Atlantic and South Florida regions.  Meridith Rentz appointed CEO and President after a one-year search by the Board of Trustees. Services and operations MedShare uses a variety of services to get recovered surplus medical supplies and equipment from U.S. hospitals and medical companies and to qualified health recipients abroad. 1) Medical Product Donations ‚Äì MedShare collects hundreds of thousands of pounds of surplus medical supplies from both hospitals and medical companies. They collect a weekly average of over 20,000 pounds of surplus medical supplies and equipment from both hospitals and medical companies. MedShare only accepts unused medical supplies that have an expiration date of at least 12‚Äì18 months or more. Biomedical equipment donations must be in working condition with the all the necessary accessories and operational manual included. MedShare's biomedical engineers evaluate biomedical equipment donations to ensure they are in operable condition before they are sent to a health recipient abroad. * Surplus Medical Recycling Program is a program for hospitals to donate their surplus medical supplies to MedShare. Participating hospitals in Metro Atlanta and Northern California are periodically trained by MedShare staff on how the program works and what surplus medical supply donations are accepted. Each hospital receives MedShare recycling barrels to place in designated hospital departments, and MedShare provides a regular pick-up service to collect the donated surplus supplies. * Corporate Product Donations About 65 percent of MedShare's product donations come from medical manufacturers and distributors. Corporations often donate products that have cosmetically damaged packaging, production overages, usable returned products or simply to make a tax-deductible donation to a trusted humanitarian charity. ''' 2\\\\. Volunteers ‚Äì MedShare offers hands-on volunteer opportunities for people to help in getting vital medical supplies to needy health recipients abroad. Each month, more than 1,500 volunteers serve at both the Southeastern and Western Distribution Centers to help sort and pack recovered surplus medical supplies. There are different sorting levels where volunteers start with assorted donated medical supplies, and eventually sort them into boxes of individual medical items, such as a box of sutures and a box of surgical gloves and a box of surgical drapes. 3\\\\. Medical Product Shipments The main way MedShare distributes donated surplus medical supplies and equipment around the world is through customized 40-foot shipping containers. They work with foreign governments, corporations, nonprofit organizations and individuals who wish to sponsor shipments of medical aid to specified recipient hospitals and clinics abroad. Each sponsor must fill out an application detailing the needs of the recipient hospital and provide the necessary funding for the shipment. 4\\\\. MedShare Online Inventory MedShare prides itself on its innovative use of technology to best use its resources and serve health recipients abroad. Approved health recipients are able to custom-order the supplies needed for their facilities using an online inventory. Once recovered surplus supplies have been sorted and packed by volunteers, they are entered into an online inventory database by MedShare staff. The online inventory is refreshed every hour to reflect the most up-to- date items available for recipients to order. Once a recipient's application is approved and funding in place, he/she is provided a personalized login to order the medical supplies for their 40-foot shipping container. Because of limited availability of biomedical equipment, only medical supplies are listed on the online inventory. The health recipient must submit a written request to MedShare of any biomedical equipment needs. 5\\\\. Medical Mission Teams MedShare also provides medical supplies to medical professionals traveling abroad on short term trips to provide medical treatment for those in need. Medical teams must fill out an application detailing the nature of their medical trip and supply needs. Once their application is approved, they can either set up an appointment to collect supplies at the MedTeam Store at either of our distribution centers in Decatur, GA or San Leandro, California. MedShare asks for a $75 donation to collect up to 50 pounds of medical supplies from our MedTeam Store. Teams needing more than 100 pounds of medical supplies can order from MedShare's online inventory. If a medical mission team is unable to pick up the supplies at one of the distribution centers, the team can pay for MedShare to ship them the supplies they need. Funding MedShare is 100% reliant on philanthropic support from more than 4,000 corporations, foundations, and individuals to fund its operations and receives no government funding. MedShare is governed by a board of 19 diverse and distinguished corporate, community and healthcare industry leaders. 100% of board members participate in annual and capital fund-raising campaigns at a personally sacrificial level. Throughout its 14-year history, MedShare has been spending on average less than four percent of total revenues on administration and fund-raising expenses. Organizational structure MedShare is a U.S. nonprofit organization with an international mission that is overseen by a Board of Trustees that serves as MedShare's governing body, responsible for the fiduciary, strategic and generative oversight and direction of the organization. Board members support 100% of the organization's annual and capital fundraising campaigns. Members serve without compensation, and meet once a quarter. The current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is James E. Arnett. MedShare's national staff consists of 37 people, with 5 executive officers. Awards and recognitions MedShare is a four-star ranked charity by Charity Navigator. They have also been ranked by Charity Navigator's periodic Top Ten lists as #2 out of 53 international charities providing humanitarian aid, #2 on the list of \\"Slam Dunk Charities\\" for fiscal responsibility, and listed on Charity Navigator's list of recommended nonprofits providing disaster relief to Haiti. MedShare is ranked as one of the \\"Best in America\\" charities by Independent Charities of America. In 2008, they received the Technology Innovation Award from TechBridge for the best use of technology for mission delivery by a nonprofit for our inventory system that enables beneficiaries to select exactly what they need. They were also awarded the 2008 Revolutions Award from the Georgia Center for Nonprofits recognizing the Nonprofit of the Year. In 2010, the Atlanta Business Chronicle named them the Green Giving Champion at the Environmental Business Awards. In 2010, MedShare's Western Region earned their Green Business Certification from Bay Area Green Business Program and was the Bay Area Excellence in Volunteer Management Award Winner. They've also been named a 2010 and 2011 Waste Reduction Awards, Program (WRAP) winner by the State of California's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery CalRecycle. The Southeastern Region recently received Grants to Green funding to support our ongoing energy conservation efforts.

For 25 years he was educational director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Born in Shoscombe, Somerset he was the son of a staunch Free Methodist coal miner. From 1899 to 1907 he attended St Julian's National School. At age thirteen he began work in the mines, later migrating to South Wales. He joined the Miners' Federation of Great Britain and the Independent Labor Party and also attended classes arranged by the Workers Educational Association. In 1915 he won a scholarship to the Central Labour College in London, which helped broaden his intellectual horizons. In 1916 he returned to the coal fields and began teaching classes in industrial history under the auspices of the Aberdare District Miners' Federation. These lectures became the basis for his A Worker looks at History. In 1918 he was called up to service in the army but became a conscientious objector on political grounds. While in prison his sister sent him a copy of the New Testament in Esperanto, which sparked a lifelong interest in the subject. Lobbying by his father got Starr transferred from prison to farm work in Northumberland. In Northumberland Starr came in contact with the Plebs League and became a leading member of that group. After his release from prison he returned to South Wales and continued his educational work. In 1921 he helped organize the National Council of Labour Colleges and was the Plebs League representative on its council. During the 1920s, the Plebs League and the NCLC became increasingly divided over personal and political animosities. The Plebs were dominated by the Horrabin family: J. F. Horrabin edited Plebs magazine, his wife Winifred Horrabin was national secretary and his sister Kathleen was a clerk in the national office. Starr married Kathleen. The NCLC was dominated by J. P. M. Millar and his wife Christine. When the NCLC absorbed the Plebs in 1927 Starr began to find his position in the group untenable and immigrated to the United States to become an instructor at Brookwood Labor College in Katonah, New York. Though seen as an ally of the Horrabins, his marriage with Kathleen was deteriorating and ended with a divorce. Along with the Horrabins, Starr briefly joined the Communist Party of Great Britain during the early 1920s, but soon left, unable to stomach the group's discipline. A trip to Leningrad in 1926 to attend an Esperanto conference further alienated him from the Soviets. He stood as a Labour Party candidate for Wimbledon in 1923 and 1924, obtaining about 30% of the vote each time. In America, Starr continued as an instructor at Brookwood until 1935, when he became educational director of the powerful International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, a position he kept until 1960. He became active in the American Labor Party and the Liberal Party of New York, both of which the ILGWU was affiliated with. He was chairmen of the Queens branch of the Liberal Party from 1945-1959. After retiring from ILGWU he represented the International Labour Organization in Singapore and East Africa and continued his Esperanto advocacy. He was listed as the chairman of the Esperanto Information Center in 1973 when he signed the Humanist Manifesto II. In 1932 Starr married Helen Norton, also a lecturer at Brookwood. They had two children, John, who died in infancy, and Emily. Mark Starr died on 24 April 1985.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1986. The Bayne‚ÄìFowle House is a masonry townhouse built in 1854 for William Bayne, an Alexandria-based commission merchant. It is noted for its fine mid-Victorian interiors and elaborate plasterwork. During the American Civil War the house was occupied by Northern troops and subsequently confiscated by the Federal government and converted briefly into a military hospital. Since 1871 it has been a private residence. Background and history William Bayne, a commission merchant and grocer in Alexandria, purchased the lot at 811 Prince Street in 1849. A house was constructed in 1854 but was sold to William H. Fowle, another commission merchant and the son of a Massachusetts businessman in 1855. The house served as his residence until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he took refuge in Richmond. During the Civil War the house was occupied by Northern troops and occupied by the federal government. In 1864 the building was used as a military hospital. After the civil war Fowle won a lawsuit to recover his property but he died in 1869, prior to the victory and subsequently the property was sold to John Jordan Wheat in 1871. Since 1871 the house has been used as a private residence, although several owners have been physicians such as Dr. Samuel B. Moore, who purchased the house in 1906, and maintained his office in the building until the 1940s. Today the property is owned by Richard Klingler and Jane Slatter and was recently given a major renovation. Architecture =Exterior= The Bayne‚ÄìFowle House is a three-story masonry town house in the Italianate design, located in a finely preserved block of the Old Town of Alexandria. It is surrounded by houses which date to the late 18th century. The house is made of brick with a painted ashlar sandstone facade, with elongated windows, a low-pitched gable roof, and an ornamental cornice. A side conservatory and small garden are found on the eastern side (the right hand side, as seen from the street). Separating the double parlors is a pendant arcade adorned with cast-iron bosses. The facade consists of three regular bays, with the primary entrance located on the western bay, reached by seven sandstone steps with matching cast-iron balustrades and newels. To the right of the entrance on the first floor are two floor-length windows with stone balconies and iron railings. The current exterior wooden window shutters were only added around 1975. The second and third floors of the facade each have three symmetrical windows with segmental arched lintels with a projecting cornice crowning the facade, supported by console brackets. The north elevation of the house to the rear is three bays wide, and features a small two-story masonry and frame addition on its west side. There is a frame connection to the brick garage building, erected in 1922. A brick wall was built around 1965, to border the garden to the east of the house. The side garden contains Japanese maple trees and a row of European hornbeam trees. Evergreens line the lawn. Interior The interior is furnished with luxurious materials such as marble and gilded mirrors. The primary entrance to the house leads to a small vestibule with a second set of paired doors, opening into the first-floor stair hall. The hall has original random width heart pine floor boards and plaster walls and ceiling and wooden baseboards and is adorned by plaster cornice ornaments the hall. An open-stringer staircase with elliptical handrails is located in the hallway, leading to the second floor; a passageway concealed behind it (as one enters the house) leads to the basement. At the rear of the hall is a small bathroom and an elevator, installed around 1965. Three sets of paired doors lead from the hall into the twin parlors and the dining room. The parlors are square in shape, and are separated by a suspended overhead pendant arcade. Eastlake-type iron gasoliers with two tiers of globes are suspended from the ceiling; these date from 1867 but have since been electrified. The floors are pine; the walls are plastered. The pendant arcade consists of two semi-circular arches and a central semi- elliptical arch, supported with cast-iron console brackets and pendant bosses. The original silver-plate doorknobs of the parlors were replaced in around 1960 with brass hardware. Pocket doors lead from the northern parlor to the dining room at the north end of the building. The mantelpiece in the dining room is made from marbleized slate and has an original pier mirror, located between the two windows on the dining room's north wall. Paired doors with glass panels lead to the polygonal room in the eastern wing which was once used as a library. The conservatory features original scalloped wooden shelves below the arched windows. The kitchen contains modern appliances. The east wing extension containing the conservatory and kitchen The second floor of the Bayne‚ÄìFowle House has a similar layout to that of the first, with three bedrooms and a bathroom to the south end of the hall and a laundry and bathroom at the north end. All bedrooms have wood flooring, plaster walls and plaster ceilings and fireplaces, two of which have marble mantelpieces with the third being metal and stone. The third floor contains three bedrooms, on the same plan as the second floor; all have diminutive marble mantelpieces.

Martin's cinematic version of this dreadful episode in American history is carried off rather well although, as always seems to be the case with films based on historical events, a lot of what transpires in the film never happened, which IS annoying to history buffs like myself. At least the film was shot during the winter in the Donner Pass near Truckee, California, which helped with the verisimilitude.\\" Horror News.Net gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Overall \\"The Donner Party\\" was a nice change from the hard core horror films that I usually watch. I have a feeling it will be shown in a lot of high school history classes in the future as there is really nothing offensive that would make it inappropriate for younger viewers. If you are in the mood for something a little different I suggest you give it a try. I also recommend that you have something to eat on hand while watching it as I was starving by the time I was done watching it. Then again, maybe I have issues.\\" See also * Cannibalism in popular culture *Survival film References External links  * Category:2009 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American drama films Category:Films set in California Category:Films shot in California Category:American independent films Category:Donner Party Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films about cannibalism ","title":"The Donner Party (2009 film)"},{"id":"26656490","text":"right British Reining is the Great Britain governing body for the equestrian sport of reining.

He translated the Bible into Mongolian. Biography A Congregationalist, Edward Stallybrass trained at Homerton College in London, a college for Free Church men who were at that time still barred from Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He was ordained at Stepney in 1816, and in the same year became engaged to Sarah Robinson (1789‚Äì1833). In 1817, they were married and both left for Russia the same year under the auspices of the London Missionary Society (LMS). =Mission in Russia= When Stallybrass arrived in Saint Petersburg in 1817, he was joined by Cornelius Rahmn (born 1785) from Gothenburg. Both men studied Russian, and in January 1818, having received authorisation to begin their missionary work, began the 4000-mile sledge journey to Irkutsk. On the way, they stopped in Moscow and were granted an audience by Alexander I of Russia, who told them that \\"he had given most positive orders...that every facility should be afforded\\" to the missionaries. Arriving in Irkutsk, they soon found the area unsuitable; Stallybrass visited various places before setting up a mission station in Selenginsk (modern-day Novoselenginsk) in 1819, among the Buryat people; he was joined by two Scotsmen, William Swan (born 1791) and Robert Yuille (born 1786). Rahmn's wife was unable to handle the Siberian climate, and the Rahmns moved to Sarepta. Stallybrass and his company moved their mission to Khodon in 1828, where Sarah died and was buried in 1833. In 1835 Stallybrass returned to England via Denmark. In Copenhagen he married Charlotte Ellah; afterward, he returned to Siberia, where Charlotte died in 1839. Work at the mission consisted of preaching, tract distribution, schools work and the translation of the Scriptures into the Buryat language. The mission was suppressed in 1840 by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church under Alexander's successor, Nicolas I. (The mission was later re- opened in 1870 with Scottish missionary James Gilmour, but was now based in Beijing.) Stallybrass returned to England in 1841 and left the LMS. =Return to England= After his return, Stallybrass was headmaster of the Boys' Mission School, Walthamstow, and pastor at Hampden Chapel, Hackney. From 1858 to 1870 he was a pastor at Burnham, Norfolk. He died on 25 July 1884 in Kent, and is buried in Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Translations Translating scripture into the local languages was an important task for the LMS missionaries. From 1836 to 1840, they worked on translating scripture and publishing it at a mission press. In 1838, William Swan reported that the work on these translations was progressing. In 1840, the Mongolian translation of the Old Testament was published, and in 1846, Stallybrass republished his and Swan's Mongolian translation of the New Testament, a revision of an 1824 translation, in London.

The aircraft of Aviastar-TU Airlines was on a ferry flight from Hurghada International Airport, Egypt to Domodedovo. There were no passengers on board and all eight crew survived the accident. Four crew members were seriously injured and taken to a hospital, while others suffered minor injuries. The accident was the first hull loss of a Tu-204 and the first hull loss for Aviastar-SP. Investigators determined the cause of the accident to be failure of the autopilot system and poor cockpit crew performance. Accident Aviastar-TU Airlines Flight 1906 was a ferry flight with only eight crew on board the aircraft. At 02:34 local time (23:34 on 21 March UTC), the plane crash-landed about 1450 meters short of runway 14R at Domodedovo airport while attempting to land at night in fog and poor visibility. The METAR for the airport at the time indicated wind direction 160¬∞ at 3 metres per second (5.8 kn) and visibility 100 metres (330 ft).Translation: METAR for Domodedovo International Airport issued at 21st of the month at 23:30 Zulu Time.

No significant change expected, end of METAR When the aircraft was on final, the pilots received several warnings from ATC that they were 1000‚Äì2000 meters to the left of the landing course, followed by another warning that they were too low. The pilots were confused about their location and were trying to figure it out based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device. According to the final investigation report, they also ignored automatic altitude readouts that started at 60 m above ground level and continued every 10 m. Nine seconds before the impact, the pilot contacted ATC to ask if they were off course, still concentrated on aligning the aircraft with the runway and not on its altitude. The pilots made no effort to stop the descent. The aircraft crash-landed in a birch forest at 23:35 local time, its left wing broke off, and the hull broke into two. There was no fire. Fire services arrived 30 minutes later. All crew members except the flight engineer who was seriously injured, escaped the crashed plane on their own. They could not immediately explain the reason of the crash, saying that it happened too fast. One of the crew members (purser) reached the nearby highway and stopped a car which took her to a hospital. Three other crew members also reached the highway and waited there for an ambulance. The two pilots suffered serious fractures and concussions; two others were taken to hospital where they were described as being in a satisfactory condition. The four remaining crew members were treated for minor injuries in Domodedovo's medical center. The accident resulted in the first hull loss of a Tupolev Tu-204 and the first hull loss for Aviastar-TU. Aircraft RA-64011, the aircraft involved The accident aircraft was Tupolev Tu-204-100, msn 1450741364011, registration RA-64011. The aircraft first flew as RA-64011 on 25 March 1993. On 3 September 1993 it entered service with Vnukovo Airlines. In January 2001, it was sold to Sibir Airlines. Before the crash, the aircraft was involved in two accidents. On 14 January 2002, the aircraft was flying from Frankfurt to Novosibirsk when it had to be diverted to Omsk due to poor weather at the destination. On approach, pilots reported fuel supply problems, followed by a flameout of both engines. The aircraft glided and landed successfully, but overran the runway and collided with the lights after the runway threshold. There were no injuries. The aircraft was repaired and continued service. From August 2006 the aircraft was leased to various Russian airlines ‚Äì Red Wings Airlines, Aviastar-TU, Interavia Airlines and then Aviastar-TU again. On 21 March 2010, one day before the crash, the aircraft was flying from Moscow to Hurghada with 210 passengers on board when it had to return to Moscow due to smoke in the cockpit. The accident was caused by a faulty heater in the cockpit, which was promptly repaired. Investigation Despite the adverse weather, Russian federal air transport service Rosaviatsia says the aircraft conducted a normal approach and \\"the crew did not report any failures, malfunctions, or the intention to make an emergency landing.\\" Russia's top investigator said on 22 March that the emergency landing may have been caused by an infringement of safety rules. The method the crew used to navigate the aircraft is a particular avenue of the investigation into the accident. Rosaviatsia says the flight recorders have been recovered and sent to the Interstate Aviation Committee () for analysis. Pending investigation, the airline ‚Äì Aviastar-TU ‚Äì was banned from carrying passengers with immediate effect, and its operations were investigated. Preliminary analysis of flight data has shown that the aircraft was not damaged in the air by any fire or explosion, and both engines operated until the impact.Engines 'operational' on crashed Tu-204: investigators, Flight Global, 23 March 2010 According to the chief of the Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency Alexander Neradko the \\"human factor\\" is the likely reason behind the crash.Human factor behind Tu-204 crash near Domodedovo airport, ITAR-TASS, 25 March 2010 On 30 March 2010, it was reported that the aircraft had 9 tonnes of fuel on board at the time of the crash. On approach to Domodedovo, the autopilot system failed as the aircraft descended through . The crew then flew the aircraft manually, but did not communicate the failure of the autoflight system to Air Traffic Control. Two months before the crash, the captain was disciplined for a minor violation (accidentally operating spoilers in flight during approach with flaps down). Final investigation report On 7 September 2010, the –ú–ê–ö released their final report into the accident. Some of their findings are: * There were no damage sustained to the aircraft in flight; * The aircraft had 9 tons of fuel on board and both engines were operating until the impact; * During the early stage of the descent, the two flight computers produced conflicting data that had to be corrected manually. This caused a furious response from the captain. * During the approach, at 5400 meters, the course mode of the autopilot disconnected due to radio altimeter failure, but the pilots did not notify ATC about this. They have repeatedly tried to switch it back on, with \\"increasing nervousness\\" and cursing. When crossing 4200 meters, the flight control computer failed too. * The pilot expected that the instrument landing system will not be available because of the failures, and stated to the crew: \\"So, pay attention, I'm going to have a hard time, so get together and watch everything\\". Nevertheless, he did not abort landing. This phrase was also noted by the investigators as an example of poor CRM. * The pilot repeatedly stated to the ATC that he was certified to land with vertical visibility of 30 m, whereas in fact he was only certified to land with vertical visibility of 60 m. During the approach, the vertical visibility ranged from 50 to 60 m. * The pilot also misinformed ATC that he is executing ILS approach, while in fact he was not. The ILS was likely operational, but the ILS frequency was not set because the pilots assumed it was not operational. When the ILS indicator is not in use, its needle is in the middle, same as when the aircraft is exactly following the glideslope. Therefore, the report suggests that the pilot may have believed that he is on the glideslope, even though he was significantly below it. * A holder for a portable GPS device was found in the cockpit, but the device itself was not found. The investigation report, based on CVR recordings, states that the pilots may have relied on the portable GPS device to understand their location. * The report suggests that during the final minutes of the flight, all three pilots were focused on correcting the horizontal deviation from the landing course and did not pay attention to the altitude. =Cause= The report states the following reason of the crash: > The cause of the incident with Tu-204-100 registered RA-64011 during the > approach for landing in weather conditions that did not meet the minima > permitted for this aircraft type and with fully operational equipment was > failure to make a go-around decision and continued descent despite no visual > contact with the ground, which has caused an impact with trees and ground in > a controlled flight into terrain. The report listed the following contributing factors: * Insufficient training for landing in adverse weather conditions; * Unsatisfactory CRM; * Autopilot failure; * Failure to divert to another airport; * Failure to go around; * Unsatisfactory communication between crew members. Criminal case In March 2011, both pilots (Aleksandr Kosyakov and Aleksey Mikhailovsky) were sentenced to one-year suspended prison term.

He has the unique distinction of being the only Vice- Chancellor (2002‚Äì05) of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) who was also a student (1963‚Äì68) and faculty (1964‚Äì92) at that institution. From 1992 to 2002, Rao was the Director of the National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur. After his tenure as Vice-Chancellor of B.H.U., in 2005, he took the reins of the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) as its first Vice-Chancellor. He was to serve DIAT until his superannuation in 2007. From 2007 till the end, Rao was a Raja Ramanna Fellow at the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials, in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Early years Rao was born on 21 March 1942 to S. R. Narayanaswamy Naidu and Laxmi Bai at Kavutavaram in the Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh. His father Narayanaswamy Naidu, was a government servant and retired as Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies while his mother, Laxmi Bai was also educated and studied up to matriculation when very few women were going to school. From his mother's side, Rao is the nephew of Narla Venkateswara Rao, a Telugu language writer, journalist and politician from Andhra Pradesh, Narla Gowri Shankar Rao, an assistant accountant-general (retired) in the Central Government of India, and Narla Tata Rao, a doyen of the power sector in India and a former chairman of the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board. For the early part of his life, Rao's parents home-schooled him and admitted him to the seventh grade directly. He completed formal school at the early age of 13. Thereafter, he went on to study intermediate at the newly established Andhra Loyola College at Vijayawada and moved over to Osmania University, Hyderabad for higher education. At the young age of 19 years, in 1961, Rao graduated with a master's degree in Physics from the Osmania University in Hyderabad India. Thereafter, in 1963, Rao graduated from the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, with a B.E. degree in Metallurgy. During his second year at I.I.Sc Bangalore, Rao was supported by the Dorabji Tata Trust. His long association with the Banaras Hindu University (B.H.U) began soon afterwards, when his mentor T.R. Anantharaman encouraged him to enroll in the doctoral program at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at B.H.U (now Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi). Rao's pioneering doctoral dissertation in Rapid Solidification laid the foundation for the research in this area in India. He obtained his MSc in 1965 and PhD in 1968. Research contributions Rao pioneered research activities in the area of rapid solidification, an area pertaining to the solidification of liquids at the rate of a million degrees per second, in India in the mid 1960s. Such a process leads to the formation of extensive solid solutions, metastable intermediate phases and metallic glasses. He was the first outside the United States of America to conduct research in this technologically important area. Rao discovered novel intermetallic phases and also the hitherto unexpected phases with 5-fold rotational symmetry. His interests then shifted to identifying the theoretical basis of the formation of such phases and he began to model their formation from a thermodynamic standpoint. Some of the expressions developed for the free energy of undercooled liquids are being used extensively by modellers. The techniques of rapid solidification which were once a matter of scientific curiosity have now been industrially exploited by the advanced countries in the form of novel metallic glass-based transformer core materials, fine grained high strength alloys, new hard magnetic materials etc. Many noteworthy contributions made by Rao, his students and erstwhile colleagues at the Banaras Hindu University have brought immense recognition to India as an important centre for rapid solidification studies. In the past decade, Rao's interests shifted to the synthesis of materials by following routes which are very similar to those practised by living organisms. This new area of investigation aptly called biomimetics has the potential of avoiding environmental pollution and energy expenditure. Most methods operate at room temperature and ambient pressure. Prof. Ramachandra Rao and his students and colleagues have successfully synthesised calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxy apatite and some metallic nanocrystals through this route. The calcium hydroxy apatite has the potential for prosthetic applications. Animal studies involving rabbits have been conducted at the Banaras Hindu University. One of Rao's students has commercialised the apatite powders for dental applications. Besides biomimetics he has also worked on ceramic materials and their production by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS). Other routes for nanomaterial synthesis were also explored. Studies were also conducted on natural composite materials like bamboo and synthetic composites and steels. Since retirement Rao had been pursuing theoretical studies involving the specific heats of about eleven metals which undergo the hexagonal to body centred cubic phase transformation. He and his associates had discovered some systematics in the thermodynamic properties of these metals but a real solution to the problem has evaded them for over 25 years. = Association with national and international bodies = Rao was a fellow of all four science and engineering academies of the country: Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India, and Indian National Academy of Engineering. He was also a fellow of The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World. He served in the council of Indian National Science Academy from 1996‚Äì98 and was serving vice- president when he died. He was also a fellow of the Institution of Engineers. He played pivoted role in the societies associated with his profession.

Early life Phelps was born in Haverhill, Essex County, Massachusetts on September 16, 1832. He was the only child of the Rev. Dudley Phelps (1797‚Äì1849), a Congregational clergyman, and Ann (n√©e Kinsman) Phelps (1808‚Äì1834). He attended Andover Theologigal Seminary, and graduated from Yale College in 1853. Career After graduation from Yale, he studied law in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire and Westchester County, New York, and was admitted to the bar in 1855 in Poughkeepsie, New York. In 1856, he removed to New York City and practiced law there in partnership with his Yale classmate Sherman W. Knevals. From 1866 to 1870, Phelps was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In 1869, he was sent to North Carolina to take charge of the proceedings against the officers of the USS Hornet, charged with a violation of the Neutrality laws. In 1872, he formed a new law firm \\"Arthur, Phelps, Knevals & Ransom\\" with Chester A. Arthur, his old partner Knevals, and Rastus S. Ransom, who served as Surrogate of New York from 1887 to 1893. In November 1872, Phelps was elected on the Republican ticket New York County District Attorney, and remained in office until his death, being re-elected in 1875 and 1878. In 1875, Carlotta Frances Shotwell testified before the Assembly Committee on Crime in New York City about the legal abuses in her 1874 trial.

It was acquired in 1893 by the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon where it has been conserved. The painting shows a young woman who is sitting in the nature, surrounded with flowers and butterflies. She has two flower bouquets in her hands: one laid down on her knees, composed of buttercups, daisies and cornflowers, the other one held vertically is composed of poppies. In the background, the landscape shows a verdant plains and the mountains of the Bugey region. The sky is blue, with some white clouds near the mountains, and indicates that the scene probably takes place in the late afternoon. Each flower, as well as the woman's face, are painted with an extremely accuracy, the colors used are sweet and some melancholy emanates from the scene. The look of the young woman seems to contain a hint of seriousness. The painting was notably exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1845 and at the Exposition Universelle (1855), also in Paris, among other exhibitions. It was restored in 1974. Larousse Encyclopedia describes this work as \\"well-balanced\\". However, it is unclear if the painting is the portrait of a woman known by Janmot, but the clothes she wears do not comply with her time, but recall the portraits of the Italian Renaissance. This may be a painting of flowers, as this type of art was very popular in Lyon in the 19th century. Another theory is that the young woman is the goddess Flora and is in thought about the transience of time.

The death of sensations or strange episodes in domestic monorail history. date back to the 19th century. Russia was a pioneer in the design and construction of monorails, from early horse-drawn models to later electrical and magnetic levitation systems. Early designs The first Russian monorail was built by Ivan Elmanov in Myachkovo village, near Moscow in 1820. In this \\"road on pillars\\", horses pulled railroad carriages placed on a horizontal beam. The wheels were mounted on the beam, not on the carriages. Elmanov could not find investors to fund for his project, and stopped working on the monorail. In 1821, Henry Palmer patented his monorail design in the UK. In 1836, Prince Beloselsky-Belozersky proposed another monorail design which contained two rows of wheels on mounted on a pillar structure. In 1872, a monorail designed by Lyarsky was shown at a polytechnic exhibition in Moscow. In 1874, Alexei Khludov constructed a monorail for transporting wood. Electric monorails In March 1895, Russian engineer Ippolit Romanov built a prototype of an electric monorail in Odessa, modern-day Ukraine. In 1897, he presented a functional model of his monorail at the meeting of Russian technological society. This idea was approved by the society, and an experimental electric monorail was built in 1899. In 1900, Empress Maria Fedorovna approved the building of an long electric monorail in Gatchina. The monorail was tested on 25 June 1900. The monorail carriage could be loaded with up to and moved at a speed of . In 1904 Russian engineer Koshkin in collaboration with Romanov designed a monorail that would connect St Petersburg and Moscow. The proposed train speed was up to . This ambitious project was approved by the Ministry of Roads, but was not financed. A similar proposal of a monorail from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod was not funded, as well. In 1911, professor of Tomsk Technological Institute B.P. Vainberg invented a train on an electromagnetic support that was driven by linear synchronous electrical motor. This design was similar to the magnetic monorail built by Emile Bachelet in France in 1910. Vainberg's experimental model permitted to transfer 10 kg carriages. In 1911-1913 Vainberg experimented with his model, and then proposed building an experimental track in which trains would move at a speed of 800‚Äì1000 km/h. This project was not realized. Soviet era In 1921, a construction of a monorail connecting Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo was commenced. Petr Petrovich Shklovskiy was the author of that project. The monorail was planned to have gyroscopic stabilization (first patented by Brennan in 1903). The proposed monorail train consisted of a motor car and a 50-seat passenger car. The travel speed was supposed to reach 150 km/h. A 12 km monorail track was constructed in 4 months, and a Saint Petersburg factory was contracted to build a train. In May 1922, the project funding ceased. Shilovskiy went to the Great Britain where he worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company. In the 1920-1930s theoretical and practical works on monorails were conducted by Vyacheslav Petrovich Tikhostsky and his colleagues. Several experimental monorails were built: Sipyaginskaya, Solotchinskaya, Lyskovskaya and Redkinskaya. In the 1950s a monorail construction project was launched in Kamchatka, but only an experimental line was built. From mid 1950s to 1960s passenger monorails were planned for Karaganda, Magnitogorsk and Miass, but their construction did not begin. In the 1950s a railway that combined features of a monorail and a cable car was proposed for Volzhskaya hydro-electric power station. A similar design was proposed in 1961 by I. Ivanova for public transportation. In 1967 scientists of Kiev Polytechnic Institute jointly with engineers of Dzerzhinsky plant pioneered the monorail with linear asynchronous motor. The construction of a circular line at the exhibition of modern technologies in Kiev was funded by Ukrainian government. Similar monorails were built in Germany in 1969. Intensive research on magnetic monorails was conducted in the Soviet Union in the 1970-1980s. In 1977 the first in the world monorail with magnetic support was planned in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. This plan was not fulfilled. 1991-present In 2004 the Moscow Monorail opened in Russia's capital.

It is often considered to be the same species as the more common Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis).  Description  The Bering cisco has an elongate, compressed body. It is silvery-coloured, with a brownish or greenish back. Its pelvic and pectoral fins are almost clear, and its other fins are spotted white. It is distinguished from the Arctic cisco by its smaller number of gill rakers. It reaches a maximum length of .  Distribution  The Bering cisco is found in Alaska from Cook Inlet on the south coast to Oliktok Point on the Arctic coast. It occurs on the Yukon River as far upstream as Dawson City, on the Porcupine River, and in the lakes of the Brooks Range. There are some reports of Bering ciscoes from the Chukchi Peninsula and the Kamchatka Peninsula, these presumably being migrants from Alaska.  Ecology  The Bering cisco is usually found in river mouths, brackish lagoons, and coastal waters, but may penetrate far upstream. Most populations are anadromous, migrating as far as inland to spawn during the late summer. In most of its range, the Bering cisco is abundant. Its habitats are mostly remote and pristine, and it has no known threats. In rivers, it may be the most abundant migratory fish. In estuaries, the Bering cisco is an important \\"keystone species\\", serving as an important source of food for larger animals. The Bering cisco is taken commercially, and sold as \\"white trout\\". In New York, smoked Bering ciscoes are popular, and are esteemed for their creamy flesh. They are sold instead of the usual holiday food of Great Lakes whitefishes. Subsistence fishermen also take the Bering cisco in small numbers, as do commercial fishermen fishing for salmon during its migration. The Bering cisco feeds on amphipods and other invertebrates and small fish such as sculpins. It migrates to clear and shallow streams in the late summer, not feeding during migration. Not eating during migration is typical among salmon, but rare in whitefishes.Reist, J. D.; R. A. Bodaly, R. J. P. Fudge, K. J. Cash, and T. V. Stevens (1987). \\"External scarring of whitefish, Coregonus nasus and C. clupeaformis complex, from the western Northwest Territories, Canada\\". Canadian Journal of Zoology 65(5): 1230‚Äì1239. . Spawning occurs in clear, cool streams with 1 to 3 inch gravel. A year after hatching, young ciscoes drift downstream to estuaries. The Bering cisco becomes sexually mature when it is four to nine years old.

There are two distinct types of risk tools identified by their approach: market-level tools using the capital asset pricing model (CAP-M) and component-level tools with probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). Market-level tools use market forces to make risk decisions between securities. Component-level tools use the functions of probability and impact of individual risks to make decisions between resource allocations. ISO/IEC 31010 (Risk assessment techniques) has a detailed but non-exhaustive list of tools and techniques available for assessing risk. Market-level (CAP-M) CAP-M uses market or economic statistics and assumptions to determine the appropriate required rate of return of an asset, given that asset's non-diversifiable risk. Component- level (PRA) Probabilistic risk assessment is often used in project risk management. These tools are applications of PRA and allow planners to explicitly address uncertainty by identifying and generating metrics, parameterizing, prioritizing, and developing responses, and tracking risk from components, tasks or costs. PRA, also called Likelihood-Consequence or Probability-Impact, is based upon single-point estimates of probability of occurrence, initiating event frequency, and recovery success (e.g., human intervention) of a specific consequence (e.g., cost or schedule delay). =Notable PRA tools and techniques= * Event chain methodology ‚Äì A method of managing risk and uncertainties affecting project schedules * Risk register ‚Äì A project planning and organizational risk assessment tool.

The Council expressed shock at the shooting down of a plane carrying the President of Rwanda Juv√©nal Habyarimana and President of Burundi Cyprien Ntaryamira on 6 April 1994. Following this, there was an outbreak of widespread violence in which thousands died and resulted in the displacement of a significant number of the Rwandese population both in Rwanda and neighbouring countries, and an increase in looting, banditry and breakdown of law and order. There was concern for the safety of UNAMIR and other United Nations and humanitarian personnel who were assisting in the implementation of the peace process and distributing humanitarian aid. The Security Council deplored the incident in which the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed and the violence which claimed the lives of the first minister, cabinet ministers, officials and thousands of civilians. Violence around Kigali and attacks on UNAMIR in particular were condemned. A ceasefire was demanded between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and an end to the violence engulfing the country. In this regard, the size of UNAMIR was reduced and its mandate was adjusted as follows: :(a) to mediate a ceasefire; :(b) to assist in the resumption of humanitarian relief operations; :(c) to monitor and report on developments in Rwanda, including on civilians who sought refuge with UNAMIR. It was decided that the mandate of UNAMIR would be kept under review in light of developments and recommendations by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The Arusha Accords remained the only settlement of the conflict in Rwanda, with the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) urged to continue efforts in the peace process. The international community was called upon to continue providing humanitarian aid. Finally, the Secretary-General was requested to report on the situation with 15 days to the Council.

As people age, they experience neurodegeneration in the retina and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Less light reaches the back of the eyes because the pupils decrease in size as you age, the lens inside your eye becomes thicker, and the lens scatters more light, causing objects and colors to appear less vivid.Lighting the Way: A Key to Independence. http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/lightHealth/AARP/senior/helpingOlderAdults/agingEye.asp These symptoms are particularly common with persons having alzheimer's disease. Older people also have reduced levels of retinal illuminance, such as having smaller pupils and less transparent crystalline lenses. Furthermore, as an individual ages, they begins to lose retinal neurons, which not only compromises the ability to see but also to register a robust daily pattern of light-dark that is needed to maintain biological rhythms. The 24-hour light- dark cycle is the most important external stimulus for regulating the timing of the circadian cycle. In addition to the aging eye, lighting designers need to consider the unique lifestyle needs of the elderly. It is especially important to provide strong illumination in stairwells to prevent slip and trips, for example. Due to physical limitations, they may be deprived of natural sunlight. Many nursing homes and assisted living facilities have dim, constant light levels and poor light spectra, often caused by extensive use of fluorescent lighting. Although widely used in offices and factories, it is unsuitable for clinics and homes. This can cause disruption of the body‚Äôs circadian rhythms, which can potentially lead to negative health effects. Flicker from the bulbs can be disturbing, especially for epilepsy patients, and the colour rendition is poor when compared with incandescent bulbs. Health concerns commuter train catering for mainly seated passengers =Accident sensitivity= A 230-volt incandescent light bulb, which gives strong, steady light ideal for illumination. Low lighting levels may contribute to slips, trips and falls in the elderly by lowering visibility of hazards such as unexpected steps, or sudden changes in floor surfaces. Obstacles to a safe passage may include clutter or ill-placed furniture, which can cause a slip or a trip. Grab bars and stair rails are obvious aids but must be visible to the user, and so such environments demand strong lighting. Falls of elderly people causes a significant number of hip joint fractures, replacement of which is a serious medical event. Depending on fall configuration, other bones may be fractured. Head injury is also possible. Falls from ladders are very common among the elderly, especially men, with potentially worse injuries owing to the greater heights involved. Fall prevention is thus an important consideration in designing homes for the elderly, and one of the most critical parts of that design process is supplying strong and effective lighting. Thus, when switched on, lights should react instantaneously, so the user is not surprised by a hidden obstacle as they moves into a kitchen or bathroom, for example. In such a case, incandescent light bulbs are preferred over fluorescent lighting, because they react instantaneously while a CFL takes time to warm up and become bright. Incandescent light bulbs also offer much greater illuminance than many other light sources, are relatively low cost and easy to install. Higher lighting levels enable users to see potential hazards before they need to take avoiding action, and so negotiate them safely and easily. Excellent colour rendering (as measured by the Colour rendering index) by such incandescent light also helps users identify colours correctly. Halogen bulbs are also available for greater efficiency, as are rough service bulbs to avoid discriminatory regulations, especially in the EU. No doubt LED lights will become an alternative source of high quality lighting in the future, but in 2013 they remain expensive for domestic use. Rough service bulbs are available in sizes up to 200 watt in all varieties of fittings. Although lifetime is generally lower than for CFLs, they are replaced easily. But lighting should also be free from glare and highlights so as not to distract or even temporarily blind the user. Some skill is needed to meet the several criteria governing good lighting systems, especially for senior citizens and patients. Lighting ergonomics attempts to address the problem of designing safe light environments as well as specific lighting products. = Circadian entrainment = Underlying the foundation of light as therapy is the understanding that all living organisms have biological rhythms that repeat approximately in 24-hour cycles, in accordance with the cycle of sunlight. The most prominent way to measure whether a body is entrained in this circadian cycle is by measuring melatonin secretion, cortisol, and core body temperature. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates melatonin and temperature and typically produces melatonin at night. Melatonin informs the body when it is time to sleep. When circadian cycles become disrupted (due either to too little light or too much light at the wrong time of day), melatonin is produced at disrupted times. This causes an individual to experience disrupted sleep patterns, which in turn causes numerous health issues to arise. The key external stimulus is variation in light and darkness over the course of the day. The elderly are at high risk for physical ailments when their circadian cycles are disrupted. Impairment of these SCN-mediated circadian rhythms becomes increasingly common with advancing age, diminished health, and Alzheimer's disease, thereby contributing to the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in these populations. =Sleep disorders= Surveys show that 40 to 70 percent of those 65 years old and older suffer from chronic sleep disturbances. The elderly tend to go to bed early in the evening and wake earlier in the morning than younger adults. Furthermore, the elderly often wake several times throughout the night and have difficulty falling asleep. They are prone to taking numerous naps during the day. Furthermore, constant lighting in assisted living facilities has been demonstrated to impair sleep ability.Figueiro M, Rea M. New research in the light and health field is expanding the possibilities for LED lighting in healthcare environments: CIE Midterm Meeting Conference Proceedings. Leon, Spain, 2005. In persons with Alzheimer's Disease, sleep disturbances are much more frequent and tend to be more severe. These patients exhibit intermittent sleep throughout the 24-hour day, instead of consolidated sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. Poor sleep is one of the largest complaints among the elderly, and poor sleep can be linked to a wide variety of problems including increased cardiovascular problems, disruption of endocrine functions, decline of immune functions, stability problems, and poor cognition. Studies have shown that when the elderly are exposed to high circadian light levels during the day and dim circadian levels at night, their sleep duration and efficiency has significantly improved.Figueiro MG, Bierman A, Bullough JD, Rea MS. 2009. A personal light-treatment device for possibly improving sleep quality in the elderly: Dynamics of nocturnal melatonin suppression at two exposure levels. Chronobiology International. 26(4):726-739. http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/lightHealth/projects/Elderly.asp?id=167 =Depression= Bright light therapy is a common treatment for seasonal affective disorder and for circadian rhythm sleep disorders The elderly frequently cite depression as a notable ailment. Many researchers have linked the depression to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and seasonal mood variations have been linked to lack of light. (SAD is markedly more frequent in extreme latitudes, such as the arctic and in Finland). Light therapy in the form of light boxes are a frequent non-drug treatment for SAD. Several preliminary studies have shown that light therapy is a positive treatment for depressive symptoms for older persons although more studies need to be done in this area. Measuring light Typical measurements of light have used a Dosimeter. Dosimeters measure an individual's or an object's exposure to something in the environment, such as light dosimeters and ultraviolet dosimeters. In order to specifically measure the amount of light entering the eye, personal circadian light meter called the Daysimeter has been developed. This is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light (intensity, spectrum, timing, and duration) entering the eye that affects the human body's clock. The device is a small, head-mounted device which measures an individual's daily rest and activity patterns, as well as exposure to circadian light‚Äîshort-wavelength light, particularly natural light from the blue sky‚Äîthat stimulates the circadian system. The device measures activity and light together at regular time intervals and electronically stores and logs its operating temperature. The Daysimeter can gather data for up to 30 days for analysis. Applications Providing light early in the evening can help seniors sleep better at night and be more alert during the day because the light delays the biological, circadian clock.Murphy PJ, Campbell SS. 1996. Enhanced performance in elderly subjects following bright light treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. J Sleep Res. 5(3):165-72. Many studies have shown that when the elderly are exposed to bright white light, the elderly individual saw improved sleep efficiency.Okawa M, Mishima K, Hishikawa Y, Hozumi S, Hori H 1993. Sleep disorder in elderly patients with dementia and trials of new treatments -- enforcement of social interaction and bright light therapy. In: Vm Kumar, HN Mallick, U Nayar: Sleep Wakefulness. New Delhi: Wiley Eastern, 1993. A recent study also demonstrated that exposure to 30 lx of blue light from LEDs in the evening (peaking at 470 nm at the eye for two hours) increased sleep efficiency for older adults who previously had difficulty sleeping. Providing white light and blue light has even greater impact for those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). So far, two lighting methods have been shown to improve nighttime sleep in AD patients: (1) exposure to bright white light (at least 2500 lx and as high as 8000 lx at the cornea) for at least one hour in the morning, for two weeks and (2) exposure to 30 lx of blue light from LEDs, peaking at 470 nm at the eye for two hours. The light, or the better sleep, also helped to reduce agitated behavior such as pacing, aggressiveness, and speaking loudly. Evening exposure to bright white light (1500 to 2000 lx at the cornea) for two hours decreased nocturnal activity and severity of evening agitation. Daylight is an ideal light source because it provides high circadian stimulation during the day. Daylight also has the correct intensity and spectrum needed to stimulate the circadian systems. Architectural designs should consider adding sun rooms, skylights, patios, and courtyards into the design of facilities for the elderly. Architects can also select lighting fixtures that emit an array of blue light LEDS (Œªmax=470 nm) which deliver at least 30 lux at the corner. Lighting schemes that have timers are also helpful in providing the right type of light at the right type of day. Nightlights are also helpful in reducing falls and injuries and, at the same time, help the elderly to maintain sleep. Falls are a major concern with the elderly; they threaten their independence and risk further health complications. Lighting systems can help seniors maintain balance and stability.Postural Control and Stability for Seniors. http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/resources/newsroom/pdf/2007/Postural8511.pdf Furthermore, sleep deprivation can contribute to decreased postural control.Brassington GS, King AC, Bliwise DL. Sleep problems as a risk factor for falls in a sample community-dwelling adults aged 64‚Äì99 years. J. Am. Ger. Soc. 2000; 48(10): 1234‚Äì40. Nightlights that accent horizontal and vertical spaces, such as soft lighting above a doorway or at the foot of a bed, can reduce the risk of falls without disturbing sleep.

He was nicknamed the \\"Doughnut King.\\"  Biography  Ted Ngoy was born in the Cambodian village of Sisophon near the country's border with Thailand. He was raised by his mother, who was from Shantou, Guangdong, and who only spoke Chinese. =Love Story= In 1967, Ngoy was sent by his mother to study in the capital, Phnom Penh, where he fell in love with Suganthini Khoeun, the daughter of a high- ranking government official. Despite her sheltered life and being forbidden from having friends or leaving the house other than for school, Ngoy fell in love. Ngoy lived in a small attic apartment a couple blocks away from the Khoeun mansion and would play flute music at night to woo Suganthini. The two eventually began a secret correspondence via letters delivered by the Khoeun family maid. One night, Ngoy devised a plan to sneak into the heavily guarded mansion that housed Suganthini, allowing the couple to meet for the first time. Ngoy spent a total of 45 days in the mansion before being discovered by Suganthini's parents and subsequently kicked out. Khoeun's parents denied Ngoy's suitability as a mate for their daughter due to his lower social class, and instructed Ngoy to break off the relationship with Suganthini at a relative's home. Suganthini's parents and cousins hid behind curtains in the home to ensure Ngoy would break off the relationship. Shortly after reiterating what he was forced to say, he admitted that what was said was a lie and stabbed himself in the stomach. The Khoeuns immediately sent for an ambulance for Ngoy and had Suganthini locked in her room for days following the event. Distraught at the turn of events, Suganthini overdosed on sleeping pills and fell into a coma, causing her parents to relent to the union shortly after the couple recovered. The couple were wed shortly after and had three children.http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/19/local/me-donutking19 =Military Career and Immigrations to the United States= Ngoy worked at various jobs, including as a travel agent and tour guide, before joining the military in 1970. Through the maneuvering of his brother-in-law, chief of police and briefly future president of Cambodia, Sak Sutsakhan, Ngoy was promoted to the rank of major and appointed military attache at Cambodia's embassy in Thailand. In 1975, Ngoy fled the Khmer Rouge with his wife and three children to Camp Pendleton. =Doughnut King= Ngoy secured work as a janitor with Peace Lutheran Church in Tustin, California. While working a second job at a gas station, Ngoy took notice of a busy local doughnut shop and inquired of its operators about learning the business. He subsequently received training through an affirmative action program to increase minority hiring within the Winchell's chain of doughnut shops, and managed a store in Newport Beach where he employed his wife and nephew. By 1977 he was able to purchase his first doughnut shop, Christy's Doughnuts, in La Habra. Despite never really being a huge success under the previous owners, Christy's became popular under the ownership of the Ngoys. The Ngoys decided to keep uniformity amongst their shops, naming subsequent acquisitions Christy's. Ngoy bought additional doughnut shops in Orange County. He became tired running doughnut shops on his own and decided to train and lease shops to his relatives and employ Cambodian refugees. He saw an opportunity to expand his business and help the large number of poor, unassimilated Cambodians who had fled the Khmer Rouge to the United States. By 1987, Ngoy owned 32 Christy's Doughnuts locations, largely accomplished by living out of a motorhome allowing him and his family to travel up and down the state of California establishing new locations. Ngoy's fortunes improved dramatically, such that by the mid-1980s Ngoy had amassed millions of dollars through his expanding doughnut shop empire, reported as 50 locations throughout California. In 1985, Ngoy and his wife became American citizens assuming the American names of Ted and Christy, respectively, and were enjoying a lavish lifestyle including a million dollar home at Lake Mission Viejo, a vacation home in Big Bear, expensive cars, and vacations to Europe. Ngoy had become an example to other Cambodian immigrants, who began to follow his business model for their own entrepreneurial endeavors. Ngoy also involved himself in American politics, joining the Republican Party and hosting fundraisers for George H.W. Bush and encouraged fellow Cambodian immigrants to support the GOP. =Decline= Despite the wealth he had amassed and his importance within his community, Ngoy felt dissatisfied, remarking that he had \\"No political life, no religious life, just work, work.\\" In 1977, the Ngoys took a trip to Las Vegas where Ted saw Elvis Presley at his last performance before his death. It was here that Ngoy had his first taste of gambling while placing bets at the Blackjack tables. Ngoy would make a habit of returning monthly to watch performers such as Tom Jones, Diana Ross and Wayne Newton and indulging in the incentives pit bosses of major casinos offered all the while spending even larger sums at the card tables. This caused tension in the Ngoy household, being the center of many arguments between Ngoy and his wife. Ngoy would often visit Las Vegas for a period of a week, unbeknownst to his wife. He would forge her signature on checks and even borrow money from relatives who leased stores from him. When he was unable to pay back his debt, he would sign over his store to them. Once a paragon in the community, refugees now avoided him for fear of being asked for a loan. Ngoy attempted Gambler's Anonymous, but denies its help with his situation stating that when he went to meetings \\"I cry, everybody cry. After cry, go back gambling.\\" Ngoy's gambling had progressed from the card tables to placing bets on sports games with Cambodian bookies. After a particularly devastating gambling loss in 1990, Ngoy flew to Washington, D.C. and joined a Buddhist monastery where he spent a month meditating. Following his time in the nation's capital, Ngoy spent time in a monastery in the Thai countryside where he spent his morning begging for alms. Upon his return to Orange County, Ngoy began gambling harder than ever stating \\"Monks cannot help me, Buddha cannot help me.\\" =Political career= After the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1993, Ngoy returned to Cambodia for the country's first elections. He formed the Free Development Republican Party ahead of the country‚Äôs UN-backed elections believing that he could show others the path to wealth and hoping that in being a politician his gambling addiction would be stymied. He did not fare well in either the 1993 or 1998 parliamentary elections, but his friend, Prime Minister Hun Sen, made him an advisor on commerce and agriculture. When his wife returned to California for the birthday of a grandchild in 1999, Ngoy began an affair with a young woman, serving as the final straw between him and his wife, Christy. She divorced him soon after and has not since returned to Cambodia. Ngoy's political career ended in 2002 after breaking with two powerful allies, the commerce minister and the head of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce. He dissolved his party and accused the government of corruption. The next day, he flew back to Los Angeles leaving behind his new wife and their two children. By 2005, after a failed political career in Cambodia, Ngoy was penniless and living on the porch of a fellow Parkcrest Christian Church parishioner's mobile home. In 2013, he was living in Phnom Penh working in the real estate business.

They have short, hollow fangs on their maxillary bones, with inlets at the bases and outlets near their tips. The venom is ducted to the inlet and forced through the hole at the tip of the fang. They are similar to another venomous snake, the blue Malayan coral snake (Calliophis bivirgata) and the nonvenomous red-headed reed snake (Calamaria schlegeli). Distribution and habitat The red-headed krait occurs in southern Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo, and a number of Malaysian (Pulau Tioman) and Indonesian islands (Bangka, Sumatra, Java, Belitung [=Billiton]). The subspecies B. f. baluensis is found in Sabah (Borneo). Red-headed kraits inhabit the rain forests in mountainous and hilly regions. They are hardly ever to be found in proximity to human habitations. Behaviour They are nocturnal and partially aquatic. Once thought to feed primarily on other snakes, they are known to include skinks, lizards, frogs, caecilians, small mammals, and snake eggs in their diets. Despite their intrinsic deadliness, they are not usually considered of high risk to humans in the daytime. Variously described as sluggish, lethargic, and extremely inoffensive, they often remain hidden during the day and, when disturbed, press their heads into the ground or hide them in the flattened or rolled coils of their bodies. During the night, they are active and extremely dangerous. Venom The red-headed krait is an extremely venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles are the first to suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20 minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed Œ∫-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1976. The house was built by John Wise, a prominent entrepreneur, who constructed the building in the late eighteenth-century Georgian architectural style. History The Lloyd House was built in 1796-97 by John Wise. It was a high status building and President George Washington was a guest there on one occasion. In 1810, Wise sold the house to Jacob Hoffman, who would later become Mayor of Alexandria. In 1824, Hoffman sold the home to James Hooe for $13,000. After his death in 1826, his widow rented out the house to an educator, Benjamin Hallowell, who used the building as a schoolhouse. When Hooe's widow died in 1831, it was sold to John Lloyd. John Lloyd's wife was the cousin of Robert E. Lee, who had been a student at the school. The Lloyd family owned the property for over 100 years until the 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, it fell into ruin, and in 1956 proposals were made to gut the building; there were opposed by the Historic Alexandria Foundation. A businessman from Wyoming, Robert V. New, bought the house, saving it from being destroyed, and financed its major renovation. Fully restored, in 1968 Lloyd House was sold to the City of Alexandria. Robert E. Lee who was a student at Lloyd House when it was a school in the 1820s. Lloyd House currently serves as the administrative headquarters for the Office of Historic Alexandria, a department of the City of Alexandria government. The department is dedicated to the collection and preservation of historic sites, and since 1976 the building has also housed important historical and genealogical collections which are part of the Alexandria Library. Shelving space was tripled at Lloyd House in order to store the collection which has over 4,000 books. Architecture The Lloyd House is characteristic of the early post- colonial style in Virginia and is a fine example of Federal domestic architecture. It is a two-story rectangular brick building with a five-bay front on the Washington street side, four chimneys, and a gabled roof with three dormers. The central entrance is solid wood and is flanked by two Doric pilasters. When the house was renovated in the early 1960s, the original 18th- century Flemish bond masonry on the exterior was damaged and repainted with Portland cement and the original interior pine boards were covered with painted hardwood flooring.

A deck truss design, it is owned and operated by the New Brunswick Southern Railway. Aerial image of the bridge History The first railway bridge over the St. Croix River at this location was opened in October 1871 by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Governor General of Canada Lord Lisgar on the completion of the European and North American Railway (E&NA;) between Bangor, Maine, and Saint John, New Brunswick. Railway bridges at this location endured divided ownership from 1871 until 1974. The New Brunswick portion of the E&NA; was reorganized as the Western Extension and later folded into the New Brunswick Railway. The Maine portion of the E&NA; was leased to the Maine Central Railroad in 1882. In 1889, MEC granted operating rights over its tracks, Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro, to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1955, MEC purchased the E&NA; from its shareholders and in 1974 sold the \\"joint\\" line, including its portion of the Saint Croix‚ÄìVanceboro Railway Bridge, to the CPR. On January 1, 1995, the CPR sold the line to the New Brunswick Southern Railway. The through truss bridge was replaced with the current deck truss design in the mid-20th century. 1915 sabotage attempt On February 2, 1915, Lt. Werner Horn, a German army reservist, bombed the international railway bridge crossing the St. Croix River from Vanceboro into Canada in an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the CPR line across Maine; it was alleged that the railway was being used to transport materiel across the then-neutral United States territory.

On 11 October of that year Prince Friedrich was promoted to Major General. In 1795, the prince took part in the successful assault on Mainz (29 October) and was victorious in the action at Bacharach (17 December). In 1796 he served in Germany under Archduke Charles and was present at the Battle of W√ºrzburg as a cavalry brigade commander. In 1799, the prince fought on the Rhine as a brigade commander in Lieutenant Field Marsh Johann Sigismund, Count Riesch's cavalry division and was distinguished in the battle of Stockach, on 25‚Äì26 March, when his Cuirassiers broke and scattered the reserve cavalry division of Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul. On 3 November, on his own initiative, he attacked the French under Michel Ney at L√∂chgau-Erligheim on the River Enz, defeating them decisively, and driving them west to Sinsheim. This action convinced Fran√ßois Lecourbe, French commander of the siege of the at Philippsburg, to withdraw. For the prince's action on the Enz, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 21 November 1799.

On 5 November, he commanded an Austrian cavalry column at the Battle of D√ºrenstein and a few weeks later, he commanded the Austrian cavalry at the Allied defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz.Smith, Databook p. 213. The decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition. The subsequent Peace of Pressburg, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lun√©ville. Furthermore, Austria ceded land to Napoleon's German allies, and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and Prussia, Russia, and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.David Gates. The Napoleonic Wars 1803‚Äì1815. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997, , pp. 23‚Äì27. Austria did not return to active war against France until the Danube Campaign of 1809. Although the Habsburgs eked out a victory at Aspern and Essling, the campaign resulted in yet another decisive defeat at Wagram. In this campaign, the prince saw no active service, although for nine months in 1809, he served as Adlatus (noble adjutant and mentor) of the Commanding General in Galicia.

Belgrade has wildly varying architecture, from the centre of Zemun, typical of a Central European town, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from 19th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t√ºrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorcol, the House at 10 Cara Du≈°ana Street from 1727. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, St. Michael's Cathedral and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, the Old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gracanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava. During the socialist period, much housing was built quickly and cheaply to house the huge influx of people from the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi (blocks) of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Dom Sindikata. However, in the mid-1950s, the modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.  Medieval and Ottoman period  Ottoman Belgrade in a 1865 painting by Carl Goebel Neboj≈°a Tower, ca. 1460 Little remains in Belgrade of its early period. The Neboj≈°a Tower, from ca. 1460, is a lonely testimony of the pre-Ottoman medieval defenses of the town. = Ottoman architecture in Serbia = Belgrade was the main urban centre of Ottoman Serbia throughout the Early Modern period. Ottoman culture significantly influenced the city, in architecture, cuisine, language, and dress, especially in arts, and Islam.

The churches usually had a bell tower, and a single nave building with the iconostasis inside the church covered with Renaissance-style paintings. These churches can mostly be found in Zemun. The XIX century was a time of development of Serbian nationalism, which sought to develop a \\"national style\\" in architecture too, in line with national romanticism ideas. Within the broader movement of historicism, in parallel to neoclassical architecture, Serbia saw the development in particular of a Byzantine Revival architecture style. In the 19th century the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, St. Michael's Cathedral and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as the House of Vuk's Foundation, the Old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gracanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava. = Byzantine Revival architecture = Serbia's modern sacral architecture got its main impetus from the dynastic burial church in Oplenac which was commissioned by the Karadordevic dynasty 1909.Aleksandar Kadijevic: Byzantine architecture as inspiration for serbian new age architects.

Following governmental centralization after the 1918 creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, this initial bottom-up enthusiasm began to fade. Yugoslav architecture became more and more dictated by an increasingly concentrated national authority which sought to establish a unified state identity. Beginning the 1920s, Yugoslav architects began to advocate for architectural modernism, viewing the style as the logical extension of progressive national narratives. The Group of Architects of the Modern Movement, an organization founded in 1928 by architects Branislav √ê Kojic, Milan Zlokovic, Jan Dubovy, and Dusan Babic pushed for the widespread adoption of modern architecture as the \\"national\\" style of Yugoslavia to transcended regional differences. Despite these shifts, differing relationships to the west made the adoption of modernism inconsistent in Yugoslavia WWII. Of all Yugoslav cities, Belgrade has highest concentration of modernist structures. The architecture of Yugoslavia was characterized by emerging, unique, and often differing national and regional narratives. As a socialist state remaining free from the Iron Curtain, Yugoslavia adopted a hybrid identity that combined the architectural, cultural, and political leanings of both Western liberal democracy and Soviet communism. During the socialist period in Belgrade much housing was built quickly and cheaply to house the huge influx of people from the countryside following World War II, resulting in the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade's blokovi (blocks); a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Dom Sindikata. However, in the mid-1950s, the modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture. = Socialist realism (1945-48) = Socialist realist Dom Sindikata (1947), by Branko Petriƒçiƒá Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia's brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism. Centralization within the communist model led to the abolishment of private architectural practices and the state control of the profession. During this period, the governing Communist Party condemned modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism,\\" a move that caused friction among the nation's pre-war modernist architectural elite. = Socialist modernism = Palace of the Federation by Potocnjak and Mihailo Jankovic, 1950 Socialist realist architecture in Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end with Josip Broz Tito's 1948 split with Stalin. In the following years the nation turned increasingly to the West, returning to the modernism that had characterized pre-war Yugoslav architecture. During this era, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation's break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc). The nation's postwar return to modernism is perhaps best exemplified in Vjenceslav Richter's widely acclaimed 1958 Yugoslavia Pavilion at Expo 58, the open and light nature of which contrasted the much heavier architecture of the Soviet Union. During this period, the Yugoslav break from Soviet socialist realism combined with efforts to commemorate World War II, which together led to the creation of an immense quantity of abstract sculptural war memorials, known today as spomenik File:Belgrade Fair - Hall 1.jpgBelgrade Fair ‚Äì Hall 1, Europe's largest dome and the world's largest dome between 1957 and 1965 File:Hotel_Metropol_Belgrade_mali_Tasmajdan.JPGHotel Metropol by Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan, 1957 File:Stadion_na_Ta≈°majdanu_-_panoramio.jpgStadion Ta≈°majdan, 1958 File:Avala_Tower.jpgAvala Tower, 1961 File:U≈°ƒáe.JPGU≈°ƒáe Towers, 1964 File:Hala_sportova_Novi_Beograd.JPGRanko ≈Ωeravica Sports Hall (Hala), 1968 File:Hotel_Jugoslavija_-_panoramio.jpgHotel Jugoslavija by Lavoslav Horvat, 1969 File:Beogradjanka, Belgrade, Serbia.jpgBeograƒëanka tower, 1974 = Brutalism = Western City Gate (1977) by Mihajlo Mitroviƒá In the late 1950s and early 1960s Brutalism began to garner a following within Yugoslavia, particularly among younger architects, a trend possibly influenced by the 1959 disbandment of the Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. File:Be≈æanijski_Blokovi_crop.jpgThe brutalist blokovi of Novi Beograd File:Novi Beograd - Telephone Central Office, south view.jpgTelephone central office, Novi Beograd = Decentralization = With 1950s decentralization and liberalization policies in SFR Yugoslavia, architecture became increasingly fractured along ethnic lines. Architects increasingly focused on building with reference to the architectural heritage of their individual socialist republics in the form of critical regionalism. Growing distinction of individual ethnic architectural identities within Yugoslavia was exacerbated with the 1972 decentralization of the formerly centralized historical preservation authority, providing individual regions further opportunity to critically analyze their own cultural narratives.  Contemporary period  The international style, which had arrived in Yugoslavia already in the 1980s, took over the scene in Belgrade after the wars and isolation of the 1990s. Big real estate projects, including Sava City and the redevelopment of the U≈°ƒáe Towers, led the ground, with little respect for the local architecturale heritage. In 2015, an agreement was reached with Eagle Hills (a UAE company) on the Belgrade Waterfront (Beograd na vodi) deal, for the construction of a new part of the city on currently undeveloped wasteland by the riverside. This project, officially started in 2015 and is one of the largest urban development projects in Europe, will cost at least 3.5 billion euros.

It is situated on the bank of the River Deben within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, south of the town of Woodbridge and east of the county town of Ipswich. All Saints church dates from the 14th century. Restored in the 19th century, it is a grade II* listed building. Waldringfield Heath, between the village and Martlesham on the edge of Ipswich, is the site of Waldringfield Golf Club. It also has a Yacht Club called Waldringfield Yacht Club.  History  The name Waldringfield is derived from the Old English words meaning 'open land of the family or followers of a man called Waldhere'. The length of human habitation at Waldringfield is unknown but Iron Age finds such as pottery shards from the 1st century BC have been found locally. Record of the settlement is found in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name 'Waldingafelda' along with the name 'Minima Waldringafelda' (Lesser Waldringfield). The village had an industrial heyday from about 1860 to 1907. First, until about 1895, coprolite was dug up locally, washed and sifted on the beach and shipped by barge to be processed in factories in Ipswich, as part of the early fertiliser industry. Then, at the end of the nineteenth century, a cement making industry used mud from the river mixed with chalk brought in by barge from the Medway. Served by one hundred barges a month and employing twelve 'bottleneck' kilns, the industry survived until 1907. The kilns were demolished in 1912.http://www.waldringfield.onesuffolk.net  References  Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Suffolk Coastal Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk ","title":"Waldringfield"},{"id":"26657774","text":"Subphrenic abscess is a disease characterized by an accumulation of infected fluid between the diaphragm, liver, and spleen.

The messages were unintelligible individually and to individual mediums, but over a long period and many seances, it was claimed by the SPR that there was purpose in the correspondences, indicating an intelligent entity was behind them. The principal recipients of the messages included Mrs Margaret Verrall and her daughter Helen; Mrs Winifred Coombe Tennant, who practised as a medium under the name \\"Mrs Willett\\" and Mrs Alice Fleming, sister of Rudyard Kipling, who practised as \\"Mrs Holland\\". It was alleged Myer's spirit communicated through Mrs Verrall on 13 July 1904 by producing a manuscript which made reference to Myers' message. When the manuscript was examined the message was incorrect and it also referred to the place where the envelope was kept which was completely wrong. On 13 December 1904, Oliver Lodge arranged a meeting for members for the Society for Psychical Research. The contents of the envelope were made known to those present. A report was published by the Society's journal in 1905 which stated, \\"It has, then, to be reported that this one experiment has completely failed and it cannot be denied that the failure is disappointing.\\" Other mediums involved in cross-correspondences have included Mina Crandon, Leonora Piper and George Valiantine.\\"Cross-Correspondences\\". Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Both Crandon and Valiantine were exposed as frauds.Edmunds, Simeon. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. pp. 112-113. Critical Reception The psychologist Amy Tanner examined the cross-correspondences in detail. Tanner noted that whilst the cross-correspondences were taking place, the SPR allowed Mrs Verrall and her daughter to frequent sittings with Mrs Piper and this was a possible source of sensory leakage. She concluded that the psychical researchers had not taken into account the association of ideas, ignored the similarity between English and Latin and had used any interpretation to make a meaning out of the words. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall wrote that the Society for Psychical Research refused outside investigation with relation to the cross- correspondences and researchers not connected with the case could not examine the original documents. The identity of some of the mediums was kept secret and the public was only permitted to know who Mrs. Willett was after she had died.Dingwall, Eric. (1985). The Need for Responsibility in Parapsychology: My Sixty Years in Psychical Research. In A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 161-174 Edward Clodd wrote that the explanation for the cross-correspondences was the subconscious mind of the medium not spirits. According to Clodd many of the messages were \\"inconsequential rubbish\\". Mrs Verrall was a well-educated classicist who had studied Latin and Greek with her husband. Clodd suggested that Mrs Willet had communicated with Verrall and looked up references in classical lore.Clodd, Edward. (1917). The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism. Grant Richards, London. pp. 242-249 Ivor Lloyd Tuckett noted that \\"in practically every cross- correspondence, there is vagueness and incorrectness of detail, allowing plenty of room for biased interpretation.\\" Criticism of the cross- correspondences also came from the psychiatrist Charles Arthur Mercier. He studied two cases and noted they could \\"be twisted into any appearance of referring to the same thing, or of emanating from the same source.\\"Mercier, Charles Arthur. (1917). Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge. London: Mental Culture Enterprise. pp. 110-112 In 1986, the magician John Booth who examined the cross-correspondences suggested that they could be explained by chance, law of averages, deliberate fraud or self-delusion. Skeptical author John Grant commenting in 2015 did not find the cross-correspondences as reliable evidence for an afterlife, and warned readers of falling into the trap of \\"intellectual pareidolia\\".Grant, John.

The cause was ascribed to loss of flight control due to explosive decompression and structural failure. The accident marked the second operational loss and first fatal crash for the C-5 Galaxy fleet, and is the third deadliest accident involving a U.S. military aircraft after the 1968 Kham Duc C-130 shootdown and Arrow Air Flight 1285.  Background  In early April 1975, with much of South Vietnam overrun by communist North Vietnamese forces, the administration of U.S. President Gerald Ford began instituting the evacuation of American citizens. To avoid alarming the host country, U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Graham Martin authorized Americans to be flown out under several conditions, one of which was Operation Babylift, in which American caregivers were paired with South Vietnamese orphans.Nixon, Ford, and the Abandonment of South Vietnam, J. Edward Lee and Toby Haynsworth, McFarland and Company, , 2002.  Description  On the afternoon of Friday, 4 April 1975, C-5A, AF Ser. No. 68-0218, making the first flight of Operation Babylift, departed Tan Son Nhut Air Base for Clark Air Base in the Philippines. This first group of orphans would then transfer to charter flights and be welcomed by President Ford upon arriving in the United States at San Diego, California. At 4:15 p.m. the C-5A was over the South China Sea about off V≈©ng T√†u, South Vietnam, flying a heading of 136 degrees and climbing to an altitude of . At that moment the locks on the rear loading ramp failed, causing the cargo door to open explosively. This caused explosive decompression, temporarily filling the cabin with a whirlwind of fog and debris. The blowout severed control cables to the tail, causing two of four hydraulic systems to fail, including those for the rudder and elevator, and leaving the flight control with only the use of one aileron, spoilers, and power. The pilot, Captain Dennis \\"Bud\\" Traynor, and copilot, Captain Tilford Harp, attempted to regain control of the airplane, and to perform a 180-degree turn in order to return to Tan Son Nhut.Valor: A Galaxy of Heroes, Air Force Magazine, August 1991. The aircraft began to exhibit phugoid oscillations, but the crew countered them and maintained a controlled descent at about . They were able to bring the plane to and begin the approach to Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. While turning on final approach, the plane's descent rate suddenly began to increase rapidly. The crew increased power to the engines in an attempt to arrest the descent, but despite their efforts, the plane touched down at 4:45 p.m. in a rice paddy, and skidded for a quarter of a mile (400 m), became airborne again for another half-mile (800 m), crossing the Saigon River, then hit a dike and broke up into four pieces. The fuel caught fire and some of the wreckage was set ablaze. Survivors struggled to extricate themselves from the wreckage. The crash site was in a muddy rice paddy near the Saigon River, one mile (1.6 km) from the nearest road. Fire engines could not reach the site, and helicopters had to set down some distance from the wreckage. About 100 South Vietnamese soldiers deployed around the site, which was near the site of an engagement with the Viet Cong the previous night. Out of 314 people on board, the death toll included 78 children, 35 Defence Attach√© Office employees and 11 U.S. Air Force personnel; there were 176 survivors. All of the surviving orphans were eventually flown to the United States. The dead orphans were cremated and were interred at the cemetery of the St. Nikolaus Catholic Church in Pattaya, Thailand.Commander in Chief Pacific Command History: Appendix III: Babylift, Carl O. Clever, CINCPAC Hawaii, 1976. The Vietnam Center and Archive, Item 2132501008, accessed 28 March 2010. The accident would also \\"stand as the single largest loss of life\\" in the Defense Intelligence Agency's history until the September 11 attacks because among the crash fatalities were five female DIA employees.. = Aftermath = Some members of the United States Congress called for a grounding of C-5s. In the end, the fleet was put under severe operational restrictions for several months while the cause was established. The U.S. Air Force Accident Investigation Board attributed the survival of any on board to Captain Traynors unorthodox use of power and his decision to crash-land while the aircraft still allowed him some control. Captains Traynor and Harp, who both survived, were awarded the Air Force Cross for extraordinary valor. Thirty-seven medals were awarded to crew members or their next of kin. USAF Flight Nurse, 1st Lieutenant Regina Aune, received the Cheney Award for 1975.http://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/109577/two-af-nurses- heroes-of-operation-babylift/ Investigation Rear doors of a C5 Galaxy Given the explosive manner in which the rear doors failed, sabotage was initially suspected. Many of the components were looted from the crash site, thereby complicating the investigation; the U.S. Air Force paid a bounty for parts from the wreckage to recover them from the local populace. The United States Navy amphibious cargo ship , frigate , and command ship were assigned to search for the flight data recorder in the South China Sea. The recorder was found, and U.S. Navy ships and helicopters also discovered wreckage from the doors in the South China Sea as well as the body of a C-5 crewmember. When the rear doors were eventually recovered from the sea, investigation determined that some of the locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not all the door locks were engaging correctly. Accounts also indicated the initial maintenance inspection noticed 5 of the 7 locks were not operating and failed the aircraft for flight. With external organizational pressure to get the flight airborne, a second off-shift maintenance team was called in. They subsequently missed the locks during inspection and the aircraft was cleared for flight. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing the doors before take-off. As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and the door failed.Lockheed C-5A Galaxy Accident description Aviation Safety Network 16 September 2017 Dramatization The story of the disaster was featured on the seventh season of the Canadian made, internationally distributed documentary series Mayday, in the episode \\"Operation Babylift\\".

This second treaty was an aftermath of the Treaty of Hadiach from 16 September 1658 between the Cossacks and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which granted many privileges to Cossacks and thus threatened Russian influence over Cossacks. The articles imposed severe restrictions on Cossack Hetmanate autonomy.

Ukrainian Cossack forces were also withdrawn from Belarus. In addition, the Cossacks could no longer elect their own hetmans or colonels without the approval of the tsar.  Aftermath  The most significant immediate consequence of the Accords was the separation of the Ukrainian Orthodox church from the Patriarch of Constantinople and its subordination to the Patriarch of Moscow.

Hockey New Haven had been known for its blue collar fans who favor rough play, especially the \\"Crazies\\" who sat in \\"The Jungle\\" -- Section 14 at the Coliseum, behind and adjacent to the opposing team's bench. These fans were renowned for being extremely tough on opposing teams, relentlessly screaming obscenities and taunts at opposing players (and sometimes at hometown players), making New Haven an intimidating place to play even though outright physical violence in the stands was rare.

New Haven's first professional baseball team was the New Haven Elm Citys of the National Association, which played for one season in 1875 at the Howard Avenue Grounds. Although the National Association's status as a major league is disputed (particularly by Major League Baseball and the Baseball Hall of Fame), some historians and statisticians consider the NA a major league, making the Elm Citys New Haven's only major league baseball franchise.David Pietrusza Major Leagues: The Formation, Sometimes Absorption and Mostly Inevitable Demise of 18 Professional Baseball Organizations, 1871 to Present Jefferson (NC): McFarland & Company, 1991. New Haven has hosted 29 minor league baseball teams, dating back to the 19th century(A complete list of New Haven base ball teams can be found here). Greater New Haven's first minor league baseball team in modern times were the West Haven Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League, which played at both Quigley Stadium and Yale Field in neighboring West Haven from 1972 to 1979. Many future New York Yankees made their way through the West Haven team, including Ron Guidry. The West Haven Yankees finished first five times in their eight years, winning the Eastern League championship four times (in '72, '76, '78, and '79). Minor league baseball returned to New Haven in 1994 with the arrival of the New Haven Ravens, an Eastern League AA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. Like the preceding minor league teams, the Ravens played in neighboring West Haven at Yale Field, just across the town line. The team was very successful in its first few seasons before losing support. New Haven and the Ravens hosted the Double-A All-Star game in 1998. The Ravens won the Eastern League championship in 2000, giving New Haven proper its first professional championship since the New Haven Blades' championship in 1956. The Ravens moved to Manchester, New Hampshire in 2003, becoming the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. In 1974, a little league team from New Haven placed sixth in the Little League World Series.

New Haven gained an Eastern Professional Basketball League (the forerunner to the Continental Basketball Association) team in 1965, named the New Haven Elms, which played in New Haven Arena. In 1967, the Elms left New Haven, and split their season in Bridgeport and Binghamton, as the \\"Flyers.\\" For the 1968-69 season, the team returned to New Haven, again calling itself the Elms. However, under the sponsorship of the Bic Pen Corporation of Milford, CT, the team moved north to Hamden the following season, now calling itself the Hamden Bics. The Bics played in the gym of Hamden High School for two seasons, before folding in 1971.http://www.cbamuseum.com/teams/nhelms.html Soccer Greater New Haven's oldest professional soccer team was the Ansonia F.C.. which is believed to have begun play in 1887 before dissolving in the 1920s.Roberts, S.H.

Gouverneto Monastery ( ŒúŒøŒΩŒÆ ŒìŒøœÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ≠œÑŒøœÖ) or Our Lady of the Angels is a Greek Orthodox monastery on the Akrotiri peninsula of the Chania regional unit of Crete, Greece. It is located about 30 kilometres from Chania, and is about 5 kilometres north of the Agia Triada Monastery.  History  Dated to 1537 (although other sources say 1548), Gouverneto Monastery is reputed to be one of the oldest monasteries in Crete, and a 1637 census, recorded shortly before the Turkish invasion, revealed that at the time there were 60 monks living there, making it one of the largest in Crete at the time. During World War II, the Germans established a guardhouse in the monastery to control the area. Since 2005 it has undergone restoration work by the monks.  Features  The monastery is a Venetian style fortress with towers at each end, and some Baroque influences added later.

P. persephone is the first fossil butterfly to be found in North America, and is exquisitely well preserved. Its closest extant relatives are the mapwings and African admirals of the genera Hypanartia and Antanartia, respectively. Full-color reconstruction of Prodryas persephone based on the colors of Hypanartia and Antanartia. Significance The type specimen, now held at the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University, was the first fossil butterfly to be found in North America, and has been described as \\"possibly the best fossil butterfly specimen ever found\\". The appearance of a figure of Prodryas in Samuel Hubbard Scudder's book Frail Children of the Air influenced the young Frank M. Carpenter to embark on a career in paleoentomology. Scudder exhibited the specimen at the Royal Entomological Society of London in December 1893. Description The single known specimen of P. persephone is a compression fossil, discovered by the \\"homesteader turned naturalist\\" Charlotte Hill, in shale deposits of Late Eocene age of the Florissant Formation near Florissant, Colorado. The butterfly has a wing length of , and the specimen is complete, although the trailing edge of one hindwing was originally covered. The upper surface of the animal is visible, and the legs can only barely be seen. The head is turned to one side, revealing the mouthparts as well as both antennae. The wing venation is exquisitely preserved, and even the patterns of color on the wings are clearly visible. Individual wing scales can be discerned in parts of the forewing. Taxonomy Based on Charlotte Hill's specimen, Samuel Hubbard Scudder described the new genus and species Prodryas persephone in 1878, although the first figure only appeared in 1899. The specific epithet persephone alludes to Persephone, wife of Hades, and the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Two other species named by Scudder in the same work also bear names referring to the underworld in Greek mythology: Lithopsyche styx (referring to the river Styx) and Jupitellia charon (referring to Charon). Although placed in a separate genus, Prodryas persephone is thought to be closely related to Hypanartia, and may be even closer to Antanartia.

It has similar dimensions and structure as those of a regular bank card. Use All Dutch citizens from the age of 14 are required to be able to show a valid identity document when the police or other enforcement officers ask for identification. The identity card is commonly used for this purpose, but other identity documents such as a passport or driving licence may be used instead. The Dutch identity card is also a valid means of personal identification in a number of countries outside the Netherlands and may be used as a travel document in those countries in place of a Dutch passport. Identity information A Dutch identity card includes the following information about the holder and the document (with fields in Dutch and English ): * Nationality: Nederlandse (Dutch) * Document number * Full name, including surname and all given names (continuation at the backside possible for 2014 model)) * Photograph (both printed and processed to watermark) * Date of birth * Place of birth (printed at the backside for 2014 model) * Height (printed at the backside for 2014 model) * Sex * Personal number (printed at the backside for 2014 model) * Authority (the authority who issued the concerning identity card, commonly the mayor of the municipality of residence; for example \\"Burgemeester van Utrecht\\"; printed at the backside for 2014 model) * Date of issue * Date of expiry (normally 10 years after the date of issue) * Signature The information at the backside ends with the Machine Readable Zone starting with I Since May 2016, the identity card does no longer contain the holder's fingerprints. The chip has been included due to European regulations. Validity The Dutch identity card is a valid travel document within all of Europe (except Belarus, Russia and Ukraine) as well as Georgia, Montserrat (max. 14 days), Turkey and on organised tours to Jordan (through Aqaba airport) and Tunisia. Validity in EU/EFTA states is based on membership of the European Union, while validity in Turkey is based on the \\"European Agreement on Regulations governing the Movement of Persons between Member States of the Council of Europe\\".

It ranges from Austria through eastern Europe and the Balkans, in Eurasian steppe in Ukraine, southern Russia into southern Siberia and northern Kazhakstan, and the Caucasus into Turkey. Iris pumila is distinguished by single blooms held 10‚Äì20 cm above ground level on a lengthened perianth tube, with the ovary almost resting on the rhizome on a very short stem. The flower is protected by two spathes, both of which are round in cross-section. Flower color is variable: yellow and purple or violet are the most common, but blue, cream, white, and blended colors are also frequently found. Most forms have a darker spot on the falls. Beginning in the mid 20th century, Iris pumila was bred extensively with the hybrid tall bearded irises of gardens, giving rise to the great variety of modern dwarf and median bearded iris cultivars. Another pumila hybrid is 'Iris coerulea' named by √âdouard Spach in Hist. Veg. Phan. xiii. 50 in 1846.

The design was carried out by Oskar Barnack, beginning in 1913 by building a camera for 24√ó36 mm negatives that by now is called the Ur-Leica; but Ernst Leitz did not decide to manufacture it until 1924. Once started, the Leica production volume doubled each year; in 1929, some 16.000 cameras were produced. In 1930, an improved model with interchangeable lens was introduced, followed a year later by the fully developed Leica II with standardized film to lens flange distance, and in 1932 the basic Leica Standard; the Leica concept was established. This camera's features are the basis for defining a Leica copy. The post 1932 Leica II and Leica III cameras were differentiated by the latter having a \\"slow speed dial\\" on the front of the camera to the left of the lens mount. After 1940, with the introduction of the Leica IIIc, the upper body was die cast rather than stamped and the visual appearance of the camera changed with a more prominent shutter-crate around the lens mount -- this was not covered with leather as in the previous models. The Soviet cameras followed the pattern of the Leica II, while most of the Asian cameras included the slow-speed feature. The earlier copies used the stamped upper body, while a few of the later cameras had die cast upper bodies. Several of the Asian brands combined the viewfinder and rangefinder features, this was not done on the Barnack Leica cameras or Soviet copies. After World War II, the Allied countries made all German patents in their country available to the public free of charge. Ernst Leitz had no patents registered in the USSR. Cameras introduced later would not cause patent rights infringements as far as the early Leica models are concerned. One set of specifications which may define a Leica copy, are described by Hans P. Rajner, is: *1 - Predominantly a rangefinder/viewfinder camera type *2 - With the 39mm Leica screw lens mount with approximately 1 mm pitch *3 - and a 28.8 mm film to lens flange distance *4 - Using the 35mm film format *5 - And employing a focal-plane shutter Minolta-35 (1947) Canon IIB (1951) Shanghai (1958) Some 500 individual camera models that were produced by a large number of camera manufacturers since the introduction of the Leica fall into this category. These originate from about 21 original Leica inspired cameras. However, some of these never made it past the prototype stage, and some came on the market only in very small quantities. There are differing opinions on when the Canon (Kwanon)line of cameras became Leica copies; the earliest of these had Leica inspired bodies, but Contax inspired lens mounts and Nikkor lenses. Those brands that made it to the market by more than a few thousands are listed here.

He was a House Deputy Speaker from 2019 until October 14, 2020. He previously served as the governor of Camarines Sur from 2004 to 2013. His father is politician Luis Villafuerte Sr., while his son is the incumbent governor of Camarines Sur, Miguel Luis Villafuerte. Personal life Luis Raymund \\"LRay\\" Villafuerte Jr. was born on June 3, 1968 in Manila to Luis Villafuerte Sr. and Nelly Favis. In elementary school, LRay was part of the De La Salle University's track team, running short distances, sprints, and the 100-meter dash. He received his primary education from De La Salle University and his secondary education from La Salle Greenhills. In 1990, Villafuerte held the highest grade-point average in the graduating Political Science class in De La Salle University. He also garnered the highest grade in the Political Science Comprehensive Examination, won the \\"Best Thesis\\" award for his work on \\"Local Autonomy\\", and was the Department Gold Medalist in the Political Science department. He also earned an executive education from Stanford Graduate School of Business (2003) and joined a leadership program in Institute of International Studies and Training in Japan (2006).

LRay's grandfather, Mariano Villafuerte Sr., was also governor of CamSur from 1942 to 1943 during the Japanese Occupation. LRay's best accomplishment as a Governor was making Camarines Sur a first-class province. In 2010, CamSur became the number one tourist destination in the country with more than 2 million tourist visits. He also turned CamSur from the 39th poorest province in the Philippines to the 10th richest in 2009. LRay paved the way for the development of the Caramoan Peninsula, now widely known as Caramoan Islands, which has hosted numerous editions of the popular reality show Survivor. LRay also led the establishment of the CamSur Watersports Complex. LRay's programs for tourism has helped him provide free education, broader medical services, agriculture programs, and livelihood programs, among others, to the Camarinenses. In 2011, LRay also pioneered the El Verde Movement, CamSur's program for making a greener environment. The program employed a partnership package with different stakeholders, allowing the people to make a living out of planting trees. The Food-for-Tree Package allowed families to plant, maintain, and take care of trees through a food-for-work scheme. The Building Communi-Trees project allows corporate sponsors to invest and pledge a donation that will correspond to the number of trees they wish to be planted. The Back Tree School program is a sponsorship program offered to organizations that can sponsor an out-of-school youth to go back to school by planting trees. Through these schemes, the El Verde Movement managed to plant 12.7 million trees in 35 municipalities by the end of 2012. It also bagged two Guinness World Records; for planting 64,096 trees in 15 minutes in the municipality of Siruma, and for planting 1 million mangrove propagules in just one hour. When LRay passed the reign to his son Migz, the current CamSur governor continued the program, aiming to plant 40 million trees by the year 2020. Most recently, LRay led the establishment of the CamSur Information Technology Park, located in the heart of the Provincial Complex. LRay envisioned the CSITP to be the province's information technology, information, and economic capital. Located within the park is the CamSur Animation Studio, the first LGU-run digital center in the Philippines. CamSur Animation Studio was established in 2006 by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur headed by LRay. One of the biggest issues LRay faced during his term as governor was the call of CamSur politicians, including his own father, to divide the province into two provinces to create Nueva Camarines. LRay sternly opposed the rally, saying that it would be better and more convenient to run CamSur as one province. LRay also noted that the creation of another province would cost too much money to the national government. Today, CamSur stands as a single, wealthy province. =House of Representatives= LRay is serving his first term as representative of the second district of Camarines Sur in Congress, beating Assuncion Arse√±o in the 2016 elections. Although considered a neophyte legislator, Congressman LRay has already filed close to a hundred bills as of writing ‚Äì a strong display of commitment to his constituents and the public. Through legislation, he seeks to develop policies relating to the environment, education, information technology, and health, among others. On his first day at work, he filed three revolutionary bills: (1) An act establishing e-government (House Bill No. 262), (2) An act integrating bicycle lanes in the Philippine transport system (House Bill No. 263), and (3) An act using digital technology in the public education system (House Bill No. 264). He has also filed bills that aim to convert roads into national roads in the province of CamSur to accelerate the province‚Äôs development and increase economic activity within the province. He has also filed bills to convert several secondary schools in the province into national high schools to better provide for the needs of the students. Congressman LRay spearheads the 17th Congress Neophytes Fellowship, a first-of-its-kind, non-partisan monthly gathering of first-term representatives designed to strengthen the camaraderie among the 104 neophytes in the 298-member chamber. LRay is also the Vice-President of the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Local Government, and the Committee on National Defense and Security, and a Member of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee on Tourism. He is also a Member for the Majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Food, the Committee on Aquaculture and Fisheries Resources, the Committee on Banks and Financial Intermediaries, the Committee of Economic Affairs, the Committee on Information and Communications Technology, the Committee on Legislative Franchises, and the Committee on Ways and Means.. He is one of the famous 70 congressman who voted against the renewal of the ABS-CBN Franchise. During the 2020 House leadership crisis, Villafuerte supported House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano's refusal to step down. After Lord Allan Velasco was elected as the new speaker, Villafuerte was ousted from being a deputy speaker on October 14 and was replaced by Mikee Romero, a Velasco ally who was removed as a deputy speaker two weeks prior by Cayetano's side. In a statement, Villafuerte announced that he will continue to support President Rodrigo Duterte's legislative agenda, and added \\"if the intention of removing me was to intimidate all those who remain loyal to former Speaker Cayetano, then they have miscalculated badly.\\" He also accused the new leadership of \\"rejecting\\" the Cayetano faction's \\"offers of cooperation.\\" References Metro Society (December 2010 Issue) The Bull Runner (July‚ÄìAugust 2011 Issue) http://www.philstar.com/feature/347159/gov-l- ray-villafuerte-cam-sur-ceo Luis Raymund Villafuerte Jr. Curriculum Vitae Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Camarines Sur Category:Governors of Camarines Sur Category:Nationalist People's Coalition politicians Category:Nacionalista Party politicians Category:Bicolano people Category:Tagalog people Category:Bicolano politicians Category:People from Camarines Sur Category:De La Salle University alumni Category:Stanford Graduate School of Business alumni Category:Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives of the Philippines ","title":"Luis Raymund Villafuerte"},{"id":"26658426","text":"Ernst Bernard Heyne (15 September 1825 - 16 October 1881) was a German botanist and horticulturist and a pioneer in the early development of agriculture in Australia.

It is a species in the genus Iris, in the subgenus Limniris and within the Lophiris section. It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, with pale blue, lavender or white flowers with an orange or yellow crest. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris japonica is similar in form to Iris confusa, but the leaves are at ground level. It has short, slender, greenish, creeping rhizomes. It spreads by sending out thin, wiry, long stolons. They are shallow rooted, and form dense carpets and clumps. It is not invasive. It has basal deep green, dark green, yellowish green or light green leaves. These are glossy (or shiny) on one side and dull on the other side. They are tinted, reddish purple, close to the rhizome and do not have a mid vein. These lance-shaped leaves, can grow up to between tall and 1.5‚Äì3.5 cm wide. The leaves are generally described as evergreen, and grow in a broad fan, with arching tips. It has wiry, stout stems that can grow up to tall. The 5‚Äì12 short, slender flower-bearing branches, (or pedicels) are near the top of the plant. The stiff pedicels can reach between long. The flowering stem (and branches) grow higher than the leaves. The stems have 3‚Äì5 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are lanceolate, and long. The stems (and the many branches) hold between 2 and 4 flowers, in spring and early summer, between March to April (in Japan) or April and May. The flowers are like Iris cristata flowers but paler and fancier. The short lasting flowers open in succession (one after another), for between 2, and 5 weeks. These flowers have a clove pinks aroma. The flattish, flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of pale blue, or pale lavender, or lilac, or purple, to white. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'). The falls are elliptic or obovate, with a spreading limb and blue or purple/violet blotching, spots, (or dots) around a central yellow signal patch around a visible yellow, or orange crest. They are long and 1.4‚Äì2 cm wide. The standards are elliptic or narrowly obovate. They are long and 1.5‚Äì2.1 cm wide. The standards spreading to the same plane as the falls, creating the 'flat' look. All the petals are fringed (fimbriated) around the edges. It has a 1.1‚Äì2 cm long perianth tube, 0.8‚Äì1.2 cm long stamens, white anthers and 7‚Äì10 mm ovary. It has 0.5‚Äì0.75 long and pale blue style branches. The terminal lobes are fimbriated (fringed). After the iris has flowered, between May and June, it produces an ellipsoid-cylindric, non-beaked seed capsule, which is 2.5‚Äì3 cm long and 1.2‚Äì1.5 cm wide. Inside the capsule, it has dark brown seeds with a small aril. =Biochemistry= Tetra- hydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone, also known as Irilin D (C17H14O7), was found in Iris japonica, Belamcanda chinensis (Iris domestica) and Iris bungei. Junipergenin B (Dalospinosin) can be found in the leaves of Juniperus macropoda and the roots of Iris japonica.John Buckingham and V. Ranjit N. Munasinghe As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Chromosome numbers in irises have been the subject of numerous studies. Findings include 2n=54, Kazuao, 1929; 2n=34,36, Simonet, 1932; 2n=36, Sharma & Tal., 1960; 2n=36 Kurosawa, 1971; 2n=31,33,54, Chimphamba, 1973; 2n=54, Mao & Xue, 1986; 2n=28,34,36,54, Colasante & Sauer, 1993; 2n=28, Dong et al. 1994; 2n=28 to 60 and Yen, Yang, & Waddick, 1995. It is a triploid plant (3n chromosomes) that does not produce seed and therefore can not be propagated by vegetative means (seed or division) while in China, it can also be diploid. This is the reason why the Japanese think that a triploid specimen was imported from China to Japan. Then over time, it has become naturalized. Plants growing wild in Japan were counted as 2n=54 for infertile triploid forms. In China, wild forms are counted as 2n=36.  Taxonomy Iris japonica illustration in Curtis Botanical Magazine, 1797 It has the common names of 'fringed iris', 'Shaga' (in Japan), and butterfly flower (in China). It is written as Ëù¥Ëù∂Ëä± in Chinese script, and known as hu die hua in Pidgin in China. It is written as „Ç∑ „É£ „Ç¨, Â∞ÑÂπ≤ in Japanese script. The Latin specific epithet japonica refers to from Japan, even though the plant is thought to have originated in China. Iris japonica was first named by Carl Peter Thunberg, (the Swedish botanist) in his 1784 publication, 'Flora Japonica'. It was introduced to Europe in 1792 from China, by Thomas Evans of the East India Company. It was then first published and described by Thunberg in 'Transactions of the Linnean Society of London' (Trans. Linn. Soc. London) Volume 2 page327 on 1 May 1794. The species description was published in Curtis Botanical Magazine in 1797. Iris fimbriata was later classified as a synonym of Iris japonica. It has received an Award of Garden Merit from the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris japonica growing in Osaka,Japan It is native to temperate and tropical regions of Asia. =Range= It is found in China, within the Chinese provinces, of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan and Zhejiang. It is found in Japan on the islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. In tropical Asia, it occurs in Myanmar (Burma). In 2014, it was found in Mongolia. =Habitat= I. japonica grows on forest margins, in wet grasslands (or meadows), among rocks by streams, and along hillsides, or rocky slopes. The species occurs at altitudes of above sea level in Japan, and above sea level in China. Cultivation Fukushima, Japan Iris japonica is very common in cultivation in USA, it is the most commonly cultivated crested iris in the UK. It is hardy to between USDA Zone 7 to Zone 10. It is also hardy to European Zone H3. It is very easy to grow in a Mediterranean climate in sheltered positions. Within the UK, it is hardy in Devon and Cornwall, and some other parts of southern UK. It prefers the protection of a sheltered sunny wall. Some cultivars of Iris japonica are more hardy than others. However, an extremely cold winter (or late frosts) may adversely affect the flowering of this species, and the foliage becomes tatty, or browned. It should be grown in well-drained soils, but moist soils are preferred. It can tolerate neutral or acidic soils (PH levels between 6.5 ‚Äì 7.8)., though prefers slightly acidic soils (including peat banks). It is not tolerant of salty water. It has average water needs during the growing season, wet or damp conditions during the winter may cause the root to rot. It can tolerate positions between full sun and partial shade, but prefers partial shade. It can be grown in a mixed flower border, as a ground cover plant and can be also grown in containers in sheltered positions. In frost prone areas, it can be grown in a cool greenhouse. The plants are rested in summer (after the spring flowering), and then started again in the late autumn. If it cannot be grown in a cool house, it should be given a sheltered position, with shrubs where it is protected from the morning sun. The stems and dead leaves should be removed after flowering to keep the plant tidy and help it, for next years growth. It does not have any serious disease or insect problems, but pests (such as Thrips, slugs and snails), occasionally damage plants by feeding on the flowers or foliage. Aphid Aulacorthum magnoliae can be found on the plant.R. L. Blackman, Victor F. Eastop It can be susceptible to attack by Japanese Beetle. =Propagation= It can be propagated by division or by seed growing. The seed is best sown in a cold frame, as soon as the capsules are ripe. Stored seed can also be sown in a cold frame in the Spring. Seedlings should be pricked out into small pots when large enough. They are then grown for another year in a greenhouse or cold frame. The new plants then can be planted into the ground in late spring or early summer of the 3rd year. Division is best carried out after flowering during July or August. Large clumps of plants can then be re-planted in new sites. Smaller clumps should be potted and grown in a cold frame until there have formed sufficient roots to survive, they then can be planted in the Spring. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris japonica has many named cultivars.

But these were later classified as a synonym of Iris japonica. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Uses In Japan, it is used as a source of starch. The rhizomes are ground up to access the starch. In China, it is used in herbal medicines, the rhizome is used to treat injuries. As a decoction, it is used to treat bronchitis, internal injuries, rheumatism and swellings. In Japan, the iris was encouraged or planted on the tops of hills, within castles, the slippery fans of the iris leaves were used to slow marauding invaders to allow defending armies to protect the castle.

It is a rhizomatous, beardless perennial plant, native to the Himalayas, India and China. It has pinkish-violet, or pinkish purple, or pinkish-lavender or pinkish lilac flowers, with a fringed yellow or orange crest (or ridge). It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to Iris tectorum (another crested iris).British Iris Society (1997) It has a short, thick, fleshy, greenish rhizomes,James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) which are 1‚Äì1.5 cm in diameter, they are larger than other crested irises. Underneath the rhizomes, are fleshy roots. The rhizome is marked on top, with marks or scars of previous seasons leaves. The rhizome produces lateral (non-flowering) shoots, these later become new growth points for the next season. During the winter months, it goes dormant, the leaves die, leaving the rhizome bare on the soil surface. It has around 8, basal leaves, which are slightly glaucous,Richard Lynch yellowish green, or greyish green, or pale green. They are sword-shaped, they can grow up to between long and wide. The leaves are visibly ribbed, and change in size along the stem. They die away in the autumn, to re-appear in the summer. It has slender, stems that can grow up to between tall. It has 2‚Äì4, branches, which are long. Iris milesii and Iris wattii are by far the tallest species of the crested irises group.Elizabeth Lawrence The stems have several spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are long, and wide. The stems (and the branches) hold between 3 and 4 flowers, in early summer, between April to May, or May to July. They are short lived, but a continuous display can carry on for many weeks, 8 to 10 weeks. The flowers are in diameter, they are smaller than Iris japonica, and Iris tectorum. The flowers come in shades of pinkish-violet, or pinkish purple, or pinkish lilac,Nick Romanowski pinkish-lavender, or pale mauve. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The falls are reflexed, obovate, 3 cm long, with a blade marked with dark purple, violet or lilac, lines, spots or mottled (streaks or blotches), it has a finely fringed, or toothed, orange, or white, or yellow crest (or ridge). The standards are narrowly obovate, long. They are self-fertile. It has articulated pedicels, that are long. It has a small perianth tube, 1‚Äì1.5 cm long, 2.5 cm long stamen, milky white anthers, 3 cm cylindric ovary. It has reddish purple, or lilac style branches, which are 3 cm long with deeply fringed (fimbriated) edges. After the iris has flowered, it produces an ovoid- globose, or ovoid-cylindrical seed capsule, between June and August. It is cm long, with veining. Inside the capsule, are pyriform (pear shaped) black brown seeds, with a white aril. =Biochemistry= Iris milesii from Jardin des Plantes, Botanical garden in Paris, France In May 1984, a study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris milesii, to ascertain their chemical constituency. Several isoflavones (chemical compounds) were found. In December 1884, a further study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris milesii and Iris kemaonensis (under old spelling 'kumaonensis'). It found several isoflavones in both rhizomes. Tetra hydroxy-3' methoxyisoflavone (C16H12O7) can be found naturally within the iris,John Buckingham and V. Ranjit N. Munasinghe rhizomes.J. B. Harborne As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several times, 2n=26, Simonet, 1932 and 2n=26, Chimphamba, 1973. It is normally published as 2n=26.  Taxonomy It has the common names of red-flower iris, and waterbird iris (in Australia). It is written as Á∫¢Ëä±È∏¢Â∞æ in Chinese script, and known as hong hua yuan wei in Pidgin in China. The Latin specific epithet milesii refers to Mr Frank Miles, who introduced it into cultivation in about 1880. These plants were grown from seeds collected by his cousin in the Kulu district to the north of Simla. It was first published and described by Michael Foster in Gardeners' Chronicle Volume 20 page 231 in 1883. John Gilbert Baker also described the iris in Curtis's Botanical Magazine Volume 112, tab.6889 in 1886. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003 and then updated on 1 December 2004. Iris milesii is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris milesii Iris milesii is native to temperate and tropical regions of Asia, =Range= It is found in temperate Asia, within the Chinese provinces, of Sichuan, Xizang and Yunnan. It is also found in tropical Asia, within the States and union territories of India, in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir. It is also thought to be found in Tibet. =Habitat= It grows in the conifer forest margins of hillsides, in meadows, in open groves (and clearings), and wet valleys. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation They are 'abundant' in the wild. Cultivation Flower buds of Iris milesii, from Himachal Pradesh, India. Iris milesii is very hardy, to between USDA Zone 3 and Zone 8, or Zone 10. It is not hardy in the North Carolina climate, because it does not survive the winter. It is hardy in UK, to ‚àí15 ¬∞C (or lower for short periods). It is also hardy, to Europe Zone H3, although it still needs a sheltered position. It is tolerant of normal garden soil, but prefers well drained, sandy, peaty soils. It does not like lime. It is tolerant of soils that are mildly acidic or mildly alkaline. It prefers a sunny or semi-shade position. It also has average water needs. It prefers to have moisture during the growing season, but it will not survive in waterlogged sites/ It can be grown in mixed flower border, or rock gardens. It does suffer virus problems that Iris tectorum. It is not rarely found in cultivation. =Propagation= It can also be propagated by division or by seed growing. Although the Iris can produce plenty to seed, propagation via division is quicker and more reliable. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. References Sources *Chowdhery, H. J. & B. M. Wadhwa. 1984. Flora of Himachal Pradesh. *Mathew, B. 1981.

She was the middle of three vessels nicknamed \\"streakers\\", the first in the Calmac fleet to be fitted with Voith Schneider Propellers . Juno left service in early 2007 and was laid up at Rosneath for 4 years. On 18 May 2011, she was beached there for scrapping and was gone by the end of July. History MV Juno took to the water at Lamont's in Port Glasgow, on 16 September 1974 and was christened by Mrs W M Little, wife of the Managing Director of the Scottish Transport Group, Calmac's owning company at the time. She was remarkably similar to , although her internal decoration was brighter, the ticket office faced fore rather than aft, and she had a curved flying bridge (although Jupiter soon incorporated such a bridge). This allowed the skipper a clearer view when berthing. Juno and Jupiter were remarkably manoeuvrable, being the first in the Calmac fleet to be fitted with Voith Schneider Propellers, which allowed the ships to literally turn within their own length. This was revolutionary in large vessels as they could berth and depart far quicker than many of the smaller vessels at the time. They would later become affectionately known as the three \\"streakers\\" after the arrival of in 1977. Juno spent much of her first decade on the Gourock-Dunoon run, replacing the much smaller . In 1981, the then Secretary of State for Scotland offered the rival firm on the Hunter's Quay- Mclnroy's Point route, Western Ferries, a grant to buy an additional vessel to provide a frequent, high speed passenger-only service from Gourock to Dunoon. At this point, Calmac considered the termination of their route. This was disallowed, preventing an outrage among the residents of Dunoon and Gourock. This meant that Calmac needed a vessel to offer a passenger-only service on the route, but financially this was not an option. Instead, Calmac resumed service with Juno, but with only one sailing per hour. This allowed popularity to grow with Western Ferries, which would otherwise have been vulnerable to being put out of business by the frequent Calmac service. From 1986, the \\"streakers\\", , and Juno provided three rosters on the Upper Clyde: one each at Dunoon and Rothesay and the third (1A Roster) to Kilcreggan with peak sailings to Dunoon and Rothesay. Initially they interchanged roster each month, but this became weekly in 1996. With the introduction of on the Clyde in summers, one of the \\"streakers\\" was freed up to carry out a series of cruises on weekday afternoons. From 1993, a cruise ran to Tighnabruaich twice a week, after the commuter runs. These were popular and the programme was extended to include Loch Long, the Kyles of Bute, with Tarbert, Loch Fyne on Sundays. The cruises were withdrawn in 2001, leaving two of the \\"streakers\\" serving Rothesay, and the other, Dunoon. Looking over Rosneath bay to the former naval base, with Juno laid up at the pier and MV Saturn alongside. Final years In July 2005, Juno was joined on the Rothesay to Wemyss Bay route by the new . By early 2007, work was required at Rothesay and vessels had to be very cautious during berthing. The service was operated by Juno and Saturn, with their superior manoeuvrability compared with Bute. Her passenger certificate was to expire on 22 April and , Butes new sistership was still fitting out in Poland. On 21 April 2007, Juno was displaced by Bute. The following day, she crossed to Rosneath pier on the Gare Loch and was never to sail for Caledonian MacBrayne again. Juno remained laid up at Rosneath, where her condition slowly deteriorated. Functioning parts were used to keep and operational. Juno was withdrawn first because her certification did not allow her to operate beyond Arran. In October 2010, she was joined by Jupiter, although Jupiter was kept in reserve, able to return to service if needed. This arrangement continued until the future of the Gourock to Dunoon service was known. In February 2011, it was announced that Juno was to be scrapped. She moved under her own power onto the mud at Rosneath on 18 May 2011 where her scrapping commenced. By July 2011, she was gone, with her bell and lions preserved at the McLean Museum in Greenock. Layout Juno had a large open car deck towards the stern and two internal passenger decks, as well as an open deck, built up on the front of the vessel. This allowed foot passengers to remain separate from the car deck which was level with the lower passenger deck. The upper passenger deck consisted of a small coffee cabin and games machines, with stairs leading down to the lower deck. The lower deck lounge had a ticket office (which closed following new regulations in 2005) and toilets aft, with doorways leading to the car deck. Juno had her accommodation renovated in 1993. The following year, her lifeboats were replaced by smaller life rafts to allow for more deck space.

Which was within 10 miles of Axel Erlandson‚Äôs famed circus trees, known at that time as The Lost World. Reames's mother showed him the value in having a vegetable garden and working with nature. This led to Reames wanting to study botany and horticulture in college, but he rejected the structure of the educational establishment. He traveled the country either by hitchhiking or in a 1969 Chevy van for over a decade. Throughout this time he worked as an itinerant landscaper. Reames states \\"I was 'volunteer homeless.' A real gypsy.\\" He would meet a woman named Maya Many Moons in southwest Oregon at a community dance in 1991. They decide to settle down in Williams Oregon near the border of Klamath National Forest. They brought some land in cooperation with another couple. They had a daughter named Myray Reames and at the same time started building a home using dead standing logs and native stone for the foundation.Arborsmith, Biography of Richard Reames In 1993, needing to look after his new family and wanting to work in an area he loved, Reames had an epiphany inspired by Axel Erlandson's Trees. He started Arborsmith Studios, his tree nursery and art studio. He bends living trees using the arborsculpture process developed by himself. He also uses the horticultural and arboricultural techniques of ring barking, approach grafting, pruning, and framing, in various combinations, to craft functional items and artworks. In 1995 he published the first of his two books How to Grow a Chair: The Art of Tree Trunk Topiary with Barbara Delbol co-authoring. He details his process of shaping trees to create a chair, benches and fences, etc. He also coined the word arborsculpture to identify and describe a craft without a generic name. In 2000, with the people of the town of J≈çk≈çji, Japan, he and John Gathright planted 1100 trees, which, combined with the existing trees created the \\"Laughing Happy Tree Park,\\" with a living tree house with living furniture. Most of the imported trees in this park were destroyed by insect damage, then a typhoon hit causing further damage. The few remaining trees were later moved to the Growing Village Pavilion at the World Expo 2005 in Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.

The structure of the dimerised PLZF BTB/POZ domain has been solved and consists of a tightly intertwined homodimer. The central scaffolding of the protein is made up of a cluster of alpha-helices flanked by short beta-sheets at both the top and bottom of the molecule. BTB/POZ domains from several zinc finger proteins have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes including N-CoR and SMRT. The POZ or BTB domain is also known as BR-C/Ttk or ZiN.

It is a rhizomatous perennial. It is native of China, Korea and Burma, with lavender- blue, bluish-violet, purple-blue, blue-lilac or sky blue flowers. There is a white form as well. It is a compact plant and is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions of the world. Description It has a thick, (the size of a man's thumb),Richard Lynch creeping, buff (coloured), or greenish rhizome.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) They are similar in form to a bearded iris rhizome. It has slender, short roots (under the rhizomes),British Iris Society (1997) and fibres on the top. The creeping habit, creates spreading clumps of plants.Barbara Ellis It does not produce stolons. It has basal fans,De-Yuan Hong and Stephen Blackmore (Editors) that are yellowish green, or pale green, and sword-shaped (ensiform), or lance- shaped. They are also, glossy, and ribbed, and can grow up to between long and wide. The leaves are floppy, and described as semi-evergreen. It has terete (cylindrical), stems that can grow up to between tall.John Greenlee It has 1‚Äì2 branches, and 1‚Äì2 (reduced) stem leaves. The stems have 2‚Äì3 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are green, lanceolate and long and wide. It has a 1 cm long pedicel (flower stalk), which is shorter than the spathe, but similar in size to the ovary. The stems (and the branches) hold between 1 and 3 flowers, in late spring, or early summer, between April and May,Florence Du Cane or June.Donald Wyman It flowers between September and October in Australia. The flower display can last for 2 weeks. The flowers are in diameter, The flattened, horizontal, flowers are larger than Iris japonica flowers.Elizabeth Lawrence The flowers come in shades of lavender blue, or bluish violet, or blue-lilac, or purple-blue, or sky blue. There is also a white form. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate (egg-like), or ovate, with darker (or brownish purple/violet). mottling, veining, streaks, or spots, around a toothed or lacinated (fringed), white crest. They have a bi-coloured claw (part of the petal closest to the stem), white and violet or lilac. The falls are long and 4 cm wide. The elliptic standards spread horizontally (not erect), and are long and 3 cm wide. Both petals (falls and standards) can have wavy margins. The flowers are self-fertile, but are pollinated by insects. It has a 2.5‚Äì3 cm long slender, perianth tube, a 2.5 cm long stamen, bright yellow anthers and a cylindric, 1.8‚Äì2 cm long ovary. It has a pale bluish-violet style branch, that is 3.5 cm long. It has toothed lobes (at the tips), that are irregular. After the iris has flowered, between June and August, it produces an ellipsoid or obovoid (oblong-ovoid), light green, seed capsule. It is long and 2‚Äì2.5 cm wide, and has 6 ribs. When it ripens, (and goes brown,) it splits in three, along 2 or more seams, starting from the top. Inside, are multiple, black- brown seeds, which are pyriform (pear shaped) and have a small cream (coloured) aril (appendage). =Biochemistry= Iris tectorum, seen in the Tyler Arboretum In 1994, a study was carried out to isolate various chemical compounds from the seeds of Iris tectorum, it found an ester 'iristectorene B'. In 1999, a study was carried out Iris tectorum rhizomes, it found a triterpenoid chemical compound. In 2007, a study was carried out on cytotoxic properties of Iris tectorum, used to treat cancer. In May 2007, a study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris tectorum, to find various chemical compounds. In 2009, a karyotype analysis was carried out on 10 Irises found in China, it found the chromosome counts. Iris tectorums were 2n=28. In 2011, Isoflavones such as Tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A (chemical compounds) have been found in the rhizomes of Iris tectorum. They were published in the Journal of Chromatography B, Vol. 879, Issue 13, pages 975‚Äì980.ScholarlyEditions In 2012, a study was carried out on the leaves of Iris tectorum, to find the chemical compounds within the leaves. These compounds were tested for anti-ling cancer properties. In 2013, a study was carried on Iris tectorum to isolate various chemical compounds. In 2013, a molecular phylogenetic (genetic evolution) study was carried out on 16 species of Iris found in Korea. It placed Iris mandshurica in a clade with other basal irises, including Iris dichotoma and Iris tectorum. In January 2014, a study was carried out on the neuro-protective activities of Iris tectorum. Several isoflavones have been found in Iris tectorum. Iris tectorigenin A is found in Iris florentina, Iris tectorum, Iris pseudacorus, Iris kumaonensis and Belamcanda chinensis (iris domestica). Iristectorin B (C23H24O12) can be found in the rhizomes of Iris tectorum, Iris-tectorigenin B found in Iris germanica and Iris tectorum and Iristectorin A (which is also found in Belamcanda chinensis).John Buckingham and V. Ranjit N. Munasinghe As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several times; 2n=28, Simonet, 1932; 2n=32, Sharma, 1970; 2n=28, Chimphamba, 1973; 2n=28, Karihaloo,1978; 2n=28, Karihaloo,1984; 2n=28, Huiang, 1986; 2n=36, Mao & Xue, 1986; 2n=28, Huang 1989 and 2n=32, Dong et al., 1994. It is normally counted as 2 n = 24, 28, 32.  Taxonomy It is pronounced as (Iris) EYE-ris (tectorum) tek-TOR-um. It is written as È∏¢Â∞æ in Chinese script, and known as yuan wei in Pidgin in China.John H. Wiersema and Blanca Le√≥n It has several common names, including; roof iris, Japanese roof iris, wall iris (in America),Arthur Haines and Elizabeth Farnsworth (of New England Wild Flower Society) wall flag, white root iris, Ichihatu (In Japan ‚Äì meaning first as the first iris to flower), shenan, and roof garden iris. It is known as Dach- Schwertlilie in German and takiris in Swedish. The Latin specific epithet tectorum refers to Latin word for roof or covering. Iris tectorum is native to China, but was first discovered in the 1860s, growing in Japan on the roofs, hence the common name. It was first published and described by Karl Maximovich in the 'Bulletin of Acad. Imp. Sci. Saint-P√©tersbourg' Volume15 page380 in 1871. It was published in Flor. Serres Vol.22 page 23 in 1874, with a colour illustration, then published by Hooker in Curtis's Botanical Magazine table 6118 in September, 1874, and in the 'Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society' Vol88 page116 in 1963. It was introduced to England and European cultivation in 1874, by Philipp Franz von Siebold, who sent plants to St Petersburg. It was also introduced to US cultivation by Mr William Bull in 1874. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 2 April 1996 and updated on 1 December 2004. Iris tectorum is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris tectorum from Aizu Matsudaira's Royal Garden, Fukushima pref., Japan It is native to temperate and tropical regions of Asia. =Range= It is found in (central and south western), China, within the Chinese provinces, of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan and Zhejiang. Also found in Korea, and within (the tropical region) of Myanmar (Burma). It is often cited as native to Japan, but it may just be naturalized. It has naturalized in Bhutan and India. It has also naturalized in regions of America, including New Hampshire. =Habitat= It grows on forest margins, on sunny banks, in meadows, in damp places and beside water. It can also be found growing along roadsides and on steep hillsides, in China. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. In New Hampshire, as a wild flower, it is found on the edges of lawns and fields, beside roadsides and in compost heaps. Cultivation Iris tectorum from Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t Karlsruhe, Germany Iris tectorum from Munsiyari, India Iris tectorum is very similar to that of Iris japonica and Iris milesii. It is hardy to between USDA Zone 4 and Zone 9. It is hardy to European Zone H2, it can tolerate temperatures as low as ‚àí10, but needs protection from hard frosts. Older plants can survive some frosts but young plants need protection in the spring. It prefers a dry and cold winter, with a warm and wet summer. Both the blue and white forms of the iris, are perfectly hardy. It is hardy in the UK, but it does not flower very well, due to the summers not being hot enough to bake the roots. It prefers to grow in humus, rich, moist soil, with good drainage. It can tolerate neutral or acidic soils (PH levels between 6.1 ‚Äì 7.8). It can tolerate positions between full sun and partial shade, but prefers light shade, In full sun, the leaves can bleach. (similar to woodland conditions). Although, a few sources say it prefers a sunny, sheltered site. It has average water needs during the growing season. If the summer conditions become exceedingly hot and dry, the iris will go into early dormancy. It can be grown in a mixed flower border, rock garden, and in a woodland garden. If the plant is to be grown in a rockery, it is recommended that the plant has new soil or fertiliser every year. It can be also grown in containers and large (15 cm) pots, but it needs to be re-potted frequently. In the UK, the pot can survive the winter in a cold greenhouse. It suffers from a virus disease that causes leaf discolouration, yellowing and streaking. It seems immune to insect pests, but can be prone to slugs or snails. Also an aphid, Aulacorthum solani can be found on the plant.R. L. Blackman, Victor F. Eastop After flowering, it is best to remove the old stems from Iris confusa, Iris japonica and Iris tectorum, as this helps the plant survive the winter. During spring or autumn, a top dressing of well rotted compost (or well rotted manure), should be added, a feed of fertilizer can also be added. A mulch can also be applied (at the same time) to retain the moisture. Since the roots can quickly take all the nutrients of the soil, division and re-planting is needed every other year, or every 3‚Äì5 years when clumps become over-crowded. Although, it can be left undisturbed for many years, but flowering will decrease. Like most rhizomatous irises, it should be planted with the top of rhizome just at the surface of the soil. They should be spaced apart. =Propagation= Iris tectorum can be propagated by division or by seed growing. It is easy to raise from seed. Plants grown from its seeds will re-produce a true form, including white plants. Division is best done in the spring, or fall (after flowering). Transplanting should be carried out soon after division. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris tectorum 'Woolong' Iris tectorum 'Alba' Iris tectorum has many cultivars including; * 'Alba' (Dykes, has white flowers with yellow markings, yellow veins, and 30 cm tall,), * 'Adamgrove Strain', * 'Atrocaeruleum', * 'Burma Form' (from Australia, mid-green leaves, height 40 cm. blooms in May, dark violet flowers flecked and veined with purple, and has white crests), * 'Freckletec', * 'Japan Form', * 'Lilacina', * 'Middleton Blue', * 'Moon Gold', * 'Norris Strain', * 'Oliver Twist', * 'Taiwan Form', * 'Tectorum Alba', * 'Tectorum album semi plenum', * 'Tectorum Sir Arthur Hort's variety, * 'Tetratec', 'Variegated tectorum', * 'Variegata' (foliage is striped and streaked creamy-white, with purple flowers,), * 'Wolong' (from Wolong in Sichuan, blooms mid-April, 20inches tall, lavender flowers with small dark purple flecks,). Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested, it can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation (like dermatitis or an allergic reaction. Uses Despite its toxicity, it is used in Chinese herbal medicine to treat hepatitis and wind damp pains.Jiaju Zhou, Guirong Xie, Xinjian Ya The Kam eat fish that have been given fresh Iris tectorum, as medicine to treat stomach aches. Culture Flower of Iris tectorum Iris tectorum is commonly called the 'roof iris' because it was grown in the thatch of Chinese and Japanese houses. There are several theories as to why; The most common theory, was due to a period of wartime, or great famine in Japan, all land was then decreed by the emperor to be cultivated, for rice and other food crops. Also, it was illegal for land to be used for growing flowers. But also women wanted the iris roots for making hair dye, face powder and corn plasters. The rhizomes were ground down, to make a white powder used for whitening the skin, similar in look to Geisha girls. Although, EA bowles did not believe this theory. Another theory, was that it was grown in the wet clay and was used to bind the straw thatch together, to stop a roof coming apart. It also acted as a decoration, creating a purple flowering roof-ridge. A final reason known, was that it was planted to avert the 'evil spirits' and a superstition that they prevent disease from affecting the householders.

Founded in 1865 as the Washington Barge Club, the Club changed its name to Vesper Boat Club in 1870. Vesper's stated goal is \\"to produce Olympic champions.\\" Most recently, that goal was achieved by Devery Karz and Kathleen Bertko in the 2016 Summer Olympics The Vesper Boat Club had its beginning on Feb. 22, 1865‚Äì a decade into the flourishing of rowing clubs on Philadelphia's Schuylkill River‚Äì with the founding of the Washington Barge Club. Five years later, on Jan 1, 1870, it changed its name to Vesper Boat Club and quickly became one of the most celebrated rowing clubs in the United States and the world. Vesper's eight- oared shell took the gold medal in Paris at the 1900 Summer Olympics. The Vesper eight repeated its victory at the 1904 games in St. Louis. And at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Vesper's eight won again, making it the only rowing club in the United States to win the title three times. Perhaps the best-known names associated with the Vesper Club are John B. Kelly Sr., an Irish brickworks owner who became influential in city politics and his son, John B. Kelly Jr., a city councilman and brother to Princess Grace of Monaco. Kelly Sr. won Olympic Gold in the single scull in 1920. He also won gold medals in the double scull in 1920 and in 1924, both times with his cousin Paul Costello. As a laborer Kelly was barred from entering the Diamond Sculls at the Royal Henley Regatta. It was two decades later that John B. Kelly Jr. would win that event, in 1947 and 1949. Kelly Jr. won the national singles championship eight times. At the time of his death in 1985, he. was president of the United States Olympic Committee. Under the coaching of such greats as Jim Manning, Dr. Charles W. Riggall, Allan Rosenberg and Dietrich Rose, many other Vesper members have gone on to cumulatively win more national and international races than any club in the United States. The present clubhouse was constructed in combination with neighboring Malta, with the Vesper cornerstone dated 1865. The first building was completed in 1865, and the second boat bay addition in 1898. The last addition was completed in the early 1960s. The boathouse was designed by noted Philadelphia architect G.H. Hewitt. The architecture ‚Äì semi -attached ornamental Victorian Gothic is typical of that period and members who were tradesmen constructed the original building with local building materials. After a century of accomplishments for the men, Vesper in 1970 became the first men's club to organize a women's rowing team. (Philadelphia Girls Rowing Club in 1968 pioneered women's rowing in the United States.) Vesper women have consistently won national championships and have regularly represented the United States in international competition. At the Montreal Olympics in 1976, six Vesper members were on the USA Olympic Rowing Team. Boathouse Vesper Boat Club, #10 Boathouse Row, 1972In 1873, Vesper, in conjunction with Malta Boat Club, built a -story boat house. In 1898, a second floor and addition were added to Vesper, and other renovations have recently been completed. Howard Egar designed the 1898 alterations and additions to the Vesper Boat Club.

Oregon LNG is controlled by the US conglomerate Leucadia National Corporation, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: LUK). The Oregon LNG Project announced that it was ceasing operations on 15 April 2016. The site of the proposed bi-directional Oregon LNG facility was in Warrenton, Oregon, on the estuary of the Columbia River. Warrenton is eight miles (13 km) west of Astoria, Oregon, and is less than 10 miles (16 km) from the point where the Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean. The site is currently being leased by Oregon LNG and consists of 96 acres (39 ha) on the Skipanon Peninsula, a man-made peninsula that was created in the 1920s out of dredge spoils. The proposed terminal would have the capacity to liquefy and ship up to 9.6 million tons of LNG per year and would also have the capacity to import and re-vaporize up to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day during regional supply emergencies. For transport, the gas is chilled to approximately negative 260 ¬∞F (- 163 ¬∞C). This condenses the gas into a liquid, making it much more compact and economical to ship. At its destination, the LNG is transferred from cargo ships to a receiving terminal, which then warms the LNG back to a gaseous state to be piped to customers. If built, the Oregon LNG project would include a marine shipping and receiving terminal, two full-containment 160,000-cubic-meter LNG storage tanks, and facilities for ship berthing and offloading.[1] The storage tanks would be 190 feet tall and would be visible from Astoria. A 2,100-foot (640 m) pier would jut into the river, where a basin would be dredged for LNG tankers to unload. History The project currently known as Oregon LNG began as the Skipanon Natural Gas Facility, with initial talks in 2004.[2] Calpine Energy initiated the project, signing a lease for the 96-acre (388,500 m2) site with the Port of Astoria. In 2005, Calpine went into bankruptcy[1] and the project was subsequently acquired from Calpine in January, 2007[2] by a partnership between original managers of the project and Leucadia National Corp.[3] Leucadia holds a majority share of Oregon LNG.[4] Oregon LNG filed a formal application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October 2008[5] for the import portion of the project. Following the discovery of large shale-gas reserves in the United States and Canada, Oregon LNG modified the project concept and entered FERC's \\"Pre-Filing\\" process for the export portion of the project in July 2012. The Oregon LNG Project announced that it was ceasing operations on 15 April 2016. Opposition Oregon LNG was opposed by a number of groups including The Columbia Riverkeeper and Rising Tide who support reduced pollution, non-fossil fuel, renewable energy sources. The pipeline is also opposed by certain landowners who object to eminent domain laws that would force them to have pipelines buried on their properties. In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 2700, which streamlined the permitting of such linear facilities amid a great deal of citizen objections and protests. Local and state agencies, and tribes recently submitted detailed comments to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality that describe why Oregon LNG's project would violate environmental laws. Over two dozen fishing, landowner, community safety, and conservation organizations joined Columbia Riverkeeper on these comments. ::Expert Report: Review of the Impacts of Oregon LNG‚Äôs Proposed Pipeline on Aquatic Ecosystems.

History The Winchester Model 1903 was designed by T.C. Johnson, who had joined Winchester in 1885 and had become nationally known as an inventor of successful rifles. It was first chambered for the .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge. In 1919, the Model 1903 moniker was shortened to Model 03, and following a partial redesign in the 1930s, was renamed the Model 63. In addition to other changes, the model fired the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. This cartridge was more popular than the .22 Winchester Automatic cartridge, and was demanded by customers. The Model 63 was first available for purchase in 1933 and remained in production until 1958. Production totaled approximately 126,000 Model 1903 rifles and approximately 175,000 Model 63 rifles.\\"The History of Winchester Firearms 1866-1992\\" By Thomas Henshaw Design and Features The Model 1903/Model 63 featured a round barrel. A barrel was approved for manufacturing in 1933, and the barrel was discontinued in 1936. The Model 1903/Model 63 had a tubular magazine in the butt stock. The magazine held ten cartridges, and was loaded through a slot in the right side of the butt stock.\\"Standard Catalog of Winchester Firearms\\" By Joseph Madden Cornell, Paul Goodwin, 2007 The Model 1903 and Model 63 were takedown rifles. The takedown mechanism on the Model 1903 required the user to press the takedown screw-lock down through a slot in the tang to release the lock from the ratchet. The Model 63 featured an improved mechanism that required the user to simply turn the takedown screw to the left until the mechanism released.\\"The History of Winchester Firearms 1866-1992\\" By Thomas Henshaw The self-loading feature of the Model 1903/Model 63 was accomplished by use of a simple blow-back operated mechanism. This mechanism featured a balanced breech bolt, meaning that the breech bolt contained a quantity of metal proportioned to the weight and velocity of the bullet. This balances the recoil forces so that the breech bolt does not move rearward until the bullet has left the muzzle of the barrel, and therefore allows the bullet to be fired with no loss of energy. The original design of this self-loading mechanism required Winchester to design a custom cartridge (the .22 Winchester Automatic) to go along with it. This mechanism was redesigned for the Model 63 to allow it to fire the .22 Long Rifle cartridge, which by then had become much more popular. The Model 1903 was advertised as an \\"automatic rifle\\". In modern times, it is more appropriately referred to as a semi-automatic rifle since the loading mechanism required the trigger to be pulled for each shot. Variants The Model 1903 was available in a \\"standard\\" and a \\"deluxe\\" version (also called \\"plain\\" and \\"fancy\\" versions). The standard version had a plain walnut stock with a plan straight grip. The deluxe version had a checkered walnut pistol grip stock with a checkered forearm. A tubular magazine located in the buttstock held ten cartridges.\\"Standard Catalog of Winchester Firearms\\" By Joseph Madden Cornell, Paul Goodwin, 2007 The first 5000 rifles were produced without a safety mechanism. After this, a cross-bolt safety was added.http://aaa- webs.com/aaa/webs/homestead/courses/1903/1903-History.htm Retrieved 2010-12-6 The Model 63, introduced in 1933, was chambered for the popular and widely available .22 Long Rifle cartridge.

The exhibition is composed mostly of found objects, trash, discarded objects, and other mixed media amalgamations. Ward fits into this exhibition, and the discourse surrounding it perfectly as a New York Based, mixed media artist who typically uses locally found objects to approach issues such as consumer culture, poverty, and race. For this installation Ward collected a myriad of disposed, or otherwise abject children's strollers in Harlem as well as other neighborhoods in Manhattan. There might have been 100‚Äì150 strollers involved in the installation, all of which had seem to have aged and dated to match the theme of the exhibition. Ward sets up an oval path through these strollers in a kind of nostalgic lap through these long-forgotten remnants of every American raised individual's childhood. Ward uses fire hoses connected by knots as the path and has a rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" sung by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson playing on repeat. The bluesy version of this national anthem sets the mood for what can only be described as a nostalgically thought-provoking stroll through strollers. = Hunger Cradle, 1996 = In 1996 Nari Ward participated in the entirely artist-run exhibition 3 Legged Race, organised by two friends of Ward, the artists Janine Antoni and Marcel Odenbach. For the show, which took place in an abandoned firehouse in Harlem, one of the works he produced was Hunger Cradle: a web-like structure made from rope and colourful yarn throughout which he wove a myriad of items, including a cradle. The structure gave them a magical quality suspending them in mid- air. =Mango Tourist, 2011= Using found objects and materials collected from his urban neighborhood, Nari Ward creates sculptural installations that subvert the original purpose of the items shown. From previous works such as Palace LiquorsouL (2010), Ward rearranges the letters of the title in a neon liquor store sign, illuminating only \\"S-O-U-L\\", leaving the remaining letters unlit and upside down. Though there were unexpected compositional arrangements, Ward enacts a transformation of everyday objects into visual markers rich with symbolic and narrative implications. =Breathing Directions= Nari ward in November 2015 created his most impacting exhibit, Breathing Directions. Breathing Directions was created from a trip Nari had taken recently to a church known as \\"The First African Baptist Church\\" located in Savannah, Georgia. The church itself was part of the many stops during the Underground Railroads peak in history. The floorboards of the church show a symbol known as the \\" BaKongo Cosmogram\\" this symbol would be made out of large holes to help slaves underneath the church breath safely without being found. Although, no one has found the exact tunnels to the underneath of the floorboards it is a powerful story of African slaves escaping death itself. In Nari's paintings he uses this symbol to communicate what he had felt while being in the church surrounded by ancient artifacts of the 1850s and 60s.  References  *-Come Together: Surviving Sandy.

Enid's first courthouse opened on April 1, 1896. It consisted of a two-story brick building, which the County soon outgrew. Enid's second courthouse was built by O.A. Campbell of Oklahoma City in 1907 from Oklahoma granite and Indiana stone. The building was located in the center of Broadway, surrounded by sidewalks, and fully landscaped. Its south side was located where the front of the Enid Post Office is now. (Enid's post office used to be where the public library is located now, and Enid's public library was a Carnegie building located at 402 North Independence.) On January 29, 1931, a fire broke out in the jail and spread to the roof, then quickly spread to the rest of the building. All prisoners were safely evacuated, and county records were rescued. From 1931 to 1936, the County operated out of an agricultural building, and later the Broadway Tower. Current courthouse The clock tower of the Garfield County Courthouse. The current Art Deco style Courthouse was built by Hawk & Parr and Reinhart & Donovan companies beginning on August 15, 1934 and was completed in 1936. The jail was refurbished in the 1960s. Garfield County Courthouse consists of county offices and courtrooms housed in the basement and first three floors, and Garfield County Jail occupies the top two floors. Funded by the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, artist Ruth Augur painted historical murals on the courthouse walls.

The newspaper also publishes a weekly total market coverage product, The Advertiser, and a monthly Faith magazine.  History  Since 1869, when the first edition came off a flatbed press in a Main Street building in downtown Chambersburg, Public Opinion has been a part of life in the Cumberland Valley, and the county's most comprehensive source of local news and information. Public Opinion began as a weekly newspaper and then became a daily first published in the morning, but in 1921 it became an afternoon paper. By 1931, Public Opinion had bought two other newspapers with long histories in Franklin County, The Franklin Repository and Valley Spirit. = Corporate ownership = Founded by M.A. Foltz, Public Opinion remained in the Foltz family until 1964, when it was purchased by McClure Newspapers. In 1971, Public Opinion became the 27th newspaper owned by Gannett,Gannett Co., Inc. which publishes USA Today and the weekly newspaper magazine USA Weekend, will be replaced by Parade (magazine). The latter is an insert in Public Opinion on Saturdays. Public Opinion again became a morning newspaper in 2005, the same year that MediaNews Group Inc.Media News Group took over controlling ownership as the newspaper's majority partner of the Texas-New Mexico Newspaper Partnership.8 N.M. Newspapers In Partnership Deal MediaNews, headquartered in Denver, Colo., is one of the nation's largest newspaper companies. It publishes 54 daily newspapers in 11 states. The MediaNews Group-Gannett partnership includes three other south central Pennsylvania newspapers: the York Daily Record and York Sunday News, Lebanon Daily News, and The Evening Sun of Hanover, and newspapers in El Paso, Texas and New Mexico. However, in the Spring of 2015, speculation that Gannett would again take control of some of MediaNews Group's holdings, including the Pennsylvania papers, grew. Later in 2015, Gannett acquired full ownership of the Pennsylvania joint venture.Gannett acquires complete ownership of Texas-New Mexico Newspaper Partnership from Digital First Media  Today  Public Opinions current home at North Third and East King streets was constructed about 1875 as a passenger station of the Cumberland Valley Railroad and served in that role until 1914. It was later used as a canteen for World War I soldiers passing through town and had a variety of manufacturing uses before 1956, when Public Opinion moved in. In 2007, Public Opinion replaced its 50-year-old letterpress with a Goss Urbanite offset press, and also introduced a Sunday edition. Today, the newspaper is Franklin County's largest daily newspaper, with a circulation of about 16,200 Mondays through Fridays and 18,000 Saturday/Sunday \\"Weekend Edition\\".

Kakabekia barghoorniana is a living fossil of this genus.  Anatomy  Kakabekia umbellata, as described by Barghoorn and Tyler in 1965 has an umbellate ‚Äúmantle‚Äù, a stalk-like ‚Äústipe‚Äù and a ‚Äúbulb‚Äù attached to it. Morphology of K. barhoorniana differs; it has a round structure with radial segmentation. They have a (possibly siliceous) ring around this structure. Feulgen-positive material (DNA) was seen in ‚Äúclots‚Äù in K. barghooriniana cytoplasms, placing them in the Prokaryotes.  Distribution  Kakabekia umbellata is known from the Gunflint chert of Canada. K. barghoorniana was first discovered in a soil sample cultured in ammonia from Harlech Castle, Wales in 1968. Further research found K. b. in Iceland and Alaska, as well as other locations in Wales.  Metabolism  Kakabekia has an unusual metabolism. While it has no need for oxygen in its growth, it is not inhibited by it, like Clostridium. This, and the fact that it has some of the oxygen- utilising enzymes, suggest that it is a transition stage of oxygen- utilisation. Kakabekia barghoorni can only be grown in ammonia-rich conditions. This may reflect ancient atmosphere composition.  Ontogeny  Barghoorn and Tyler propose an ontogeny where, starting from a spore, the stipe is grown which then produced the umbellate \\"mantle\\". In 1967, Licari and Cloud noted that many fossil \\"Huroniosporas\\" (a wastebasket taxon containing spore-like beings) have holes or \\"apertures\\" in them, suggesting a detachment point from Kakabekia stipes. However, based on observations of living K. barghoorniana, Siegel et. al. came to a very different conclusion. They found that the spore-like bodies would grow into a larger, spherical organism, encircled by the ring described above. Then, divisions form radiating from the center, and a stipe grows and releases a spore. After about 10 days, the organism degenerates and dies (senescence).

Retrieved 14 Feb 2014 is a short-cut between the rivers Elbe and Weser in North Germany which is part-canal and part-river. It has a length of and is designed for smaller coastal vessels. It includes some of canal dykes and of canal paths. The channel starts in Otterndorf with the Hadeln Canal, then becomes the Bederkesa-Geeste Canal from the town of Bad Bederkesa to the River Geeste, the final leg of the shipping channel, which flows into the Weser at Bremerhaven. It is owned by the state of Lower Saxony, maintained by the NLWKN from its Stade office. Today they just look after maintenance of the drainage system, because the economic element of the canal ‚Äì commercial shipping which was particularly thriving in the late 1960s ‚Äì declined increasingly from 1973 onwards and today hardly exists at all. Nevertheless the waterway is still used by smaller yachts as a short cut between Elbe and Weser.  History  right right The Hadeln Canal in right The Hadlerkanal im right right Very early on, rulers in the Elbe‚ÄìWeser triangle wanted to build a link between the Elbe and the Weser, because ships had to follow a long detour around Cuxhaven, Neuwerk and Scharh√∂rn. This circuitous route was necessary because the Wadden Sea, with its shoals in the area between the Weser and Elbe estuaries, was unnavigable. In addition, in stormy seas small boats did not dare to make the passage. The first records of the subject between the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, the Archdiocese of Bremen and the Hadlers date to the year 1542. As early as 1608/09 a section had been excavated, albeit filled in again by order of the Archbishop of Bremen. Other attempts were made in 1661 and 1768 to 1773. Under French rule another plan was drawn up between 1806 and 1811, but did not come to fruition. This plan had the aim of also creating a link between the Oste and the Geeste.  Hadeln Canal  The waterway was finally opened following the construction of the Hadeln Canal (also called the Hadeler or Hadler Canal), a navigable, drainage channel, roughly long, between the Elbe near Otterndorf and the lake near Bad Bederkesa. The Hadeln Canal was built between 1852 and 1855 and, in addition to providing drainage, acted as a short cut between the Weser and the Elbe until the 1990s, especially for small coastal motor vessels and sports boats. The canal is designed for boats with a length of up to 33.50 metres and a beam of up to 5.00 metres. A draft of up to 1.50 metres is possible. The maximum permitted height, determined by the many bridges, is 2.70 metres. These official figures are only of a theoretical nature, because the canal is no longer managed and reports of boats exceeding these limits are on the rise.  Bederkesa‚ÄìGeeste canal  The Bederkesa‚ÄìGeeste canal was built in the years 1858-1860, because the Hadeln Canal proved economically viable and a link to Bremerhaven was seen as necessary. These were only navigable until the construction of the lock in the Geeste in 1898, thereafter the water level through the lock was too low. Not until the channel was deepened in 1935-37 were barges once again able to use it. A further excavation to cater for larger coastal vessels (K√ºmos) took place in 1957-1961.  The Geeste  The Geeste river rises in Hipstedt in the district of Rotenburg ten kilometres west of Bremerv√∂rde and drains a large part of the old district of Weserm√ºnde (now Cuxhaven). The construction of the third lock on the Geeste in 1898 made the river independent of tides but also resulted in the depth of the channel becoming too low. So until 1935 its use for shipping was limited. Further building work, from 1957 to 1961 and the construction of a tide and storm surge barrier at Bremerhaven improved its shipping capacity significantly.  Locks  The Hadeln Canal has a lock at Otterndorf. Locking is routinely available during the summer months, but in winter only on request. Actual hours of operation are depending on the tides of the Lower Elbe. The second lock is near Lintig on the Bederkesa‚ÄìGeeste canal; this can be operated by boat crews themselves all year round. The lock in Bremerhaven (Tidesperrwerk Bremerhaven) operates daily, but actual hours of operation are depending on the tides. The Schiffdorf flash lock (Schiffdorfer Stauschleuse) on the Geeste at the eastern edge of Bremerhaven was the tidal barrage up to the construction of the lock in Bremerhaven. The flash lock operated between 1892 and the 1960s. Since 1985 the remains of the flash lock are protected as a cultural monument. Shortly before the confluence of the Geeste is the storm surge barrier under the Kennedy Bridge which was completed in 1961.

In the spine, there is bone formation along the anterior longitudinal ligament and sometimes the posterior longitudinal ligament, which may lead to partial or complete fusion of adjacent spinal levels. The facet and sacroiliac joints tend to be uninvolved. The thoracic spine is the most common level involved. In the peripheral skeleton, DISH manifests as a calcific enthesopathy, with pathologic bone formation at sites where ligaments and tendons attach to bone. Signs and symptoms The majority of people with DISH are not symptomatic, and the findings are an incidental imaging abnormality. In some, the x-ray findings may correspond to symptoms of back stiffness with flexion/extension or with mild back pain. Back pain or stiffness may be worse in the morning. Rarely, large anterior cervical spine osteophytes may affect the esophagus or the larynx and cause pain, difficulty swallowing or even dyspnea. Similar calcification and ossification may be seen at peripheral entheseal sites, including the shoulder, iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, trochanters of the hip, tibial tuberosities, patellae, and bones of the hands and/or feet. Cause The exact cause is unknown. Mechanical, dietary factors and use of some medications (e.g. isotretinoin, etretinate, acitretin and other vitamin A derivatives) may be of significance. There is a correlation between these factors but not a cause or effect. The distinctive radiological feature of DISH is the continuous linear calcification along the antero-medial aspect of the thoracic spine. DISH is usually found in people in their 60s and above, and is extremely rare in people in their 30s and 40s. The disease can spread to any joint of the body, affecting the neck, shoulders, ribs, hips, pelvis, knees, ankles, and hands. The disease is not fatal, however some associated complications can lead to death. Complications include paralysis, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and lung infections. Although DISH manifests in a similar manner to ankylosing spondylitis, they are separate diseases. Ankylosing spondylitis is a genetic disease with identifiable marks, tends to start showing signs in adolescence or young adulthood, is more likely to affect the lumbar spine, and affects organs. DISH has no indication of a genetic link, and does not affect organs other than the lungs, which is only indirect due to the fusion of the rib cage. Long term treatment of acne with vitamin derived retinoids, such as etretinate and acitretin, have been associated with extraspinal hyperostosis.  Diagnosis  DISH is diagnosed by findings on x-ray studies. Radiographs of the spine will show abnormal bone formation (ossification) along the anterior spinal ligament. The disc spaces, facet and sacroiliac joints remain unaffected. Diagnosis requires confluent ossification of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies. Classically, advanced disease may have \\"melted candle wax\\" appearance along the spine on radiographic studies.Waldron, T. \\"Paleopathology\\". Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 73. In some cases, DISH may be manifested as ossification of enthesis in other parts of the skeleton. The calcification and ossification is most common on the right side of the spine. In people with dextrocardia and situs inversus this calcification occurs on the left side.

Symptoms of pain and stiffness may be treated with conservative measures, analgesic medications (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and physical therapy. In extraordinary cases where calcification or osteophyte formation is causing severe and focal symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or nerve impingement, surgical intervention may be pursued.

Brig. Gen. Thomas Lawson Thomas Lawson (August 29, 1789 ‚Äì May 15, 1861) was an American physician who served as Surgeon General of the United States Army for over 24 years. Biography Lawson was born in Princess Anne County, Virginia in 1789. Nothing is known about his early education or medical education, but it is assumed that he trained under local physicians. He entered the United States Navy as a surgeon's mate in March 1809. He resigned two years later to be appointed as a garrison surgeon's mate in the army. Lawson served during the War of 1812 as he was promoted to be the regimental surgeon for the 6th Infantry on May 21, 1813. In May 1815 he became the surgeon for the 7th Infantry, and appeared as a senior officer of surgeons until he was promoted to Surgeon General in October 1836. During his time with the 6th Infantry he was President of a board of medical examiners in charge of giving troops entrance and promotion health examinations. With troops concentrated around his garrison for the Seminole War, he was appointed the medical director of Fort Mitchell, Alabama. In 1836 Surgeon General Joseph Lovell died. A movement to promote a civilian doctor to the post was opposed by the army who were in full support of Lawson. He was appointed on November 30, 1836 by President Jackson. After the Seminole War there were few activities needing the attention of the Surgeon General, but Lawson worked to create many changes within the medical department of the military. Improvements included an increase in numbers, new uniforms, military rank and increased pay. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Lawson accompanied General Winfield Scott from Vera Cruz to Mexico City as a medical advisor. The first three volumes of Army Medical Statistics were published during Lawson's tenure. Lawson received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in May 1848. At the start of the American Civil War, Lawson was 72 and in poor health. The medical staff for the Union Army consisted of 30 surgeons and 83 assistant- surgeons. On May 15, 1861 he was stricken with apoplexy and died in Norfolk, VA. References * http://history.amedd.army.mil/surgeongenerals/T_Lawson.html * Gillett MC.

The fault takes name from Lanalhue Lake, which is located in part of the fault trace, of elongated shape shows the NW-SE trend. The lanalhue fault makes up a major lithological boundary in the Chilean Coast Range to which Cordillera de Nahuelbuta belongs. The Nahuelbuta Range is composed by Carboniferous granitic core bounded by High-T metasedimentary rocks referred as the Eastern Series. The Arauco Basin contains over 3 km of late Cretaceous to Holocene continental and marine sediments, being a major center of coal mining and hydrocarbon exploration for over a century.Melnick et al 2009, Segmentation of megathrust rupture zones from fore-arc deformation patterns over hundreds to millions of years, Arauco peninsula, Chile From Valpara√≠so Region to Lanalhue Fault Carboniferous-Permian granitoids makes up a large part of the bedrock of the Chilean Coast Range.

After writing a successful book, author Donald Miller's life stalled. Instead of enjoying the fruits of his labor, Miller had slipped into a dark point in his life. He had no desire to participate in the daily responsibility of life and found himself questioning what his purpose was. While in this slump he was approached by two movie producers wanting to turn his book into a movie. A Million Miles in a Thousand Years centers on the realizations that Miller came to while editing his successful memoir Blue Like Jazz into a screenplay for a movie, directed by Steve Taylor.Blue Like Jazz: The Movie In writing the screen play and editing the book events into proper, and interesting, movie dialogue, Miller learns a little more about the elements of story and through those things learns more about the story that he is living as well as the story he wants to be living. He challenges himself by putting himself in situations that require more effort and sacrifice than he would typically feel comfortable exerting. Miller goes from sleeping all day to riding his bike across America, from living in romantic daydreams to fearful encounters with love, from wasting his money to founding a nonprofit with a passionate cause. Guided by a host of outlandish but very real characters, Miller shows us how to get a second chance at life the first time around. A Million Miles in a Thousand Years is a rare celebration of the beauty of life.

The hospital was built as a private hospital by the American company Health Care International at a cost of was ¬£180 million and opened in March 1994. Six months after opening, receivers were involved and several months after that, it was being run by the Middle Eastern-based Abu Dhabi Investment Company.

Founded in 1985 by Rabbi Meir Schuster, it offers free or subsidized lodging to Jews from around the world. The hostel provides young Jewish adults with information on touring, studying, intern, and work opportunities in Israel, in addition to providing follow-up connections, especially with the Jewish communities back in their home towns around the world.  History  Meir Schuster opened the Heritage House non-profit youth hostels in 1985 in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem in order to give Jewish young adults the opportunity to explore Israel and their heritage in a safe and home-like environment. It is the only Jewish-run youth hostel in the Old City. After changes in leadership, the organization split into two separate entities. The Men's house, led by Rabbi Ben Packer, moved to a location near the Hurva Synagogue. The Women's house, led by Chaya Weisberg, remained at its original location.  Services  Apart from lodgings, the Heritage House provides a range of services designed to help guests explore Israel and Judaism, including free tours, information on educational programs, internship and volunteering opportunities. = Shabbat = There is a special optional program every Shabbat. One of the highlights is Jeff Seidel, director of the Jewish Student Information Center, arranges for guests to spend Shabbat meals with Orthodox families. For many guests this is the first time they ever see traditional Jewish family life up close. = Jewish holidays = The High Holy days are the busiest time of the year for the Heritage House. An explanatory service is run in the Old City designed especially for beginners, although it attracts young Jews up to the age of 30 from all levels of observance. = Volunteer programs = Under the leadership of Packer, guests of the Jerusalem Heritage House for men take part in volunteer work restoring historical sites in Hebron and repairing synagogues and agricultural work at the vineyard in Kfar Tapuach and at locations in Israeli settlements.  Accommodations  The Heritage House consists of two buildings, one for men and one for women, which are in close proximity. The buildings date back to the Crusader period, with a medieval ambiance preserved through the stone walls and classic interior arches. Nevertheless, both buildings have modern renovations and extensions to cater to the comfort of the guests.  Haaretz expos√©  In a series of reports published in Haaretz between Nov. 13-14 2017, it was alleged that the men's Heritage House encourages guests to volunteer in illegal West Bank outposts, does not accept non-Jewish guests, and promotes a radical right-wing agenda. Former guests who were interviewed on their time there described it's director, Rabbi Ben Packer, as an open Kahanist and claimed to have heard him making racist and homophobic remarks. One former guest who had stayed in the hostel when Rabbi Meir Schuster was still in charge and then returned after Packer had taken over claimed that it began promoting Kahanist ideology after Packer assumed leadership. Following the reports, Birthright stopped promoting the hostel while Aish, among other Jerusalem centered foundations, continued their support.https://www.aish.com/jw/s/The-Man-at-the-Wall.html The women's Heritage House however is considered definitively apolitical and is a separate legal entity.{https://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/1.822795}https://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/.premium-1.821979https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.822627  References  *Jerusalem hostel caters to the non-observant  The Canadian Jewish News *Top 5: Jerusalem hostels  JPost  Israel News   External links  * Men's hostel * Women's hostel * Category:Hotels in Jerusalem Category:Hotels established in 1985 Category:Hostels Category:1985 establishments in Israel Category:Non-profit organizations based in Israel ","title":"The Heritage House"},{"id":"26659348","text":"The Paris-based Swingle Singers recorded regularly for Philips in the 1960s and early 1970s and the successor London-based group continued to record, for Columbia / CBS, Virgin Classics and other record labels from 1974 to the present.

Founded in 1996, CCFH has benefited approximately 16,000 children through direct treatment and established training programs. In addition to services delivered in the state of North Carolina, CCFH has provided assistance in the aftermath of national tragedies such as 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina.  Services and programs  Prevention CCFH focuses their attention on the prevention of child abuse and neglect in children between the ages of 0‚Äì5. Through Healthy Families Durham, an intensive, home-based support program for low-income, high risk families; CCFH works to prevent child abuse, identify special needs, and promote child health and development. Through the Durham Connects program, nurses conduct home visits with families with newborns to identify whether they are at risk and to provide referrals for medical and community-based resources. Additional parent-focused interventions include the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catchup, Parent Child Interaction Therapy, Child Parent Psychotherapy, and the Incredible Years. The center is a leader in the East Durham Children's Initiative, which is a local replication and implementation of the Harlem Children's Zone. Training CCFH has directed a range of training programs including the Period of Purple Crying: Keeping Babies Safe in North Carolina, which aims to reduce traumatic brain injuries in infants. Another program, the North Carolina Domestic Violence and Children Training Academy resulted in a toolkit and online courses through the NC Area Health Education Centers designed to improve capacities of domestic violence shelter and agency staff to screen, intervene, and refer children experiencing distress related to their exposure to violence and other adverse events. CCFH has applied collaborative learning and quality improvement methods to dissemination of best practices for the treatment of child traumatic stress and is a partner in the Duke Evidence Based Practice Implementation (EPIC) and the North Carolina Child Treatment Program with the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Treatment CCFH offers direct psychiatric services in the community including Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress, Child-Parent Psychotherapy for Family Violence, Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Abuse Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Trauma Focused Coping, which was developed by CCFH faculty in response to an industrial disaster. In 2001, the US Office for Victims of Crime highlighted CCFH as one of the most effective child treatment centers in the country. In addition, CCFH creates partnerships to maximize effectiveness and outreach. For example, CCFH currently collaborates with the Durham police officers as part of the North Carolina Child Response Initiative (NCCRI) to reduce the effects of violence on children. Due to the success of this program, a 2007 report recommends an expansion of this program in its comprehensive gang assessment. Legal The Legal Program addresses the complex legal needs of families served by CCFH and provides current legal information to CCFH staff. The Legal Director is made available by North Carolina Central University (NCCU) School of Law through their Clinical Programs Department. The program offers legal support to all of the CCFH programs, and works to expand the program's involvement on a university, statewide, and national scale. Furthermore, the Legal Program focuses on state policy related to child well-being, training on mental health law and expert witness testimony, and court preparation for child witnesses.  Research and publications  CCFH is designated by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network as a Community Treatment and Services Center. Through this designation, CCFH bridges the gap between community-based practice and research on empirically proven interventions for childhood trauma. The center is well-renowned and has multiple publications by faculty and staff including: * The Child Status Index * Child Maltreatment:What We're Learning and Where We're Going * Dissociation Predicts Later Attention Problems in Sexually Abused Children * Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatment for Children and Adolescents Exposed to Traumatic Events * Improving Law Enforcement Response and Mental Health Services for Child Trauma Victims in North Carolina * Domestic Violence Toolkit * The Durham Family Initiative:A Preventive Care System  References   External links  * National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome * The National Child Traumatic Stress Network * East Durham Children's Initiative * North Carolina Child Response Initiative * Keeping Babies Safe in North Carolina Category:Health charities in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in North Carolina ","title":"Center for Child and Family Health"},{"id":"26659432","text":"Varzuga () is the rural locality (a selo) in Tersky District of Murmansk Oblast, Russia, located on the Varzuga River.

Other documents of the 1460s indicate that the residents of Varzuga were the second generation of the original Russian settlers. The documents refer to the residents' land plots as otchinas, meaning that they were inherited from the fathers, but there is no mention of dedinas (lands inherited from the grandfathers). From the second half of the 15th century, it served as the seat of Varzuzhskaya Volost (which was abolished in 1841). By 1563, Varzuga's population grew to 124 homesteads, who were primarily salmon fishers.–ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ \\"–¢–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –ë–µ—Ä–µ–≥\\", ‚Ññ37, 14 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2002 –≥. \\"–°–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¢–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞\\" In the mid-17th century, some of the residents moved out to the coast, where they founded new villages, such as Kuzomen and Tetrino. In 1861, Varzuga was a part of Kemsky Uyezd of Arkhangelsk Governorate. It had three Orthodox churches and housed its own rural government. The population was 249 (120 male and 129 female); living in 54 homesteads. The 1897 Census counted 793 residents, and the population grew further.

It protects the wearer's upper clothes from dirt and wear and in some cases provide additional protection in the case of falls. History =East Asia= The Manchu \\"horse jacket\\" (magua) was a dark blue riding coat worn by Manchurian horsemen before becoming a staple item of menswear across the Qing Empire. It subsequently developed into the Burmese taikpon and the Chinese tangzhuang. =Britain= Woman wearing a traditional riding mac at a parade in Coldstream Metropolitan Museum of Art Original waterproof designs ‚Äì similar to a mackintosh ‚Äì generally comprised a full- length coat with wide skirt and leg straps to keep it in place. Other typical features included a belted waist, large patch pockets with protective flap, raglan sleeves with tab and wind cuff, fly front, throat tab and a broad collar. In 1823 Charles Macintosh (1766‚Äì1843) patented his invention for waterproof rubberised cloth, pressing together two sheets of cotton material with dissolved India-rubber sandwiched in between. It was a brilliant idea for making any fabric weatherproof, and the very first macintosh coats were made at the family's dyestuffs factory, Charles Macintosh and Co of Glasgow. The rubber processing pioneer Thomas Hancock (1786‚Äì1865) was aware of Macintosh‚Äôs work and in 1825 he took out a licence to manufacture the patented \\"waterproof double textures\\". For historical background, refer to the hardback \\"The Hancocks of Marlborough\\"\\"The Hancocks of Marlborough\\" by John Loadman & Francis James, Oxford University Press, 2009 and website \\"Bouncing Balls\\", author John Loadman Using masticated scrap rubber instead, Hancock's solutions had a higher rubber content than those of Macintosh and so could more readily give a uniform film on the cloth, minimising water penetration and odour. Eventually the two men co-operated, so that in 1831 Hancock became a partner in Charles Macintosh & Co and their two companies merged. One feature of the co-operation was the construction of an automated spreading machine to replace Macintosh‚Äôs original paint brushes. In 1834 Hancock's London factory burned down and Macintosh had already closed the Glasgow factory, hence all the work transferred to Manchester. See the \\"Virtual Encyclopedia of Greater Manchester\\" From then on, the manufacturing of \\"proper\\" raincoats or macs impervious to all weathers ‚Äì constructed of two layers of rubber-coated cotton fabric or \\"double textured\\" ‚Äì was concentrated, with all necessary expertise and experience, in Manchester or the Lancastrian cotton towns. There such rubber or rubberised products amounted to a \\"cottage industry\\", as confirmed by the abundance of company records in the National Archives at Kew, Surrey. Classic, belted, double-textured trench coats in off-white or fawn for riding or walking were fashionable prior to World War 2 until the end of the century as a specifically British fashion, flattering the human form and enhancing its magnetism. To see typical wartime usage, a good reference is Danger UXB (Anthony Andrews), Thames Television's acclaimed drama series first broadcast in the late 1970s, or the 1976 movie The Eagle Has Landed (film) (Donald Sutherland). The military flavour of rubberised raincoats continued with the 1997 programme Bodyguards (TV series) (as sported by John Shrapnel playing Commander MacIntyre of the elite protection team). A model pictured in the December 1944 issue of Vogue (magazine) showed the attractiveness and practicality of these macs for the fashion-conscious, whilst they appeared in favourite 1950s and 1960s feature films such as Genevieve (film) (1953) (worn by Dinah Sheridan), Me and the Colonel (1958) (Nicole Maurey) and Twice Round the Daffodils (1962) (Sheila Hancock), always sharp, clean, rustling and making a bold statement. Meanwhile, traditional gentlemen's outfitters such as Cordings, Hackett and Gieves & Hawkes continued to sell plenty of smart walking coats in thick rubberised cotton, very popular at the time. Common in Britain around 1960 were neat zipper jackets for young and old, frequently with pinched waist, and hooded anoraks in the same materials - the latter in dark green for scouting, hiking, climbing, canoeing and yet more of the great outdoors. Developing on from that, double-textured \\"gangster\\" macs were the must-have, trendy outerwear for girls with chutzpah around 1970, having originated with the Valstar \\"Gangster\\" brand designed by Maurice Attwood. Featuring a signature yoke front and back, a belt and peplum, and wriststraps with buckles, these styles were sold in a range of colours, different lengths, and either cotton or viscose, at major high street stores like Debenhams (under their Debroyal brand) and C&A; (Vivienne style) at prices from ¬£10 to ¬£20. The snazzy yoked design was all the rage among the younger set, even appearing in suitably small sizes for daughters proud to copy their mums. This or a similar style of rainwear graced the foremost actors and actresses of the time. Cinema films included Country Dance (film) (1970) (Susannah York), Hoffman (film) (1970) (Sin√©ad Cusack), No Blade of Grass (1970) (Nigel Davenport, Jean Wallace, Lynne Frederick), The Ragman's Daughter (1972) (Victoria Tennant) and All Creatures Great and Small (film) (1974) (Lisa Harrow, Simon Ward). Examples of the many TV series in that period containing Valstar ‚ÄúGangster‚Äù type double-textured rainwear were Take Three Girls (Liza Goddard), The Lotus Eaters (TV series) (Wanda Ventham) and Man About the House (Paula Wilcox). Since they provided effective insulation against the cold, the garments were later called ‚Äúwinter macs‚Äù by females, who would wear them buttoned, with upturned short collar and - to complete the look - a neckerchief giving a bright, contrasting slash of colour. The retro \\"gangster\\" style has been revived as the \\"Chorlton\\" in a choice of five colours by Lakeland Elements of Lancaster, since Chorlton-upon-Medlock, now part of Greater Manchester, was the location of one of the early macintosh factories. Other design initiatives and variants over the years included the introduction of ‚Äúlight double-textured‚Äù and ‚Äúsingle-textured‚Äù rubberised macs, again in many hues. There were ponchos, military-style capes and more recently the short, navy blue Margaret Howell hoody. Then, on the Continent of Europe, you would see the green hooded anorak or slicker, with yellow rubber lining, as worn by Anne-Laure Meury in the classic French relationship movie The Aviator's Wife (1981) and the similarly unisex Friesennerz reversible hooded anorak in yellow rubber with blue (sometimes fawn) lining, sold on Germany‚Äôs high streets and sported by Glenda Jackson in her 1978 film The Class of Miss MacMichael. Certainly the latter mac was beloved by young tourists of German nationality making pilgrimage to the fashion mecca of the Swinging Sixties, Carnaby Street in London W1.

The amps were offered with hardwood cabinets, or in a variety of vinyl-covered birch plywood cabinets in a variety of colors. The amps were built as 1-12\\", or 1-10\\" combos, or as a head. JBL E-120 speakers were offered as an option. Jim Kelley Amplifiers were also the first guitar amplifiers to be offered with an optional power attenuator. Jim developed these high-power continuously variable L-pad attenuators as a means of controlling the overall volume of his amplifiers so that the output section could be overdriven at more modest sound pressure levels. One unique feature of these power attenuators is the remote footswitch which would allow the attenuator to be bypassed. Further amplifier innovations were incorporated into the FACS (foot-activated channel switching) model, which built upon the single-channel design by including two similar switchable preamps and tone stacks, independent reverb level controls for each channel, and internal relay switching for the external power attenuator. These models were available with optional transformer-coupled effects loops, and were configured for either a master effects loop, or for a separate effects loop for each channel. Owing to its longer (22-inch) chassis, the FACS model amplifiers were available additionally as a 2-10\\", or 4-10\\" combo. Another novel feature developed by Jim Kelley was the LED Bias Indicator as an aid in adjusting grid bias. The final model to be developed and produced was the FACS Line Amp. It had all the features of a FACS amp, but the lead channel also employed a low-power push-pull output section. The miniature output transformer was followed by the Main Gain control, which functioned as a Master Volume. The lead channel also had a post distortion passive LC tone control which could cut or boost mid-range. A rack-mounted, all-FET stereo guitar amplifier with analog delay reverb was developed but never brought to market. From 2012 until 2017 Suhr Guitars (JS Technologies) reissued the single-channel Reverb Model and Power Attenuator under a licensing agreement with Jim Kelley. In 2018 Jim began building a new single channel version of the Line Amp model in limited quantities. The amps are now only sold at privately held auctions. The most distinguishing feature of the new design is the innovative Harmonic Generator overdrive circuit. The circuit comprises a dual cascode differential amplifier and utilizes a pair of conventional dual triode tubes. The circuit produces harmonic distortion similar to that of an overdriven power output stage. Like the earlier Line Amps, output signal level is controlled by the Main Gain master volume. A post master volume, transformer coupled, guitar level effects loop is also provided. In addition, the amp contains much of the same circuitry as the original Single Channel non-reverb amp. In 2020 Jim Kelley began building a two channel version of the Line Amp. Unlike the FACS Line Amp, these amps feature two distinct inputs. But similar to the FACS, the two channel Line Amp has two preamps, and each preamp has its own tone controls. The A input is a legacy Reverb Model preamp. The B input is the Line Amp channel. Channel switching is accomplished using any external A/B or A/B/Y type footswitch. Among the unique feature of these amps are the dual concentric potentiometers, providing control of Gain, Treble, and Bass for each of the two channels.

Humbert was succeeded by Saint Curcodomus. From the 9th century to the time of the French Revolution in the late 18th century, the abbey followed the Rule of St. Benedict. The abbey was repaired and restored in 1025 by Gerard of Florennes (G√©rard de Cambrai) after the Norman invasions. It suffered damage in the 14th and 15th centuries in wars involving the County of Hainaut. Reconstruction projects took place during the 16th and 18th centuries.

The term Shaikh can cover a community of no definite origin, since the name has been used by any individuals of wide background. On occasion, they may be of influential people or poor farmers converted by Sufi saints who used to adopt Shaikh title. They played a key role in the early Islamic history of Gujarat, serving as courtiers and administrators for the Sultans of Gujarat and later Mughal rulers. After the breakup of the Mughal Empire, they became rulers of a number of states in the Kathiawar region, with Mangrol being the most important. The community is found mainly in Ahmedabad, Bharuch, Godhra, Vadodara, Rajkot, Junagadh, Bhavnagar and the Kutch District. They are essentially an urban community, except the Shaikh of Kutch. The Kutchi Shaikh have three groups of equal status, the Shaikh Dada, Shaikh Sayed and Shaikh Fakeer. The first two are found in Kanyabee village and the last group in Shaikh Sumrasar village of the Bhuj taluka. Shaikh by District History & origin = The Hansotis of Bharuch = The Shaikh of Bharuch District include the Hansotis, a unique community, who initially arose from the Hansot taluka of Gujarat. The Hansoti dialect, which has often been assigned to a broader language known as \\"Bombay Urdu\\" has an archaic proto-Urdu character; it has retained Arabic and Turkic words which other Urdu dialects do not. Some may ascribe it to the geographical middle zone, popularly entitled Bombay Urdu. Their language borrows many gramatical aspects from Indo Aryan languages such as Punjabi, Archaic Turkish Bombay/Dakhni Urdu and Gujarati. Many Hansoti‚Äôs also migrated to Pakistan as well during the Partition of India, therefore being a huge community in Pakistan, especially in the urban city of Karachi. The ethnic mix of Hansotis, on the precursor stock, includes a dizzying variety of additions e.g. phenotypic features, covering the range from Yemen, Iraq & Syria to Khorasanian(Central Asian Turco-Persian), native Indic nationalities to Ethiopic Habshis which are a rarity now. One often sees their men being barrel-chested, broad-shouldered with Turkic eyes & noses, children with brown hair, & even the odd example of blue or green eyes & red hair. There are tall men possessed of a Punjabi, or Rajput caste. Although a lot of Hansoti‚Äôs can speak Gujarati due to its geographical location, however they are not ethnically Gujarati and are somewhat a clannish and independent group. Their Last names consist of Shaikh, Malek(Malik), Chauhan(Rajputs), and Pathan(Pathans). Many Hansoti‚Äôs have settled in several parts of the world. Predominantly California, especially, San Francisco( Bay Area) and several other states, countries in Europe, Africa, etc. Prominent people from Hansot include: * Shaikh Samad, who reported directly to the Mughal Emperor Akbar (regarding the Parsi community of Navsari, among other matters); * Actor Farooq Sheikh, and; * Cricketer Abdulahad Malek. http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/290721.html  Present circumstances The Shaikh of Gujarat are largely an urban community, with the exception being the Shaikh of Kutch, who are largely farmers. In Kutch, the Shaikh undertake rain fed agriculture, and grow mainly wheat, sorghum and groundnuts. A few rear goat, sheep and cattle. Those in the urban area engage in a number of occupation, and have traditions similar to other Gujarati Muslims community. The majority of the Shaikh are Sunni, the only exception being the Shaikh families of the town of Khambhat, who are Shia. Like other Gujarati Muslims, and in opposition to Islamic precepts, some have a statewide caste association, the Shaikh Samyukh Mowath Jamat. The Shaikh of Gujarat have differing native languages depending on their particular ethnogenesis. Some speak Gujarati with large number of Urdu loanwords, while those of Kutch speak Kutchi. ., & yet others speak archaic proto-Urdu e.g. Hansotis. The Sodagar The Sodagar or \\"Arab Shaikh\\" are a small sub-group within the larger Shaikh community. They originate from the Hadhramaut region of Yemen, and settled in the city of Patan, during the period of Mughal rule, and intermarried with the Sunni Bohra community. The community were involved the buying and selling of silk, and exporting it to the Middle East. They still maintain links with the Middle East, being fluent in Arabic. But the Sodagar mohalla in Patan has declined, with many of their houses becoming crumbling ruins. They have their own caste association, the Jamat Shams Sodagaran, which is involved in the up keep of their jamat khana, in the town of Patan.

It is her best known work. In 1991 the Times Literary Supplement listed it as one of the hundred most influential non-fiction books published since 1945. It has gone through numerous reprints and re-editions (1969, 1970, 1978, 1984, 1991, 2002). In 2003 a further edition was brought out as volume 2 in Mary Douglas: Collected Works ().  Summary  The line of inquiry in Purity and Danger traces the words and meaning of dirt in different contexts. What is regarded as dirt in a given society is any matter considered out of place. (Douglas took that lead from William James.) She attempted to clarify the differences between the sacred, the clean and the unclean in different societies and times, but that did not entail judging religions as pessimistic or optimistic in their understanding of purity or dirt, such as dirt-affirming or otherwise. Through a complex and sophisticated reading of ritual, religion and lifestyle, Douglas challenged Western ideas of pollution and clarified how context and social history are essential. As an example of that approach, Douglas first proposed that the kosher laws were not, as many believed, either primitive health regulations or randomly-chosen tests of the Israelites' commitment to God. Instead, Douglas argued that the laws were about symbolic boundary- maintenance. Prohibited foods were those that did not seem to fall neatly into any category. For example, the place of pigs in the natural order was ambiguous because they shared the cloven hoof of the ungulates but did not chew cud. Later, in a 2002 preface to Purity and Danger, Douglas went on to retract this explanation of the kosher rules and said that it had been \\"a major mistake\\". Instead, she proposed that \\"the dietary laws intricately model the body and the altar upon one another\\". For instance, among land animals, Israelites were allowed to eat animals only if they were allowed to be sacrificed as well: animals that depend on herdsmen. Douglas concluded from that that animals that are abominable to eat are not in fact impure but that \\"it is abominable to harm them\\". She claimed that later interpreters (even later Biblical authors) had misunderstood this.  Influence  A historian of Late Antiquity, Peter Brown, stated that Purity and Danger was a major influence in his important 1971 article \\"The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity\\", which is considered to be one of the bases for all subsequent study of early Christian asceticism.

The name was used between 1931 and 1939, after which the road became the northern section of the Queen Elizabeth Way. It borrowed the name of Middle Road from a concession road in Toronto Township between 1st Concession South and 2nd Concession South during the early 1800s. The Middle Road was initially constructed as a depression relief project, employing 74 men to grade and widen the country lane into a four lane roadway. In 1934, the concept was reworked by Thomas McQuesten and Robert Melville Smith into a divided, limited access freeway, the first such intercity stretch in North America when it was opened in 1939.While the Long Island Parkway and several similar roadways opened in the late twenties and early thirties, these parkways were designed to move traffic in and out of a city's downtown. The Middle Road was designed to provide travel between cities, and opened a year before the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the first U.S. highway to do this. The Middle Road provided the blueprint for Highway 401, believed by some to be the most important single factor to the current economy and standard-of-living in Ontario.Shragge p. 95 \\"as geography professor, E.G. Pleva, of the University of Western Ontario stated: ‚ÄòHighway 401 is the most important single development changing the social and economic pattern of Ontario. It is still transforming the province's economy and the social, work and spending habits of its people.‚Äô\\"  Route description  The Middle Road or Commissioners' Road,http://www.pollard.ca/genealogy/0001text.txt named so because of its location between what were then the highways (or historic streets) between Toronto and Hamilton, Dundas Street and Lakeshore Road, followed the same path taken by today's Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), with little exception, beginning at the Humber River and travelling to Bronte Line (where today, the QEW veers south). Since the highway followed a concession road,Stamp p. 13 it was straight for almost its entire length, veering only at Browns Line (Highway 27), the Credit River, and at the Oakville border. At the time of construction, this route was surrounded by farmland, as most of the towns in the area at the time lay along Dundas or Lake Shore, to the north and south respectively. However, the highway spurred rapid development of the surrounding land; it did not take long for farmland to become subdivisions. Middle Road was also a concession created between 1st Concession South and 2nd Concession South during the early 1800s. Bronte Creek Bridge, 1936. The old Middle Road bridge is visible in the foreground. Most of the route was paved with concrete.Stamp p. 50 The two roadways were separated by a median varying in width,Shragge indicates three to ten feet on page 79, consistent with the minimum of one metre given by Stamp on page 20, but far less than the maximum of nine metres. often filled with trees. Most of the rows of trees along the old country lane were incorporated into the median, and new ones were planted in the gaps, as equal focus was given to functionality as aesthetics.Stamp p. 24 Over most of the bridges, the two roadways converged, undivided. These were, however, a great improvement from the bridges along the old lane, as seen in the picture at left. At Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) was Canada's first cloverleaf interchange,Shragge p.81 opened in 1937.Stamp p. 25Stamp also writes on page 20 that construction on the cloverleaf began in 1937. Shragge also indicates it opened in 1937 on page 81. One of the elements of the Middle Road, to which engineers paid particular attention in future highway design, was controlled access. While the section between the Humber River and Highway 27 was built without allowance for private driveways, and was thus controlled- access, many at-grade intersections existed along the Middle Road west of Highway 27, and many adjoining landowners built driveways to the highway for access, an issue that led to the creation of legislation to allow the designation of a road as 'controlled-access'.Stamp p. Today, a small remnant of the pre-1930s Middle Road can be found spanning the Etobicoke Creek off of Sherway Drive at the Mississauga and Etobicoke border. The bridge, constructed in 1909, was part of Middle Road until 1932 and served as a farm lane until the section of the Queen Elizabeth Way into Toronto opened in 1940. It was the first concrete truss bridge built in Canada. It was designed by Frank Barber and built by Octavius Hicks. The short section was later renamed Sherway Drive.  History  Middle Road in 1917. In colonial times, both Lakeshore Road and Dundas Street existed. In Toronto Township (modern Mississauga) the dirt path between concessions one and two was referred to as \\"the middle road\\" in 1852. Later in the 19th century Toronto Township council began to ask Etobicoke Township about connecting Middle Road with a road in Etobicoke between the 2nd and 3rd concessions. There were right of way difficulties as the two roads met the Etobicoke River in different places. These discussions continues sporadically in the late the 19th century with York County Council receiving proposals from Peel County Council. Finally in 1909 Middle Road was carried over the Etobicoke River. The Middle Road was not the first highway between Toronto and Hamilton. In January 1914, a cement road known as the Toronto-Hamilton Highway was proposed. The highway was chosen to run along the macadamized old Lake Shore Road, instead of Dundas Street to the north, because of the numerous hills encountered along Dundas Street, which would have increased the cost of the road without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs.Shragge p. 55 By November of that year, the proposal was approved, and work began quickly to construct the road known today as Lake Shore Boulevard and Lakeshore Road from Toronto to Hamilton. The road was finished by 1917, in width and nearly long, becoming the first concrete road in Ontario, as well as one of the longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in the world.Shragge p. 55 \\"...the Toronto-to-Hamilton highway which, when completed in 1917, was both Ontario's first concrete highway and one of the longest such inter-city stretches in the world.\\" The highway became the favourite drive of many motorists, and it quickly became a tradition for many families to drive it every Sunday. The cloverleaf interchange at Middle Road and Highway 10 was the first controlled access interchange in Canada. Over the next decade, vehicle usage increased monumentally; as early as 1920 the Lake Shore Road was once again bumper to bumper on weekends. In response, the Department of Highways once again sought out improving another road between Toronto and Hamilton. Middle Road, a continuation of Queen Street west of the Humber River, was chosen to avoid delays on Dundas or Lake Shore. The road was to be more than twice the width of the Lake Shore Road, at , and would carry two lanes of traffic in each direction.Shragge p. 79 Construction on what was then known as the Queen Street Extension between Highway 10 and Highway 27 began in the spring of 1931, and between Highway 27 and the Humber River on November 1, 1931. Middle Road in 1937, east of present-day Erin Mills Parkway, looking east towards Toronto. Before the highway could be completed, the 1934 provincial elections brought Mitchell Hepburn into office as premier and Thomas McQuesten was appointed the new minister of the Department of Highways. McQuesten in turn appointed Robert Melville Smith as deputy minister. Smith, inspired by the German Autobahns - new \\"dual-lane divided highways\\", separated by a depressed grass centre crossing short distances between major cities - modified the design for Ontario roads,Stamp pp. 19-20 and McQuesten ordered that the Middle Road be changed into this new form of highway.Smith pp. 11-12 A right-of-way of was purchased along the Middle Road and construction began to convert the existing sections to a divided highway, as well as on Canada's first cloverleaf interchange at Highway 10. By the end of 1937, the Middle Road was open between Toronto and Burlington, where it connected with what was first known as the Hamilton - Niagara Falls Highway. It soon came time to name the new highway, and an upcoming visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth proved to be the focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June 7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam nearby the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way. However, the ceremony only designated the highway between St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. The remainder of the road was known by various names, including the Toronto- Burlington/Hamilton Highway and The New Middle Road Highway. At the formal opening of the highway between Toronto and Niagara Falls on August 23, 1940, the entire length was declared The Queen Elizabeth Way by Thomas McQueston.

On February 27, 1933, six days before the election, the Reichstag was burned, an event that was blamed on the Communists. With Nazis in key positions in government, Adolf Hitler was able to push through the Reichstag Fire Decree, which was then signed into law by President Paul von Hindenburg. The decree withdrew civil liberties and enabled the Nazis to arrest anyone they deemed to be an enemy. This became first and foremost a confrontation with the KPD, but in effect, outlawed all political parties in Germany, other than the Nazi Party. The Enabling Act of March 27, 1933 consolidated their power and authority. By the end of April 1933, the Nazis had arrested 18,000 Communists, 12,000 SPD members and others, filling concentration camps. By June 1933, more than half of the KPD's district leaders were in detention and hundreds of Nazi opponents had been killed. Many people went underground, including Jacob. A year later, in mid-August 1933, he was arrested in Berlin by the Nazis and sent to prison, where Jacob subjected to torture in the Gestapo prisons Columbia Haus in Berlin and KolaFu in Hamburg. In 1934, he was sentenced to three years at hard labor in a Zuchthaus for \\"preparation to commit high treason.

An additional meeting was planned for July 4, 1944 to discuss concrete measures. They were denounced by an informer, however, and when Jacob, Saefkow and Reichwein arrived at the appointed place, the Gestapo snared them all. Leber was arrested a few days later.

Cast Critical reception The New York Times wrote, \\"take an inventive young man who is required to spend a quarter of a million dollars in six months, and you possess the germ of a successful farce. If this sounds a trifle uncertain, it is because the new British screen edition of \\"Brewster's Millions\\" leaves you with just that rueful impression. Instead of telling the story in the swift and eventful terms of screen comedy, the present gentlemen have used it simply as the libretto for a big, eye-filling musical photoplay in the combustible Hollywood style. There are songs, dances, girls and more girls, and a great fiesta scene featuring a mass dance called la caranga, which seems to be a compound of all the recent variations on the rumba. Although the English ladies of the ensemble are lovely, the tunes quite acceptable and Mr. Jack Buchanan an able and versatile performer, the film never comes off as musical comedy. Those song-and-dance interludes during which Mr. Buchanan abandons his money-spending campaign are useful chiefly to remind the audience that \\"Brewster's Millions\\" is still a sufficiently sturdy comedy to stand on its own feet. When the piece is being played straight, it is always bright and amusing in a slightly desperate British style...Mr. Buchanan is an engagingly frantic Brewster and he is assisted pleasantly enough by Lili Damita as the malicious chorus girl who wants to snare him and by Nancy O'Neil as his conservative sweetheart. But \\"Brewster's Millions\\" is more hilarious in theory than in practice in this British rendition\\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990DE1DB1F3CE23ABC4053DFB266838E629EDE while TV Guide noted, \\"the witty, energetic Buchanan has a field day with this craftily scripted comedy.

After fighting in the Peninsular War and in the Peruvian War of Independence Valent√≠n engaged in the chaotic politics of the post-war reign of Isabella II of Spain, serving as Prime Minister of Spain in 1840 and holding other important offices such as Mayor of Madrid. Born into a noble family established in the twelfth century around the Benasque Valley, Huesca, the family produced several illustrious clerics, politicians, lawyers and military strategists. He was the nephew of Antonio Cornel y Ferraz, the Spanish Minister of War for Charles IV of Spain and first cousin of Jose Ferraz y Cornel, Spanish Minister of Finance For Queen Isabella in 1840, and Francisco Javier Ferraz y Cornel, Lieutenant General and Chief Military Justice, also during the reign of Isabella II. Spanish War of Independence In 1808 as a cadet in the King's Dragoon Regiment in the city of Zaragoza at the beginning of the second phase of the Napoleonic invasion,Valent√≠n was captured after the surrender of the city following two months of fierce fighting in the streets. However he managed to escape and rejoin the Spanish army which exploit earned him promotion to lieutenant in 1809. That same year he fought in the campaign of Valencia, then threatened by the French army of Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet. He engaged in constant battles and skirmishes that took place until the fall of the city of Valencia to the French, but a combination of fortuitous invents were to follow. First, the withdrawal of most French troops from Spain to reinforce Napoleon's Russian campaign and then the offensive of the Duke of Wellington was launched from Portugal. These factors helped the Allies to expel the French from Spain. The regiment of Ferraz was deployed the fields of La Mancha (south of Madrid) where he distinguished himself in the fighting that preceded the ultimate French expulsion and the signing of the eventual peace treaty. After the war he held the military field rank of Captain (Teniente in Spanish), and requested a posting to South America where the royal armies faced the Peruvian separatists. Peruvian War of Independence In 1815 Valent√≠n was assigned to the regiment Cazadores del Rey, (Royal Hunters) which had been intended for action overseas and was sent to Peru in order to form the escort of the new General in Chief of the Army of Upper Peru, Brigadier Jos√© de la Serna, in whose company he embarked from Cadiz on 8 May 1816 aboard the frigate La Vengeance. As Captain in command of 4 officers and 46 soldiers, his regiment landed in the Peruvian port of Arica on 8 September of the same year. There they collected the horses and supplies needed for the campaign, and proceeded to the front-line of the war zone to join the royal army of Alto Peru in its barracks Santiago de Cotagaita, on the basis of the European troops would, in 1817 form a squad of Grenadier Guards of 78 men commanded by Ferraz. He mounted campaigns in Tarija, Jujuy Province and Salta Province, recovering for the Spanish Crown those territories that had been occupied by the Argentine independence movement. The outstanding performance of Ferraz troops converted their mission from one of escort detail to a front-line regiment which came to have four squadrons with two beater and two shooter companies totalling some 600 men. His skills as a cavalry officer and his willingness to command was noted in dispatches. .Biograf√≠a del excelentisimo se√±or teniente general Don Valentin Ferraz, pages: 28 & 107 THE regiment would not have the opportunity to participate in the battle on the shores of Lake Junin, because the Alto Peru army revolted at Olaneta, which forced the Spanish viceroy to send Ferraz to reinforce the southern army under the command of Valdes. The campaign was a disaster and had to be abandoned. The troops returned to Cusco where the viceroy gathered his army for the final battle against Sucre. The Capitulation of Ayacucho is the treaty signed by the Spanish Chief of Staff Jos√© de Canterac and General Antonio Jos√© de Sucre after the battle of that name on December 9, 1824 which gave birth to an independent Peru. Feraz embarked for the Iberian Peninsula accompanied by a few subordinates with whom he had come to Peru nine years ago. Return to Spain Valent√≠n returned to Spain in 1825, and boosted his career under the tutelage of General Baldomero Espartero, rising through the ranks to the highest institutions, but always faithful to his liberal ideas. His titles included:Lieutenant General of the Armies, General Manager Gun Cavalry, inspector general of the National Militia, member of advisory boards for foreign wars, Congressman and Senator of the Spanish Kingdom representing the province of Huesca, Mayor of Madrid, War Minister four times and President of the Council of Ministers in the last weeks of the regency of Mar√≠a Cristina de Borb√≥n . Especially noteworthy in this period is when he led the Directorate General of Cavalry, which provided a real demonstration of his initiative and leadership qualities. He also founded an enduring Academy for Weaponry in Alcala de Henares which earned him the nickname of Spanish Cavalry Regenerator. In 1865, a year before his death, Madrid's San Marcial Street (which runs between the central Plaza de Espa√±a (Madrid) and Paso Moret) was renamed calle Valentine Ferraz, in his honour, and remains so today. In house number 70 in this street in 1925 the founder of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, Pablo Iglesias was to die. The building now serves as the principal political training facility and bears the name of Valentine as a mark of respect for his service to Spain.

For a while he also went by the name Talmadge X Hayer, and his chosen Islamic name is Mujahid Abdul Halim. Assassination of Malcolm X When Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York City, Hagan was shot in the leg by one of Malcolm X's bodyguards while attempting to flee from the building. Hampered by his bullet wound, Hagan was grabbed by several members of the crowd who witnessed the shooting and physically beaten before policemen arrived and arrested Hagan at the scene. He later confessed to the crime but said that Thomas Johnson (Khalil Islam) and Norman Butler (Muhammad Abd Al-Aziz), two suspects who were arrested at a later point in time, were not involved in the assassination. Hagan stated in a 1977 affidavit that he had planned the assassination with four others (Johnson and Butler not being among them) to seek revenge for Malcolm X's public criticism of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. He said that one of his accomplices distracted Malcolm X's bodyguards by starting an argument about having been pickpocketed. When the bodyguards moved toward the diversion and away from Malcolm X, a man with a shotgun stepped up to him and shot him in the chest. After that, Hagan himself and another of his accomplices shot several rounds at Malcolm X with semi-automatic handguns. Later life Hagan, Butler, and Johnson all received 20-years-to-life sentences in 1966. During his 45 years in jail, Hagan earned bachelor's and master's degrees; he filed 16 times for parole but was denied each time. Butler was paroled in 1985 and Johnson in 1987. From 1988, Hagan was in a work release program, which allowed him to seek work outside prison and required him to spend only two days a week in a minimum-security facility in Manhattan. The rest of the week, he was allowed to stay with his wife and children. Among other places, he worked at the Crown Heights Youth Collective, as a counselor at a homeless shelter on Wards Island, and in a fast-food restaurant. Hagan was granted parole in March 2010 and was released from prison at the end of April. He is still a practicing Muslim, but has left the Nation of Islam, no longer agreeing with their ideology, and has expressed \\"regrets and sorrow\\" for having shot Malcolm X. Portrayal in the arts Hagan was portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito in the 1992 American biographical film Malcolm X. References Further reading *Peter Louis Goldman: The Death and Life of Malcolm X.

It is manufactured by BAE Systems Land & Armaments, which was formerly United Defense. The Bradley is designed for reconnaissance and to transport a squad of infantry, providing them protection from small arms fire, while also providing firepower to both suppress and eliminate most threats to friendly infantry. It is designed to be highly maneuverable and to be fast enough to keep up with heavy armor during an advance. The M2 holds a crew of three: a commander, a gunner and a driver, as well as six fully equipped soldiers. The total cost of the program is $5,664,100,000, and the average unit costs $3,166,000.  Design  The Bradley IFV was developed largely in response to the amphibious Soviet BMP family of infantry fighting vehicles, and to serve as both an Armored personnel carrier (APC), and a tank-killer. Design began in 1963 and entered production in 1981.History of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle One specific design requirement was that it should be as fast as the new M1 Abrams main battle tank so that they could maintain formations while moving, something which the older M113 armored personnel carrier could not do, as it had been designed to complement the older M60 Patton. = Armament = The Bradley is equipped with the M242 25 mm autocannon as its main weapon. The M242 has a single barrel with an integrated dual-feed mechanism and remote feed selection.Bradley M2 / M3 Tracked Armoured Fighting Vehicles, USA. Army-Technology.com. Retrieved on August 1, 2008. The gun has 300 ready rounds in two ready boxes (one of 70 rounds ‚Äì usually AP-type rounds, the other of 230 rounds ‚Äì usually HE-type rounds), with another 600 rounds in storage. The two ready boxes allow a selectable mix of rounds, such as the M791 APDS-T (Armor-Piercing Discarding Sabot (with) Tracer), and M792 HEI-T (High Explosive Incendiary (with) Tracer) rounds. The 25 mm automatic gun is primarily used for clearing bunkers and firing on lightly armored vehicles. While the 25 mm automatic gun is not the weapon of choice for engaging tanks, vehicle commanders, crews, and CALL and Army Infantry Center personnel reported isolated instances in which the 25 mm automatic gun had killed tanks. However, Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) officials stated that, on the basis of their assessment of combat vehicles in the Persian Gulf war, for the 25 mm automatic gun to kill a tank, the tank would have to be hit at close range in its more vulnerable areas. Subsequent ammunition developments resulted in the M919 APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer) round, which contains a finned depleted-uranium penetrator similar in concept to armor- piercing munitions used in modern tanks. The M919 was used in combat during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is also armed with an M240C machine gun mounted coaxially to the M242, with 2,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition. For engaging heavier targets (such as when acting in an anti-tank fashion), the Bradley has a TOW missile system on board, which was changed from the M2A1 model onwards to fire TOW II missiles. M2 infantry Bradleys also have turreted firing ports for a number of M231 Firing Port Weapons or FPWs, providing a button-up firing position to replace the top-side gunners on the old ACAV, though the M231 is rarely employed. Initial variants carried six, but the side ports were plated over with the new armor used on the A2 and A3 variants, leaving only the two rear-facing mounts in the loading ramp. = Countermeasures = The use of aluminum armor and the storage of large quantities of ammunition in the vehicle initially raised questions about its combat survivability. Spaced laminate belts and high hardness steel skirts have been added to later versions to improve armor protection, although this increased overall weight to 33 tons. However, actual combat operations have not shown the Bradley to be deficient as losses have been few. In friendly fire incidents in Desert Storm, many crew members survived hits that resulted in total losses for lighter USMC LAV-25 vehicles. All versions are also equipped with two four-barreled smoke grenade launchers on the front of the turret for creating defensive smoke screens, which can also be loaded with chaff and flares. In December 2018, the Army revealed it would be installing the Iron Fist on M2 Bradleys of one armored brigade as a near-term active protection system to enhance protection against anti-tank rockets and missiles.Army Bradley Brigade Will Get Israeli Anti-Missile System: Iron Fist. Breaking Defense. 14 December 2018. = Chassis = The Bradley has a welded aluminum unit or monocoque structure to which the armor is attached, mostly on the outside. The suspension is by torsion bars and cranks. Six small rubber rimmed, divided road wheels on each side straddle the location flanges sticking up from the tread. These were originally of aluminum, but were changed to steel as vehicle weight increased. The steel treads sit on flat hard rubber tires. = Mobility = The Bradley is highly capable in cross-country open terrain, in accordance with one of the main design objectives of keeping pace with the M1 Abrams main battle tank. Whereas the M113 would float without much preparation, the Bradley was initially designed to float by deploying a flotation curtain around the vehicle. This caused some drownings due to failures during its first trials. Armor upgrades have negated this capability.  History  = Production history = Bradley IFV burns after being hit by Iraqi T-72 tank fire during the Battle of 73 Easting, February 1991 The M2, which was named after World War II General Omar Bradley, carries a crew of three and a six-man dismountable infantry squad.

Burton.James G. Burton, Col. The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press (1993). . Burton advocated the use of comprehensive live fire tests against fully loaded military vehicles to check for survivability. The Army and Navy agreed and established the Joint Live Fire testing program in 1984. When testing the Bradley, however, disagreements occurred between Burton and the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, which preferred smaller, more controlled, \\"building block\\" tests that could be used to improve the databases used to model vehicle survivability, as opposed to full up tests with random shots, which reduce the possibility of bias but produced little useful statistical data. In addition, Burton insisted on a series of ‚Äúovermatch\\" tests in which weapon systems would be fired at the Bradley that were known to be able to easily penetrate its armor. Burton saw attempts to avoid such tests as dishonest, while the BRL saw them as wasteful as they already knew the vehicle would fail. The disagreements became so contentious that a Congressional inquiry was set up. As a result of the tests, additional improvements to vehicle survivability were added. = Combat history = During the Persian Gulf War, M2 Bradleys destroyed more Iraqi armored vehicles than the M1 Abrams.. Global Security Twenty Bradleys were lost‚Äîthree by enemy fire and 17 due to friendly fire incidents; another 12 were damaged. The gunner of one Bradley was killed when his vehicle was hit by Iraqi fire, possibly from an Iraqi BMP-1, during the Battle of 73 Easting.Quotation from General accounting office's report about the Bradleys and Abrams performance in the Persian Gulf War: \\"According to information provided by the Army‚Äôs Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, 20 Bradleys were destroyed during the Persian Gulf war.

The M2 can be identified by its standard TOW missile system, steel laminate armor, and Cummins VT903 engine with HMPT-500 Hydro-mechanical transmission. Basic features also included an integrated sight unit for the M242 25 mm gun, and thermal imaging system. The M2 was amphibious with the use of a \\"swim barrier\\" or \\"flotation screen\\" and was transportable by C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. All M2 vehicles have been upgraded to improved standards. The M2 armor protects the vehicle through a full 360 degrees against 14.5 mm armor- piercing incendiary (API) ammunition. The turret was offset to the right to maximize the room in the passenger compartment. Six infantry soldiers for dismounted fighting were held in the passenger compartment. Vision for the troops was provided through three periscopes placed between the rear ramp and the cargo hatch just behind the turret, as well as two periscopes on each side of the hull above the side firing ports. The passenger compartment also held up to five TOW or Dragon missile reloads. The side and rear hull armor consisted of two steel plates one inch apart and away from the aluminum armor. The hull top, bottom, and front consisted of 5083 aluminum armor, and steel armor was added to the front third of the hull bottom to increase mine protection.M2 Variants - AFVDB.com =M3= The M3 Bradley CFV is very similar to the M2 Bradley IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) and is fielded with the same powerful two-man 25mm Bushmaster Cannon turret with the coaxial 7.62mm machine gun. It only varies from the M2 in a few subtle ways and by role. The M3 is classified as an armored reconnaissance and scout vehicle and does away with the firing ports found in the M2 series. The M3 also carries more TOW missiles as well as more ammunition for its 25mm and 7.62mm guns. = M2A1 = Introduced in 1986, the A1 variant included an improved TOW II missile system, a Gas Particulate Filter Units (GPFU) NBC system, and a fire-suppression system. By 1992, the M2A1s had begun being remanufactured to upgraded standards. The GPFU system was only connected to the vehicle commander, driver, and gunner, while the infantry squad had to use their own from MOPP suits. A seventh infantryman was also added just behind the center of the turret. U.S. Army soldiers head out on a mission in their M2A2 ODS, seen here fitted with explosive reactive armor boxes, Iraq, October 2004 = M2A2 = Introduced in 1988, the A2 received an improved engine with an HMPT-500-3 Hydromechanical transmission and improved armor (both passive and the ability to mount explosive reactive armor). The new armor protects the Bradley against 30 mm APDS rounds and RPGs (or similar anti-armor weapons). The new armor also eliminated the trim vane that made the Bradley amphibious and covered up the side firing ports. Spaced laminate armor was installed to the hull rear and spaced laminate track skirts protected the lower hull. A semicircular shield was attached to the turret rear to add more stowage space as well as act as spaced armor. Kevlar spall liners were added to critical areas. The troop carrying number was reduced to six, eliminating the periscope position behind the driver. After live firing testing, the seating and stowage arrangements were redrawn. These upgrades raised the cumulative gross weight of the vehicle to 30,519 kg (). The M2A2 was qualified to be transported by the C-17 Globemaster III. M2A2s were all eventually modified to M2A2 ODS or M2A3 standard. M2A2 ODS/ODS-E The \\"Operation Desert Storm\\" and \\"Operation Desert Storm-Engineer\\" improvements were based on lessons learned during the first Gulf War in 1991. The major improvements included an eye-safe laser rangefinder (ELRF), a tactical navigation system (TACNAV) incorporating the Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) and the Digital Compass Systems (DCS), a missile countermeasure device designed to defeat first-generation wire-guided missiles, and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Battlefield Command Information System. The internal stowage was further improved and a thermal imaging system was added for the driver. The infantry squad was again increased to seven men, six of whom sat facing each other on two 3-man benches in the passenger compartment, with the seventh back in the position behind the turret. An MRE ('Meal, Ready-to-Eat') heater was added to the vehicle to assist in the preparation of food while in the field or warzone. With the retirement of the Dragon missile, the vehicle had the option of carrying some Javelin anti-tank missiles. = M2A3 = M2A3 Bradley operating near Fallujah, Iraq, in November 2004. The main recognition feature of the M2/M3A3 is the Commander's Independent Viewer (CIV), at the right rear of the turret. Introduced in 2000, the A3 upgrades make the Bradley IFV totally digital, with upgraded or improved existing electronics systems throughout improving target acquisition and fire control, navigation, and situational awareness. Also, the survivability of the vehicle is upgraded with a series of armor improvements, again both passive and reactive, as well as improved fire-suppression systems and NBC equipment.NBC also stands for nuclear, biological, chemical Three M2A3 Bradleys exit an OCCD at the start of a Patrol at Fort Irwin, California. The A3 Bradley incorporates the Improved Bradley Acquisition Subsystem (IBAS) and the Commander's Independent Viewer (CIV). Both include a second-generation forward looking infrared (FLIR) and an electro-optical/TV imaging system, and the IBAS also has direct-view optics (DVO) and the eye-safe laser rangefinder (ELRF).Field Manual 3-22.1, Bradley Gunnery (Nov 2003). Headquarters, Department of the Army. The CIV allows the commander to scan for targets and maintain situational awareness while remaining under armor and without interfering with the gunner's acquisition and engagement of targets.Hans Halberstadt (2001). Europa Militaria No 30: Bradley Company. Ramsbury, Marlborough, Wiltshire: The Crowood Press Ltd. . A pair of M2A3 Bradleys firing their M242 chain guns in a live fire exercise. The A3's fire control software (FCSW) combines laser range, environmental readings, ammunition type, and turret control inputs to automatically elevate the gun for range and to automatically generate a kinematic lead solution if a target is moving. This functionality, very similar to that of the M1A2 Abrams, allows the gunner or commander to center the reticule on a moving target, lase the target, and achieve a first-round-hit, without the need to fire sensing rounds and adjust aim.Michael Green & James D. Brown (2007). M2/M3 Bradley at War. St. Paul, MN: Zenith Press. . The FCSW incorporates a thermal aided target tracker (ATT) function that can track two targets in the FLIR field of view and switch between them, primarily intended for employing TOW missiles against moving vehicles. The FCSW also allows the turret and gunner's sights to be slewed automatically onto a target that has been designated with the CIV. The A3 Bradley uses a position-navigation subsystem that incorporates a global positioning system (GPS), an inertial navigation unit (INU), and a vehicle motion sensor (MVS), which, in addition to allowing accurate own- vehicle navigation, allows accurate position reporting and hand-off of designated targets to other units via FBCB2. The Commander's Tactical Display (CTD) presents information from FBCB2 and the vehicle navigation systems on a moving-map display, allows the commander to communicate via text over FBCB2, and allows him to check vehicle built-in test (BIT) information and access various other information. The Squad Leader's Display (SLD) in the infantry compartment improves the situational awareness of the passengers by allowing them to view navigational information from FBCB2 and imagery from the IBAS, CIV, or Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) to familiarize themselves with their surroundings prior to dismounting. The M2A3 Bradley II, and an M2A3 Bradley variant used in Iraq, were included in the GCV Analysis of Alternatives. = M2A4 = After the Iraq War, the Army began researching engineering change proposals (ECPs) for the M2 Bradley to buy back space, weight, power, and cooling capacity reduced by the addition of armor and electronics hastily added during combat. ECP1 will work to restore mobility and allow the vehicle to handle more weight. As weight increased, the Bradley got lower on its suspension, which reduced ground clearance. This decreased mobility on rough terrain and left it more vulnerable to IEDs. The effort will install lighter tracks, shock absorbers, a new suspension support system, and heavy weight torsion bars. ECP2 will restore automotive power with a larger engine, a new transmission, and a smart-power management system for better electrical power distribution to accept future networked tactical radio and battle command systems.Army Develops New Concepts, Keeps Existing Fleets Rolling - Defensenews.com, 12 October 2014Upgrades 'new normal' for armor in uncertain budget environment - Army.mil, 20 October 2014 The first Bradleys upgraded with ECP1 were fielded in mid-2015, and the first to be upgraded with ECP2 will begin fielding in 2018.Army Begins Massive Makeover of Combat Vehicle Fleet - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 6 May 2015 Vehicles that receive both the ECP1 and ECP2 upgrade will be designated A4.

He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia, who quoted statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate in November 2009. That speech caused a furor according to The Courier-Mail, The New Zealand Herald and other media. Biography =Scientology official= Australia and United States A New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's parents were Scientologists. Saxton's father committed suicide when he was 14, and this had a significant impact on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain. Saxton received influential positions within the organisation, both in Sydney and the United States. Senator Nick Xenophon stated that Saxton \\"rose to a position of influence in Sydney and the United States\\" within Scientology. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Saxton \\"rose to a senior level\\" within the Sea Org, 3 News characterised the Sea Org as \\"Scientology's senior management\\". The Editor-in-Chief of The Village Voice reported that Saxton served as \\"one of the Sea Org's ruthless enforcers during the 1990s\\". In their book Cults and New Religions, Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley describe the Sea Org writing, \\"Described by the Church as 'a fraternal religious order,' members of the Sea Org 'occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy'.\\" Rolling Stone wrote, \\"Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy\\". In 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org. Between 1989 and 1996, Saxton worked for the Church of Scientology of Australia, as well as at the headquarters of Scientology in the U.S. In 1991, Saxton was assigned to work at Scientology facilities in Florida. While in the Sea Org, Saxton spent the majority of his time assigned to Scientology facilities in Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, Saxton worked at the division of International Management for Scientology. He also functioned within the organisation as an Ethics Officer, and worked out of the Communications Office. In this role, Saxton learned policies relating to Scientology's Flag Organization and its Office of Special Affairs. While a member of the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO), Saxton tried to make sure those under his supervision had adequate nourishment. As a recruiter for the CMO, Saxton tried to get Scientologists between ages 13 to 14 to join the organisation. Saxton left Scientology in 2006. He came to question why he had done some of the actions within the Sea Org that he later came to regret. He felt ashamed for what he had witnessed, as well as the part he played in controversial acts in the organisation. Whistleblower against organisation Australian Senator Nick Xenophon read Saxton's statements about Scientology into the public record. In 2009, Saxton lived in Perth, Australia, and worked as an information technology contractor. He contacted Senator Nick Xenophon of Australia, who read statements by Saxton about Scientology into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate. In a November 2009 speech, Xenophon said, \\"Aaron has now left the organisation and is willing to cooperate with police investigations into these matters.\\" Senator Xenophon characterised Saxton as a \\"victim\\" of Scientology that had written to him about the organisation. Saxton's statement was tabled in Australian parliament. Xenophon said, \\"In his statement Aaron also says he was forced to participate in the illegal confinement and torture of a follower who was kept under house arrest. ... He says while under control of Scientology he was involved in coercing female followers to have abortions (because) ... this was in line with a policy designed to keep followers loyal to the organisation and to allow them to keep working for the organisation.\\" He read into the record, \\"Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion. If they refused, they faced demotion and hard labour ... Aaron says one staff member used a coat-hanger and self-aborted her child for fear of punishment. He says she was released from the organisation and the files were destroyed.\\" Saxton said that while a member of the Scientology organisation, he had participated in actions including torture and blackmail. He stated that Scientology members deemed to be underperforming in their tasks were ordered to eat rations of beans and rice. According to Xenophon, Saxton said he had participated in the \\"forced confinement and torture\\" of a woman in Scientology who had been relocated to a rural area in New South Wales. Senator Xenophon stated Saxton was, \\"ordered by superiors to remove documents that would link a Scientology staff member to murder\\". While an official for Scientology, Xenophon stated Saxton had \\"ordered more than 30 people to be sent to Scientology's work camps, where they were forced to undertake hard labour\\". While in the organisation, Saxton had access to Auditing files on celebrity Scientologists, and he was later critical of the way information from these files could be used as leverage. In response to the statements by former Scientologists read into the parliamentary record of the Australian Senate by Senator Xenophon, the Australian PM Kevin Rudd said he would ponder opening an inquiry into Scientology. The Prime Minister called the concerns raised in the statements by former Scientologists including Saxton \\"grave\\", and stated, \\"Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology. I share some of those concerns. But let us proceed carefully, and look carefully at the material which he has provided, before we make a decision on further parliamentary action.\\" Senator Xenophon said that Saxton had been in touch with the office of the Prime Minister, and had offered to provide additional statements and testimony regarding the assertions made in the Australian Senate. In March 2010, Xenophon's call for an inquiry was \\"overwhelmingly rejected\\" by the Australian Senate, the senators voting 33 to 6 against, with 37 abstentions. Scientology response Scientology in November 2009 said that Saxton's letter to Senator Xenophon was not reliable. The Church of Scientology released a statement in 2009 referring to Saxton as \\"a mean hateful young man\\". The head of Scientology in New Zealand, Mike Ferriss, characterised Saxton as a \\"nutter\\" and a \\"consummate liar\\". In a statement given by Ferriss to Campbell Live, he said, \\"There are no forced abortions in Scientology and if Aaron Saxton or anyone else coerced someone into having an abortion then they are way outside of the Church's policy and ethical conduct.\\" In February 2010, Scientologist Sue Hunt tried to get an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) filed against Saxton. Hunt said Saxton had banged on her car window during a protest against Scientology. Saxton said that he did not know the individual. According to Today Tonight, \\"Scientologist Sue Hunt completed a course called 'PTS/SP'. This course is designed to teach Scientologists how to attack, intimidate, harass, even lie about anyone or any group that criticises Scientology.\\" Saxton said that the AVO was an attempt to suppress his right to freedom of speech. Magistrate Paul Falzon questioned the legitimacy of Hunt's assertions, and said the court would require demonstration of \\"reasonable apprehension\\" of a threatening or violent action. \\"Have you seen what happens to Nicole Kidman?\\", queried the Magistrate regarding Hunt's assertions. Senator Xenophon spoke out critically about Scientology's actions against Saxton, and referenced the practice of Fair Game. \\"Since Aaron has spoken out he says he's been harassed at work, his mother's been visited by private investigators, he's been getting a number of unexplained phone calls to his private number and you've got to ask the question has this got anything to do with the Scientology doctrine of Fair Game? Let me just quote you what L Ron Hubbard said about it. He said Scientology critics can be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed. They are the words of the founder of Scientology,\\" said Senator Xenophon. Commentary The Courier-Mail called Saxton a whistleblower against Scientology, and 3 News said that Saxton's \\"whistleblowing about the Church has made it all the way to the Australian Parliament\\". The New Zealand Herald described the statements given to Senator Xenophon by Saxton as \\"at the centre\\" of the Senator's speech in the Australian Senate criticising Scientology. The New Zealand Herald commented, \\"Saxton's allegations about behind-the-scenes church activities caused an uproar after they were quoted in the Australian Senate\\", and reported that Saxton's statements \\"formed part of a blistering attack in the Australian Senate\\". The Australian current affairs program, produced by the Seven Network, Today Tonight, described Saxton's revelations as \\"shocking\\". Today Tonight commented, \\"He joined a group of former Scientologists in revealing stunning, shocking claims of abuse, tabled by federal independent Senator Nick Xenophon.\\" The Editor-in-Chief of The Village Voice stated that Saxton's statements comprised \\"some of the most cited after Xenophon's speech\\", and commented, \\"Saxton's profile in Australia blew up overnight after Xenophon's speech, and his story quickly became familiar there\\".

The compound is of academic interest as an early example of a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation that operates by an \\"outer sphere mechanism.\\". Related derivatives are known where p-tolyl replaces some of the phenyl groups. Shvo's catalyst represents a subset of homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts that involves both metal and ligand in its mechanism. Synthesis and structure tetraphenylcyclopentadienone and triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. The catalyst is named after Youval Shvo, who uncovered it through studies on the effect of diphenylacetylene on the catalytic properties of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. The reaction of diphenylacetylene and Ru3(CO)12 gives the piano stool complex (Ph4C4CO)Ru(CO)3). Subsequent hydrogenation of this tricarbonyl affords Shvo's catalyst. Y. Blum, D. Reshef, and Y. Shvo. H-transfer catalysis with Ru3(CO)12. Tetrahedron Lett. 22(16) 1981, pp. 1541-1544. Blum, Y.; Shvo, Y. Isr. J. Chem. 1984, 24, 144. The iron analogue is also known, see Kn√∂lker complex. The compound contains a pair of equivalent Ru centres that are bridged by a strong hydrogen bond and a bridging hydride. In solution, the complex dissociates unsymmetrically: :(Œ∑5-C5Ph4O)2HRu2H(CO)4 ‚Üí (Œ∑5-C5Ph4OH)RuH(CO)2 \\\\+ (Œ∑6-C5Ph4O)Ru(CO)2 Hydrogenation catalysis Structure of proposed intermediate in transfer hydrogenation of a ketone by Shvo's catalyst. Example of hydrogenation of a carbonyl using Shvo's catalyst. In the presence of a suitable hydrogen donor or hydrogen gas, Shvo's catalyst effects the hydrogenation of several polar functional groups, e.g. aldehydes, ketones, imines, and iminium ions. Many alkenes and ketones undergo hydrogenation, although conditions are forcing: 145¬∞C (500 psi). One obstacle to the use of Shvo's catalyst in the hydrogenation of alkynes is its propensity to bind the alkyne quite tightly, forming a stable complex that gradually poisons the catalyst.Intramolecular reactions proceed as well, illustrated by the conversion of allylic alcohols to ketones. Shvo's catalyst also catalyzes dehydrogenations. Example of an imine hydrogenation using Shvo's catalyst. =Mechanism= The mechanism of hydrogenation catalyzed by Shvo's catalyst has been a matter of debate, broadly between two alternative descriptions of the double bond's interaction with the complex at the rate-determining step. The proposed alternatives are an inner-sphere mechanism, where the transition state involves interaction with the metal only, and an outer-sphere mechanism, in which the cyclopentadienol proton also interacts with the substrate. Kinetic isotope studies provide evidence of a concerted transfer due to strong rate influence from both the ligand -OH and the metal hydride. Other reactions Shvo's catalyst facilitates the Tishchenko reaction, i.e., the forrmation of esters from alcohols. The early step in this reaction is the conversion of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde.Blum, Y.; Shvo, Y. J. Organomet. Chem. 1984, 263, 93. Products obtained from amination of a propargylic alcohol using Shvo's catalyst. Addition of the amine is facilitated through oxidation to the ynone, followed by reduction of the product.Haak, E. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2007, 2815. Example of alkylation of an amine using Shvo's catalyst. Another case of \\"hydrogen borrowing\\", the alkylation of amines using other amines is also promoted by Shvo's catalyst. The reaction proceeds through oxidation to an imine, which allows nucleophilic attack, followed by an elimination step and reduction of the double bond.Hollmann, D.; Bahn, S.; Tillack, A.; Beller, M.

They have released five albums, the most recent being Vultures Above, Lions Below, released in August 2015. In August 2016, UNFD, their signed record company, announced on their Facebook page that the band was breaking up. History =Early history (2007‚Äì2008)= Buried in Verona formed in 2007 by vocalist Brett Anderson, guitarists Mick Taylor and Katongo Chituta, bassist Scott Richmond and drummer Steve Rogers. All the members were acquainted through the high school community in the suburb of Engadine in south Sydney. After a relatively short period of live performances, during which they gained support slots for Australian bands Daysend, Toe To Toe and Frankenbok, the band released their debut album Circle The Dead in 2008. After the recording period in Melbourne, Steve Rogers was ejected from the group unceremoniously due to a serious back injury, which required surgery. Richie Newman, who co-produced the album along with Greg Stace, is credited as the drummer in the liner notes. Newman would later join the band officially as third guitarist. Chris Melross would eventually join the line-up as their drummer. Buried in Verona has featured in the \\"Top 25 Bands to Look Out For\\" list in both the December 2009 and December 2010 editions of Blunt Magazine. =Saturday Night Sever (2010‚Äì2011)= Following the trend set by genre peers Parkway Drive and I Killed the Prom Queen, the band made the decision to relocate overseas with the purpose of recording their second album. Saturday Night Sever was recorded and produced by Fredrik Nordstr√∂m at his studio Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden. After a 5-week production period, the album was released in June 2010 to positive reviews, with the band's musicianship and production values they had invested in being praised, even though some critics brushed off the release as a generic metalcore album. Upon their return to Australia later that year, the band enjoyed regular Sydney support slots for internationally touring heavy metal bands including Whitechapel, Soilwork, Escape the Fate and The Haunted. In 2011 they co-headlined an Australia tour with Resist The Thought, dubbed the \\"I Wanna Give It Tour\\". In 2011 singer Brett Anderson has also featured in a song made by the Swedish band Solitude called \\"Last Division\\". =Notorious (2012‚Äì2013)= On 20 July 2011 Buried In Verona announced on their official Facebook page that they had parted ways with members Mick Taylor and Kat Chituta. Sean Gynn and Nate Martin were announced as their replacements. Newman openly admitted that the departure of these members meant the band was due for a change in musical style. With the intention of returning to Sweden to record again with Fredrik Nordstr√∂m, the band prepared for an Australian Farewell Tour with The Amity Affliction. On 27 August 2011, days before its commencement, another Facebook post simply stated \\"Our bass player is currently in RPA hospital, smashed himself through a glass window because he likes to party. Hope he's ok...\\" Although never officially announced, Scott Richmond had been quickly replaced by Daniel Gynn on bass. With three founding members suddenly gone, Brett Anderson was left sole-remaining original member in the line-up. Following the band's first European tour with Canada's Liferuiner, the band returned to Studio Fredman in Gothenburg, Sweden to begin a gruelling 3 month writing and recording process. Their third album, Notorious was released on 1 June 2012 following the band's signing to Australian label UNFD. The band's stylistic change, moving away from the band's metalcore origins towards a stripped back, musically more diverse approach to songwriting, was praised by critics as a sign of maturity. Anderson‚Äôs revised hardcore punk vocal style and Newman‚Äôs increased clean vocal presence was also duly noted. The band featured The Amity Affliction's Ahren Stringer on the track \\"Can't Let It Go\\". Expecting fan backlash, especially those who were more akin to their older metalcore style, Newman openly acknowledged the change, stating that the band‚Äôs attitude during the recording was \\"Fuck it. Write what you want to write, put your emotions into it and whatever happens happens. If you want to do something funky or jazzy or you think this part needs to be emotional or aggressive do whatever you want.\\" Having debuted on the ARIA Music Charts at #20 ‚Äò‚ÄôNotorious‚Äô‚Äô was nominated for ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôBest Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô at the annual ARIA Music Awards in 2012, but lost to DZ Deathrays ‚Äò‚ÄôBloodstreams‚Äô‚Äô. Returning to Australia in late June, the band began rigorous touring schedule. In July, it was announced via Facebook that drummer Chris Melross had left the band and Shane O‚ÄôBrien moved in as his replacement. On 11 September 2012 ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôArtery Recordings‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô announced they had signed Buried In Verona for North American representation. The band toured the U.S for the first time in November that year and again in 2013. In February 2013, Buried In Verona have announced that Shane O‚ÄôBrien had left the band to join I Killed The Prom Queen as their drum technician, and then their full time drummer, leaving the band without an official drummer. In June 2013, Buried In Verona announced on their official Facebook page that drummer Conor Ward, would now be joining the band as their full-time drummer. Conor appeared in Buried In Verona's music video for their new song 'I Am Hate'. Buried In Verona toured with I Killed The Prom Queen, House Vs Hurricane (last tour), and Saviour on the 'East Coast Rampage Tour' across the east coast of Australia. The band was set to record new music with Joey Sturgis in September. =Faceless (2014‚Äì2015)= On 28 November 2013 the band released a brand new song titled \\"Splintered\\", that hadn't appeared on their reissue of Notorious. The video titles \\"Part I: Splintered\\", insinuating that there would be a second part to the song and music video. On 16 January 2014 the band announced that their fourth studio album entitled Faceless would be released on 7 March through UNFD and Artery Recordings. On 22 January the band released a brand new single titled \\"Illuminate\\". The music video was the second part of the two-part project with Splintered. Preorders for the new album were made available on 23 January. On 12 January 2015 Daniel and Sean Gynn announced their departure from the band on good terms, leaving the band as a three piece. Buried In Verona was scheduled to headline Shorefest in Sydney on 18 April 2015. =Vultures Above, Lions Below (2015‚Äìpresent)= On 30 June 2015 the band released a brand new single. It was the first music video since the release of Illuminate, in a year and a half. The song was titled \\"Can't Be Unsaid\\" and is a lot more mellow as opposed to their previous work. The band have strayed away from their metalcore roots with this song and wrote a more rock-based ballad, similar to the style of a couple previous songs such as 'Lionheart' and 'Set Me On Fire'. Along with the launch of their new song, the band released the artwork, the title, and pre-orders for the album. The album was confirmed to be titled \\"Vultures Above, Lions Below\\". In December 2015 Richie Newman announced on Buried in Verona's official Facebook page that he was leaving the band.

Musical events occur as a succession of events in time, whose speed is tempo. Music also organizes these according to a framework called meter, by partitioning time into patterns of \\"strong\\" and \\"weak\\" beats. MIDI's tempo map specifies the speed at which a file's events are transmitted within this framework: their tempo. If a file plays at a fixed tempo, its map is a horizontal line (e.g., measures 38 and 39 in this part of a MIDI sequencer‚Äôs display of the end of J.S. Bach's prelude #8 from Book I of the Well-tempered Clavier): 800px But, if the tempo fluctuates as a function of time, such as in accelerando, allargando, or rubato, the line is respectively an upward- or downward-climbing one, or in the latter case, a complex curve, as seen here in measures 35 and 36 at left, or the ending in measures 40 and 41. In most music, aesthetics demand that this flow of events not be linear, but fluctuate according to the expression the music intends to convey. Hence, a very emotional piece such as the preceding is excerpted from, although playing at a base tempo of MM=50 ‚Äî which means 50 quarter notes per minute, holding back or lunging forward according to expressive impulse can result in a tempo map similar to that seen above: It flexes tempo down for the intermediate cadence at left, and again for the final allargando at the right. After recording a sequence in real time at a fixed tempo, or composing it using step-record mode, well-written MIDI sequencer software like MasterTracks Pro will have functionality to edit the MIDI tempo map, so as to result in a natural, expressive result, not a machine-like one, when playing the file.

Areas covered include the harmonisation of private international law, extradition arrangements between member states, policies on internal and external border controls, common travel visa, immigration and asylum policies and police and judicial cooperation. As internal borders have been removed within the EU, cross-border police cooperation has had to increase to counter cross-border crime. Some notable projects related to the area are the European Arrest Warrant, the Schengen Area and Frontex patrols. Organisation The area comes under the purview of the European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship and the European Commissioner for Home Affairs. They deal with the following matters: EU citizenship; combating discrimination, drugs, organised crime, terrorism, human trafficking; free movement of people, asylum and immigration; judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; police and customs cooperation; and these matters in the acceding countries.Summaries of EU legislation: Justice, freedom and security, Europa (web portal), accessed 22 March 2010 The relevant European Commission departments are the DG for Justice and the DG Home Affairs. However, there are also Eurojust and Europol, which develop judicial and police cooperation respectively. Related to the latter there is also the European Police College, the European Police Chiefs Task Force and Frontex. Actions Over the years, the EU has developed a wide competence in the area of justice and home affairs. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co- operation of police forces, Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors, and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities. The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities throughout the borderless Schengen Area. Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition (such as the European Arrest Warrant), family law, asylum law, and criminal justice. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Eur-lex.europa.eu In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.See Article 2(7) of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Eur-lex.europa.eu By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22‚Äì26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, p. 16‚Äì22).  European crimes  In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of C√¥te d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that \\"Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union\\". With countries such as Spain not even having a law against shipping toxic waste Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for \\"ecological crimes\\". His right to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law. So far though, the only other use has been the intellectual property rights directive. Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but were rejected at vote. However, in October 2007 the Court of Justice ruled the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some. The European Commission has listed seven offences that become European crimes. The seven crimes announced by the Commission are counterfeiting euro notes and coins; credit card and cheque fraud; money laundering; people-trafficking; computer hacking and virus attacks; corruption in the private sector; and marine pollution. The possible future EU crimes are racial discrimination and incitement to racial hatred;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655 organ trade; and corruption in awarding public contracts. It will also set out the level of penalty, such as length of prison sentence, that would apply to each crime. History The first steps in security and justice cooperation within the EU began in 1975 when the TREVI group was created, composed of member states' justice and home affairs ministers. The first real cooperation was the signing of the Schengen Implementing Convention in 1990 which opened up the EU's internal borders and established the Schengen Area. In parallel the Dublin Regulation furthered police cooperation.Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, European Parliament, accessed 22 March 2010 Cooperation on policies such as immigration and police cooperation was formally introduced in the Maastricht Treaty which established Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) as one of the EU's 'three pillars'. The Justice and Home Affairs pillar was organised on an intergovernmental basis with little involvement of the EU supranational institutions such as the European Commission and the European Parliament. Under this pillar the EU created the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in 1993 and Europol in 1995. In 1997 the EU adopted an action plan against organised crime and established the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). In 1998 the European Judicial Network in criminal matters (EJN) was established. The idea of an area of freedom, security and justice was introduced in May 1999, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which stated that the EU must \\"maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime.\\"Article 1(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty. The first work programme putting this provision into effect was agreed at Tampere, Finland in October 1999. Subsequently, the Hague programme, agreed in November 2004, set further objectives to be achieved between 2005 and 2010.Strengthening the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, European Commission July 2008, accessed 16 November 2010 The Treaty of Amsterdam also transferred the areas of asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters from the JHA to the European Community pillar, the remainder being renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC).Glossary: Area of freedom, security and justice Europa (web portal), accessed 22 March 2010 During this time further advancements were made. In 2000 the European Police College was created along with numerous conventions and agreements. The Treaty of Nice enshrined Eurojust in the EU treaties and in 2001 and 2002 Eurojust, Eurodac, the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters (EJNCC) and European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) were established. In 2004 the EU appointed an anti-terrorism coordinator in response to the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the European Arrest Warrant (agreed in 2002) entered into force. The 2009 Treaty of Lisbon abolished the pillar structure, reuniting the areas separated at Amsterdam. The European Parliament and Court of Justice gained a say over the whole area while the Council changed to majority voting for the remaining PJCC matters. The Charter of Fundamental Rights also gained legal force and Europol was brought within the EU's legal framework.Can the EU achieve an area of freedom, security and justice?, EurActive October 2003, accessed 22 March 2010 As the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the European Council adopted the Stockholm Programme to provide EU action on developing the area over the following five years. Justice There has been criticism that the EU's activities have been too focused on security and not on justice.Verbeet, Markus (19 March 2008) Interview with EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini: 'The Problem Is not Data Storage, It's Terrorism' Der Spiegel, accessed 22 March 2010European Arrest Warrant does not overrule human rights Sarah Ludford 2 June 2009, accessed 22 March 2010 For example, the EU created the European Arrest Warrant but no common rights for defendants arrested under it. With the strengthened powers under Lisbon, the second Barroso Commission created a dedicated commissioner for justice (previously combined with security under one portfolio) who is obliging member states to provide reports on their implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, the Commission is putting forward proposals for common rights for defendants (such as interpretation), minimum standards for prison conditions and ensure that victims of crime are taken care of properly wherever they are in the EU. This is intended to create a common judicial area where each system can be sure of trusting each other.Engerer, Cyrus (22 March 2010) Justice across Borders: Freedom, security and justice in the EU, Malta Independent Online, accessed 22 March 2010 Opt-outs Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom all have various opt-outs from the border control, asylum policy, police and judicial cooperation provisions that are part of the area of freedom, security and justice. While Ireland and the United Kingdom have opt- ins that allow them to participate in legislation on a case-by-case basis, Denmark is fully outside the area of freedom, security and justice. Denmark has nonetheless been fully implementing the Schengen acquis since 25 March 2001, but on an intergovernmental basis. The United Kingdom applied to participate in several areas of the Schengen acquis, including the police and judicial cooperation provisions, in March 1999. Their request was approved by a Council Decision in 2000 and fully implemented by a Decision of the Council of the EU with effect from 1 January 2005. While Ireland also applied to participate in the police and judicial cooperation provisions of the Schengen acquis in June 2000, and were approved by a Council Decision in 2002, this has not been implemented. Broadening security and safety perspective The European Union's growing role in coordinating internal security and safety policies is only partly captured by looking at policymaking within the area of freedom, security and justice. Across the EU's other (former) pillars, initiatives related to food security, health safety, infrastructure protection, counter-terrorism and energy security can be found. New perspectives and concepts have been introduced to examine the EU's wider internal security role for the EU, such as the EU's \\"protection policy space\\" or internal \\"security governance\\".Kirchner, Emil and Sperling, James (2008) EU Security Governance.

There have been proposals by the European Commission to upgrade the border agency Frontex, which is responsible for overseeing the security of the EU's external borders. This new body, called the European Border and Coastguard Agency, would involve having a pool of armed guards, drawn from different EU member states, that can be dispatched to EU countries at three days' notice. The European Border and Coastguard Agency would function more in a supervisory capacity. The border agencies of host countries would still retain day-to-day control, and the personnel from the new agency would be required to submit to the direction of the country where they are deployed. However, interventions could potentially happen against the wishes of a host country. They include instances such as \\"disproportionate migratory pressure\\" occurring on a country's border. For this intervention to happen, the new border agency would have to gain consent from the European Commission. Under these proposals, border guards would be allowed to carry guns. The agency would also be able to acquire its own supply of patrol ships and helicopters.

Houston Chronicle. Development Huyler grew up in Winnetka, Illinois as the oldest of three brothers. Bored throughout high school, he skipped college and in 1988 started an electronic graphics business with his father. The company the two created folded up within a year, however, and the NetBoy concept was slowly forming while Huyler worked as a pizza deliverer and programmed digital keyboards for musicians. Huyler started uploading NetBoy on the World Wide Web when he was 23 years old and worked as a creative director for Chicago-based internet provider InterAccess. The stick figure character was designed as an \\"Internet innocent\\" because, as Huyler put it at the time, \\"the Internet needs a good parody.\\" According to Huyler, each of the characters in the webcomic are based on people one may find on the internet. Huyler started selling NetBoy T-shirts within a year of the webcomic's release. When NetBoy was accessed by six users every second in December 1994, the server it was hosted on crashed, which prompted Huyler to go on hiatus for three months so that he could design a server that could better serve the rising demands.

His government first resigned in December 1906, when the defence budget for 1907 was rejected by the Senate.

Career  Dieter Dorn studied at the Theaterhochschule Leipzig. In 1956, he left East Germany and studied at the Max-Reinhardt-Schule f√ºr Schauspiel in Berlin with Hilde K√∂rber, the founder of the school, and Lucie H√∂flich. He was engaged at the State Theatre in Hanover from 1958 until 1961 as an actor and a dramaturge, then worked as a journalist and radio speaker for the NDR. In 1964, he returned to the theatre at the Landesb√ºhne Hanover, then in Essen. In the early 1970s, he staged at the Schauspielhaus Hamburg and at the Schaub√ºhne in Berlin,Portrait: Dieter Dorn and as a guest in Oberhausen, Basel, Wien and the Burgtheater.  M√ºnchner Kammerspiele  In 1976, Dorn moved to the M√ºnchner Kammerspiele as a senior director, opening with Lessing‚Äôs Minna von Barnhelm with Cornelia Froboess in the title role. He concentrated first on other German classical authors such as Goethe and Kleist and then focused on Shakespeare. He staged six plays in collaboration with the literary manager Michael Wachsmann, the theatre‚Äôs artistic director since 1986, who translated the complete texts: A Midsummer Night's Dream (1978), Twelfth Night (1980), Troilus and Cressida (1986), King Lear (1992), The Tempest (1994), and Cymbeline (1998). The stage sets were by J√ºrgen Rose who built large empty spaces. One of his protagonists was Rolf Boysen who played Lear, for example. Dorn promoted contemporary theatre, such as world premieres of the plays of Botho Strau√ü, in 1988 Besucher (Visitors), in 1991 Schlusschor (Final Chorus), and in 1996 Ithaka, with Bruno Ganz. Dorn had become the theatre's director in 1983.

He also staged at the Salzburg Festival Ariadne auf Naxos of Richard Strauss and in 2003 the world premiere of L'Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe of Hans Werner Henze, conducted by Markus Stenz. The reviewer stated: \\"The hot ticket at this year‚Äôs Salzburg Festival is not one of the three Mozart opera productions, but the world premiere production of Hans Werner Henze‚Äôs newest stage-work L‚ÄôUpupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe (The Hoopoe and the Triumph of Filial Love).\\" and continued: \\"This action-packed scenario might seem complex, but it emerges in a production of magical simplicity and ravishing visual beauty by the stage director, Dieter Dorn and set and costume designer, J√ºrgen Rose with a spell-binding clarity. A clarity which Henze also achieves in what must be his richest and most entrancing opera score to date.\\"Up and away Review of Hugh Cunning in TimesOnline, 31 August 2003 At the Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele, Dorn staged Cos√¨ fan tutte in 1984 and Le nozze di Figaro in 1987, both conducted by Wolfgang G√∂nnenwein.

Etymology and pronunciation  The city's full name is \\"El Paso de Robles\\", which in Spanish means \\"The Pass of the Oaks\\". People differ on the pronunciation of the city's shortened name of \\"Paso Robles\\". While its Spanish pronunciation is , many residents Anglicize the pronunciation as . This Anglicized version is used in official city capacities.  History  Paso Robles Clock Tower The historic Carnegie Library now houses the Paso Robles Historical Society museum. This area of the Central Coast, known as the City of El Paso De Robles, Paso Robles, or simply \\"Paso\\", is known for its thermal springs. Native Americans known as the Chumash lived in the area thousands of years even before the mission era. They knew this area as the ‚ÄúSprings‚Äù or the ‚ÄúHot Springs.‚Äù A tribal site on present-day Paso Robles was named elewexe, Obispe√±o for \\"Swordfish\\". Paso Robles is located on the Rancho Paso de Robles Mexican land grant that was purchased by James and Daniel Blackburn in 1857. Their partner was Drury James of Kentucky, a veteran of the Mexican War and uncle of the outlaw Jesse James. The land was a rest-stop for travelers of the Camino Real trail, and was known for its mineral hot springs. Franciscan priests from neighboring Mission San Miguel constructed the first mineral baths in the area. During this period, Paso Robles began to attract the pioneer settlers who would become the founding members of the community. They would later establish cattle ranches, apple and almond orchards, dairy farms, and vineyards. In 1864, the first El Paso de Robles Hotel was constructed and featured a hot mineral springs bath house. Today, only three locations (Paso Robles Inn, River Oaks Hot Springs, and Franklin Hot Springs) are left that offer the healing mineral bath hot spring experience which brought people like Ignacy Jan Paderewski to Paso Robles. James and Daniel Blackburn donated two blocks to the city for a public park to be used for the pleasure of its citizens and visitors. By original deed, the land was to revert to the donors if used for any other purpose than a public park. Two exceptions were made: allowing the building of the Carnegie Library, and the conversion of the library to a museum. The grounds were laid out by a Mr. Redington and a planting day was held when each citizen set out his own donation. Originally, the whole park was hedged in by a fence of cactus, and in 1890 a bandstand was built with money raised by private theatricals. In 1886, after the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad, work began on laying out a town site, with the resort as the nucleus. Two weeks after the first train arrived on October 31, 1886, a three-day celebration was held including a special train from San Francisco bringing prospective buyers, who toured the area and enjoyed the daily barbecues. On November 17, the ‚ÄúGrand Auction‚Äù was held, resulting in the sale of 228 lots. The local agent for the SPR when it arrived in Paso Robles was R. M. \\"Dick\\" Shackelford, a Kentucky native who had come to California in 1853 to dig for gold. Shackelford had a varied career, going from gold mining to hauling freight by ox team, to lumbering, which took him to Nevada, where he served one term as a delegate in the state's first legislature for Washoe County. By 1886 Shackelford had returned to California and was living in Paso Robles, where he began buying up extensive property, building warehouses and starting lumber yards along the railroad's route. Shackelford also established the Southern Pacific Milling Company, which had a virtual monopoly on local milling until local farmers, in an effort to break Shackelford's stranglehold, themselves organized their own milling cooperative, the Farmers' Alliance Flour Mill.San Luis Obispo Heritage In 1889, the same year that Paso Robles incorporated as a city, construction began on a magnificent new hotel. The hotel required over one-million bricks and cost a princely $160,000. The new El Paso de Robles Hotel opened for business in 1891. The new hotel was three stories tall and built of solid masonry, set off by sandstone arches. This ensured the hotel was completely fireproof. The hotel also featured a seven-acre (28,000 m2) garden and nine- hole golf course. Inside there was a library, a beauty salon, a barber shop, and various billiard and lounging rooms. The new hotel also offered an improved hot springs plunge bath as well as 32 individual bath rooms. The 20 by plunge bath was considered one of the finest and most complete of its time in the United States. On January 17, 1914, one of the world's most well-known concert pianists and composers came to the hotel: Ignace Paderewski. After three weeks of treatments at the hotel's mineral hot springs for his arthritis, he resumed his concert tour. He later returned to live at the hotel and bought two ranches west of Paso Robles. During the next 30 years, the hotel was visited by other notables: Boxing champion Jack Dempsey, President Theodore Roosevelt, Adela Rogers St. Johns, Phoebe Apperson Hearst (the mother of William Randolph Hearst), actors Douglas Fairbanks, Boris Karloff, Bob Hope, and Clark Gable all stayed at the El Paso de Robles Hotel. And when Major League baseball teams used Paso Robles as a spring training home, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago White Sox stayed at the hotel and soaked in the mineral hot springs to soothe tired muscles. For a time, Paso Robles was known as the ‚ÄúAlmond City‚Äù because the local almond growers created the largest concentration of almond orchards in the world. The ranchers in the outlying areas were very important to the Paso Robles area. On these ranches were cattle and horses, grain crops (primarily wheat and barley), garden produce and fruit and nut orchards. Many of these ranch lands and orchards have become vineyards for the many wineries which currently draw tourists to the area. To show their appreciation to the ranchers, in October 1931 the business people established Pioneer Day, which is still an annual celebration. Pioneer Day is celebrated most years on the Saturday prior to October 12 (however, in 2017, it was moved to October 14). It was originally organized by community volunteers working with donations of time, materials and money from individuals, businesses, churches and service organizations. Their goal was to provide a day of community friendship and a commemoration of the heritage of the Paso Robles area. It would also become a day set aside to say ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to all of the people who support the business and professional community of the area throughout the year. Most businesses would close so that their employees could enjoy and participate in the activities and family reunions. There were to be no charges for any of the events and no commercial concessions, and lunch would be provided at no cost. The business closure still holds true for most of the downtown core businesses, but some do open in the mid-afternoon. Most businesses outside of the downtown area keep their normal hours and do not close.

Guests staying the night escaped unharmed. However, the night clerk who discovered the fire suffered a fatal heart attack immediately after sounding the alarm. Within months after the blaze, plans for a new hotel to be built on the site were drawn up. The design was an entirely new concept: A garden inn-hotel, designed to accommodate motor vehicle travelers. By February 1942 construction was complete and the new Paso Robles Inn opened for business. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the City of Paso Robles experienced significant growth. The area's wine industry flourished, the California Mid-State Fair expanded into a regional attraction, and local lakes, such as Lake Nacimiento, became family vacation destinations. =The waters= Historic brochure for Paso Robles Hot Springs resort, circa 1910 As far back as 1795, Paso Robles has been spoken of and written about as ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äôs oldest watering place‚Äù‚Äîthe place to go for springs and mud baths. In 1864, a correspondent to the San Francisco Bulletin wrote that there was every prospect of the Paso Robles hot springs becoming the watering place of the state. By 1868 people were coming from as far away as Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, and even Alabama. Besides the well-known mud baths, there were the Iron Spring and the Sand Spring, which bubbles through the sand and was said to produce delightful sensations. In 1882, Drury James and the Blackburn brothers issued a pamphlet advertising ‚ÄúEl Paso de Robles Hot and Cold Sulphur Springs and the Only Natural Mud Baths in the World‚Äù. By then there were first-class accommodations: a reading room, barber shop, and telegraph office; a general store, a top-of-the-line livery stable, and comfortably furnished cottages for families that preferred privacy to quarters in the hotel. Visitors could stay in touch with the rest of the world, as there were two daily mails, a Western Union telegraph office, and a Wells Fargo agency with special rates for guests. As the springs became more and more a destination of the well-to-do as a place to go to socialize, the original purpose of the springs‚Äîto heal‚Äîbecame peripheral. The bathhouse was erected over the sulphur spring in 1888, with a plunge and thirty-seven bath rooms. In the following year, work began on the large Hot Springs Hotel, (today the Paso Robles Inn), which was completed in 1900 and burned down 40 years later. Since the privileges of using the baths were restricted to guests of the hotel and many sufferers of the ailments the baths cured could not pay the rates of the fashionable hotel, a few businessmen in Paso Robles made arrangements with Felix Liss for the right to bore for sulphur water on a lot which Liss owned. A sulphur well was reached, a bath house built and baths offered at an affordable rate of twenty-five cents. The establishment was later offered to the city and is currently the site of the Municipal Pool. =Wine= Paso Robles‚Äô growth industry‚Äîwine‚Äîhas a long history with the area. Wine grapes were introduced to the Paso Robles soil in 1797 by the Spanish conquistadors and Franciscan missionaries. Spanish explorer Francisco Cortez envisioned an abundant wine-producing operation and encouraged settlers from Mexico and other parts of California to cultivate the land. The first vineyardists in the area were the Padres of the Mission San Miguel, and their old fermentation vats and grapevine artwork can still be seen at the Mission, north of the city of Paso Robles. Commercial winemaking was introduced to the Paso Robles region in 1882 when Andrew York, a settler from Indiana, began planting vineyards and established the Ascension Winery at what became York Mountain Winery and is now Epoch Winery. When York purchased the land, it was primarily apple orchards, with a small plot of wine grape vines. York found that the climate and soil were more suitable for vineyards and he expanded the vineyards. Within a few years, he found that the vines were yielding more than he could market, prompting him to build a small, stone winery. Following Andrew York's early success in the wine business, Gerd and Ilsabe Klintworth planted a vineyard in the Geneseo/Linne area in approximately 1886. They were licensed to sell jugs of Zinfandel, Port, and Muscatel, as well as some of the area's first white wine made from Burger grapes. The Casteel Vineyards in the Willow Creek area were planted just prior to 1908. Casteel wines were stored and aged in a cave cellar. Cuttings from the old vines provided the start for other vineyards, still producing in the area today. As the popularity of wines began to grow, so did the Paso Robles wine region. Lorenzo and Rena Nerelli purchased their vineyard at the foot of York Mountain in 1917. Their Templeton Winery was the area's first to be bonded following the repeal of Prohibition. The early 1920s saw a flurry of winemaking activity when several families immigrated to the area to establish family vineyards and wineries. Sylvester and Caterina Dusi purchased a vineyard in 1924. The old head-pruned Zinfandel vines are now owned and cultivated by their son, Benito. The Martinelli, Busi, Vosti, Steinbeck and Bianchi Winery vineyards were also established around this time. The Paso Robles wine region gained more notoriety when Ignace Paderewski, the famous Polish statesman and concert pianist, visited Paso Robles, became enchanted with the area, and purchased . In the early 1920s, he planted Petite Sirah and Zinfandel on his Rancho San Ignacio vineyard in the Adelaide area. Following Prohibition, Paderewski's wine was made at York Mountain Winery. The wines produced from grapes grown on Rancho San Ignacio went on to become award- winners. Paso Robles‚Äô reputation as a premier wine region became firmly established as a result of this and later successes, and through to the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of vineyard pioneers came forth and flourished in the Paso Robles area. =San Simeon earthquake= At 11:15 am PST on December 22, 2003, the San Simeon earthquake struck about northwest of Paso Robles. The earthquake registered 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Two deaths occurred when the roof slid off the clock tower building, a popular landmark in downtown Paso Robles. The dormant underground springs that had once been used for the spa were brought back to life, causing flooding and a large sinkhole in the parking lot of the city hall and library. Due to lengthy environmental and engineering considerations, it took until December 2010 for the sinkhole to be filled and the parking lot resurfaced. Paso Robles has dedicated a new clock tower in memory of the two women who died. Geography Paso Robles is approximately halfway between the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The topography of the area consists of gentle rolling hills on the eastern half of the city, and foothill peaks which rise in elevation to the Santa Lucia Coastal Range on the west, which are all blanketed in the Californian chaparral environment, which is mainly dry grassland and oak woodland. Paso Robles sits on the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Coastal Mountain Range, which lies directly to the West of the city, and runs in a North-South direction, starting at Monterey, then runs down South to its terminus, in the San Luis Obispo area. The city is located at the southern end of the fertile Salinas River Valley, which is centered in between the Temblor Range (including the San Andreas Fault), which lie about to the East, and the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, which lie directly west, rising up from the city's western border. Paso Robles sits at the border where northern San Luis Obispo County and southern Monterey County meet, and is situated roughly , or 20 minutes, inland from the Pacific Ocean. =Climate= The Paso Robles area has two different climate types and classifications, as based on the K√∂ppen climate classification (KCC) system, which are KCC type BSk, a semi-arid, dry, steppe-type climate, and KCC type Csb, which is the typical, coastal Californian & \\"Mediterranean\\" type. The area receives a mixture of these two types of climates, but the primary climate is defined by long, hot, dry summers and brief, cool, rainy winters. Paso Robles enjoys long-lasting, mild autumns and occasional early springs, giving the region a unique climate suitable for growing a variety of crops (ranging from primarily grapes, to olives, to almonds and other tree nuts). The city receives an average annual rainfall of about 14.71 inches (374 mm) per year, and most of this precipitation falls during winter and early spring. Paso Robles often receives less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rain per year and typically, no rain falls from May through September. Summers in Paso Robles tend to be very hot, with daily temperatures frequently exceeding from late June to as late as mid September, and occasionally exceeding . Paso Robles' summers feature an unusually large daytime-nighttime temperature swing, where there may be a profound temperature difference, as much as 50 ¬∞F (28 ¬∞C), between the daytime highs and the overnight lows. Winters are often very cool and moist, with daytime temperatures reaching into the low 50s¬∞F (10 ¬∞C). Mornings and nights differ from the daytime average, as they tend to very frigid (especially in December and January), where lows reach as low as . Due to the somewhat close proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the marine layer occasionally makes it over the coast range and into Paso Robles, creating occasional fog. Unlike typical California coastal marine fog in areas such as San Francisco, this fog is never long lasting, and typically burns off before 10am. The all-time record high temperature at the National Weather Service cooperative city office was on August 13, 1933. The record low temperature was on January 6, 1913, making Paso Robles the lowest elevation in California to reach that low temperature. There are an average of 81.0 days with high temperatures of 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) or higher and an average of 64.0 days with low temperatures of 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C) or lower. The 30-year average (1971‚Äì2000) annual precipitation is , falling on an average of 47 days. The wettest year was 1941 with of precipitation and the dryest year was 1947 with . The most precipitation in one month was in January 1916. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on December 6, 1966. Although snow is rare in Paso Robles, 4.0 inches fell on April 5, 1929, and on December 15, 1988. At the Paso Robles FAA Airport, the record high temperature was 115 ¬∞F on June 15, 1961, and July 20, 1960. The record low temperature was on December 22, 1990. There are an average of 86.7 days with highs of 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) or higher and an average of 53.6 days with lows of 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C) or lower. The 30-year average (1971‚Äì2000) annual precipitation was , falling on an average of 42 days. The wettest year was 1995 with and the driest year was 2007 with . The most precipitation in one month was in January 1969. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on March 10, 1995. The record snowfall was on December 15, 1988.

Economy =Wine and vineyards= Halter Ranch Winery vineyard near Paso Robles The Paso Robles Wine Country has a number of wineries and vineyards in the area. It is the location of the Paso Robles AVA (American Viticultural Area). More than 25 different varieties of grapes are grown in the Paso Robles Wine Country and there are over 250 bonded wineries. In 1993, Paso Robles grape growers, wineries and wine tasting rooms united to form the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance. This non-profit trade organization is dedicated to the promotion and education of the Paso Robles premium wine country. The Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance is a cooperative marketing alliance made up of Paso Robles Wine Country wineries, vineyards and related businesses. They host many of the festivals in the Paso Robles Area, and strengthen brand awareness locally, regionally and nationally. The wine alliance focuses on trade and consumer outreach, media relations, buyer tours, educational and research programs and giving back to education and health organizations in the Paso Robles community. =Sustainable building= Several companies in the area specialize in straw-bale construction, insulating concrete forms, rammed earth, super insulated buildings, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (L.E.E.D) construction. Within a radius of downtown Paso Robles there are twelve straw bale homes, six insulated concrete homes, and several straw bale wineries/tasting rooms. Arts and culture Every year in March, the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance hosts the Zinfandel Festival, during which Central Coast Zinfandel producers and the public visit the area to enjoy the wine of the area. This event is held by the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, a non-profit cooperative marketing alliance looking to not only educate the community and surrounding communities about Paso Robles wine, but to also give back to the community. The Paso Robles Wine Festival takes place in May and an olive festival takes place yearly also. In October is the Harvest Wine Weekend, celebrating the wine harvest in the region. The Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance also host a Grand Tasting Tour, which takes the wines of the Paso Robles area to other areas in California, and other states such as Washington, D.C.. On Memorial Day Weekend, Paso Robles hosts the Festival of the Arts in the downtown park. With over 100 artists over three art-filled days, the festival of the arts is a multiday arts festival which is intended to honor and preserve the natural environment and character of the region through the arts. In August of each year, the Paso Robles Main Street Association presents the Olive Festival in the downtown park featuring free olive oil and olive product sampling from producers from all over California. Government = Local government = Paso Robles is a general law city; it does not have a city charter. It uses a council-manager form of government, directed by a five-member city council. The council consists of a mayor (elected at-large for a four-year term during non-presidential even- numbered years) and four council members (elected at-large for staggered four- year terms on even-numbered years (2+2)). The mayor has no veto power, but has a vote on the council. Prior to the mid-1990s, the mayor was rotated through the city council members on a yearly basis. Then it became a two-year general election post. In 2012, the voters voted to make the mayor a four-year post. The council appoints the city manager and city attorney, but the city clerk and city treasurer are elected officials. =State and federal representation= In the California State Legislature, Paso Robles is in , and . In the United States House of Representatives, Paso Robles is in . Transportation =Highways= Paso Robles is at the major crossroads of U.S. Highway 101 and State Highway 46, about halfway between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area with direct access to the San Joaquin Valley and Interstate 5. Paso Robles is currently served by one freeway and two highways: * 25px U.S. Route 101 (US 101) is the most frequented and largest road- transportation arterial for the city of Paso Robles which serves as its north- south gateway. US 101 runs in a north-south direction and bisects the city (along with the Salinas River), into its western and eastern portions. Traveling northward from the city, US 101 heads to San Jose and San Francisco, and continues on along the coast up through Northern California and Oregon, and ends near Olympia in Washington state. Traveling southward from the city, US 101 heads to San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and on to its southern terminus in Los Angeles. * 20px State Route 46 (SR 46) is the main east-west arterial for the city of Paso Robles and serves as its eastern gateway from the San Joaquin Valley. SR 46 runs in an east-west direction except for a short portion in Paso Robles where it overlaps with US 101 for . Traveling westward, SR 46 leaves the city and gradually climbs up and over the Santa Lucia Coastal Range, where it then quickly descends and meets the Pacific Ocean, just south of the coastal village of Cambria at its westernmost terminus at Highway 1, better known as the Pacific Coast Highway. Traveling eastward, SR 46 leaves the city and after traveling through rolling countryside for about , it climbs up the Temblor Range and San Andreas Fault, then later, crosses Interstate 5 and continues on, later terminating at State Route 99, about north of Bakersfield and south of Fresno. In the future, SR 46 may be considered for a possible westward expansion of Interstate 40, via SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield, from Bakersfield to I-5 via Westside Parkway, along I-5 to SR 46, then following SR 46 to Paso Robles. * 25px State Route 229 is mainly an intra-county route that is used for traveling between the small rural towns in the eastern part of the county. SR 229 begins in Paso Robles as Creston Road, then east, as it leaves the city heading south- eastward, becomes simply SR 229 as it heads to the small rural town of Creston about southeast of Paso Robles. It then continues southward for , where it ends at State Route 58, about east of the small town of Santa Margarita. =Rail transportation= Southern Pacific steam excursion train in north Paso Robles, 1994 Amtrak Train Station Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, serves Paso Robles, operating its Coast Starlight daily in each direction between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, which operates between San Diego and Paso Robles, connects by bus transfer from San Luis Obispo Railroad Station. =Airport= Paso Robles Municipal Airport, a regional general aviation airport, is about northeast of downtown Paso Robles. Paso Robles Municipal does not offer scheduled passenger service. Scheduled passenger market is available at thebnearby San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport, to the south in San Luis Obispo. The Paso Robles airport has daily business aviation operations, in addition to serving as a large general aviation base. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has an air attack base at the airport. There, aircraft are reloaded with fire fighting chemicals, which are dropped on brush and forest fires. The local Civil Air Patrol squadron also operates and trains on the airbase as part of the localized squadron 103, performing training craft operations known as O-Flights in a trainer craft that is brought to a desired altitude then dropped, essentially being towed by the aircraft, cadets of the Civil Air Patrol are the most of this demographic, but the cadets also help out congestion in the airport when it is busy during the operations. Also, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) houses a fixed-wing aircraft, used for speed enforcement, and a helicopter, used for search and rescue. The area immediately surrounding the Paso Robles Airport, known as Airport Road Industrial Park, is also home to many aviation maintenance providers and facilities, as well as home to many aviation parts manufacturers and other related businesses.

Riviera Magazine 'Lost Prophets is among the most beautifully shot, well-edited and fully realized movies in this years Newport Beach Film Festival, let alone the action sports category.' OC Weekly Filmmaker A competitive freestyle BMX rider in his teens, Apffel's lifepath was drastically altered when he fell off a cliff in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico at the age of 16. He was life-flighted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, CA and quickly prepped for brain surgery due to excessive swelling and bleeding on the brain. During pre-surgery testing, however, the doctors found that Apffel had suffered a grand mal seizure due to head trauma. The surgery was postponed, the bleeding and swelling subsided slowly, and days later, he was released on strict orders that he could not take part in activities where he could hit his head again. Because head injuries are cumulative, another hit could be extremely detrimental or fatal. His driver's license was suspended and he endured a year full of EEG's and MRI's. What followed was a new cautiousness, but Apffel couldn't leave his passion for surfing and action sports behind. He secured a small loan and purchased a Sony Handycam and laptop. He then took some courses and delved into sports, surf and water photography while his filming career took root.

He wrote a book with General Kurt Versock called The History of the 24th Infantry Division. Although much decorated, Tettau's reputation is debatable. Some German historians argue that he had little real military experience up to his countermeasures at the Battle of Arnhem in 1944, the Allied Operation Market Garden. Fellow generals spoke of Tettau -whose regular work in the army was more that of an inspector than of a commanding officer - in a negative way when he organised his defences in the Netherlands under the name of Westgruppe, which was no formal army division at all. This was seen as a political move by Tettau to gain credit in Berlin.Verhoef, 2012 Awards and decorations * Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class (18 September 1914) & 1st Class (18 September 1915)Thomas 1998, p. 372. * Clasp to the Iron Cross (1939) 2nd Class (22 September 1939) & 1st Class (5 October 1939) * German Cross in Gold on 5 May 1942 as Generalleutnant and commander of 24.

Apart from being one of the political novels in the Philippines from 1967 to 1972 that \\"represented a clamor for change in society\\" (Filipino: kinatawan ng paghingi ng pagbabago sa lipunan), Satanas sa Lupa was one of the novels in the Philippines that incorporated romanticism in its plot using the \\"love triangle\\" (Filipino: tatsulukan ng pag-ibig) genre, a genre that began in the Philippines in 1906 through another novel entitled Juan Masili by another Filipino author named Patricio Mariano. The love triangle in Satanas sa Lupa is between the characters Benigno Talavera, Conrado, and Chona. Description According to Ruby Gamboa-Alcantara in her \\"Romantisismo, Estilong Pilipino\\" Itinatak sa Nobelang Tagalog (\\"Romanticism, Filipino Style\\" Stamped on the Tagalog Novel), the character Benigno Talavera was the representative of Philippine politics in Satanas sa Lupa. Talavera was a \\"formerly good citizen\\" who was influenced by three other Congressmen (Filipino: Konggresista) Carpio, David, and Balbino. The three were cheating each other for the sake of climbing up the ladder of power and for gaining wealth. In Satanas sa Lupa, the reign of greed was ended by the persecution of Senator Morales, the death of Talavera, and the burning of evidence used to blackmail Talavera. The evidence was burned by Talavera's wife, Virginia. The other circumstances presented in Satanas sa Lupa were the drug addiction of Ismael, the son of Talavera; the pregnancy out of wedlock and motherhood as a single woman by Esther, the daughter of Talavera; the love affair between Contrado and Chona; and the elopement of Conrado and Chona (Conrado was supposed to become a priest). According to Gamboa-Alcantara, there is an unrealistic circumstance in Satanas sa Lupa, which is the excessive portrayal of Virginia, the wife of Talavera, as the martyred spouse and mother, due to the use of Philippine-style romanticism.

It was built in 1909‚Äì1910 for the Norfolk and Western Railway, and was later used by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Amtrak. History Union Station in 1921 The Pocahantas at Petersburg in 1970 The Petersburg Railroad (opened 1833) and Richmond and Petersburg Railroad (opened 1838) ran north-south on a winding route through Petersburg. The two lines merged in 1898 and became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) in 1900. The ACL used a station located at Washington Street and Union Street. The east-west Southside Railroad, predecessor of the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;), opened in the early 1850s. It used a still-extant station at River Street and Rock Street. The Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) opened its own north-south line through Petersburg in 1900, crossing the Appomattox River on a high bridge. The SAL had a passenger station at Dunlop Street for through trains, and terminating passenger and freight stations at Market Street on a spur line. The SAL never used Union Station; the Dunlop Street station was replaced with a brick station near Bluefield Street in 1944. In 1909-10, the N&W; constructed Union Station at the junction with the ACL near Third Street. It allowed riders to transfer between the Norfolk‚ÄìCincinnati trains - the Cavalier, Pocahontas and Powhatan Arrow - and ACL Florida‚ÄìNew York trains. The ACL moved to a new station in Ettrick on a western bypass route in 1955, leaving only the N&W; at Union Station. When Amtrak took over intercity passenger service on May 1, 1971, east-west service on the N&W; was discontinued, while north-south service continued to use the Ettrick station. From 1975 to 1977, Amtrak operated the Norfolk-Cincinnati Mountaineer, with a stop at Union Station The Hilltopper, which replaced the Mountaineer and ran until 1979, used a station located slightly to the west at Fleet Street instead.

This practice is common to religion, politics and business and can facilitate the approval or disapproval or indifference to a person, policy, or product. The ethicality of crowd manipulation is commonly questioned. Crowd manipulation differs from propaganda although they may reinforce one another to produce a desired result. If propaganda is \\"the consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of the public to an enterprise, idea or group\\",Edward L. Bernays and Mark Crispin Miller, Propaganda (Brooklyn, NY: Ig Publishing, 2004): 52. crowd manipulation is the relatively brief call to action once the seeds of propaganda (i.e. more specifically \\"pre- propaganda\\"Jacques Ellul, Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes (New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1965): 15.) are sown and the public is organized into a crowd. The propagandist appeals to the masses, even if compartmentalized, whereas the crowd manipulator appeals to a segment of the masses assembled into a crowd in real time. In situations such as a national emergency, however, a crowd manipulator may leverage mass media to address the masses in real time as if speaking to a crowd.Gustave Le Bon, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, Kindle Edition, Book I, Chapter 1 (Ego Books, 2008). Crowd manipulation also differs from crowd control, which serves a security function. Local authorities use crowd-control methods to contain and disperse crowds and to prevent and respond to unruly and unlawful acts such as rioting and looting. Function and morality A sensationalized portrayal of the Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770): Such images were used to breed discontent and foster unity among the American colonists against the British crown prior to the American War of Independence. The crowd manipulator engages, controls, or influences crowds without the use of physical force, although his goal may be to instigate the use of force by the crowd or by local authorities. Prior to the American War of Independence, Samuel Adams provided Bostonians with \\"elaborate costumes, props, and musical instruments to lead protest songs in harborside demonstrations and parades through Boston's streets.\\" If such crowds provoked British authorities to violence, as they did during the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, Adams would write, produce, and disperse sensationalized accounts of the incidents to stir discontent and create unity among the American colonies. The American way of manipulation may be classified as a tool of soft power, which is \\"the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments\\". Harvard professor Joseph Nye coined the term in the 1980s, although he did not create the concept. The techniques used to win the minds of crowds were examined and developed notably by Quintilian in his training book, Institutio oratoria and by Aristotle in Rhetoric. Known origins of crowd manipulation go as far back as the 5th century BC, where litigants in Syracuse sought to improve their persuasiveness in court.Aristotle, The Art of Rhetoric, translated with an introduction by H.C. Lawson-Tencred (New York, NY: Penguin Group, 2004): 1‚Äì13. The verb \\"manipulate\\" can convey negativity, but it does not have to do so. According to Merriam Webster's Dictionary, for example, to \\"manipulate\\" means \\"to control or play upon by artful, unfair, or insidious means especially to one's own advantage.\\" This definition allows, then, for the artful and honest use of control for one's advantage. Moreover, the actions of a crowd need not be criminal in nature. Nineteenth-century social scientist Gustave Le Bon wrote: Edward Bernays, the so-called \\"Father of Public Relations\\", believed that public manipulation was not only moral, but a necessity. He argued that \\"a small, invisible government who understands the mental processes and social patterns of the masses, rules public opinion by consent.\\" This is necessary for the division of labor and to prevent chaos and confusion. \\"The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion\\", wrote Bernays.Bernays, 109. He also wrote, \\"We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.\\" Others argue that some techniques are not inherently evil, but instead are philosophically neutral vehicles. Lifelong political activist and former Ronald Reagan White House staffer Morton C. Blackwell explained in a speech titled, \\"People, Parties, and Power\\": In brief, manipulators with different ideologies can employ successfully the same techniques to achieve ends that may be good or bad. Crowd manipulation techniques offers individuals and groups a philosophically neutral means to maximize the effect of their messages. In order to manipulate a crowd, one should first understand what is meant by a crowd, as well as the principles that govern its behavior. Crowds and their behavior The word \\"crowd\\", according to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, refers to both \\"a large number of persons especially when collected together\\" (as in a crowded shopping mall) and \\"a group of people having something in common [as in a habit, interest, or occupation].\\" Philosopher G.A. Tawny defined a crowd as \\"a numerous collection of people who face a concrete situation together and are more or less aware of their bodily existence as a group. Their facing the situation together is due to common interests and the existence of common circumstances which give a single direction to their thoughts and actions.\\" Tawney discussed in his work \\"The Nature of Crowds\\" two main types of crowds: In a 2001 study, the Institute for Non-Lethal Defense Studies at Pennsylvania State University defined a crowd more specifically as \\"a gathering of a multitude of individuals and small groups that have temporarily assembled. These small groups are usually friends, family members, or acquaintances.\\" A crowd may display behavior that differs from the individuals who compose it. Several theories have emerged in the 19th century and early 20th century to explain this phenomenon. These collective works contribute to the \\"classic theory\\" of crowd psychology. In 1968, however, social scientist Dr. Carl Couch of the University of Liverpool refuted many of the stereotypes associated with crowd behavior as described by classic theory. His criticisms are supported widely in the psychology community but are still being incorporated as a \\"modern theory\\" into psychological texts.Kenny, et al., 13. A modern model, based on the \\"individualistic\\" concept of crowd behavior developed by Floyd Allport in 1924, is the Elaborated Social Identity Model (ESIM). The Riots Organized by the Paris Commune (French Revolution) on May 31 and June 2, 1793. =Classic theory= French philosopher and historian Hippolyte Taine provided in the wake of the Franco Prussian War of 1871 the first modern account of crowd psychology. Gustave Le Bon developed this framework in his 1895 book, Psychologie des Foules. He proposed that French crowds during the 19th century were essentially excitable, irrational mobs easily influenced by wrongdoers. He postulated that the heterogeneous elements which make up this type of crowd essentially form a new being, a chemical reaction of sorts in which the crowd's properties change. He wrote: Le Bon observed several characteristics of what he called the \\"organized\\" or \\"psychological\\" crowd, including: #submergence or the disappearance of a conscious personality and the appearance of an unconscious personality (aka \\"mental unity\\"). This process is aided by sentiments of invincible power and anonymity which allow one to yield to instincts which he would have kept under restraint (i.e. Individuality is weakened and the unconscious \\"gains the upper hand\\"); #contagion (\\"In a crowd every sentiment and act is contagious, and contagious to such a degree that an individual readily sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest.\\"); and #suggestibility as the result of a hypnotic state. \\"All feelings and thoughts are bent in the direction determined by the hypnotizer\\" and the crowd tends to turn these thoughts into acts. In sum, the classic theory contends that: *\\"[Crowds] are unified masses whose behaviors can be categorized as active, expressive, acquisitive or hostile.\\" *\\"[Crowd] participants [are] given to spontaneity, irrationality, loss of self-control, and a sense of anonymity.\\"Kenny, et al., 12. Part of the crowd at the G20 Meltdown protest in London on 1 April 2009. =Modern theory= Critics of the classic theory contend that it is seriously flawed in that it decontextualises crowd behavior, lacks sustainable empirical support, is biased, and ignores the influence of policing measures on the behavior of the crowd.Stott, 12. In 1968, Dr. Carl J. Couch examined and refuted many classic-theory stereotypes in his article, \\"Collective Behavior: An Examination of Some Stereotypes.\\" Since then, other social scientists have validated much of his critique. Knowledge from these studies of crowd psychology indicate that: *\\"Crowds are not homogeneous entities\\" but are composed \\"of a minority of individuals and a majority of small groups of people who are acquainted with one another.\\" *\\"Crowd participants are [neither] unanimous in their motivation\\" nor to one another. Participants \\"seldom act in unison, and if they do, that action does not last long.\\" *\\"Crowds do not cripple individual cognition\\" and \\"are not uniquely distinguished by violence or disorderly actions.\\" *\\"Individual attitudes and personality characteristics\\", as well as \\"socioeconomic, demographic and political variables are poor predictors of riot intensity and individual participation.\\" According to the aforementioned 2001 study conducted by Penn State University's Institute for Non-Lethal Defense Technologies, crowds undergo a process that has a \\"beginning, middle, and ending phase.\\" Specifically: *The assembling process This phase includes the temporary assembly of individuals for a specific amount of time. Evidence suggests that assembly occurs most frequently by means of an \\"organized mobilization method\\" but can also occur by \\"impromptu process\\" such as word of mouth by non-official organizers. *The temporary gathering In this phase, individuals are assembled and participate in both individual and \\"collective actions.\\" Rarely do all individuals in a crowd participate, and those who do participate do so by choice. Participation furthermore appears to vary based on the type and purpose of the gathering, with religious services experiencing \\"greater participation\\" (i.e. 80-90%). *The dispersing process In the final phase, the crowd's participants disperse from a \\"common location\\" to \\"one or more alternate locations.\\" A \\"riot\\" occurs when \\"one or more individuals within a gathering engage in violence against person or property.\\" According to U.S. and European research data from 1830 to 1930 and from the 1960 to the present, \\"less than 10 percent of protest demonstrations have involved violence against person or property\\", with the \\"celebration riot\\" as the most frequent type of riot in the United States.Kenny, 12‚Äì20. =Elaborated social identity model (ESIM)= A modern model has also been developed by Steve Reicher, John Drury, and Clifford Stott which contrasts significantly from the \\"classic theory\\" of crowd behavior. According to Clifford Stott of the University of Leeds: Stott's final point differs from the \\"submergence\\" quality of crowds proposed by Le Bon, in which the individual's consciousness gives way to the unconsciousness of the crowd. ESIM also considers the effect of policing on the behavior of the crowd. It warns that \\"the indiscriminate use of force would create a redefined sense of unity in the crowd in terms of the illegitimacy of and opposition to the actions of the police.\\" This could essentially draw the crowd into conflict despite the initial hesitancy of the individuals in the crowd.Stott. Planning and technique Crowd manipulation involves several elements, including: context analysis, site selection, propaganda, authority, and delivery. =Context analysis= Soldiers of the California National Guard patrol the streets of Los Angeles in response to street rioting. History suggests that the socioeconomic and political context and location influence dramatically the potential for crowd manipulation. Such time periods in America included: *Prelude to the American Revolution (1763‚Äì1775), when Britain imposed heavy taxes and various restrictions upon its thirteen North American colonies;Waller, 1-4. *Roaring Twenties (1920‚Äì1929), when the advent of mass production made it possible for everyday citizens to purchase previously considered luxury items at affordable prices. Businesses that utilized assembly-line manufacturing were challenged to sell large numbers of identical products;Curtis. *The Great Depression (1929‚Äì1939), when a devastating stock market crash disrupted the American economy, caused widespread unemployment; and *The Cold War (1945‚Äì1989), when Americans faced the threat of nuclear war and participated in the Korean War, the greatly unpopular Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, the Cuban Missile Crisis. Internationally, time periods conducive to crowd manipulation included the Interwar Period (i.e. following the collapse of the Austria-Hungarian, Russian, Ottoman, and German empires) and Post-World War II (i.e. decolonization and collapse of the British, German, French, and Japanese empires).Paul Johnson, Modern Times: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties (New York, NY: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 11‚Äì44; 231‚Äì2; 435, 489, 495‚Äì543, 582, 614, 632, 685, 757, 768. The prelude to the collapse of the Soviet Union provided ample opportunity for messages of encouragement. The Solidarity Movement began in the 1970s thanks in part to leaders like Lech Walesa and U.S. Information Agency programming.Wilson P. Dizard, Jr., Inventing Public Diplomacy: The Story of the U.S. Information Agency (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2004): 204. In 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan capitalized on the sentiments of the West Berliners as well as the freedom-starved East Berliners to demand that Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev \\"tear down\\" the Berlin Wall.Smith-Davies Publishing, Speeches that Changed the World (London: Smith-Davies Publishing Ltd, 2005): 197‚Äì201. During the 2008 presidential elections, candidate Barack Obama capitalized on the sentiments of many American voters frustrated predominantly by the recent economic downturn and the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His simple messages of \\"Hope\\", \\"Change\\", and \\"Yes We Can\\" were adopted quickly and chanted by his supporters during his political rallies.David E. Campbell, \\"Public Opinion and the 2008 Presidential Election\\" in Janet M. Box-Steffensmeier and Steven E. Schier, The American Elections of 2008 (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2009): 99‚Äì116. Historical context and events may also encourage unruly behavior. Such examples include the: *1968 Columbia, SC Civil Rights Protest; *1992 London Poll Tax Protest; and *1992 L.A. Riots (sparked by the acquittal of police officers involved in the assault of Rodney King).Kenny, et al. In order to capitalize fully upon historical context, it is essential to conduct a thorough audience analysis to understand the desires, fears, concerns, and biases of the target crowd. This may be done through scientific studies, focus groups, and polls. =Site selection= U.S. President Ronald Reagan giving a speech at the Berlin Wall, Brandenburg Gate, Federal Republic of Germany. June 12, 1987. Where a crowd assembles also provides opportunities to manipulate thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Location, weather, lighting, sound, and even the shape of an arena all influence a crowd's willingness to participate. Symbolic and tangible backdrops like the Brandenburg Gate, used by Presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton in 1963, 1987, and 1994, respectively, can evoke emotions before the crowd manipulator opens his or her mouth to speak.Melissa Eddy, \\"Obama to speak near Berlin's Brandenburg Gate\\". Associated Press, July 20, 2008. George W. Bush's \\"Bullhorn Address\\" at Ground Zero following the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center is another example of how venue can amplify a message. In response to a rescue worker's shout, \\"I can't hear you\\", President Bush shouted back, \\"I can hear you! I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people ‚Äì and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!\\" The crowd erupted in cheers and patriotic chants. =Propaganda= The crowd manipulator and the propagandist may work together to achieve greater results than they would individually. According to Edward Bernays, the propagandist must prepare his target group to think about and anticipate a message before it is delivered. Messages themselves must be tested in advance since a message that is ineffective is worse than no message at all.Bernays, 52. Social scientist Jacques Ellul called this sort of activity \\"pre-propaganda\\", and it is essential if the main message is to be effective. Ellul wrote in Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes: In Jacques Ellul's book, Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, it states that sociological propaganda can be compared to plowing, direct propaganda to sowing; you cannot do the one without doing the other first.Ellul, 15. Sociological propaganda is a phenomenon where a society seeks to integrate the maximum number of individuals into itself by unifying its members' behavior according to a pattern, spreading its style of life abroad, and thus imposing itself on other groups. Essentially sociological propaganda aims to increase conformity with the environment that is of a collective nature by developing compliance with or defense of the established order through long term penetration and progressive adaptation by using all social currents. The propaganda element is the way of life with which the individual is permeated and then the individual begins to express it in film, writing, or art without realizing it. This involuntary behavior creates an expansion of society through advertising, the movies, education, and magazines. \\"The entire group, consciously or not, expresses itself in this fashion; and to indicate, secondly that its influence aims much more at an entire style of life.\\"Ellul, Jacques (1973). Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, p. 62.Trans. Konrad Kellen & Jean Lerner. Vintage Books, New York. . This type of propaganda is not deliberate but springs up spontaneously or unwittingly within a culture or nation. This propaganda reinforces the individual's way of life and represents this way of life as best. Sociological propaganda creates an indisputable criterion for the individual to make judgments of good and evil according to the order of the individual's way of life. Sociological propaganda does not result in action, however, it can prepare the ground for direct propaganda. From then on, the individual in the clutches of such sociological propaganda believes that those who live this way are on the side of the angels, and those who don't are bad.Ellul, Jacques (1973). Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes, p. 65.Trans. Konrad Kellen & Jean Lerner. Vintage Books, New York. . Bernays expedited this process by identifying and contracting those who most influence public opinion (key experts, celebrities, existing supporters, interlacing groups, etc.). After the mind of the crowd is plowed and the seeds of propaganda are sown, a crowd manipulator may prepare to harvest his crop. =Authority= The manipulator may be an orator, a group, a musician, an athlete, or some other person who moves a crowd to the point of agreement before he makes a specific call to action. Aristotle believed that the ethos, or credibility, of the manipulator contributes to his persuasiveness. Prestige is a form of \\"domination exercised on our mind by an individual, a work, or an idea.\\" The manipulator with great prestige paralyses the critical faculty of his crowd and commands respect and awe. Authority flows from prestige, which can be generated by \\"acquired prestige\\" (e.g. job title, uniform, judge's robe) and \\"personal prestige\\" (i.e. inner strength). Personal prestige is like that of the \\"tamer of a wild beast\\" who could easily devour him. Success is the most important factor affecting personal prestige. Le Bon wrote, \\"From the minute prestige is called into question, it ceases to be prestige.\\" Thus, it would behoove the manipulator to prevent this discussion and to maintain a distance from the crowd lest his faults undermine his prestige.Le Bon, Book II, Chapter 3. =Delivery= Winston Churchill in Durban in the British Cape Colony in 1899. Delivering a speech after escaping from a South African prisoners' of war camp. The manipulator's ability to sway a crowd depends especially on his or her visual, vocal, and verbal delivery. Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler made personal commitments to become master rhetoricians. Churchill At 22, Winston Churchill documented his conclusions about speaking to crowds. He titled it \\"The Scaffolding of Rhetoric\\" and it outlined what he believed to be the essentials of any effective speech. Among these essentials are: *\\"Correctness of diction\\", or proper word choice to convey the exact meaning of the orator; *\\"Rhythm\\", or a speech's sound appeal through \\"long, rolling and sonorous\\" sentences; *\\"Accumulation of argument\\", or the orator's \\"rapid succession of waves of sound and vivid pictures\\" to bring the crowd to a thundering ascent; *\\"Analogy\\", or the linking of the unknown to the familiar; and *\\"Wild extravagance\\", or the use of expressions, however extreme, which embody the feelings of the orator and his audience.Winston S. Churchill, \\"The Scaffolding of Rhetoric\\", in Randolph S. Churchill, Companion Volume 1, pt. 2, to Youth: 1874-1900, vol. 1 of the Official Biography of Winston Spencer Churchill (London: Heinmann, 1967): 816‚Äì21. Hitler Still frames of Adolf Hitler during a speech show his use of emotion and body language to convey his message. Adolf Hitler believed he could apply the lessons of propaganda he learned painfully from the Allies during World War I and apply those lessons to benefit Germany thereafter. The following points offer helpful insight into his thinking behind his on-stage performances: *Appeal to the masses: \\"[Propaganda] must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses\\", rather than the \\"scientifically trained intelligentsia.\\" *Target the emotions: \\"[Propaganda] must be aimed at the emotions and only to a very limited degree at the so-called intellect.\\" *Keep your message simple: \\"It is a mistake to make propaganda many-sided‚Ä¶The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous.\\" *Prepare your audience for the worst-case scenario: \\"[Prepare] the individual soldier for the terrors of war, and thus [help] to preserve him from disappointments. After this, the most terrible weapon that was used against him seemed only to confirm what his propagandists had told him; it likewise reinforced his faith in the truth of his government's assertions, while on the other hand it increased his rage and hatred against the vile enemy.\\" *Make no half statements: \\"‚Ä¶emphasize the one right which it has set out to argue for. Its task is not to make an objective study of the truth, in so far as it favors the enemy, and then set it before the masses with academic fairness; its task is to serve our own right, always and unflinchingly.\\" *Repeat your message constantly: \\"[Propagandist technique] must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over. Here, as so often in this world, persistence is the first and most important requirement for success.\\"Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, trans. Ralph Manheim (Mariner Books, 1998): 176‚Äì186. (Gustave Le Bon believed that messages that are affirmed and repeated are often perceived as truth and spread by means of contagion. \\"Man, like animals, has a natural tendency to imitation. Imitation is a necessity for him, provided always that the imitation is quite easy\\", wrote Le Bon.Le Bon, Book II, Chapter 4. In his 1881 essay \\"L'Homme et Societes\\", he wrote \\"It is by examples not by arguments that crowds are guided.\\" He stressed that in order to influence, one must not be too far removed his audience nor his example unattainable by them. If it is, his influence will be nil.Gustave Le Bon, \\"L'Homme et Societes\\", vol. II. (1881): 116.\\" The Nazi Party in Germany used propaganda to develop a cult of personality around Hitler. Historians such as Ian Kershaw emphasise the psychological impact of Hitler's skill as an orator.Ian Kershaw, Hitler: A Biography (2008) pp 105-5. Neil Kressel reports, \\"Overwhelmingly ... Germans speak with mystification of Hitler's 'hypnotic' appeal\\". Roger Gill states: \\"His moving speeches captured the minds and hearts of a vast number of the German people: he virtually hypnotized his audiences\\". Hitler was especially effective when he could absorb the feedback from a live audience, and listeners would also be caught up in the mounting enthusiasm. He looked for signs of fanatic devotion, stating that his ideas would then remain \\"like words received under an hypnotic influence.\\"F.W. Lambertson, \\"Hitler, the orator: A study in mob psychology.\\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 28#2 (1942): 123-131. onlineYaniv Levyatan, \\"Harold D. Lasswell's analysis of Hitler's speeches.\\" Media History 15#1 (2009): 55-69. Applications =Politics= Barack Obama accepts the Democratic nomination for president The political process provides ample opportunity to utilize crowd-manipulation techniques to foster support for candidates and policy. From campaign rallies to town-hall debates to declarations of war, statesmen have historically used crowd manipulation to convey their messages. Public opinion polls, such as those conducted by the Pew Research Center and www.RealClearPolitics.com provide statesmen and aspiring statesmen with approval ratings, and wedge issues. =Business= WWF superstar Hulk Hogan works a crowd during a televised wrestling match. The Penn State Nittany Lion warming up a crowd of 100,000+ college football fans. Ever since the advent of mass production, businesses and corporations have used crowd manipulation to sell their products. Advertising serves as propaganda to prepare a future crowd to absorb and accept a particular message. Edward Bernays believed that particular advertisements are more effective if they create an environment which encourages the purchase of certain products. Instead of marketing the features of a piano, sell prospective customers the idea of a music room.Bernays, 19-20. The entertainment industry makes exceptional use of crowd manipulation to excite fans and boost ticket sales. Not only does it promote assembly through the mass media, it also uses rhetorical techniques to engage crowds, thereby enhancing their experience. At Penn State University-University Park, for example, PSU Athletics uses the Nittany Lion mascot to ignite crowds of more than 100,000 students, alumni, and other visitors to Beaver Stadium. Among the techniques used are cues for one side of the stadium to chant \\"We are...\\" while the other side responds, \\"Penn State!\\" These and other chants make Beaver Stadium a formidable venue for visiting teams who struggle to call their plays because of the noise.J. Douglas Toma, Football U.: Spectator Sports in the Life of the American University (University of Michigan Press, 2003): 51-2. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) employs crowd manipulation techniques to excite its crowds as well. It makes particular use of the polarizing personalities and prestige of its wrestlers to draw out the emotions of its audiences. The practice is similar to that of the ancient Roman gladiators, whose lives depended upon their ability to not only fight but also to win crowds.Rachael Hanel, Gladiators (Mankato, MN: The Creative Company, 2007): 24. High levels of enthusiasm are maintained using lights, sounds, images, and crowd participation. According to Hulk Hogan in his autobiography, My Life Outside the Ring, \\"You didn't have to be a great wrestler, you just had to draw the crowd into the match. You had to be totally aware, and really in the moment, and paying attention to the mood of the crowd.\\"Hulk Hogan and Mark Dagostino, My Life Outside the Ring (New York, NY: Macmillan, 2009): 119-120. =Flash mobs= A flash mob pillow fight breaks out in Warsaw in 2009 A flash mob is a gathering of individuals, usually organized in advance through electronic means, that performs a specific, usually peculiar action and then disperses. These actions are often bizarre or comical‚Äîas in a massive pillow fight, ad- hoc musical, or synchronized dance. Bystanders are usually left in awe and/or shock. The concept of a flash mob is relatively new when compared to traditional forms of crowd manipulation. Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, is credited with the concept. He organized his first flash mob in a Macy's department store in 2003. The use of flash mobs as a tool of political warfare may take the form of a massive walkout during a political speech, the disruption of political rally, or even as a means to reorganize a crowd after it has been dispersed by crowd control. A first glance, a flash mob may appear to be the spontaneous undoing of crowd manipulation (i.e. the turning of a crowd against its manipulator). On September 8, 2009, for example, choreographer Michael Gracey organized‚Äîwith the help of cell phones and approximately twenty instructors‚Äîa 20,000+-person flash mob to surprise Oprah Winfrey during her 24th Season Kick-Off event. Following Oprah's introduction, The Black Eyed Peas performed their musical hit \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". As the song progressed, the synchronized dance began with a single, female dancer up front and spread from person to person until the entire crowd became involved. A surprised and elated Oprah found that there was another crowd manipulator besides her and her musical guests at work. Gracey and others have been able to organize and manipulate such large crowds with the help of electronic devices and social networks. But one does not need to be a professional choreographer to conduct such an operation. On February 13, 2009, for example, a 22-year-old Facebook user organized a flash mob which temporarily shut down London's Liverpool Street station. See also References Further reading *Alinsky, Saul.

These often feature serrated blades and wooden handles, and are the only sharp knife commonly found at the modern table. Specialized steak knives emerged in America following World War II. Prior to World War I, all table knives were sharp, but required frequent upkeep‚Äîsharpening and polishing. With the decline in domestic workers (household servants), this upkeep became less feasible. Stainless steel became widespread following World War I, which did not require polishing, but did require sharpening due to manufacturing limits. Following World War II, serrated stainless steel steak knives were introduced which required neither polishing nor frequent sharpening, and proved an instant hit. In the 1950s heat treatment of stainless steel was introduced, allowing knives to remain sufficiently sharp without needing serrations, but by this point serrated steak knives had become well-established and continued to be used. Origin In Medieval Europe, a sharp knife and hands were the only eating utensils, and portable sharp knives continue to be used to this day in rural Europe, as in the Laguiole knife in France. By contrast, in most of Asia and Africa, knives have long been a utensil used only in the kitchen (meat either being cut into pieces or cooked so that it could be pulled apart with the hands); with only hands, spoons, or chopsticks used at the table.

The division, with 15 schools having a total of about 3,800 students as of 2019, provides public education to the following central Alberta communities: the towns of Barrhead, Swan Hills, and Westlock, and the Village of Clyde, as well as the counties of Barrhead, Westlock, and Woodlands. Sections of Big Lakes County and Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124 to the southeast and south are also in this school district. History The division was created on January 1 1995 from the County of Barrhead No. 11 school district, Swan Hills School District No. 5109, and Westlock School Division No. 37, which combined into a single school district. It was established during a wave of school board amalgamations in Alberta, during the Progressive Conservative government of Ralph Klein. Pembina Hills Public Schools was the result of a voluntary merger of Westlock School Division No. 37, the educational component of the County of Barrhead No. 11 and Swan Hills School District No. 5109. Prior to that union, the Barrhead and Westlock areas had previously been part of a regional school division, Pembina School Division No. 37, which was split in 1947 into the Westlock and Barrhead School Divisions. In 1959, the Municipal District of Barrhead consolidated with the school district to form a county.

This event is mirrored by other similar events in other pre-Hispanic sites such as Chich√©n Itz√° and Malinalco, Mexico State. Observances In Teotihuacan, thousands of people visit for the event, many dressed in white with a red scarf or other accessory. Many dance, burn incense and chant but the defining ritual is to stand at the top of the Pyramid of the Sun, with arms outstretched facing the sun in the morning on the eastern horizon. Most climb this pyramid between 9am and 1pm. However, those who arrive early enough can see the sun rise over the Apan Mountains to the east of the Pyramid of the Sun, with its red rays coloring the landscape and the onlookers‚Äô clothing. Chanting and other clamor accompanies this sunrise as participants stand with arms outstretched. Some come because they believe they are following in the footsteps of their ancestors, in asking the gods for energy and health on this day. Some New Age sources claim that at the point of the equinox, man is at a unique place in the cosmos, when portals of energy open. Climbing the 360 stairs to the top of the Pyramid of the Sun is claimed to allow participants to be closer to this \\"energy\\". Popularity of the event It was estimated about more than a million people visited the site during the weekend on which the Northward equinox fell in 2010. Officially, the equinox occurred on Saturday, but many seemed assured that the energy was still present on Sunday. Due to the large crowds, access and activity at the site is severely restricted. The site is opened for the event from 6 am to 5pm, with visitors on this day entering through gates 1, 2 and 5 and leaving through gate 3. Commercial activity is restricted. Special scaffolding and security are placed on the pyramid on that day to assure a regular flow of people. Only the first level of the Pyramid of the Moon is accessible. Other areas such as the Palace of Quetzalcoatl, the Site Museum, the Citadel and others are all closed off, restricting visitors to the open areas of the Avenue of the Dead and the plazas around the two pyramids. The small mounds that line the Avenue of the Dead are reserved for police monitoring the crowds below. Ceremonies are restricted to the plazas next to the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon and prohibited on them. The normal parking lots of the site are closed on this day with parking restricted to private lots in the communities around the site. First aid for those who need it, often from the heat later in the day, is provided by the organizations such as the Mexican Red Cross and the state civil protection authority. Around 550 federal police are employed in the archeological zone for the event as well as numerous state and local enforcement for the surrounding communities. Archaeoastronomy of the site Although some are now closed off during the spring equinox, a number of the buildings at the Teotihuacan site show relationships with astronomy. Archaeoastronomy research has been undertaken at the site since the 1990s. The Palace of the Butterflies has circles on its walls created with reflective mica, which have been interpreted as representing astronomical bodies. It is very likely that the Palace of Quetzalcoatl functioned as a solar observatory. On the spring equinox, from between 7:15 and 7:45am when the sun rises, a shadow travels upwards along figures etched and painted red onto a battlement- like structure on the west wall. Some of the figures depicted are owls, a bird associated with darkness as well as rays of light. The symbolism is that of balance between light and dark. Birds also symbolize the stars. This structure is called an unxicalcoliuhqui, a type of fretwork that can also been seen at Chich√©n Itz√°. As with the Butterfly Palace, there are circles on the walls created with reflective mica. The first rays of the sun that stream across the landscape on the day of the spring equinox are broken on their way to Teotihuacan by an elevation called the Cerro Colorado Grande. Some believe that this point was used by the ancient people of Teotihuacan to mark the equinox. However, this would most likely have required the placement of the Pyramid of the Sun in a more northerly position, or that the Pyramid of the Moon played a more prominent role in spring equinox celebrations.

He collected and described plants from southern India, many of which were named after him by European botanists.  Life and work in India  Heyne was born in Germany and went to the Tranquebar Mission run by Moravians where he took an interest in the botanical garden. Through William Roxburgh he obtained a position in the Madras Presidency as a botanist at Samalkot around 1794. He was involved in introducing new food plants to overcome famines and these included potatoes and breadfruit. After the fall of Tipu Sultan, he was appointed to look for a new site for a botanical garden in Mysore and he chose Lalbagh. He moved many specimens from Samalkot to Lalbagh. He was formally titled \\"Naturalist and Botanist\\" in 1802. Heyne made an observation in 1815 that Bryophyllum calycinum was more acidic in taste in the morning than in the afternoon, among the earliest observations on Crassulacean acid metabolism. Geological map of the Circars, 1814. One of the oldest geological maps of India. Heyne married Charlotte Rebecca, daughter of L.C. Topander of Jaganaikepuram in May 1803. A mistress, Mrs Maria Clasina Heyne is recorded of having died at Hyderabad on 9 April 1809 while his wife Charlotte died in Bangalore on 29 July 1816. Heyne died at Vepery. Bangalore collections In 1800, after the fall of Mysore, the Lalbagh botanical garden at Bangalore was appropriated by the British East India Company \\"as a depository for useful plants sent from different parts of the country\\". Dr. Benjamin Heyne, the Company's botanist at Madras, was ordered by the Governor-General, Richard Wellesley to accompany the Surveyor, with the following instructions: \\"A decided superiority must be given to useful plants over those which are merely recommended by their rarity or their beauty,... to collect with care all that is connected with the arts and manufacturers of this country, or that promises to be useful in our own; to give due attention to the timber employed in the various provinces of his route,... and to collect with particular diligence the valuable plants connected with his own immediate profession, i.e. medicine.\\" An important task assigned to the colonial botanical gardens was dealing with malaria, the largest obstacle to colonial expansion. Heyne was placed in charge of the Lalbagh botanical garden till 1812. He did a great deal of collecting at Coimbatore and Bangalore and compiled a large collection of plant specimens which were forwarded to London. He collected more than 350 species from the Western Ghats and more than 200 species were named by him. He sent many of his Indian botanical specimens to the German botanist Albrecht Wilhelm Roth, whose work Novae plantarum species praesertim Indiae orientali (a book of Indian flora) is largely based on Heyne's botanical specimens. Mysore survey North West View of Nandydroog Benjamin Heyne was assistant to Francis Buchanan on his Mysore Survey. He recorded in his Journal, his visits to sites with Col. Colin Mackenzie : \\"To Sautgur Hill (near Conjeeveram) with Mackenzie. Of the Sienite, they made formerly Cannon balls of which many are found lying all over the Hill.\\" and at Nandydroog which was: \\"this morning cloathed with a white fog, when the rest of the country was Clear. The country hereabouts pretty well cultivated. Yesterday morning was with Capt. Mackenzie in the Fort, in which the houses, very few excepted, were empty. The garden in it that was formerly famous is entirely neglected and nothing in it worth attention but a few apple and coffee Trees.\\" Dr. Benjamin Heyne died at Madras in 1819.

The international flight originated in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in Amsterdam, Netherlands and made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Detroit, Michigan, United States. All 290 people aboard the flight, including Abdulmutallab, survived, though he and several others sustained injuries, most of them minor. After being released from a local hospital, Abdulmutallab was indicted by a federal grand jury on six criminal counts. As a result of the attack, travelers faced increased security and other effects, while the U.S. government saw a backlash to its handling of national security and the incident. Criminal charges Prison grounds at Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, where Abdulmutallab was incarcerated On December 26, a criminal complaint was filed against Abdulmutallab in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, charging him with two counts: placing a destructive device in, and attempting to destroy, a U.S. civil aircraft. The U.S. Attorney's Office assigned to the case federal prosecutors Jonathan Tukel (chief of the counter-terrorism unit) and Eric Straus (former chief of the same unit). Abdulmutallab was arraigned and officially charged by U.S. District Court Judge Paul D. Borman later the same day at the University of Michigan Hospital. On January 6, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal counts including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder. \\"Not guilty\\" pleas were entered on the behalf of Abdulmutallab at the hearing. The charges carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment plus 90 years. He faced his first court hearing, a detention hearing, on January 8, 2010. A former federal prosecutor told the Detroit News that \\"there's no chance of getting this guy bond in a million years\\". When asked about his decision to prosecute Abdulmutallab in federal court rather than have him detained under the law of war, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder defended his position, saying that it was \\"fully consistent with the long-established and publicly known policies and practices of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the United States Government as a whole,\\" and that he was confident that Abdulmutallab would be successfully prosecuted under the federal criminal law. Holder had originally been asked by U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, as well as several others, about his choice on January 26, 2010. The response was sent in a February 3 letter to McConnell and the others. On February 16, 2012, Abdulmutallab, who had pleaded guilty but remained unrepentant, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is currently incarcerated at the ADX Florence supermax prison, near Florence, Colorado.  Governments  = Effect on travel = The U.S. government did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack. However, the Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be in place for the remainder of the Christmas travel period. The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports. On December 28 Transport Canada announced that for several days it would not allow passengers flying to the U.S. from Canada a carry-on bag, with some exceptions.\\"Canada limits carry-on baggage on flights into U.S.\\", CNN, December 29, 2009.

Other European countries increased baggage screening, pat-down searches, and random searches for passengers traveling to the U.S. A spokesperson for the Dutch airport used by the attacker said that heightened security would be in place for \\"an indefinite period\\". However, in spite of the extra measures said to have been put in place to prevent a follow-up attack, Stuart Clarke, a photoreporter from the British newspaper Daily Express claimed to have smuggled a syringe containing fluid, and which could have contained a liquid bomb detonator onto another plane. On January 3, 2010, Clarke said he boarded a jet from Schiphol Airport bound for Heathrow Airport just five days after the Christmas Day terror attack, and that the airport appeared to have imposed no additional security, such as precautionary pat-downs which could easily have discovered the syringe which he claimed he kept in his jacket pocket throughout.Jarvis, David. \\"Plane crazy: we carry a syringe on jet at terror airport\\", January 3, 2010, The Daily Express.

White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said several times on Sunday talk shows that \\"the system had worked\\", a statement that engendered some controversy. The next day they retracted the statement, saying that the system had in fact \\"failed miserably.\\" According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of every flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen. Napolitano had originally stated on This Week that \\"once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork\\" and that \\"once the incident occurred, the system worked\\". The day after the attack, the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee both announced that they would hold hearings in January 2010 to investigate how the device passed through security, and whether further restrictions should be placed on air travel; the Senate hearings began on January 21.DeYoung, Karen, \\"Bombing reports start trickling in to Obama\\", The Washington Post, January 1, 2010, accessed January 2, 2010 Four days after the attack, Obama said publicly that Abdulmutallab's ability to board the aircraft was the result of a systemic failure that included an inadequate sharing of information among U.S. and foreign government agencies. He called the situation \\"totally unacceptable.\\" He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner. Two days later Obama received the briefing, which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines, and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack. Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. no-fly list, despite the government having received warnings about his potential al-Qaeda links.

Immediately near the lighthouse, is the emblematic baleia de pedra (whale rock), a curious geological basaltic rock that has resisted erosion, in the shape of a whale. The lighthouse includes a symmetrical single-floor building, and a high cylindrical tower that extends its lamp to above the ocean surface. It is considered a second-order lighthouse, which began operating on 1 February 1930. The lighthouse, denoted as 797 (Internationally recognized as D-2676) is equipped with a 3-order lenticular dioptric lamp with a focal distance, manufactured in 1927. Initially the beacon was produced by a mechanical system that rotated the incandescent lamp every 5 seconds, powered by a diesel engine (and with a butane reserve). History The Whale Islet, located in the northern coast, adjacent to the Ponta da Baraca Lighthouse The main tower of the lighthouse The General Plan for Lighthouses of 1883, documents the necessity of installing a lighthouse on top of Pico Negro, a volcanic cone located to the southeast of Ponta da Barca. Difficulties in accessibility and problems with the geomorphology of the area brought the planners to the conclusion that Ponta da Barca would be a more suitable alternative (although the interposition of Pico Negro did not permit some visibility from Ponta da Barca). The new selection, was acceptable to the Comiss√£o dos Far√≥is e Balizas (Commission on Lighthouses and Beacons), which concluded in 1902 that although the economically small lighthouse would be able to support ships travelling from the north. Although included in the 1883 Lighthouse Plan, and its location selected in 1902, it was not until 1927 when the equipment, optics and lantern were purchased from France (for 804,200 francs). The lighthouse was constructed in 1930, with beacon began functioning along Ponta da Barca on 1 February 1930 (purchased by Barbier, B√©nard & Turenne) using a third-order diotropic optical system, with a focal distance of . Isolated in the northwest coast of Graciosa, a road was constructed in 1935 by the District Government of Angra do Hero√≠smo to link the lighthouse to Santa Cruz (supported by 6000$00 escudos from Lighthouse Commission). The original lighthouse building had initially consisted of two living quarters for the lighthouse keepers. After 1952 a third space, and then a fourth were added, in order support four lighthouse keepers. The lighthouse was electrified in 1958, with the mounting of two groups of generators, with the beacon being upgraded to an incandescent 3000 Watts/110 Volt lamp, with a range of : the diesel supported incandescent lamp was placed on reserve. In the 1980s, the lamp was substituted for a 1000 Watt bulb, at 120 Volts, but reducing the luminosity to . The lighthouse joined the municipal power-grid in 1999, and services became automated through DF model system. The lighthouse is today the tallest tower in the Azores, in an intemperate zones; in 1978 an intense lightning storm caused large damage in the lighthouse and lighthouse keeper's quarters. The 1 January 1980 earthquake caused damage to the lighthouse with landslides occurring around the clifftop: its beacon continued to function.

A California sea lion swims by in the background. The aureole effect or water aureole is an optical phenomenon similar to Heiligenschein, creating sparkling light and dark rays radiating from the shadow of the viewer's head. This effect is seen only over a rippling water surface. The waves act as lenses to focus and defocus sunlight: focused sunlight produces the lighter rays, while defocused sunlight produces the darker rays. Suspended particles in the water help make the aureole effect more pronounced. The effect extends a greater angular distance from the viewer's shadow when the viewer is higher above the water, and can sometimes be seen from a plane. Although the focused (light) ray cones are actually more or less parallel to each other, the rays from the aureole effect appear to be radiating from the shadow of the viewer‚Äôs head due to perspective effects. The viewer's line of sight is parallel and lies within the cones, so from the viewer's perspective the rays seem to be radiating from the antisolar point, within the viewer's shadow. As in similar antisolar optical effects (such as a glory or Heiligenschein), each observer will see an aureole effect radiating only from their own head‚Äôs shadow. Similarly, if a photographer holds their camera at arm's length, the aureole effect appearing in the picture will be seen radiating from the shadow of the camera, although the photographer would still see it around their head's shadow while taking the picture. This happens because the aureole effect always appears directly opposite the sun, centered at the antisolar point. The antisolar point itself is located within the shadow of the viewer, whatever this is: the eyes of the viewer or the camera's lens.

Observations The Council recognised that there was no purely military solution to the situation in Afghanistan and reiterated its support to the Afghan people in rebuilding their country. Support was given to the Afghanistan Compact, Afghanistan National Development Strategy and National Drugs Control Strategy. It was stressed that the central role of the United Nations in Afghanistan was promoting peace and stability by leading the efforts of the international community. The Council also welcomed the continued commitment of the international community to support the stability and development of the country, particularly those that were increasing civilian and humanitarian efforts to assist the Government of Afghanistan and its people. The resolution stressed the need for a transparent, credible and democratic process in the lead up to the 2010 parliamentary elections. The Council also recognised the interconnected nature of the challenges in Afghanistan with regards to progress on security, governance, human rights, the rule of law and development, as well as the issues of anti‚Äëcorruption, counter-narcotics and transparency. The need for greater co-operation between UNAMA and International Security Assistance Force was noted, with respect to Resolution 1890 (2009). Also important to the Council was the humanitarian situation in the country and the delivery and co- ordination of humanitarian assistance, while all attacks against humanitarian workers. Concern was expressed at the security situation in the country in particular the increased violent and terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al- Qaeda, illegally armed groups, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade. Acts UNAMA's mandate, as set out in resolutions 1662, 1746 and 1806, was extended until March 23, 2011. It was also guided by the principle of reinforcing Afghan ownership with a particular focus on: :(a) promoting more coherent international support for the Government's development and governance priorities; :(b) strengthening co-operation with international security forces as recommended in a report by the Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon; :(c) providing political outreach and good offices to support the implementation of the Afghan-led reconciliation and reintegration programmes; :(d) supporting as well as taking into account progress on electoral reform commitments agreed at the London Conference in January 2010; :(e) working in co-operation with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to promote humanitarian efforts. It also stressed the importance of strengthening and expanding the presence of UNAMA and other United Nations entities, and encouraged the Secretary-General to continue his current efforts to take measures to address the security issues associated with such strengthening and expansion.

Mis hear errors are recorded when an ATCO fails to detect and correct an incorrect pilot R/T read back which is audible. These errors are more common at ATC centres with high R/T workload. ;Correct pilot readback followed by incorrect action: The pilot readback the controllers instruction correctly however performed an incorrect action (e.g., climbed to incorrect FL). Some events in this category will involve occasions where crews have received a clearance to a level which is known to cause confusion such as FL100/FL110 or FL200/220. The UK have introduced non-standard R/T phraseology to overcome this difficulty but the problem is still with us; in 2004 there are 8 recorded occasions where a crew have correctly acknowledged a descent clearance to FL110 but have then descended to FL100. Other events will involve a breakdown in cockpit SOPs; It is not fully understood why this type of event occurs but it is possible that high R/T loading, high cockpit workload and communication issues are all contributory factors. ;Incorrect pilot readback by correct aircraft: The pilot's readback of the controller instruction was erroneous (e.g., wrong level) ;Pilot readback by incorrect aircraft: A pilot read back an instruction that had been issued to another aircraft. ;Failed to follow cleared SID: The pilot failed to follow comply with the level restrictions include in a SID. Failed to follow cleared SID is a particular issue with departures from Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton although other airports are affected. Gatwick, Stansted and Luton all have step climb SIDs and these errors normally involve an aircraft failing to stop at the first stop altitude. ;Altimeter setting error: The crew did not have the correct pressure set. Altimeter setting error is a problem mainly reported in the London TMA, 80% of the errors occur when the aircraft is in the climb, is above the transition altitude/level and the standard pressure setting isn't set. ;Poor manual handling: The pilot's manual flying of the aircraft led to aircraft failing to comply with clearance. ;Aircraft technical problem: Technical problems exist with the aircraft ;Failure to follow ATC instruction: The pilot did not comply with an ATC instruction (e.g., the aircraft failed to hold when instructed). Accidents and serious incidents involving level bust * 12 November 1996, an Il-76 collided in mid air with a Saudi B747 near New Delhi India, following a level bust by the Il-76. * 12 November 1996, a B737 descended below its assigned holding level in the LHR stack, in IMC, to within 100 feet vertically and between 680 and 820 metres horizontally of an MD-81 at its correct level.

A Catholic force under F√©ilim √ì N√©ill laid siege to the town but failed to wrest the garrison from the Royalists. During the siege, the Irish rebels made three attempts to break into and capture the town. All three attempts failed and the town was ultimately relieved by English forces.Quaile.Plant Background After the Irish rebellion began on 22 October 1641, the rebels first attempted to move into Ulster and capture Belfast. When they met stiff resistance from Protestant militias in Ulster, the rebels turned their focus southward with the goal of taking Dublin. En route to attack Dublin, the rebels came upon the town of Drogheda, and laid siege to the Royalist stronghold. Assaults during the siege Early in November, Lord Moore of Mellifont had become concerned about the defense of Drogheda and had stepped in to make preliminary improvements. Among the actions that he took were to procure four guns and gunpowder from a merchant ship on the nearby River Boyne. He transferred the guns to the town and placed them on Mill Mount. Lord Moore then put the people of Drogheda to work reinforcing weak points in the city walls. Through appeal to the Lord Justices in Dublin, he was then able to secure a commission to enroll and equip 120 citizens of Drogheda as a military troop at the expense of the State. Lord Moore's actions and concerns eventually convinced the Lord Justices to appoint Sir Henry Tichborne as the Governor of Drogheda. On November 8, Sir Tichborne set out for Drogheda taking with him 1,000 reinforcements. After the arrival of the reinforcements, the military complement of the garrison at Drogheda had reached approximately 1,660.Hamilton, pp. 168-169 Because the rebel force had no artillery with which to breach the walls of Drogheda, they surrounded the town hoping to starve the Royalists into submission. As the garrison continued to hold out throughout the four month siege, the rebels attempted to attack the walls and break into the city in a conventional manner. The rebels attempted three assaults on the town. On the first occasion the rebels simply rushed the walls. In the second attempt, a small party of 500 men broke into the town at night through dilapidated sections of the walls, with the aim of opening the gates for a storming party of 700 men outside. However, the initial incursion was repulsed in confused fighting and, in the morning, the garrison opened the gates to rebels outside, only to take them prisoner once they entered the town. In early March 1642 when relief was imminent, the rebels tried a final assault attacking the walls with scaling ladders, but were again repulsed.Nicholas, p. 68. Aftermath Shortly afterwards, English reinforcements arrived from Dublin, under Colonel Moore, who was later created the Earl of Drogheda. The English army broke the siege and drove the Irish forces back to Ulster.Nicholas, p. 81. A second, more famous siege of Drogheda took place later during the war in 1649, when Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army took the town and massacred its Royalist and Irish Confederate garrison.

He was a tax collector at Monterey in 1843, and one of the prime movers in the movement against Manuel Micheltorena 1844. Ch√°vez was the grantee of the eleven square league Rancho Cienega del Gabilan 1843Marjorie Pierce,1981, East of the Gabilans, Western Tanager Press, and the three square league Rancho Pleyto in 1845. He took part as Lieutenant in various military operations in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846. He was sent by Jos√© Castro to John C. Fr√©mont's camp at Gavilan Peak. Later he kidnapped Thomas O. Larkin and was second in command at the Battle of Natividad, where he was wounded. He returned to Mexico in 1848. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

It was built to be a horse racing facility and it held single races in NASCAR Grand National Series, AAA, and USAC Stock cars before it was demolished. It opened as the Las Vegas Jockey Club. History =Construction= Joseph M. Smoot hitched a ride from lawyer Hank Greenspun to get from New York City to Las Vegas. He claimed to have helped build tracks in California and Florida which turned out to be untrue. The track was built to be a major horse racing facility on the south side of Las Vegas. Smoot funded the track by convincing 8000 shareholders to give him $2 million. \\"Old Joe knew a track wouldn't have a chance and he said so when he came here in 1946,\\" Greenspun later said in his biography. After the construction was delayed well past its original opening date, Smoot published an apology in a local newspaper. Smoot and two others were charged with felony embezzlement after he could not provide receipts for missing $500,000. A trustee was appointed by a federal judge to run the track. Smoot remained indicted until he was found dead in a hotel room two years later. =Horse racing= On September 4, 1953 the track was opened named the Las Vegas Jockey Club. Ticket booths and tote boards did not work properly and only one entrance discouraged customers. Customers had to wait one hour in traffic to park and some went home without attending. 8200 customers attended in the first day and the board of directors closed the track for two weeks after the third day to replace the ticket booths. The track was rapidly losing money, so the board closed after operating 13 days. It opened back up in 1954 to host quarter horse racing but closed after seven weeks. =Auto Races= Three major auto racing event were held on the track. In 1954, an American Automobile Association (AAA) Champ Car event was held at the track, followed by a 1955 NASCAR Grand National race. The final race was a United States Auto Club (USAC) Stock Car event in 1959. Championship car The American Automobile Association held its final Indy Car race of the 1954 season on November 14.

He competed in the United States Auto Club (USAC) Stock Cars in the 1950s through 1970s. He won the season championship in 1960, 1965, and 1966 as a driver. Nelson also won five owner's championships. He competed in five NASCAR Grand National Series events and won one. He had 35 USAC victories including 11 at the Milwaukee Mile near his hometown Racine, Wisconsin. He was nicknamed \\"The Great Dane\\" because he was 6 feet 4 inches tall. Racing career =Early career= Nelson prepared for racing when, as a 14-year-old, he borrowed his sister's 1934 Chevrolet and he raced it on the back streets of Racine. He competed for the first time on a rainy 1939 afternoon race in a swampy field near Pleasant Prairie. His first race ended when his jalopy got stuck on the straightaway. He continued in the car until the 1940-41 winter indoor series, when he got a ride in a midget car at the Chicago Amphitheater. He ended up driving the midget into the wall in the first corner. Racing in the United States ended for World War II and he served the United States Army. After the war ended, he returned to successfully race midget cars. He stopped racing midgets in favor of late model stock cars so he could race more frequently. Nelso had been introduced to stock car racing in 1948 when Milwaukee promoter Tom Marchese brought stock cars to the region. Nelson said \\"Once I got into stock car racing, I knew that it was for me. I couldn't get into just any midget. We always had to make special ones for me.\\" He raced in his first stock car race on the dirt of the Milwaukee Mile in 1948 and finished third in the event. =USAC= In 1950, Nelson was racing the American Automobile Association (AAA) Stock Car division in its first season and was leading the national points going into the final race at the Springfield Mile. Second-place driver Jay Frank was the only driver who could catch him in the points and he had to win while Nelson had to not finish the race. \\"That's exactly what happened\\", Nelson said. \\"The engine on my Oldsmobile blew and he won the race.\\" Earlier that season he lost all of his points earned for winning a race at Milwaukee after USAC determined he had used an illegal gear. He was using a special mountain gear in his Oldsmobile; he pointed out (to no avail) that the part can be found in a parts catalog. He continued to race in AAA Stock Car races in 1952, 1953, and 1954 - collecting top five finishes at Toledo Raceway Park, Dayton Speedway, Illiana Speedway, and Milwaukee. Nelson joined up with Carl Kiekhaefer's Chrysler team in 1955. He won a 1955 stock car race at the Milwaukee Mile and blew his right front tire right after winning the race causing the car to skid into the walls. Nelson's crew had done their pit stop in 1 minute and second-place finisher Marshall Teague had a 1-minute and 40 seconds stop. He raced at Wilmot Speedway in Kenosha in 1959 and won the track's modified stock class. He returned to driving on the national tour and finished third in 1958 and 1959. For the first time in his career, Nelson drove in someone else's car when Bill Trainor hired him to race. He won a race at the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack and had several second-place finishes during his 1960 championship season. He added a win in the Midwest Association for Race Cars (MARC), the forerunner to ARCA in a race under dual sanction with USAC. Beginning in 1963, Nelson hired Jerry Kulwicki (Alan Kulwicki's father) to build engines for his race cars. Nelson began his 25th season of racing in 1965 by winning the season-opening USAC Stock Car race at Milwaukee over Paul Goldsmith. Nelson took the lead away from Parnelli Jones when his engine blew up late in the race. Three NASCAR drivers competed in the event - Richard Petty, David Pearson, and Bobby Isaac. Nelson won the Yankee 300 race at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1965 which contributed toward him winning his second driver's championship that season. Nelson won the 150-mile event at Langhorne Speedway in 1966 and he won his third season championship. He also won his second straight Yankee 300 at IRP. When Nelson retired from driving in 1976 because of detached retina, he was tied with A. J. Foyt for second on the all-time USAC victories list with 35 wins. =NASCAR= Nelson made five starts in his Grand National career. He made his first start at the 1955 LeHi 300 in LeHi, Arkansas and won his only NASCAR race later that season after starting on the pole position at the only NASCAR race held at the 1-mile dirt Las Vegas Park Speedway. While driving for Carl Kiekhaefer's championship team, he led the final 106 laps of a 111 lap race which was shortened from its original 200 lap distance because of darkness. He competed in three more NASCAR races, once each in 1966, 1967, and 1968. Owner Nelson-owned USAC Stock Car driven by Roger McCluskey Even before Nelson's career began to wind down, he began having other racers drive in his USAC car. He hired Roger McCluskey to drive for him in 1968, starting a two-car operation as Nelson began to wind down his career. In 1975, McCluskey had to miss a race because he had a burned foot; Nelson drove the car for him. Other drivers include A. J. Foyt. Nelson's cars started in 13 NASCAR; nine of these races ended in a Top 10 finish. Jim Hurtubise drove Nelson's only win as a car owner at Atlanta International Raceway. Personality Nelson was known for saving his equipment until the latter stages of a race. Alan Kulwicki said, \\"I can remember guys like A. J. Foyt and Parnelli Jones drove against him, and Norm wasn't as much a charger as those guys, but he was always there at the end of a race. Because he owned his own cars, he didn't run them as hard as those other guys did.\\" Kulwicki added, \\"He was a good, smooth driver and very intelligent.\\" Personal life Nelson and his wife Caroline had eight children. He also had 15+ grandchildren. During the racing off-season, he owned a snowmobile sales and repair shop in Racine called \\"Nelson Enterprises\\". Caroline and several of their children worked at the shop. Death Nelson died on November 8, 1988 while at the Zablocki Veterans Administration Center at age 65 and he was buried at the Graceland Cemetery in Racine.

The division raced nationally; drivers from USAC's open wheel classes like Indy cars, Silver Crown, sprints, and midgets frequently competed in races and won championships. Several NASCAR drivers raced in USAC Stock Cars at various points in their careers. In the late 1950s, USAC Stock Cars rivaled NASCAR stock cars with races throughout the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. NASCAR owners Holman-Moody found racing in USAC Stock Cars to be appealing because of USAC's ties to the Indianapolis 500. History The stock car class began as a division of the AAA Contest Board. AAA decided to stop sanctioning all racing classes after Bill Vukovich's death at the 1955 Indianapolis 500 was followed closely by the 1955 Le Mans disaster. USAC took over sanction in all of their classes starting in 1956. USAC continued to sanction the Stock Car division until 1984 but the series had lost some luster as the events were frequently co- sanctioned with ARCA. The final championship in 1984 was scheduled for three races but only two were run (Springfield and DuQuoin). The third event, part of the 4 Crown Nationals at Eldora Speedway, was rained out and not rescheduled. After the division ended, many of the drivers moved to other Midwestern series such as the American Speed Association (ASA), ARCA, and ARTGO. Tracks USAC Stock Cars raced on dirt tracks, asphalt ovals and road courses. The Milwaukee Mile was regularly on the schedule. The variety of tracks included the dirt at DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack's oval, Indianapolis Raceway Park's asphalt oval, and the asphalt circle at Langhorne Speedway. The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb was even a stop on the schedule during some seasons.

Levin Early Life Growing up in an uneducated family of Jewish-Russian descent, Levin was accepted by Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1940 at the age of sixteen, after skipping two grades at Newton High School in Queens, New York. However, his family found it unaffordable and considered him too young for such a large institution. He partially worked his way through high school and college as a jazz pianist/arranger and later attended Harvard Law School as a Carnegie Fellow in Law and Economics.Hofstra University Archives Faculty Collection: Harvey J.

According to his colleagues, he was several decades ahead of his time in addressing the economic ramifications of the radio spectrum, long before others were concerned with the airwaves as a resource.Resources, \\"RFF Redux: Revisiting The Invisible Resource ‚Äì Use and Regulation of the Radio Spectrum\\", Fall 1996 issueResources, \\"Reflections\\", Molly K.

Career In 1993, Grosso's monologue Mama Don't was produced by the Royal Court Young People's Theatre and put on at the Commonwealth Institute, London. It was directed by Roxanna Silbert. A year later, his first stage play, Peaches, was produced by the Royal Court Theatre in association with the Royal National Theatre Studio and put on at the Royal Court Theatre, London. It starred Ben Chaplin. According to Michael Billington, the season in which Peaches appeared (which also included Blasted by Sarah Kane) defined the historical importance of the Theatre Upstairs, a season of new writing masterminded by Stephen Daldry. In 1996, Grosso's second stage play, Sweetheart, was produced by the Royal Court Theatre and put on at the Royal Court Theatre, London, before embarking on a regional tour. It starred Kate Beckinsale. In 1998, Grosso's third stage play, Real Classy Affair, was produced by the Royal Court Theatre and put on at the Ambassadors Theatre, London.

Since then, the Hampstead Theatre in London has produced and put on three young people's plays by Grosso. In 2004, Grosso directed his monologue Killing Paul McCartney at the Assembly Rooms at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was produced by David Johnson and performed by Jake Wood. The same year, Grosso was invited to participate in the inaugural 24 Hour Plays at the Old Vic Theatre, London, hosted by artistic director Kevin Spacey.

It was the first 3-D film produced in Japan, and, according to Allmovie, the world's first 3-D sex film. Synopsis A madman is on the loose, raping and murdering women and sometimes engaging in necrophilia. After one woman manages to flee the criminal before he has killed her, she goes to the police for help in bringing him to justice. The criminal targets the woman for murder. Cast * Setsu Shimizu (the woman) * Sh≈´hei Mut≈ç (the rapist) * K≈çhei Tsuzaki (the policeman) * Keisuke Akitsu. * mari nagisa Critical appraisal and background On a technical level, Perverted Criminal is notable for being Japan's first 3-D film. Allmovie writes that it was also the first 3-D sex film in the world, however, in the chapter \\"Sexploitation Films\\" in the book Incredibly Strange Films, Jim Morton writes that Jack H. Harris, producer of The Blob (1958), made the first 3-D sexploitation film with Paradisio (1962). Perverted Criminal was shot in the \\"part-color\\" format common with pink films of this period, with only a few scenes shot in color. In the case of Perverted Criminal, rather than sex scenes, it is the murder scenes, coupled with the 3-D effects, which are given the lurid emphasis of color. In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser compare Perverted Criminal to later 3-D sex films such as The Stewardesses (1969), and describe Perverted Criminal as \\"a considerably more violent and sleazy venture than any of the international 3-D erotica which followed\\". Allmovie also judges the film a \\"gruesome affair\\" and a \\"sordid sleazefest\\". The star of Perverted Criminal, Setsu Shimizu, had first come to prominence for her leading role in director Shin'ya Yamamoto's Nihon Cinema pink film, Torture by a Woman (1967). Prior to this breakout performance, she had been cast in supporting roles in various pink films for directors such as Giichi Nishihara and Perverted Criminal's K≈çji Seki. She later starred in Kin'ya Ogawa's 1968 horror film for ≈åkura Studio, Ghost Story Of Barabara Phantom.Weisser, p. 439. Director Seki's 1969 film Abnormal Sex Crimes was a remake of Perverted Criminal. Mari Nagisa, who had a role in Perverted Criminal, starred as the victim in this remake, and K≈çhei Tsuzaki was the rapist.

Both lakes are gradually being destroyed by siltation, caused by development upstream in Roswell. The city sued in 2005. The developers contested their liability and claim the lakes have likely out-lived their \\"life expectancy\\", and the situation is likely caused by the natural flow of silt and sediment in the basin.

Lurie is a 2014 MacArthur Fellow. Life When he was a student in the Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School, Lurie took part in the International Mathematical Olympiad, where he won a gold medal with a perfect score in 1994.. In 1996 he took first place in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search and was featured in a front-page story in the Washington Times.. Lurie earned his Bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard College in 2000 and was awarded in the same year the Morgan Prize for his undergraduate thesis on Lie algebras. He earned his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under supervision of Michael J. Hopkins, in 2004 with a thesis on derived algebraic geometry. In 2007, he became associate professor at MIT, and in 2009 he became professor at Harvard University.. In 2019, he joined the Institute for Advanced Study as a permanent faculty member in mathematics. Mathematical work Lurie's research interests started with logic and the theory of surreal numbers while he was still in high school. He is best known for his work, starting with his thesis, on infinity categories and derived algebraic geometry. Derived algebraic geometry is a way of infusing homotopical methods into algebraic geometry, with two purposes: deeper insight into algebraic geometry (e.g. into intersection theory) and the use of methods of algebraic geometry in stable homotopy theory. The latter area is the topic of Lurie's work on elliptic cohomology. Infinity categories (in the form of Andr√© Joyal's quasi- categories) are a convenient framework to do homotopy theory in abstract settings. They are the main topic of his book Higher Topos Theory. Another part of Lurie's work is his article on topological field theories, where he sketches a classification of extended field theories using the language of infinity categories (cobordism hypothesis). In joint work with Dennis Gaitsgory, he used his non-abelian Poincar√© duality in an algebraic-geometric setting, to prove the Siegel mass formula for function fields. Lurie was one of the inaugural winners of the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014, \\"for his work on the foundations of higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry; for the classification of fully extended topological quantum field theories; and for providing a moduli-theoretic interpretation of elliptic cohomology.\\" Lurie was also awarded a MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\" Fellowship in 2014.

The paper was biweekly, but due to publishing delays it generally came out about once every three weeks during its first year, and about once every 6 weeks thereafter.

Glessing, in The Underground Press in America (Indiana University Press, 1971) says that paid circulation was never more than 1200 copies. This may refer to mail subscriptions, but it was not uncommon for smaller underground papers to print thousands more copies than they could sell, because the economics of web press offset printing made it very cheap to have the printers run off a few thousand extra copies and then give them away as free samples or sell them later as back issues. Because they could not find an affordable printer in Jackson, Kudzu was forced to go to The Louisiana Weekly, a black newspaper in New Orleans, to get the paper printed. The paper had few advertisers and was financed mostly out of the pockets of the editors, who lost the small amount of financial support they were receiving from SSOC when that group disbanded in mid-1969.\\"The Kudzu: Birth and Death in Underground Mississippi\\" by David Doggett, in Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the Vietnam Era Underground Press ed. by Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press, 1993), p. 213-232.

Founded in 1890, it closed in 1958. History The Ohio Military Institute was established in 1890, on the foundation then known as Belmont College, and in the earlier days, as Farmers' College. The history of the college goes back almost to the beginnings of education in the West. Farmers' College was one of the first institutions of higher culture established beyond the mountains. It had a long and useful career. The roster contains the names of President Benjamin Harrison; Murat Halstead, the great editor; and Bishop John M. Walden, of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Farmers' College was begun perhaps a generation too soon for permanent success. The community had not yet accepted the concept that inspired the enterprise. To quote the language of a very old letter used in early materials, \\"The distinctive feature of Farmers' College is the practical character of its course of instruction * to qualify our youth for a higher position in any of the industrial pursuits.\\" The idea expressed is today the most powerful force directing the trend of thought in education. The history of Belmont College covers a period of transition, during which the older institution was returning gradually toward its source for the training of boys. The real progenitor of the Ohio Military Institute was Cary Academy, established in his own home on College Hill by Freeman Cary, in the year 1832. The Cary family were pioneers in this part of Ohio. The father came from New England to Cincinnati as early as 1802. A few years later he purchased a large farm on the present site of College Hill. There his two sons, Freeman G., the elder, and Samuel F., grew to manhood. Sisters Alice and Phoebe Cary, the well-known poete, lived nearby, in what is now North College Hill. Both the Cary boys were graduated from Miami University at Oxford, then in its infancy. Freeman's ambition was to become an educator, and upon his graduation, he opened an academy for boys at his home. The old house still stands, a well-known landmark of the village. Cary's Academy, when opened, received four pupils, but before the year closed the eager young scholar was teaching more than a score of boys. Mr. Cary was encouraged to build, on a plot of ground just in front of the present location of the school, a small brick school building. Shortly afterward he constructed a handsome addition. Meanwhile, the school increased readily in numbers, until during the last year of the old Academy, more than 120 students were in attendance. In the twelve years during which Mr. Cary conducted his school, some 1,200 boys from all parts of the West and the South came under his instruction. His Academy was, at that time, the leading private school west of the Allegheny Mountains. He was assisted in the work by an efficient corps of instructors, several of whom were very able men, who afterward became eminent educators. Probably most loved because of his personality, and the most revered and respected because of his work, was Dr. Robert H. Bishop. He came from Miami University to Cary Academy during its last year, He remained to fill the chair of Philosophy and History in the faculty of Farmers' College, Shortly before his death, in 1855, he requested that his body and that of his wife might find a last resting place on the College grounds. The letter begging this simple boon is one of the most precious archives of the College. In 1999, part of Cary's original school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name \\"Freeman Grant Cary Pleasant Hill Academy\\". Embracing his house and one other building, the designation was granted both because of the buildings' architecture and because of their connection to Cary, who was deemed a significant figure in local history.

The system consists of 12 hospitals, 200+ ambulatory sites, hospice, home health, medical equipment and other health services spanning 47 Ohio counties. As of May 2020, the organization has 35,000 physicians, associates, and volunteers, with more than $4.3 billion in net revenue. History =Early Beginnings= OhioHealth can trace its origins back to 1891, with the creation of Protestant Hospital Association, the fourth hospital in Columbus, and the first not associated with the Roman Catholic Church. In 1922, this hospital became White Cross Hospital, affiliated with the Ohio Methodist Episcopal Conference, but due to financial difficulty during the Great Depression, only the United Methodist Church was able to continue providing support. The hospital grew at a quick pace and in 1958 it broke ground on its current location at West North Broadway and Olentangy River Road. To reflect its new location, the hospital was named Riverside Methodist. White Cross continued operating under the same name at its Short North location into the 1970s. At its new location, Riverside Methodist grew at a rapid pace well into the 1980s, expanding into new fields of medicine all the time. =Formation of U.S. Health= In September 1984, amidst much change in the United States' healthcare system, U.S. Health Corporation of Columbus was formed to meet the demands of the changing healthcare environment. After much negotiating with the West Ohio Conference of the United Methodist Church, the hospital's sponsor, Riverside Methodist became a subsidiary of U.S. Health. In 1988, Mercy Hospital joined the U.S. Health network, and over time became Southern Ohio Medical Center, which eventually regained independent status. In 1986, Marion General Hospital joined the system, allowing U.S. Health to become one of the Midwest's largest health systems. In 1988, Grant Medical Center became a member. In 1992, Hardin Memorial Hospital joined the network as well. In 1997, after settling a lawsuit with US Healthcare Inc., of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, (now merged with Aetna), U.S. Health Corporation became OhioHealth. Reputation OhioHealth was named by Thomson Reuters as one of the 10 best healthcare systems in America three years in a row. OhioHealth also has been recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the ‚Äú100 Best Companies to Work For‚Äù from 2007 through 2018. In addition, U.S. News & World Report ranked Riverside Methodist Hospital's neuroscience program 38 out of 50 on its list of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Best Hospitals‚Äù for neurology and neurosurgery in 2015-2016. Services and clinical programs OhioHealth offers the following services and clinical programs: Cancer Care, Heart and Vascular, Neurosciences and Stroke, Orthopedics, Sports Medicine, Maternity and Women's Health, Bariatrics, and Trauma Services.

In 1912, three new premises were opened in Warwick Avenue, Smith Street and West Street along with their official crest and motto; Per Adua Ad Alta. Legislation of 1967 was a watershed for education in South Africa as it moved to provide exclusively for the needs of the white population group. Between 1953 and 1965, the provinces shed ‚Äòbantu‚Äô, ‚Äòcolored‚Äô and ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô education and become responsible for ‚Äòwhite‚Äô education only. In August 1991, the approval of the Certification Council for Technikon Education authorized Technikon Natal to issue its own certificates or diplomas to graduates, representing an important development for technikons. Due to the 1994 democratic elections, in 1995 for the first time on registration day, an applicant did not have to state his or her race or colour.

Publication history The Frederick von Frankenstein version of Riot first appeared in Superman: Man of Steel #61 and was created by Louise Simonson. Fictional character biographies =New Titans Riot= The first Riot appeared in New Titans #98. Frederick Von Frankenstein is the last of a long line of scientists in his family. His father put tremendous pressure on him to succeed in school and in the lab. The sheer volume of work proved too much for one man, so Freddy used his Uncle Hal's Phase Shifter to create duplicate copies of himself, trying to be the best at everything. During this time, he developed a means to allow himself to stick to virtually any surface, but the duplication process activated a metagene that had surfaced in him. He discovered that he can create clones of himself without a cloning machine. His face then resembled a skeleton. Having all the duplicates deprived him of sleep causing him to have insomnia. He was soon driven insane by it and turned to a life of crime under the alias of Riot.Superman: Man of Tomorrow #14. DC Comics. When Riot was committing a series of thefts from bio- tech facilities, he had his first encounter with Superman. Superman discovered that when he attacks Riot, Riot clones himself. Superman corralled all the Riot clones, but the real Riot got away.Superman: Man of Steel #61. DC Comics. Riot later resurfaces and steals photon fuel samples from S.T.A.R. Labs. He manages to evade Superman, but is caught by Morgan Edge as Riot hadn't cloned himself that time. Morgan had Anomaly beat up Riot until the cage was full. Riot was able to accept Morgan Edge's offer to join the Superman Revenge Squad alongside Maxima, Misa, Barrage, and Anomaly.Adventures of Superman #543. DC Comics. Despite the team's bickering, they managed to beat Superman to a stand-still.Action Comics #730. DC Comics. The Superman Revenge Squad quickly fell apart when all the members realized that Morgan Edge could not fulfill all the promises he made to them. Riot used the chaos to send his duplicates back to the Squad's lair. Morgan had further ensured his loyalty by keeping one copy behind, shackled with a device that prevented the others from integrating him. Riot freed his copy and slipped away, while Superman defeated the others.Superman: Man of Steel #65. DC Comics. Riot then plotted to steal a phase/time integrater that will enable him to stay together and get to sleep. When Superman came across him, he caused chaos and created a legion which crashed the tower that Lex Luthor was holding a party in. Riot's uncle Hal was present and told Lois about Riot's backstory. Superman stopped the S.C.U. from disturbing Riot until after he had reintegrated and fallen asleep. Once asleep, he was taken into custody. Riot was among the supervillains recruited/brainwashed by Manchester Black to take part in the \\"Ending Battle\\". Superman managed to defeat him easily.Adventures of Superman #608. DC Comics. Riot appears alongside Roxy Rocket and Doctor Phosphorus as part of an event arranged by Roulette to see which of them could defeat Batman. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl manage to defeat all of the villains, rendering the bet void.Batgirl #6. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Frederick had the ability to clone himself at will or when attacked. He can also reintegrate the clones into him at any time. Riot II can also stick to walls. One of Riot's most significant advantages in a fight is that the force of a blow delivered to one duplicate is dispersed across all of his currently-active duplicates; as a result, while Superman could theoretically knock Riot out if he struck the original Riot with a powerful enough punch at the start of the fight, with a dozen or more duplicates active at once, Superman's blows will fail to cause sufficient damage to render any of the Riot clones unconscious. However, his ability to duplicate when attacked has also been used against him, such as by confining him in a cage and then hitting him so many times that there are far too many clones in the cage for him to be comfortable. In other media The second Riot makes a very small appearance in the movie Superman/Batman Public Enemies. He is shown running away when Captain Atom's group arrives to apprehend Batman and Superman. The second Riot appears in the Superman Returns video game voiced by Peter Lurie. He and his clones cause trouble in the Hyper Sector of Metropolis. Superman manages to defeat them using his freezing breath and fists, and sends Riot back to Stryker's Island.

ECI provides development grants and international advocacy for community-building initiatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Background Affleck began to explore the possibility of becoming more actively involved in philanthropy in 2007 and was drawn to New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's coverage of human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo. During two 2008 trips, Affleck reported on the humanitarian crisis for ABC News Nightline and directed a short film, Gimme Shelter, for the UN Refugee Agency. He also spoke at the Combating Global Poverty event during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In 2009, he wrote an essay for Time,Chi, Paul.

Retrieved on June 5, 2014. spoke at the Global Leadership Awards, and served as an executive producer of the HBO documentary film Reporter, which focused on Kristof's work in the Congo. After five visits to eastern Congo between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck developed \\"a clearer sense of what I wanted to do... What I found was that the people doing the best work, with the real expertise, who understood what was needed intuitively, just like they would in my neighborhood, who knew who the guy was to talk to, were community-based organizations.\\" Aims In 2010, Affleck and Whitney Williams co-founded the Eastern Congo Initiative. Early investors included Howard Graham Buffett, Google, Laurene Powell Jobs, Pam Omidyar and Cindy McCain. ECI acts as a grant maker for Congolese-led, community-based organizations. ECI, with two employees in the US and 12 in the Congo, fundraises, makes grants and offers capacity-building support to over 20 charities. These local charities support survivors of rape and sexual violence, help to reintegrate child soldiers into their communities, promote economic opportunity, increase access to health care and education, and promote community-level peace and reconciliation. In an effort to create sustainable wealth, ECI offers training and resources to cooperatives of Congolese farmers while leveraging public-private partnerships. In 2010, ECI partnered cacao farmers with Seattle-based Theo Chocolate and, as of 2014, Theo is the biggest sourcer of cocoa beans in the Congo. In 2011, ECI began supporting coffee farmers to increase the quality and quantity of their crop production; Starbucks began exporting their coffee beans in 2015. House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights ECI also advocates with and on behalf of the people of eastern Congo to raise public awareness and drive policy change in the US. In an effort to achieve this goal, ECI has published a white paper and a USAID-supported landscape analysis and searchable database of over 400 of the most effective community-based organizations. Affleck has made nine media-documented trips to Central Africa since 2007 and has discussed ECI's work in many television interviews. In 2010, he wrote a column for The Washington Post, contributed an essay to The Enough Moment and appeared as a panelist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2011, Affleck and Cindy McCain, an ECI board member, testified before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights. Also in 2011, Affleck was a speaker at the Global Philanthropy Forum. In 2012, he spoke alongside Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Washington's Child Survival: Call to Action Forum and alongside Senator John McCain at the Sedona Forum. He wrote op-eds for The Washington Post and Politico. During the Kony 2012 campaign, Affleck wrote an essay for The Huffington Post. While welcoming increased awareness of the issue of child soldiers, he warned that Western 'saviours' are \\"ineffectual at best and deadly at worst\\" and stressed the importance of funding \\"remarkable local organisations.\\" Later in 2012, Affleck testified before the House Armed Services Committee and met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 2013, Affleck introduced the Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste at a TED conference and began developing an Africa-set film. Also that year, President of Rwanda Paul Kagame was photographed arriving at Affleck's Los Angeles home; Affleck had testified before Congress in 2012 about the Rwandese government's support of rebel groups in eastern Congo. In early 2014, he and US Special Envoy Russ Feingold testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and met with Secretary of State John Kerry. He also spoke at the Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards, where Denis Mukwege was honored. In 2015, Affleck testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Projects while, in early 2016, he was a speaker at the Starkey Expo.

Funk and Lincoln were also responsible for bringing the Chicago & Alton Railroad through Bloomington-Normal in McLean County, detouring it from its originally planned route through Peoria. Family founders in America Frederick Funk was born in Germany and emigrated from The Palatinate, a section of the Rhineland, to the United States on the Pink Mary in 1733. Like other immigrants, Funk was seeking religious freedom in his new country. During the voyage, Adam Funk was born to Frederick's wife Sarah (Moore), who died during childbirth. Adam Funk settled in Shenandoah County, Virginia near Strasburg. He married Sarah Long of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His son Adam Funk, Jr. was raised in Virginia. Some time around 1790, Adam Funk, Jr. moved to Clark County, Kentucky. In 1808, he removed to Fayette County, Ohio. Adam Funk, Jr. had at one time accumulated significant wealth, but he died poor. However, he was prolific in progeny: he and his wife had nine children‚Äîsix sons and three daughters. Family patriarch Isaac Funk The Funks and Stubblefields were among the first settlers in the county and put down roots in the area now known as Funks Grove, Illinois. In 1824, brothers Isaac and Absalom Funk, the sons of Adam Funk, Jr., moved to McLean County. Six months later in December 1824, Dorothy Funk Stubblefield and husband Robert Stubblefield followed from Ohio; Robert had earlier been widowed after being married to another Funk suster, Sarah, for 25 years. Their father Adam Funk Jr. arrived the same year; he chose the site of Funks Grove Cemetery, and in 1830 he was one of the first to be buried there. In 1826, Isaac married Cassandra Sharp, who eventually gave him 10 children. By the 1830s, the Funks were among the richest settlers in the area, but they lost half of their fortune in the Panic of 1837. Isaac and Absalom dissolved their partnership the following year, in 1838, after which Isaac continued to raise cattle and to slowly rebuild his fortune. In 1840, Isaac was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives and served a single two-year term. The Great Flood of 1844 again caused financial havoc, and Isaac once again rebuilt his finances. In 1862, he was appointed to fill the remaining Illinois Senate term of Richard J. Oglesby, who had resigned to fight in the Civil War; Isaac was re- elected to a second two-year term in 1864. From 1864 to 1865, Isaac Funk, Robert Stubblefield and their sons built the Funks Grove Church next to the cemetery from white pine shipped by railroad. Family businesses and charitable activities Isaac Funk raised livestock and drove it to market on foot and later served in the Illinois House and in the Illinois Senate; his sons and their descendants were mostly involved in banking, politics and agricultural businesses such as Funk Brothers Seed Company and seed farms. While in the state legislature, Isaac met and became a friend and supporter of Abraham Lincoln. While Isaac was away, his sons, led by eldest son George Washington Funk (called ‚ÄúThe General‚Äù by his siblings), took care of the farm. Like other pioneer American settlers, Isaac and his sons made maple sugar and maple sirup from the local sugar maples, which were plentiful in the area. His youngest son, Isaac II, took over the sirup production around 1860, when demand for maple sweeteners rose during the Civil War as Northerners used them in place of Southern cane sugar. Isaac II's son Arthur opened the first commercial maple sirup camp at Funks Grove in 1891. Isaac II's other son, Lawrence (Arthur's brother), took over the commercial operation in 1896. Marquis de LaFayette Funk Isaac II had a brother, Absalom Funk, named after their uncle Absalom, their father's brother. The younger Absalom's daughter, Hazel Funk Holmes, who was cousin to Arthur and Lawrence, took over the family sirup business during the early 1920s; she owned the property on which the sirup operation (Funks Grove Pure Maple Sirup) is now located and was the owner when U.S. Route 66 came through the area in November 1926. Hazel was the one who modernized the operation and ensured that the family business continued well into the future. Because Hazel's primary residence was still out East, however, she rented out her land to tenants who tapped the sugar maples every spring, made the sirup, and farmed the rest of the land, and she built a new sugarhouse to house a flue-pan evaporator. The little peaked cabin that Arthur and Lawrence had used as a cooking house was moved to its present location on the farm, where Hazel used it as a guesthouse and as her summer home. Hazel also protected her land for the future: in her will, she placed her timber and farmland in a trust, for use by the family maple sugaring business. In that same trust, she insisted that their product be forever called maple sirup, spelled with an 'i' -- as was the preferred spelling in Webster's at the time to indicate a pure maple product made only from boiled maple sap and untainted by other sweeteners or additional ingredients. Sirup production was temporarily halted in 1942 because of World War II‚Äîheavy taxes on sugar made the maple sugaring business unprofitable‚Äîbut production resumed the following year. In 1947, Lawrence's son Stephen Funk, a veteran airman of the war, and Stephen's wife, Glaida, took over the sirup operation. When during the early 1970s it looked like construction of Interstate 55 through McLean County would cut through the Funks Grove's virgin prairie forest and the family's prized sugar maples, the family successfully petitioned to get the superhighway rerouted around the historic grove. A billboard erected alongside the new interstate ensured that the maple business lost no customers due to the new highway. During the late 1970s, Stephen and his son Mike formed a partnership to run the sirup operation. In 1988, Stephen retired, and Mike and his wife, Debby, took over the business; later that year, Stephen and his sons Mike, Larry and Adam built the current sugarhouse, the first one to include a salesroom. Mike's nephew Sean Funk became a partner in the business in 2001. Today, Funks Grove Maple Sirup has both a mail-order business and an online ordering system, thanks in part to the increased popularity that came with resurging interest in Historic Route 66. Family patriarch Isaac Funk's brother Absalom Funk was one of Northwestern University's first trustees.http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/nu_charter.pdf LaFayette Funk was on the University of Illinois board. The Funks also helped found Illinois Wesleyan University, where Isaac Funk was one of the founders, and Chicago's Union Stock Yards.http://www.pantagraph.com/news/article_b1628ae5-805d-5937-ac4e-d88e53f39056.html Funk's G-Hybrid and the Funk Brothers Seed Company were, in their day, the world's leading producers of hybrid corn.

He was remembered as a patriarch who was well-versed in his ecclesiastical duties but was also hot-tempered and corrupt.  Sources  Brief accounts of Abraham's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth- century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century)  Abraham's election  The following account of Abraham's election is given by Bar Hebraeus: > He [Yohannan IV] was succeeded by Abraham III of Beth Garma√Ø, the bishop of > Marga, who was in Baghdad when the catholicus Yohannan died. At that time > there lived the scribe Abdallah, son of Shemon, a man of very great > influence at the king's court. This man procured a royal decree for him, > after first obtaining from Abraham a written promise that he would show no > favour to the petition of Theodore (who later embraced Islam when he was > caught in fornication with an Arab woman, and accepted her among his wives), > but would rather show special honour to Shemon's son, and raise him to a > higher rank than any of his colleagues. So Abraham set out for Seleucia, and > was consecrated on the tenth day of the latter kanun [January] in the year > 293 of the Arabs [AD 906], on the eleventh day of the third month. He was > well versed in his ecclesiastical duties, but was too fond of money and also > prone to anger. He secured the catholicate for himself by bribery. > They say that after the death of the catholicus Yohannan the metropolitan of > Mosul Yohannan Bar Bokhtisho wrote to ask for Abraham's backing, and that > Abraham wrote back advising him to wait for a while and not rush down to > Baghdad, so as to avoid a repetition of the events that had followed the > death of the catholicus Yunanis. Abraham told him to stay at home until he > was able to forge a consensus, and promised to send for Yohannan as soon as > he was sure that he would be welcomed with honour. Bar Bokhtisho trusted in > Abraham's word, and remained at home awaiting his summons. Meanwhile, > Abraham betrayed him and obtained the leadership for himself. When Yohannan > heard of this, he was furious and hastened down to Baghdad, but his > opposition was of no avail. After a bitter argument between the two men, > Yohannan quietly withdrew to the monastery of Mar Pethion. There he was > informed that the catholicus Abraham had come to see him and to humble > himself before him. Yohannan swore on the gospel, 'If he comes to me, I > shall make him sit on the throne of the bishops, in his former seat.' A > little while later the catholicus unexpectedly came over to him, and when > Yohnnan saw him he stopped him, rose and went over to him, and made him sit > above him. Then Abraham said to him, 'Father, you are worthier than I, and > the office of catholicus should by rights be yours, not mine.

Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 230‚Äì4  Relations with the Melkites and Jacobites  The most important event of Abraham's reign was a crisis provoked by the arrival of a Greek Orthodox metropolitan in Baghdad. Abraham was able to extract a firman from the caliph al-Muqtadir (907‚Äì32) stipulating that only the catholicus of the Nestorians might reside permanently in Baghdad. This concession, doubtless obtained by bribery, as alleged by Bar Hebraeus, represented a striking victory for the Nestorians not only over the Melkites but also over the Jacobites, and the Nestorians invoked al-Muqtadir's firman on several occasions thereafter in defence of their privileges. The following account of this incident is given by Bar Hebraeus, who wrongly presents it as a bilateral agreement between the Nestorians and the Melkites. Neither church enjoyed such powers under Arab rule, and other sources confirm that the dispute was settled by the issue of a firman by the caliph al-Muqtadir: > The Greeks at that time were living in great numbers in Baghdad, and their > scribes, doctors and common people asked Eliya, the Chalcedonian patriarch > of Antioch, to send them a metropolitan. A certain Jani [John] was sent to > them. After he arrived and took up residence in a Greek church in Baghdad, > he was attacked by Abraham, the catholicus of the Nestorians, who brought > him to trial before the wazir. 'We Nestorians', said the catholicus, 'are > the friends of the Arab people, and pray for their victory. How can this > enemy of the Arab people possibly be given the same honours as me?' The > wazir replied, 'You Christians are all alike! You all hate us, and you just > put on a show of friendship!' The catholicus was struck dumb, and could not > find a word to say. But he promised a thousand dinars to one of the great > doctors of the Arabs, who was sitting next to him, to take up his cause. > This man said, 'How can you treat the Nestorians, who have no other ruler > except the Arabs, the same as the Greeks, whose kings are constantly at war > with the Arabs? In their attitude towards us, they are as different as > friends and enemies.' The Arabs who were standing by all applauded the > doctor's words. The catholicus Abraham is said to have laid out 30,000 gold > dinars to bring Eliya, the patriarch of the Greeks, to Baghdad in the year > 300 of the Arabs (AD 912), where he obtained a written promise from him that > no Greek catholicus or metropolitan would remain permanently in Baghdad, and > that if circumstances required him to send a bishop to visit the Greeks of > Baghdad, the bishop would return to his own country as soon as he had > transacted his business.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed. Abeloos > and Lamy), ii. 236‚Äì8  Ecclesiastical reforms  Nestorian Christians in the Abbasid caliphate were in the habit of fasting on Sundays and during the forty days of Lent, but by Abraham's time some of the Christians of Baghdad were breaking their Sunday fast in daylight, at outdoor barbecue parties, after celebrating the eucharist in the early afternoon. Abraham put an end to this practice, which he doubtless considered unseemly, by deferring the eucharist service to the early evening. He enforced this new custom by writing to the bishops of all the far- flung dioceses of the Church of the East. The following account of Abraham's innovation is given by Bar Hebraeus: > In the same year [AD 937] the catholicus Abraham died, having fulfilled his > office for thirty-two years. Up to his time the Nestorians had kept Sundays > and the days of the Lenten Fast like all the other Christian peoples. They > used to offer sacrifice at the third hour, then each man would go home and > break his fast indoors. But the catholicus was told that some people > celebrated the eucharist on Sunday and then sat down to an alfresco banquet > in their gardens. The catholicus forbade the eucharist to be celebrated > before evening on Sundays and during the Lenten Fast, and wrote to all the > regions informing them of these prohibitions. In this way a new custom was > established, which the Nestorians observe to this day.Bar Hebraeus, > Ecclesiastical Chronicle (ed.

In head-on collisions, this panel gives by up to a quarter of an inch (6 mm), helping to absorb the impact. The Revolution helmet was conceived in an attempt to reduce the risk of head injuries such as concussions. What research has been done on the helmet's efficacy so far has been inconclusive. Revolution Speed Helmet The Speed Helmet is the most recent addition to the Revolution series of helmets made by Riddell. The helmet is designed around the head's center of gravity, and is intended to reduce the prevalence of concussions. Recent data has brought the issues of football concussions to the public attention.

Since most concussion-causing impacts occur on the side of the head and face, the helmet features mandible extensions which the cover the wearer's jaw line. The helmet is lined with a custom fit cellular air pad system made of polyurethane and synthetic rubber foam, and the shell is made of a polycarbonate alloy.

The research compared the Revolution helmet with other models. 2,000 high school players participated in the study which took place over the course of three years. The study's results showed that 5.4% of the athletes wearing the Revolution helmet suffered a concussion during a game as opposed to 7.6% of the players wearing the older model helmets. High school players wearing the Revolution helmet were 31% less likely to experience a concussion.Hoff, David J. 2006. \\"SPORTS SAFETY.\\" Education Week 25, no. 24: 16.

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center later disavowed these results, citing problems with the design of the study, according to the book League of Denial. The Federal Trade Commission also conducted an independent investigation into the safety claims made by Riddell. It concluded that \\"the study did not substantiate Riddell‚Äôs claim that Revolution varsity football helmets reduce concussions or the risk of concussion by 31% compared to other varsity football helmets.\\" It also invalidated all claims relating to youth football and the Revolution youth helmet due to the fact that the UPMC study tested neither youth players nor the youth version of the helmet. Despite determining that Riddell falsely represented numerous claims, the FTC chose not to sanction Riddell as the company had already discontinued use of the 31% claim.

The 2010 China drought and dust storms were a series of severe droughts during the spring of 2010 that affected Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Hebei and Gansu in the People's Republic of China as well as parts of Southeast Asia including Vietnam and Thailand, and dust storms in March and April that affected much of East Asia. The drought has been referred to as the worst in a century in southwestern China.Asianews.it. \\"Asianews.it.\\" Worst drought in a century wipes out harvests in southwestern China. Retrieved on 2010-03-22. Causes Prior to the drought in Yunnan and Guizhou, the China Meteorological Administration recorded temperatures averaging 2 ¬∞C warmer than normal over six months and half the average precipitation for the past year across the region, both unprecedented since at least the 1950s. The effects of El Ni√±o are believed to be contributing to the drought, which may be exacerbated by global warming, as some areas in Yunnan have recorded record high temperatures during the winter since record-keeping began in 1950. Some areas in the drought-affected regions have seen no rainfall since before October. Spring dust storms are common in China, but have become more severe in recent years due to desertification, deforestation, drought, urban sprawl and overgrazing. Countries downstream from Yunnan are also affected by drought conditions upriver, and some places including much of Vietnam have seen very little precipitation since the previous September. A severe drought in 2009 also affected much of northern and northeast China, resulting in agricultural losses of up to 50%. Water shortages By March 22, 2010, about 51 million people faced water shortages in a number of provinces. Commodities including sugar cane, flowers, tea, fruit, potatoes, rapeseed, medicinal ingredients, tobacco, wheat, rubber and coffee have been severely affected with output reduced by as much as 50%. Authorities began to fear unrest due to soaring food prices and sent more than 10,000 armed police to the affected regions to ensure stability and help with water supplies. More than 20 million people are left without adequate drinking water in Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan and Chongqing, and many wells in Yunnan have gone dry. The three wells in the village of Xiazha in Guangxi Autonomous Region were reported to have gone completely dry for the first time since 1517, in addition to three reservoirs in the area going dry. Economic damage to agriculture and failed electricity generation from hydroelectric dams from the drought was estimated to be at least 24 billion Chinese yuan ($3.5 billion USD). Around 3,600 rivers and brooks in Guizhou have run dry, while 916,000 ha of crops were affected by drought in the province and one million farmers have left to find work in other provinces. The drought affected over 28 million farmers, and a grain shortage has affected 8 million people. The Chinese government has transferred 1.7 million tonnes of grain to the region to reduce potential inflation. About 4.348 million ha of cropland were affected by the drought in Southwestern China and 942,000 ha would yield no harvest by late March, according to China's State Commission of Disaster Relief. In late March, the government began cloud seeding in Guizhou using silver iodide to produce rain. By April 10, the drought had eased in Chongqing due to heavy rain, but it had affected over 18 million livestock and 8.13 million ha of land. In parts of Yunnan Province inhabited by the Dai people, officials cancelled or shortened the Songkran water dousing festival due to the water shortage, including in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. By early June, the drought had affected close to 5 million hectares of land. The drought may also affect water levels at the headwaters of the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween Rivers. Some experts believe that hydropower production may be contributing to the water shortage from the drought. Countries downstream of the Mekong, including Thailand, suggested that the building of dams on the river such as at Lancang may be worsening the effects of drought on the river's water levels, which were at their lowest in 20 years. Fisheries along the Mekong in Thailand have halted, and 7.9 million people in the country are affected by the drought. 3,674 small dams within the river basin have dried up. The drought in Vietnam was described as the country's worst in a century. The Red River near Hanoi was by early March at a level of , the lowest on record, and rice plantations have been severely affected. Timber fires have been sparked in several regions. The Mekong Delta experienced its lowest water levels in nearly 20 years, threatening to produce saltwater intrusion in dry areas. Some parts of Vietnam are forecast to possibly receive no rain until August. A power shortage of up to one billion kilowatt-hours could also hit the country as less water is available for hydroelectricity. The El Ni√±o conditions of the winter prior to the drought has raised concerns that the rice crop in Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines may be significantly reduced by the summer. The lack of precipitation caused land subsidence at Kunming Wujiaba International Airport in Yunnan. About 5,000 villagers in Yunnan Province have left their homes from the drought for streams near Himalayan foothills, and many residents in Guangxi who are able to leave have also left. However, officials have denied reports of drought refugees leaving their villages. The source of the Pearl River's headwaters was cut off, and its outflow was severely reduced. Water rationing was put into practice in some rural regions. Shortages of drinking water also affected parts of Inner Mongolia, including a water shortage for over 250,000 residents of Chifeng. Reservoirs in the city held 73.7% less water than they did one year prior and water volume had reduced by 77.4% in major rivers in the area by mid-April. The drought has affected non-ferrous metal production in Guangxi, including of electrolytic zinc, with companies in Nandan County cutting production by 30%. Premier Wen Jiabao visited southwestern China three times during the drought, including a three-day tour in mid-March in Yunnan, including Luliang County, which had seen no rainfall since August, to promote water conservation, and another visit in early April 2010 to several Miao and Buyei autonomous prefectures in Guizhou, some of the worst-hit places where farming has been made impossible. Most provinces in South China affected by the drought were hit by a series of floods beginning in mid-May that ended most of the drought but also destroyed large areas of farmland. Dust storms Strong dust storms from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia hit Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, North Korea and Japan by March 22, before being carried across the Pacific Ocean by the jet stream, with some dust reaching the West Coast of the United States. The dust storm in late March spiralled around a strong low pressure system. Many areas recorded an extremely rare level 5 \\"hazardous\\" rating for air quality. Many flights in Beijing were also delayed or cancelled. Air pollution readings in Hong Kong reached a record high, reaching at least 15 times the recommended maximum levels by the World Health Organization. Taiwan also reported a new record for worst sandstorm conditions. A strong sandstorm tore through Turpan in Xinjiang on April 23, sparking fires that killed two people and forcing a shutdown of rail and road traffic for six hours.

Algal blooms In mid-June 2010, a large algal bloom, consisting of enteromorpha algae, developed off the coast of Shandong, in the Yellow Sea. Causes of the algal outbreak include marine pollution from sewage and agricultural run-off, in addition to run-off from fish farms, worsened by eutrophication following the drought, subsequent flooding and heat wave, as well as high sea surface temperatures in the area. The bloom continues to expand, and preparations have been made for a flotilla of vessels to ward off the bloom, covering an area of , the largest bloom since 2008. The patch of algae since expanded offshore Jiangsu Province, and is pushing toward the city of Qingdao. The Chinese State Oceanic Administration has warned that the algae could threaten marine life and local tourism, and other scientists have stated that the bloom could decompose on beaches and release toxic gases if not cleaned up. Close to 4,000 tonnes a day of algae is being removed from the bloom, to be sent off and used as animal feed or fertilizer. Green and red tides have become more common in China in recent years. The green tides from the current algal blooms can also result in dead zones from localized ocean anoxia. Large blooms of jellyfish, including giant Nomura's jellyfish have also appeared off Shandong and around the coasts of Japan within the past decade, as a result of the same type of pollution in dead zones.

Built in 1914, Pease auditorium is the 4th oldest standing building on Eastern Michigan University's campus. The auditorium was constructed in 1914 for $243,963. For the time, that was a considerable amount of money. Today Pease is home to the university's music performances and as well as some performing arts productions. With a seating capacity of 1,700, Pease is a prime spot for many events held by the community. History of Pease Auditorium EMU Marching Band performing in Pease Originally named Pierce Auditorium, the name was changed a year later to the Frederic H. Pease Auditorium. Frederic H. Pease was the professor of music from 1858‚Äì1909 and Head of Conservatory at Michigan State Normal School (former name for Eastern Michigan University). He was described as being, \\"very eager to help students develop their full potential for music\\". When Pease opened for the fall semester of 1914, it was considered to be one of the most modern and prestigious auditoriums of its time. The grand neoclassical fa√ßade and classical details of the interior made the acoustics top of the line, and attracted many performers from across the country. Later in 1960, there was a large Aeolian-Skinner organ installed on the back of the stage. Then in 1959 new seats and a new stage floor was added. In 1993-1994 president William Shelton spent $2.2 million on renovations to electrical, plumbing and structural upgrades, as well as adding new seats and putting in a lighting system for performing arts performances. Then a celebrity \\"green room\\" was added in the back of the auditorium to accommodate the many celebrities that perform there. Pease Auditorium has long been used by the Eastern Michigan University music department which today is housed under the Eastern Michigan University College of Arts and Sciences. Contributors to upgrading Pease Charles McKenny- President of Michigan State Normal School during the building of Pease auditorium. Raised funds and oversaw the successful building of Pease Auditorium. John D. Pierce- Head of the music department from 1859 to 1909. Pease Auditorium was originally named Pierce auditorium before betting dedicated in 1915. Frederic H. Pease- Professor of music from 1858 to 1909. He was a favorite among his students and the auditorium was dedicated in his name on October 11, 1915. Frederick Alexander-A music professor in the early 1900s at Michigan State Normal school. Early in the construction of the auditorium he had visions of an organ being installed on the back part of the stage. Because of funding issues the organ was never installed in the original construction of the auditorium. In his will Alexander left $80,000 to the university to build the organ. Then in 1957 the organ was finally installed at a cost of $91,000 making it the most expensive organ in Michigan at the time. Erich Goldschmidt- Professor of organ from 1955-1978 at Eastern Michigan University. Goldschmidt designed and tuned the massive organ installed in 1957. William E.

This process follows a modular approach to grid construction and focuses on the development of the IT-enabling of its electric power generation system. The country views the smart grids, along with the so-called \\"new energy industries\\", as an emergent pillar of the Korean economy. According to Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), one of the leaders of the initiative, \\"smart grids would help the country use more renewable energy sources and cut overall energy consumption.\\" The \\"smart\\" in a grid is achieved through an installed software rather than hardware, banking more on the element of intelligence for more consistent upgrades, patterns learning, and timely response to new technologies. The South Korean smart grids include the following components: # Smart power: the intelligent monitoring of demand, high level of fault tolerance and fast restoration in case of failures; # Smart service: The provision of domestic, commercial, and industrial customers with electricity tariffs and services customized according to their needs; # Smart place: the use of intelligence at home (e.g. smart appliances), real- time pricing, and demand management; # Smart transport: installation of sophisticated systems to effectively manage the connections of electric vehicles to the smart grid; and, # Smart renewables: the connection and use of large and diverse sources of power to the grid to ensure stability.  Industry  Internet in South Korea is more robust and developed than in almost any other country, with gigabit wired service being common even in fairly rural areas. Accordingly, Korean initiatives in smart grid and Internet of things largely take reliable backhaul connectivity for granted. The country's mobile device and appliance exports also put it in the forefront of machine-to-machine communication. For instance, to deploy electric car charging technology broadly across the country required only a few deals to equip vehicles and chargers with LTE technology, plus existing technologies like submetering and two-way plugs (to facilitate the purchase of vehicle battery power for the grid, especially at peak times, as was announced in 2014).  KEPCO initiatives and exports  KEPCO, as of 2014, planned to \\"spend US$155 million between 2015 and 2017 on developing technologies that will reduce spending on power, as well as boosting energy saving and efficiency\\" and set 2030 as the date to deliver universal smart grids for \\"power generation, distribution and consumption\\" and to export them to all of Southeast Asia. Its first export was to Canadian power company PowerStream with which it committed to build a pilot project in the Penetanguishene region of Ontario, suggesting it would also aggressively export this technology to North America In 2011, KEPCO had earmarked investment of US$7.18 billion in its smart grid business to meet this 2030 goal. Most of the investment would be completed before 2020, to upgrade power transmission and distribution systems and switch meters, the company said in a statement. By early 2020 the spending of 27.5 trillion won over the next two decades on smart grids was to make electricity distribution more efficient, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save US$26 billion in energy imports. Also, KEPCO had announced earlier in 2014 that it \\"would soon be buying electricity stored in car batteries through a vehicle-to-grid pilot scheme\\" to reduce on-peak demand generation. The government committed to change laws to smooth the vehicle-to-grid program by the end of 2014, while the state-run electricity distributor will design a new price-charging system.  Technologies  In July 2015 KEPCO announced a deal with telco LGU+ to develop Internet of things technologies jointly.  Emissions and climate goals  The South Korean government announced its CO2 reduction target for 2020. The target represents a 30% reduction from the estimated level of 2020. This goal is deemed very challenging since Korean industry had doubled its greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2005, the fastest growth in the OECD. Korea has voluntarily set its 2020 emission reduction target. With this pledge, Seoul seeks to be a model for other countries including China and India who are categorized as developing countries under the Kyoto Protocol; the two countries thus have no binding obligation but to announce its reduction target by 2030. Korea is also pursuing sustainable development while dealing with climate change. At the same time, it is shifting toward a low carbon economy and a society capable of recovering from climate change. As part of these efforts, Korea launched a Smart Grid national project to achieve green growth in a transparent, comprehensive, effective, and efficient way. This project envisions laying the foundation for a low carbon, green-growth economy by building a Smart Grid. Thus, it can serve as a yardstick to evaluate the future of Korea‚Äôs green- growth economy. In light of this,Korea came up with a proactive and ambitious plan to build a Smart Grid Test-bed on Jeju Island to prove its determination in the low carbon, green-growth strategy. The island was chosen in June 2009 due to the availability of potential renewable energy sources as well as the requirement for a closed territory. The initiative aims to become the world's first \\"all-inclusive\\" test-bed and to transform Jeju as the \\"world's largest Smart Grid community.\\" To address climate change, Korea has recognized the necessity of rolling out a Smart Grid as infrastructure for the low carbon, green industry in preparation for its binding reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. With that in mind, the Korean government is implementing relevant policies and projects that can be echoed by the public. In short, Korea is pursuing the Smart Grid initiative as a national policy to achieve the vision of ‚ÄúLow carbon, Green growth.‚Äù In line with this, in 2009, Korea‚Äôs Green Growth Committee presented \\"Building an Advanced Green Country\\"as its vision, and specified the contents of the Smart Grid. Afterwards, in November 2009, the committee collected views of experts from the industry, academia, and research institutes to outline the national roadmap.  2010 World Smart Grid Forum Korea Smart Grid Association and Korea Smart Grid Institute hosted 2010 World Smart Grid Forum, sponsored by Ministry of Knowledge Economy and Presidential Committee on Green Growth. It was mainly held to ascertain the present of the domestic smart grid sector and to identify a future direction for development.http://english.wsgf.co.kr *Title : 2010 World Smart Grid Forum *A Theme : The Smart Grid Implementation and Beyond *Date : January 20‚Äì22, 2010 *Venue : Grand Ballroom, COEX, Seoul, Korea *Hosted by : Korea Smart Grid Association, Korea Smart Grid Institute *Sponsored by : Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Presidential Committee on Green Growth  Korea's Smart Grid 10 Power IT Projects Power IT refers to a technology that enables electric power devices and systems to become digital, environmentally friendly, and intelligent through the convergence of electric power technology and information and communication technology (ICT). It also creates high added value for electric power services. The Power IT National Program aims to develop Power IT into a driving force behind the nation‚Äôs economic growth by advancing the Korean electric power and electrical industries. The program also seeks to bring innovation and higher added value to electric power services. To achieve these goals, Korea embarked on a strategic technology development program in 2005 and selected 10 projects, which have since been systematically implemented. In Feb. 2009, the implementation of these projects was connected with the Smart Grid Initiative, a core element of Seoul‚Äôs Green Growth Strategy. The Power IT Program is expected to develop the electric power and electrical industries. Thus, once these 10 projects are complete, these two industries will play a critical role in propelling national economic growth and delivering innovative and high value-added electric power services. There are ten Power IT Project Areas: # Development of Korean Energy Management System # IT Based Control System for Bulk Power Transmission # Development of Intelligent Transmission Network Monitoring and Operating System # Development of a Digital Technology-based Next-Generation Substation System # Development of Intelligent Distribution Management System # The Development of Power Active Telematics System for Facility Monitoring # Development of a Consumer Integrated Resource Management System for High Value-Added Power Services # Development of PLC Ubiquitous Technology # Development of Power Semiconductor Technology for Distributed Generation and its Application in Industrial Inverters # Development of integration EMS for the microgrid and application technology to real site Korea Smart Grid Institute KSGI organizational structure Korea Smart Grid Institute (KSGI) was launched in August 2009 as the secretariat of Smart Grid Initiative and projects in Korea. The Smart Grid Initiative mainly targets the modernization of electric power systems. Today, many countries around the world recognize the necessity of enhancing energy efficiency, tackling climate change, and promoting green energy. This received very high level attention: President Lee Myung-Bak announced on August 15, 2008, Korea‚Äôs new national vision ‚ÄúGreen Growth, Low Carbon.‚Äù To implement this vision KSGI was established, to manage comprehensively the government‚Äôs Smart Grip roadmap; operate a Smart Grid test-bed, pilot city; and extend other policy support for Smart Grid related issues. By late 2014 these objectives were substantially realized and Korea was exporting smart grid technologies to other countries. KSGI aims to explore projects on the development of technology that encompasses the convergence of electric power and IT; support cooperation among industry, academia and research institute; pursue international cooperation and certification, standardization as well as security; and ultimately achieve low carbon green society to better the lives of people and improve the environment by building a nationwide Smart Grid.

The species was described by Heidemann in 1914 after it aroused attention a year earlier in the United States as an eggplant pest around Norfolk, Virginia. Fink found that the species became an agricultural pest when eggplant is planted on a large scale. It mainly feeds on the flowering plant family Solanaceae, being found on a range of Solanum species including tomato, potatoes and eggplant as well as species of other genera such as Althara, Cassia, Gossypium and Salvia. It is found in Mexico, the United States and Canada.Drake, C.J. and F.A. Ruhoff. (1965). Lacebugs of the World, a Catalog (Hemiptera: Tingidae). U.S. Nat. Mus. Bull. 243., Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., U.S.A. 634 pp. It is prey to generalist predators such as adults and larvae of the ladybirds Hippodamia convergens and Megilla maculata, which flip their prey onto their back before eating them. Some other heteropterans prey on them, specifically Podisus maculiventris and Orius insidiosus (which prey on nymphs). Three small spider species are also known to feed on this species. Mothers lay their eggs in circular deposits on the abaxial (lower) side of leaves; eggs are \\"attached at a slight angle and covered with frass\\". The species goes through five instars in its life cycle, and the fifth instar and adult form were included as figures in Fink (1915). The developmental process from egg to adult takes about 20 days, the nymphal stage taking about 10 days. Fink noticed that the nymphs have spines, though he was not entirely sure why (more recent work has shed light on their function). Mating was observed to occur in November and there are perhaps seven or eight generations each year. These may occur on eggplant for the first six and the last on horse nettle (Solanum carolinense). Adults have been found year-round in Missouri, sometimes while hibernating in clumps of grass or under bark or the leaves of mullein (Verbascum thapsus). This was the first species in the family Tingidae (lace bugs) in which maternal care was discovered. Mothers defend their offspring against predators as they mature by moving towards the threat and fanning their wings. Experiments show that without this protection their progeny have only a 3% survival rate in the wild. Further observation has shown that guarding eggs and protecting offspring after they hatch has a significant cost to the mother, reducing her future reproductive potential in terms of fecundity and clutch number. Evolutionary theory predicts that parental investment should change depending on the reproductive value of offspring and future reproductive potential of parents. Douglas Tallamy found that maternal defensive behaviour in this species is consistent with the theory, since mothers became more aggressive in their clutch defense as they got older (less future reproduction at risk) and as the nymphs in each clutch matured (greater investment lost/higher survival potential as they get bigger). Because of heavy predation, this investment is necessary. However, females can reduce costs to themselves by laying in the egg masses of conspecifics (i.e. other mothers) who will then take care of their offspring for them (similar behaviour occurs in other species; see brood parasite). This exploitation of other females is common; eggs are laid in neighbouring egg masses whenever there is opportunity to do so. Egg dumpers were observed to have higher mortality rates per egg, but were at an advantage because they were more fecund (could lay more eggs) and were at lower risk of predation. Some semiochemicals have been identified for this species. For example, larvae emit an alarm pheromone called geraniol from dorsal glands which cause nearby nymphs to flee, which explains earlier observations that nymphs become alarmed when a nearby sibling is crushed.

It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady and built from to 1970 by McArdle & Thompson. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The bridge is one of the earliest concrete bridges in Australia. As it replaced a high set timber bridge which was demolished during the disastrous floods of 1893, the present bridge is a low level bridge designed for inundation, as it is less likely to be damaged by floating debris during floods. It was opened to traffic on 30 October 1896 and was named in honour of Lord Lamington, Governor of Queensland.  History  The Lamington Bridge, which crosses the Mary River from Tinana to Maryborough, was built to the design of AB Brady and opened in 1896. It replaced an earlier highset timber bridge constructed in 1874 and is one of Australia's oldest concrete bridges. The port of Maryborough was established in the late 1840s to supply sheep stations on the Burnett River and provide an outlet for their wool. It was a port of entry and during the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough flourished as the principal port of the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained its growth as a major regional centre. The first bridge over the Mary River was a timber high-set bridge constructed in 1874, upstream from the current bridge. During the disastrous floods of 1893, this bridge was partially demolished, cutting off the important road that linked Gympie to the port. The new bridge was designed by Alfred Barton Brady. Brady was born and trained in England, designed many notable bridges and was one of Queensland's most important early engineers. He served the Queensland Government for 37 years from 1885, at first with the Railways Department, then from 1889 with the Public Works Department, and then as the Queensland Government Architect and engineer for bridges from 1892. Although Brady designed many important and handsome public buildings, his forte was bridge design. As well as the Lamington Bridge, Brady was responsible for the design of the Gairloch Bridge over the Herbert River at Ingham (1889-1890); the Granville Bridge in Maryborough (1889-1890); the Burnett Bridge in Bundaberg (1890-1900) and the Victoria Bridge in Brisbane (1893-1997). Of the many bridges he designed, Lamington Bridge is his most technically innovative work. In discussing his very early choice of concrete for the Lamington Bridge, Brady explained that \\"the Author was induced to recommend a concrete bridge, as it ensures a structure of very great strength, almost everlasting in character, and the annual expenditure in maintenance is consequently reduced to a minimum\\". The bridge was designed as a low level bridge, which was thought to be much safer during floods where floating debris causes much damage to high set bridges. Brady wrote a detailed account of the design and construction of Lamington Bridge in a paper he presented to the Institute of Engineers in 1900. The bridge was designed in 1893 and tenders were called for the project in September 1894. The successful tenderers were Messrs AcArdle and Thompson of Brisbane. Construction followed and the completed structure cost about . The bridge was opened to traffic on 30 October 1896 by Hon. David Hay Dalrymple, MLA, Minister for Public Works. The bridge was named in honour of His Excellency the Right Hon. Baron Lamington KCMG, Governor of Queensland. Lamington Bridge was widened in 1970 but the original handrails were retained and reused.  Description  Lamington Bridge, 2001 Lamington Bridge is a low level bridge, designed for inundation, and crosses the Mary River immediately south of the city of Maryborough between Ferry Street in Maryborough and Gympie Road in Tinana. It is a reinforced concrete structure comprising eleven spans of clear or centre to centre of piers. The bridge is reinforced on both faces with eleven rails, which were erected as frames and are bolted to the pier tops underneath the concrete and spliced with fishplates. Deck and piers The bridge has a solid deck, wide, with circular segmental soffit and a depth at the centre of the roadway varying in each span from . The roadway camber is and there is an integral kerb at each side. The reinforcement consists of railway rails deep, with long lower flanges. There are thirteen such rails running longitudinally in each face at centre, with clear cover of about . The top and bottom rails are formed into eleven frames, each bolted to the pier top. The top member is continuous over the length of the bridge, achieved by fishplated connections. Heritage listing The Lamington Bridge was listed on the former Register of the National Estate in 1986. It was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Lamington Bridge, opened in 1896, is important in illustrating the development of bridge design in Queensland and the importance of Maryborough as a port and outlet for the Gympie goldfield in the late 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Lamington bridge has international importance as one of the first concrete girder bridges based on the Wuntsch system. It is technologically innovative as one of the earliest concrete bridges in Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The bridge is important as the most significant example of the work of Alfred Barton Brady who, during 37 years of work for several departments of the Queensland government, made a major contribution to the development of the state in both architectural and engineering design.  Engineering heritage award  The bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

History Raphael was married to the former Ernestine Lissner in March 1848. She gave birth to seven children, four boys and three girls, all born in Prussia prior to their migration to England. As the family of seven children grew older, the children provided more help to the business. Raphael sent out his sons, Herman, Adolph and Gustave, to bring in more business. Herman and Adolph also went on selling trips, and at the end of the day they would check the results of the day's work. The one with the higher sales would have the bigger egg next morning for breakfast. Three of the four sons participated in the firm established by their father. Their second son, Adolph, was chairman and managing director of Raphael Tuck and Sons Ltd. until his death on 3 July 1926. He was created a baronet on 19 July 1910 (see Tuck baronets). The Tuck coat-of-arms features a shield with a flaming antique lamp above which are two hands in the attitude of prayer, with two crossed F's in a circle at the lower part of the shield. The crest shows a seated lion supporting an artist's palette whereupon is inscribed the work ‚ÄúThorough\\". The Tuck motto inscribed on a ribbon below the shield is Cum Deo (i.e., \\"with God\\"). Raphael had received training in graphic arts in his home country; also, although he was not an artist himself, he had a flair for commercial art that prompted his interest in this new field. Upon coming to England, he caught the imagination of the public in such a way that he was able to create a new graphic arts business. He was so successful at it that, according to The Times he \\"opened up a new field of labour for artists, lithographers, engravers, printers, ink and paste board makers, and several other trade classes\\". Tuck's continued to run very successful postcard competitions through the early 1900s with the focus changing to collectors of Tuck postcards rather than of postcards by the artists whose work was depicted. The top part of the 1903 Tuck Exchange Register pictured above announces the second of Tuck's prize competitions which began in 1900. The prize competitions aroused much interest. The first contest winner turned in a collection of 20,364 cards over the 18-month duration of the contest. The second prize competition winner submitted 25,239 cards. In 1914 the fourth prize competition was announced. The competitions were a novel and effective marketing technique. Although the Tuck firm did some black-and-white printing in their London offices, the majority of colour work was contracted for in Germany, Raphael's home country. This is evidenced by the wording \\"printed (or chromographed) in Bavaria\\" (or Germany or Saxony) inscribed on the majority of the early Tuck postcards. The greatest period of expansion of the Tuck firm came under the direction of Adolph who had joined his father in 1870. Gustave and Herman soon followed their brother in 1871. Adolph became managing director, which included control of the art department. Gustave directed the book and calendar departments, while Herman handled the financial end of the business. Raphael House enabled the Tuck firm to consolidate their various offices and departments that had spread throughout various parts of the city. In addition to the administrative offices, the new building provided adequate space for eight functioning departments: Card Department (Toy-Books, Gift-Books, Booklets); Birthday Book Department; Educational Department; Wall Text and Scripture Motto Department; Engraving Department; Chromo, Oleograph, and Art Study Department; Relief and Art Novelty Department; and Show-Card Department. These Tuck departments attest to the fact that the Victorian age was the age of printed pictorials that took shape by means of the various printing and engraving processes. Timeline =1866= Raphael Tuck opened a shop on Union Street, Bishopsgate, now known as Brushfield Street, and begin selling pictures and frames. =1870= Raphael moved to 177 City Road. His three sons joined him as the picture- framing and picture side developed into importing and publishing. =1871= The company produced their first Christmas greeting card. =1880= New premises were taken at 72‚Äì73 Coleman Street. Son Adolph launched a nationwide contest offering 5,000 guineas in prizes for the best Christmas card designs. Over five thousand paintings were said to have been entered in the contest. Entries were displayed in the Dudley Galleries and vast crowds visited the exhibition. Over ¬£2,500 was spent in buying entries and launching the Christmas card industry as an annual custom throughout the world. Both amateur and professional artists submitted entries for the close scrutiny of the judges. Literary merit was also considered: the then-popular writer Grant Allen served as judge of appropriate texts. Marcus Stone headed a committee of well-known artists in the selection of the designs. Also in this year, the famous trade mark was applied for, and was finally registered on 2 March 1881.Picture Postcards and Their Publishers, by Anthony Byatt, page 289 =1882= Paris branch opened. =1893= Queen Victoria granted the firm the Royal Warrant of Appointment. Tuck cards thereafter bore the message \\"Art Publishers to Her Majesty the Queen\\". Future sovereigns continued the warrant of appointment. =1895= On 27 December 1895, the firm was incorporated as a limited company, with a registered office at 72 Coleman Street, London, E.C. In the same year, they opened a new branch in New York. Raphael's wife Ernestine died and Raphael's own health began to fail. =1899= Raphael House was opened on 6 July 1899, located between Tenter Street, and White Street. Its five floors held every department for the existing business. The first experimental Snowdon postcard was produced, entitled the \\"View\\" postcard, showing scenes of London, with an individual number given to each card. =1900= Early in the year, the first 45 sets of postcards were ready. They covered the outstanding attractions of London and the River Thames. All these cards had undivided backs, leaving the room to write a message on the front that was only partially covered by the image. Raphael Tuck died on 16 March 1900. Adolph and his brothers continued to expand the business after Raphael's death. In July 1900 the first postcard competition was announced. Prizes of ¬£1,000 were offered for the largest collection of Tuck cards sent through post. First prize was awarded to the owner of 20,364 cards,Picture Postcards and Their Publishers, by Anthony Byatt, page 291 a huge total to collect through the eighteen-month duration of the contest. Events such as these helped foster the \\"postcard boom\\". The sons of Adolph Tuck, Reginald and Desmond, continued the business their grandparents had started. With the advent of World War I, they volunteered for military service. In 1910 the Tuck baronetcy was created for Adolph Tuck. He died in 1926 and was succeeded as 2nd Baronet by Reginald, his eldest son. Soon after that Gustave retired and the business was left in the hands of Sir Reginald and Desmond. =1903= The famous \\"Oilette\\" series was introduced, as well as the \\"Proof\\" series. The Proof series were printed on superior board, every set was stamped with a consecutive number, and a register was kept of whom the set had been sold to.Picture Postcards and Their Publishers, by Anthony Byatt, page 293 Richard F. Outcault, the American cartoonist of Buster Brown fame, also produced postcards for the company around this time.<> =1906= From the set \\"Humour of Life\\" (1907) Notable artists illustrating sets this year included Lance Thackeray, producing sets such as \\"Amateur Gardening\\", Society Pets and John Hassall with \\"Humour of Life\\".Picture Postcards and Their Publishers, by Anthony Byatt, page 295 Another competition was announced in February, the aim of which was to establish the longest chain. Any public institution could be nominated, and the originator had to get as many as possible to buy a packet of Tuck cards, send one in to the institution, and the rest to his friends, telling them to do so as well. Prizes were ¬£1,000 to the institution with the most cards, and ¬£50 to anyone that sent a card to the winning institution. =1914= The fourth competition was said to have taken place in March (although there is evidence it was actually not the fourth competition, even though it was called that by Tucks themselves). Only cards passing through the post after 1 January were accepted, and the winner was once again decided by the largest collection.Picture Postcards and Their Publishers, by Anthony Byatt, page 298 A separate competition was held for children, called \\"Father Tuck's Painting Book Competition\\", with samples such as those by A. Barraud. The child then painted some of the cards in the book, which were perforated for easy removal. =World Wars I and II= During World War I and World War II, a greatly reduced but steady flow of sets continued, with the themes of many cards changing. Titles such as \\"The Call of The Flag\\" and \\"Prisoner of War\\" became more prominent. =1940= In the night of 29 December 1940, London was heavily bombed and Raphael House was destroyed. Records of seventy- four years and 40,000 or more original pictures and photographs by the best artists were in ashes. In spite of having to start over, the company was soon making progress. =1950= After the war, many employees came back, and the company enjoyed success. New headquarters were built in the West End of London. They also built a branch in Northampton. =1954= Sir Reginald Tuck died, and his son Bruce inherited the title of baronet, but soon left the company, of which Desmond Tuck was left in charge. =1959= Desmond Tuck retired. The company combined with two others, to become the British Printing Corporation (renamed British Printing & Communications Corporation in 1982 and finally Maxwell Communications Corporation in 1987), which was originally located only a short distance from where the first shop of Ernestine and Raphael Tuck once stood.

The mainline (official \\"Blue\\" and \\"non-dot\\") trail is not completely contiguous, notably there are two gaps of several miles (between the Southington and Burlington sections and between the Burlington section and the Nepaug section). The Tunxis Trail is composed of eighteen (18) trails of which one is the primarily North-to-South mainline trail plus a number of shorter side trails. Despite being easily accessible and close to large population centers, the trail is considered to be rugged and scenic. Its features include the Lake Compounce Amusement Park (and its \\"non-ski lift\\"), \\"Tory Den\\", the \\"Mile of Ledges\\", colonial era cemeteries, several caves (including the \\"Indian Council Caves\\"), waterfalls, cliff faces, woodlands, swamps, lakes, river flood plains, farmland, historic sites, and the summits of Pine Mountain and Southington Mountain.Connecticut Walk Book: A Trail Guide to the Connecticut Outdoors. 17th Edition.

Trail description Tunxis Trail Southern Trailhead and Parking Lot The Tunxis Trail extends from the Connecticut / Massachusetts border north to south crossing successively the municipalities of Hartland in Hartford County, Barkhamsted and New Hartford in Litchfield County, Canton and Burlington in Hartford County, Harwinton and Plymouth in Litchfield County, ending in Bristol and Southington in Hartford County with two southern side trails touching the northern New Haven County town of Wolcott. The southern terminus of the trail is located just north of the Mount Southington ski resort at the intersection of Mount Vernon Road and Whitman Road at a courtesy parking lot provided by the Southington Sportsmen Association, in the town of Southington, Connecticut; the northern terminus is located on the Connecticut / Massachusetts state line where Connecticut's Tunxis State Forest and Massachuesett's Granville State Forest meet, part of Hartland, Connecticut, south of Granville, Massachusetts. The Metacomet Ridge (in particular central Connecticut high points such as the Hanging Hills, Ragged Mountain (Connecticut) and Talcott Mountain‚Äîincluding Heublein Tower) is visible to the east from much of the Tunxis Trail. A number of networks of shorter hiking trails (17 official \\"Blue-Blazed\\" regional trails) intersect with the Tunxis Trail in the three southern sections‚Äîin the Southington region (from Wolcott to the New Britain Reservoir and in Bristol near the Lake Compounce Amusement Park), the Burlington Region, and in Nepaug State Forest (New Hartford). The Tunxis Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and in the winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for, and are used for, mountain biking and cross-country skiing. Site-specific activities enjoyed along the route include hunting, fishing, horseback riding, boating, bouldering, rock climbing (access), and swimming.Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.

The Farmington River cuts through the trail just above Nepaug State Forest at the Satan's Kingdom Recreation Area (in New Hartford). The Tunxis Trail crosses several Connecticut state forests, land/preservation trusts, metropolitan water company properties and private property. From south to north the trail crosses the Session Woods Wildlife Management Area, Nassahegon State Forest, Nepaug State Forest, Tunxis State Forest, Granville State Forest.

Connecticut's Farmington River was also known as the Tunxis River (particularly in the localities of New Hartford, Burlington, Farmington, Avon, Simsbury and Granby) to the English colonists during the middle of the 17th century. New England Gazetteer: Containing Descriptions of the States, Counties, Cities and Towns of New England, John Hayward, 1857, Second Edition \\"Tunxis\\" is also a name given to the Native American sub-tribe (of the Saukiogs tribe) living in the area between and including where the towns of Farmington and Southington Connecticut exist today. They were the subjects of the sachem Sequassen (who sold the Hartford area to the English) and to have‚Äîin 1610‚Äîhave sold off most of their territory. A group of twenty wigwams existed in Farmington at the beginning of the eighteenth century but only four or five families existed in the settlement by 1761http://www.farmingtonlibraries.org/qhistoryoffarmington.htm When white Europeans first arrived the \\"Tunxis Sepus\\" territory consisted of a 165-mile square area bounded by Simsbury to the North, Wallingford to the South, northwest to Mohawk country and on the east by the current towns of Windsor, Hartford and Wethersfield. In 1645 the Town of Farmington Connecticut was named by the Connecticut General Assembly and this was re-affirmed in 1650 by the execution of a deed by the General Assembly and the reservation of land for the \\"Tunxis Indians\\" near \\"Indian Neck\\" on the east bank of the Farmington River. For more information on the Tunxis native-Americans (\\"American Indians\\") see the Wikipedia entry on the Tunxis. =Historic sites= Loyalist \\"Tory Den\\" on the Tunxis Yellow Dot Trail in the Burlington Section. =Folklore= There is much American Revolutionary war history associated with the Blue-Blazed White Dot Trail in Plymouth (Terryville) and Harwinton. The locations of several British \\"loyalist\\" families are also near the southern terminus of the White Dot Trail in Terryville ( Plymouth, Connecticut) and Harwinton such as the former homestead of Stephen Graves. The Tory Den, a boulder cave located to the west of the \\"Miles of Ledges\\" on the border of Terryville ( Plymouth, Connecticut) and Burlington, was a hiding place for Loyalists during the American Revolution. There are many \\"satanic\\" references in place names along the Tunxis Trail‚Äîusually dating back to colonial American times. The \\"Devil's Kitchen\\" is an interesting box (also called a \\"cloven\\") canyon formation through which the Blue-Blazed Orange Dot Trail passes in Burlington. \\"Satan's Kingdom\\" north of Nepaug State Forest was considered a territory of rogues and unsavory elements during the colonial American era. It is now noteworthy as a launching area for a commercial white- water \\"tubing\\" concession on the Farmington River. The Ski Sundown ski area was known as Satan's Ridge Ski Area when it first opened in 1963 until it was sold in 1969. http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2009/02/04/business/doc49892b866accb642611713.txt http://www.countytimes.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=2303&dept;_id=478843&newsid;=20246613&PAG;=461&rfi;=9 Hiking the trail A stile in the middle of a snow-covered fallow field on Johnnycake Mountain marks the Tunxis White Dot Trail after the farm fences are gone. The mainline Tunxis trail is blazed with blue rectangles. It is regularly maintained, and is considered easy hiking, with sections of rugged and moderately difficult hiking. However the \\"Mile of Ledges\\" in Burlington requires an amount of rock climbing and the northernmost \\"wilderness\\" twenty miles contains both higher elevation and changes in elevation. The Tunxis Trail is generally close to public roads. However, in the Burlington areas many of the roads are unpaved and the northernmost twenty miles are much more remote and even farther from paved roads. There are camping facilities along the northern portions of the trail in the Nepaug and Tunxis State Forests. Camping is generally prohibited in the southern sections (Southington and Burlington). Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association The mainline trail consists roughly of four unbroken sections‚ÄîSouthington (Southington, Wolcott and Bristol), Burlington (Plymouth, Harwinton, Burlington), Nepaug (Burlington, New Hartford) and the northern twenty miles north of route 44 (New Hartford, Canton, Barkhamsted and Hartland). Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Metacomet Trail Extensive flooding in ponds, puddles and streams may occur in the late winter or early spring, overflowing into the trail and causing very muddy conditions. In this case fairly high waterproof boots are recommended. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. The southern sections of trail can be very close to civilization (suburban homes, streets and businesses) and often contain ruts from ATVs. The middle sections (Burlington, Nepaug) contain many forest roads, dirt roads and paved road walks. The Nepaug section can contain weirdness along the trail (many cairns, Christmas tree ornaments on tree branches, perfectly spaced pine tree forests as a result of forest management experiments). Much of the trail is adjacent to, or is on lands where hunting and the use of firearms are permitted. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended.

He was also a politician, newspaper editor, and diplomat. Life John Mott-Smith was born in New York City on November 13, 1824. His father was also named John Mott Smith (1795‚Äì1832), generally spelled without the hyphen, and mother was Amanda Day. His father had trained as a physician, but became a Methodist minister instead, and was Principal of Wesleyan Seminary in New York in 1820. In 1826 the family moved to White Plains, New York with the school, and then in 1832 to Middletown, Connecticut where his father became a professor of classical languages at the new Wesleyan University. His father died in 1832 and was one of the first burials in the university cemetery. Subsequently, having attended Wesleyan, the young Mott-Smith borrowed a book from a friend who was attending dental school and passed the exams to set up a practice in Albany, New York. He moved to California as part of the California Gold Rush in 1849 and practised dentistry there for two years. He sailed to Hawaii in early 1851. He was only the third Western-trained dentist in the Hawaiian Islands and the first to set up a permanent practice. Two others, M. B. Stevens and George Colburn left after brief stays in the previous two years. For about 15 years he did most of the dental work in Honolulu. He shared an office building with physician William Hillebrand. In 1853 he had his first taste of politics when he was elected to the House of Representatives in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom. His dentist office in 1853 In 1866 Mott-Smith gave up his dental practice to John Morgan Whitney, the first in Hawaii to actually graduate from a dental school. He became editor of the newspaper Hawaiian Gazette. He used the paper to defend the monarchy, which gained him favor with King Kamehameha V, who made it the official government publication. He returned to the legislature in 1866, and was elected Vice President of it in 1867. In 1868 he was sent to Washington, D.C., to help Elisha Hunt Allen negotiate a trade treaty, but was not successful. On December 21, 1869 he returned and was appointed to the powerful post of Minister of Finance in the cabinet. He served until August 25, 1872. With the king's influence, he was an investor with fellow American politician Charles Coffin Harris in the first Hawaiian Hotel. The government issued bonds to finance its construction. After Kamehameha V's death at the end of 1872, Mott-Smith was out of political power and resumed practising dentistry while he was on the Board of Education until 1874. After the liberal King Lunalilo died and King KalƒÅkaua was elected in 1874, monarchists were back in political favor. On December 4, 1876 Mott-Smith was appointed Minister of Interior, serving until July 3, 1878. From 1876 through 1886 he served in the upper House of Nobles in the kingdom legislature when he was not traveling. It was widely suspected that KalƒÅkaua's replacement of his cabinet was influenced by Claus Spreckels, who refinanced the King's debts the night before, in order to secure water rights for his sugarcane plantation on Maui. Since the bachelor Lunalilo left no heirs, Mott-Smith was appointed to the first board of trustees of the Lunalilo Trust. In 1884 he was put in charge of the Hawaii exhibits at the World Cotton Centennial in New Orleans, Louisiana. He returned and was appointed Minister of Finance by Queen Lili ªuokalani on July 28, 1891. However, by October 17, 1891 he resigned and was sent back to Washington. Samuel Parker acted as finance minister both before and after him. His hope was to negotiate a replacement for the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, but he was recalled after the 1893 Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. His position was just below the diplomatic rank of 21st-century ambassador. He retired to Honolulu where he died August 10, 1895 after an illness of several weeks. After a funeral at the Sain Andrew Cathedral he was buried in Oahu Cemetery. Family and legacy In 1859 he married Ellen Dominis Paty. They had seven children. Son Ernest Augustus Mott- Smith was born May 12, 1873 went to Harvard Law School briefly, married Anna Elizabeth Paty in 1896 and became active in politics. He practised law, and served on various government boards of the Territory of Hawaii, such as the Board of Health from 1901‚Äì1925, and territorial secretary from 1907‚Äì1914. Other sons were Harold Meade Mott-Smith and Morton Churchill Mott-Smith. Daughters were Martha Paty Smith, Myra Harris Smith who married Reverend James B. Thomas, Ida Campbell Smith who married Robert Morss Lovett in Chicago, and May Henderson Smith.

He is a multiple winner of the ASCAP Award, among other awards such as the America Music Center Award, Brannen-Cooper Fund Award, and the Minnesota Orchestra Honorable Mention. \\"FredO,\\" as he is called by friends and colleagues was born in Secondi-Takoradi, near the Atlantic Coast in Ghana, West Africa. Early childhood and education through college years were spent in both Ghana and Nigeria. In 1990, he attended Principia College, Elsah, Illinois, on a full scholarship, and while there studied music theory and 20th Century composition techniques under Jim Dowcett, as well as Engineering Science and Computer programming with David Cornell and Tom Fuller. Although Onovwerosuoke has had a wide-ranging training that spans composition, electrical and electronic engineering, information technology, management and musicology, he is known to attribute his interest in music to his childhood as boy-soprano and to his high-school music teacher, Sam Anyanele, who instilled him a deep love of indigenous African music. His tutelage under Dowcett at Principia was said to unleash a creative individualism that eventually evolved into a career as a composer with works that bear influences from Africa, the Caribbean and the American Deep South.  Career  Onovwerosuoke founded the St. Louis African Chorus in 1993 (now African Musical Arts, Inc.), with a mission, according to the organization's website to \\"foster a better understanding of Africa's cultures through the musical arts.\\" He has been active conducting choral and musical workshops since 1978, but it was his work as composer that earned him much needed acclaim in 2006 when his chant, Bolingo (Ofrenda de amor), in Robert De Niro's movie, The Good Shepherd (Universal Pictures, 2006) became particularly successful and drew attention to other musical works and discography promoted by the African Musical Arts organization. While the 2005 Hurricane Katrina brought indescribable devastation to many people in New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, it was in the aftermath of that disaster that much of Onovwerosuoke's music manuscripts were discovered and salvaged by volunteers who had visited his family to help with the clean-up and rebuilding effort. Shortly afterwards, a quick succession of works were published, including his Twenty-Four Studies in African Rhythms, Volume I (African Music Publishers, 2007), Songs of Africa: 22 Pieces for Mixed Voices (Oxford University Press, 2008), and in the CDs, African Arts Music for Flute by flutist Wendy Hymes and pianist Darryl Hollister, ASA: Piano Music by Composer from Africa and the African Diaspora by pianist William Chapman Nyaho, and the promotional CD, Landscapes of Africa: Music for Orchestra, by the New Horizons Studio Orchestra. Onovwerosuoke has a diverse compositional output that includes orchestra suites and works for various combination of chamber groups.

Traditionally ancillary services have been provided by generators, however, the integration of intermittent generation and the development of smart grid technologies have prompted a shift in the equipment that can be used to provide ancillary services. Types of ancillary services Six different kinds of ancillary services: * scheduling and dispatch * reactive power and voltage controlAhmadimanesh, Alireza, and Mohsen Kalantar. \\"Two new frameworks for reactive power market considering reactive losses.\\" International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems 27.10 (2017). * loss compensation * load following * system protection * energy imbalance =Scheduling and dispatch= Scheduling and dispatch are necessary because in most electrical systems energy storage is nearly zero, so at any instant, the power into the system (produced by a generator) must equal the power out of the system (demand from consumers). Since production must so closely match demand, careful scheduling and dispatch are necessary. Usually performed by the independent system operator or transmission system operator, both are services dedicated to the commitment and coordination of the generation and transmission units in order to maintain the reliability of the power grid. Scheduling refers to before-the-fact actions (like scheduling a generator to produce a certain amount of power the next week), while dispatch refers to the real-time control of the available resources. =Reactive power and voltage control= Consumer loads expect voltage within a certain range, and the regulators require it be within a certain percent of the nominal voltage (for example, in the US it is Âúü5%). Reactive power can be used to compensate the voltage drops, but must be provided closer to the loads than real power needs (this is because reactive power tend to travel badly through the grid). Notice that voltage can be controlled also using transformer taps and voltage regulators.Ahmadimanesh, A., and M. Kalantar. \\"A novel cost reducing reactive power market structure for modifying mandatory generation regions of producers.\\" Energy Policy 108 (2017): 702-711. =Frequency control= Frequency control refers to the need to ensure that the grid frequency stays within a specific range of the nominal frequency. Mismatch between electricity generation and demand causes variations in frequency, so control services are required to bring the frequency back to its nominal value and ensure it does not vary out of range.Rebours, Yann G., et al. \\"A survey of frequency and voltage control ancillary services‚ÄîPart I: Technical features.\\" Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 22.1 (2007): 350-357. If we have a graph for a generator where frequency is on the vertical axis and power is on the horizontal axis: slope = -R = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta f}{\\\\Delta P_{m}} where Pm is the change in power of the system. If we have multiple generators, each might have its own R. Beta can be found by: \\\\beta = \\\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \\\\frac{1}{R_n} The change in frequency due to a change in power can be found with: \\\\Delta f = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P_{m}}{\\\\beta} This simple equation can be rearranged to find the change in power that corresponds to a given change in frequency.Glover, J. Duncan, et al. Power System Analysis & Design. 6th ed., Cengage Learning, 2017. =Operating reserves= Since production and demand must match so perfectly (see Scheduling and dispatch), operating reserves help make up the difference when production is too low. An operating reserve is a generator that can quickly be dispatched to ensure that there is sufficient energy generation to meet load. Spinning reserves are generators that are already online and can rapidly increase their power output to meet fast changes in demand. Spinning reserves are required because demand can vary on short timescales and rapid response is needed. Other operating reserves are generators that can be dispatched by the operator to meet demand, but that cannot respond as quickly as spinning reserves. Renewable generation The grid integration of renewable generation simultaneously requires additional ancillary services and has the potential to provide ancillary services to the grid. The inverters that are installed with distributed generation systems and roof top solar systems have the potential to provide many of the ancillary services that are traditionally provided by spinning generators and voltage regulators. These services include reactive power compensation, voltage regulation, flicker control, active power filtering and harmonic cancellation.Sortomme, Eric, and Mohamed A. El-Sharkawi. \\"Optimal scheduling of vehicle-to-grid energy and ancillary services.\\" Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on 3.1 (2012): 351-359. Wind turbines with variable-speed generators have the potential to add synthetic inertia to the grid and assist in frequency control.Lalor, Gillian, Alan Mullane, and Mark O'Malley. \\"Frequency control and wind turbine technologies.\\" Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 20.4 (2005): p. 1905-1913. CAISO tested the 131 MW Tule wind farm's synchronverter in 2018, and found it could perform some of the grid services similar or better than traditional generators.Tuel Wind Power Plant Test Results CAISO, 2019 Hydro-Qu√©bec began requiring synthetic inertia in 2005 as the first grid operator, demanding a temporary 6% power boost when countering frequency drop by combining the power electronics with the rotational inertia of a wind turbine rotor. Similar requirements came into effect in Europe in 2016. Electric vehicles Plug-in electric vehicles have the potential to be utilized to provide ancillary services to the grid, specifically load regulation and spinning reserves. Plug-in electric vehicles can behave like distributed energy storage and have the potential to discharge power back to the grid through bidirectional flow, referred to as vehicle-to- grid (V2G). Plug-in electric vehicles have the ability to supply power at a fast rate which enables them to be used like spinning reserves and provide grid stability with the increased use of intermittent generation such as wind and solar. The technologies to utilize electric vehicles to provide ancillary services are not yet widely implemented, but there is much anticipation of their potential.Joos, G., et al. \\"The potential of distributed generation to provide ancillary services.\\" Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 2000.

K. Sajan and produced by Menaka under Revathy Kalamandhir. Starring Suresh Gopi, Priya Raman, Sharada, Lalu Alex and Ratheesh. It was dubbed and released in Telugu as New Delhi. Plot The film starts with NSG Officer Shyam (Suresh Gopi) arresting a terrorist nicknamed Jagmohan Pandey. Justice Usha Varma (Sharada), the judge of the Pandey's trial case, is the sister of Indian Home Secretary Rajagopal Varma (Rajan)(Lalu Alex). In retaliation to the arrest and trial, Pandey's terrorist group kills Unni, Usha's son. Following this incident the government enlists Z Category protection for Justice Usha Varma and her family. Rajan Varma and Balram (Ratheesh) decide to give the assignment to Black Cat Commando Team under Shyam's command. Justice Usha‚Äôs family is distrustful and rude towards Shyam due to his brusque manner and soldier's tough attitude. Shyam is always humiliated and scoffed at by the family, especially by the Judge's daughter Manasi (Priya Raman). The only person who seems to understand him and respect him is the Home Secretary Rajan Verma. Shyam shoots and inadvertently kills Manasi's boyfriend Nathuram (Madhupal), when he tries to trespass her home. Nathuram's death intensifies Usha's and Manasi's hatred towards Shyam . What they all didn't know was that the boyfriend was actually part of the terrorist group planning to kill Usha. Nathuram had been lying that he is based in France, while in reality, he was the son of the terror group's leader and was working with the terrorist group. The terrorists led by Abbas Qureshi later kidnap Manasi in retaliation and thus she understands the truth about Nathuram. After Manasi's kidnap and learning about her son's assassination, Usha Varma requests Shyam's help to keep her alive until she reads the verdict in Pandey's case at the Supreme Court. Later during the exchange for Manasi's release, Shyam infiltrates the terrorist hideout disguised as Pandey. When the real Pandey manages to escape and notify the terrorists about the 'switch' in the exchange, firefight breaks out between NSG Commandos and terrorists . In the ensuing fight Pandey manages to kill Balram, and then Shyam finishes off both Pandey and Abbas Qureshi. The Varma family thanks him for his help and Manasi apologizes for her hatred towards him. The ending scene shows Justice Usha‚Äôs family seeing Shyam at an airport on new assignment and watching him with respect.

She is described as a consort of wise Bhrigu, and the mother of Shukra, the god of the planet Venus and the preceptor of the Asuras or demons. She is the reason why god Vishnu was cursed to take Avatars on Earth. Legend Devi Bhagavata Purana discusses the legend. Once, the Asuras fought a war against the Devas, and their guru Shukra decided to seek the favour of the god Shiva to defeat the Devas. He started penance on Mount Kailash, Shiva's abode, leaving the Asuras unprotected. The Devas came to know of Shukra's intentions and waged a war on the Asuras again. The Asuras rushed to the Hermitage of Shukra, while being chased by Vishnu and the Devas. Males were not present at the hermitage, when asuras arrived. Shukra and his father were work. Kavyamata followed Atithi Dharm and gave protection to asuras for many months. The hermitage was covered by a protective invisible shield that was impossible to be penetrated even by Indra. Devas who arrived at hermitage requested the wife of Bhrigu to release asuras from hermitage, however, she refused and said that they were her atithis (guests). It is not rational to unprotect one's guests. With one glance Kavyamata put all the Devas into a deep sleep. By her meditative power, Kavyamata (Usanas) petrified Indra, the king of the Devas, putting them in a state of paralysis.Mani p. 402 Vishnu assessed the situation and surmised that he would have to break the armour of hermitage to protect the world from eons of chaos that would be ushered with the victory of the Asuras. Vishnu summoned his discus weapon ‚Äî the Sudarshana chakra, and broke the protective shield / armour around the hermitage. While doing so, even Kavyamata's head got cut off who was protecting her guests. Shukra's father, the great sage Bhrigu, became angry when he returned to his hermitage and cursed Vishnu for his sin of woman-slaughter, saying that Vishnu would have to take countless avatars on Earth and suffer pain and confinement due to his sin. Vishnu, who himself overseers that boons and curses come to pass, accepted this curse of the grieving sage. When Shukracharya comes to know about this incidence, he pledges to have war against devas and help asuras, as a revenge of Vishnu's deed with his mother. http://www.telugubhakti.com/telugupages/Sages/Bhrigu.htm Then Bhrigu resurrected Kavyamata (Usanas) by sprinkling holy water from his kamandalu (water-pot). Kavyamata woke as if from a deep sleep.Mani pp. 77-8 The rest of the story remains the same in all versions. In Ramayana Although woman-slaughter is considered a sin in Hinduism, in the great epic Ramayana, the god Rama ‚Äì an avatar of Vishnu ‚Äì is convinced by his guru Vishvamitra that killing the demoness Taraka is right. To convince his pupil, the sage gives the example of Kavyamata who was plotting to \\"appropriate herself to the dominion of Indra\\" and was killed by Vishnu, implying that treacherous and wicked persons could be punished as per the duties (Dharma) of the king.

Reception =Analysis= According to an analysis by Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, a video calibration equipment producer, the industry-standard color spaces used by content providers mean there is no existing source material that contains the fourth color channel. He therefore concludes that any \\"extra\\" colors displayed must be created in the television itself through video processing, resulting in exaggerated, less accurate color. Spectral response of a common Quattron display. The white response was compared with each of the four primaries, given by the respective colored lines. Yellow light produced by the display turns out to be simply the sum of the light that passes through the red pixel and the green pixel. Color researchers at Queen Mary University of London investigated the Quattron technology and found that although Quattron does have four physical color sub-pixels, it does not have a fourth primary in the backlight to drive it (yellow is approximately 575 nm). In other words, Quattron has a yellow sub-pixel to let light through, but the manufacturer has not made any provision to produce the yellow light needed to pass through it. (The yellow subpixel merely lets through more red and green light.) On that basis they conclude that it serves no useful function.

In knot theory, the square knot is a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection. It is closely related to the granny knot, which is also a connected sum of two trefoils. Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the square knot and the granny knot are the simplest of all composite knots. The square knot is the mathematical version of the common reef knot. Construction The square knot can be constructed from two trefoil knots, one of which must be left-handed and the other right-handed. Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise. The resulting connected sum is the square knot. It is important that the original trefoil knots be mirror images of one another. If two identical trefoil knots are used instead, the result is a granny knot. Properties The square knot is amphichiral, meaning that it is indistinguishable from its own mirror image. The crossing number of a square knot is six, which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot. The Alexander polynomial of the square knot is :\\\\Delta(t) = (t - 1 + t^{-1})^2, \\\\, which is simply the square of the Alexander polynomial of a trefoil knot. Similarly, the Alexander‚ÄìConway polynomial of a square knot is : abla(z) = (z^2+1)^2. These two polynomials are the same as those for the granny knot. However, the Jones polynomial for the square knot is :V(q) = (q^{-1} + q^{-3} - q^{-4})(q + q^3 - q^4) = -q^3 + q^2 - q + 3 - q^{-1} + q^{-2} - q^{-3}. \\\\, This is the product of the Jones polynomials for the right-handed and left-handed trefoil knots, and is different from the Jones polynomial for a granny knot. The knot group of the square knot is given by the presentation :\\\\langle x, y, z \\\\mid x y x = y x y, x z x = z x z \\\\rangle. \\\\, This is isomorphic to the knot group of the granny knot, and is the simplest example of two different knots with isomorphic knot groups. Unlike the granny knot, the square knot is a ribbon knot, and it is therefore also a slice knot.

His first film, Muqabala (1942), was the first to feature the double-role or \\"twins\\" phenomenon in Indian cinema, wherein lead actress Fearless Nadia alternated between the good sister and the gangster's moll. The formula was subsequently emulated in numerous Hindi films. Early life and career Bhatt, called Yeshwant Bhatt, was born on 12 June 1915 in Porbandar, British India. He started his early career in films as a sound recordist with Prakash Pictures, working under his brother Balwant Bhatt, and then by writing \\"scripts and stories\\" using the name Batuk Bhatt. He began his directorial venture when he joined Homi Wadia's team at Basant Pictures by co-directing two films with Babubhai Mistri, Muqabala (1942) and Mauj (1943), under the same name. He directed two more films as Batuk Bhatt, Homi Wadia's Hunterwali Ki Beti (1943) and Liberty Pictures Sudhar (1949). Bhatt left Basant Pictures and started his own production company \\"Deepak Pictures\\" in 1946. Personal life Bhatt,was the patriarch of the Bhatt film family. He had five daughters and four sons, including noted film director and producer Mahesh Bhatt, Mukesh Bhatt, and Robin Bhatt.

It is closely related to the square knot, which can also be described as a connected sum of two trefoils. Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial knot, the granny knot and the square knot are the simplest of all composite knots. The granny knot is the mathematical version of the common granny knot. Construction The granny knot can be constructed from two identical trefoil knots, which must either be both left-handed or both right-handed. Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise. The resulting connected sum is the granny knot. It is important that the original trefoil knots be identical to each another. If mirror-image trefoil knots are used instead, the result is a square knot. Properties The crossing number of a granny knot is six, which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot. Unlike the square knot, the granny knot is not a ribbon knot or a slice knot. The Alexander polynomial of the granny knot is :\\\\Delta(t) = (t - 1 + t^{-1})^2, which is simply the square of the Alexander polynomial of a trefoil knot. Similarly, the Conway polynomial of a granny knot is : abla(z) = (z^2+1)^2. These two polynomials are the same as those for the square knot. However, the Jones polynomial for the (right-handed) granny knot is :V(q) = (q^{-1} + q^{-3} - q^{-4})^2 = q^{-2} + 2q^{-4} - 2q^{-5} + q^{-6} - 2q^{-7} + q^{-8}. This is the square of the Jones polynomial for the right- handed trefoil knot, and is different from the Jones polynomial for a square knot. The knot group of the granny knot is given by the presentation :\\\\langle x, y, z \\\\mid x y x = y x y, x z x = z x z \\\\rangle. This is isomorphic to the knot group of the square knot, and is the simplest example of two different knots with isomorphic knot groups.

The first instance is functions of a quaternion variable, where the argument is a quaternion. A second instance involves functions of a motor variable where arguments are split-complex numbers. In mathematical physics, there are hypercomplex systems called Clifford algebras. The study of functions with arguments from a Clifford algebra is called Clifford analysis. A matrix may be considered a hypercomplex number. For example, study of functions of 2 √ó 2 real matrices shows that the topology of the space of hypercomplex numbers determines the function theory. Functions such as square root of a matrix, matrix exponential, and logarithm of a matrix are basic examples of hypercomplex analysis.Felix Gantmacher (1959) The Theory of Matrices, two volumes, translator: Kurt Hirsch, Chelsea Publishing, chapter 5: functions of matrices, chapter 8: roots and logarithms of matrices The function theory of diagonalizable matrices is particularly transparent since they have eigendecompositions.Shaw, Ronald (1982) Linear Algebra and Group Representations, v. 1, ¬ß 2.3, Diagonalizable linear operators, pages 78‚Äì81, Academic Press . Suppose \\\\textstyle T = \\\\sum _{i=1}^N \\\\lambda_i E_i where the Ei are projections. Then for any polynomial \\\\textstyle f, \\\\quad f(T) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\\\lambda_i ) E_i . Modern terminology is algebra for \\"system of hypercomplex numbers\\", and the algebras used in applications are often Banach algebras since Cauchy sequences can be taken to be convergent. Then the function theory is enriched by sequences and series. In this context the extension of holomorphic functions of a complex variable is developed as the holomorphic functional calculus. Hypercomplex analysis on Banach algebras is called functional analysis.

One of the declared aims of the movement is to take Free Software and its ideological implications to computer users ‚Äúacross the digital divide‚Äù, to under-privileged sections of society. Activities * The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) had made mandatory the use of the proprietary Office 365 in all engineering colleges in the country. This mandatory mandate was rescinded after intervention by several groups led by FSMI. * The Free Software Movement of India (FSMI) has alleged that the new Guidelines for Examination of Computer Related Inventions are illogical. It argues that they violate the spirit and law contained in the amended Patents Act of 1970 and could pose a grave threat to innovation in our country. It cautioned that permitting software patents through the backdoor would severely restrict the innovative capabilities and would adversely impact the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of the youth in the India. * FSMI has strongly criticized the Indian Telecom Giant Airtel for tampering user's online communications on its 3G network, and maliciously inserting advertisements into its user's data. In a statement issued they also stated that Airtel acted in violation of the privacy rights of at least thousands if not millions of Indian citizens and has rendered their online communications unsafe. FSMI appealed to all groups working on net neutrality to oppose Airtel and Flash Networks illegal and unethical actions and share the code that exposes Airtel widely, thus defeating corporate attempts to muzzle citizens right to free speech (which are only intended to cover up acts of corporate malfeasance). * A call to Protest on 9 June 2012 for Internet Freedom was given by FSMI to which there was a good response across the country. In Hyderabad police scuttled a planned protest by activists of Free Software Movement of India (FSMI). A good number of software engineers, students and other campaigners assembled near People's Plaza on the Necklace Road.A senior police official threatened FSMI activists with arrest and confiscation of all protest material and T-shirts. The activists contended that theirs was a token protest and they had no plans to organise a rally. The police initially took Y.

The conference was inaugurated by former President of India Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. The concept of Free Software, wherein knowledge is created by the community for the community, without being driven by commercial interests, must be extended to research to solve problems in health care, agriculture, energy and safe drinking water, the former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, said. Controversy A report in the Malayalam daily Mathrubhumi stated that the new organisation was under the tutelage of certain political parties and that it had driven a wedge in the free software movement in India by sidetracking the Free Software Foundation of India (FSFI). The report in Mathrubhumi was criticized by FSMI in another newspaper for not upholding basic journalistic ethics and code of conduct of contacting the FSMI leadership before making allegations. A rejoinder to the report has been published by FSMI. FSFI and organizations part of FSMI such as FSMK have worked together on many aspects and will continue to collaborate on an issue basis. The Mathrubhumi article stated that the general secretary of FSMI, Kiran Chandra was a representative of Novell while the FSFI website showed that he is on the Board of Directors. Contradicting the Mathrubhumi report, FSMI follows a policy similar to FSFI of accepting funding from corporations while not endorsing them.

RaRa was active in the 1980s and 1990s within the Netherlands, bombing sites to express opposition to the apartheid policies of South Africa as well as to the Dutch asylum legislation. Their bombings caused a lot of material damage, but no deaths resulted. Makro and Van Leer attacks In 1985 and 1986 RaRa fire bombed and destroyed divisions of Makro, a chain of wholesale traders. As a result, Makro ended all economic activity in South Africa. RaRa targeted Forbo, a Dutch maker of floor coverings, and Forbo also withdrew from South Africa. RaRa also bombed various facilities of the Shell oil company, because it expanded its business in South Africa. RaRa also set fire to the Amsterdam head office of the Royal Packing Industry Van Leer BV on 9 July 1986. The Dutch Interior Minister referred to RaRa as \\"terrorists\\" in connection with these arson attacks. SHV attacks In January 1987 Steenkolen Handels Vereniging (SHV) pulled out of South Africa because of arson attacks by RaRa.

One of the members of RaRa was quoted as saying, in connection with the SHV pull-out, \\"According to the rules of TV democracy, those with the most access to the media win.\\" Arrests and conviction On 11 April 1988 the police arrested 8 people they thought to be behind the RaRa bombings. Another person surrendered shortly thereafter, and a tenth suspect was arrested in May 1986. Only one of the suspects was prosecuted and tried, Ren√© Roemersma. He was convicted on four of seven charges, the most serious of which was arson, for his part in two 1986 attacks on Dutch wholesale traders, a January attack on a Dutch passport printer, and the sabotage of a Shell station in Nieuwegein. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. A higher court subsequently changed the verdict to a sentence of 18 months imprisonment because some evidence was illegally obtained as the public persecutor during a search of seven properties had been temporarily absent. The others arrested at the same time as Roemersma were released for lack of evidence. When Roemersma was sentenced, roughly 100 sympathizers protested outside the Amsterdam High Court, where they threw stones at the windows of the court. 1990s attacks On 12 November 1991, RaRa bombed the private house of Aad Kosto, member of the Dutch government. In 1990 and 1991 RaRa also bombed the building of the Dutch Departments of Justice and of Internal Affairs. The Dutch intelligence service was surprised by the 1991 attacks. After the 1991 attacks the RaRa claimed to \\"want to stop the asylum policy which abandons people, excludes them and dehumanizes them.\\" In 1993 RaRa bombed the building of the Department of Social Affairs.

Biopgraphy  Dora Siegel (later Gad) was born in C√¢mpulung, Romania. She grew up in the home of her grandfather, and attended Hebrew school and a government-run school. Between 1930 and 1934, she studied at the Technische Universit√§t in Vienna, and received her diploma in engineering and architecture. There, she met her future husband, Heinrich Yehezkel Goldberg, an architecture student. They married in 1936, immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. In 1959 she married Ephraim Ben-Artzi, a former general and public figure.  Interior design career  Gad began her career in the office of architect Oskar Kaufmann. In 1938 she began to work independently. In 1942 she began to design private apartments together with her husband. Her style was light and modern, drawing from local inspiration; abundant light, and local building materials. Gad incorporated locally available fabrics, wool carpets, woven work, straw and felt in her designs. Her style set her apart from many European educated architects of the day, who maintained more European styles of architecture. By the 1950s, the couple were already prominent interior designers in Israel. They were involved in the planning of many government buildings and institutions. After the death of Yehezkel Gad in 1958, Gad established a partnership with Arieh Noy, an employee in her office. The Gad-Noy firm continued to work on governmental projects, and they were responsible, in 1965, for the design of the Israel Museum, together with architect Al Mansfeld, and in 1966, for the interior design of the Knesset building.The official Knesset website The Gad-Noy firm operated until 1976.

George Kastrioti Skanderbeg was the ruler of Albania () who had been leading a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire since 1443 and allied himself with several European monarchs in order to consolidate his domains. In 1458, Alfonso V of Aragon, ruler of Sicily and Naples and Skanderbeg's most important ally, died, leaving his illegitimate son, Ferdinand, on the Neapolitan throne; Ren√© d'Anjou, the French Duke of Anjou, laid claim to the throne. The conflict between Ren√©'s and Ferdinand's supporters soon erupted into a civil war. Pope Calixtus III, of Spanish background himself, could do little to secure Ferdinand, so he turned to Skanderbeg for aid. In 1457, Skanderbeg had achieved his most famous victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Uj√´bardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son by sending a military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce and he was still sending his armies against Bosnia and the Byzantine Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy. Due to fears of an approaching Ottoman army, Skanderbeg first sent his nephew, Constantine, with 500 cavalry to Barletta. They were incorporated into Ferdinand's forces to combat his Angevin rivals. They held back their enemy for a year, but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461. Before reaching Italy, Skanderbeg visited Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign. Meanwhile, his men landed in Italy and Angevin forces lifted their siege on Barletta. Upon arriving, Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally's enemies with great success. Ferdinand's adversaries thus began to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of Orsara, although it is not known if Skanderbeg's men participated. Background In 1456, Skanderbeg's ally, Janos Hunyadi, died, and his son, Mathias Corvinus, was crowned King of Hungary. Hunyadi had been an advocate for an offensive war against the Ottoman Empire, whereas the Hungarian nobility and his son promoted a defensive war. The next year, however, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defeated a sizable Ottoman force at the Battle of Albulena (Uj√´bardha). Rome had been desperately waiting for such a victory after the Siege of Belgrade, as Pope Calixtus III had wanted to assure himself of the feasibility of a crusade before declaring one. Calixtus thus named Skanderbeg the Captain-General of the Curia; to secure the pope's interests, Skanderbeg sent twelve Turkish prisoners of war that had been captured at Albulena to Rome. Despite seeing his forces defeated the year before, Sultan Mehmed II prepared another force to be sent into Albania. The country had been obstructing his ambitions for empire in the West and he grew restless to defeat Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg sent delegations to several Western European states to convince them to stop fighting each other and unite for Calixtus' crusade. =Italian situation= Portrait of Skanderbeg in the alt= A portrait of Skanderbeg, the ruler of Albania who led a war against the Ottoman Empire. On 27 September 1458, Alfonso V of Aragon, Skanderbeg's most important and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta, died. In 1448, as a gesture of friendship with Alfonso, Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios Reres to Crotone to quell a rebellion against Alfonso. The next year, many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled. Upon hearing of his ally's death, Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King of Naples, Ferdinand I, to give condolence for his father's death, but also to congratulate him on his accession to the throne of Naples. The succession was not without turbulence, however: Ren√© d'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled Naples before Aragon had taken control of it, and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso's illegitimate son. The Southern Italian nobility, many of Angevin background, supported Ren√© d'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand. Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini, the Prince of Taranto, and Jacopo Piccinino, a famed condottieri who had been invited by the Angevins. Francisco Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was wary of a French presence in Italy, sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew, Alessandro Sforza, to command his army in southern Italy. Pope Calixtus, a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control of Naples, was in no position to help the weak Ferdinand, so he turned to Skanderbeg for help. However, by that time, Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except Naples, Capua, Aversa, Gaeta, Troia, and Barletta, where Ferdinand was besieged. Skanderbeg had received much aid from Ferdinand's father, Alfonso, and was still a vassal of the Crown of Aragon, so he felt the need to repay the Crown. He accepted the pope's pleas to go to Italy and aid Ferdinand. Skanderbeg's stated reasoning was two-fold: he wanted to remain loyal to his ally and he wanted to prevent an Angevin takeover of Naples since they had maintained friendly relations with the Turks. Skanderbeg also feared that if the Angevins took Naples, they would turn to Albania where they had previously maintained a kingdom. On the other hand, before undertaking any action against the Angevins, he took measures to soften relations with Venice. Seeing that Southern Italy was locked in conflict, Venice no longer feared an Aragonese- Albanian alliance and the Senate decided to take a friendlier approach in Albanian-Venetian relations. Meanwhile, Pope Calixtus III had died and was succeeded by Pope Pius II. Sensing that war would soon begin, Pius tried to convince Giovanni Orsini, Ferdinand's main rival, to settle his differences with the King. The French King, Louis XI, took up the Angevin stance and, in the hopes of convincing Pius to allow the French takeover of Naples, proposed the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges which undermined the pope's power and he even declared that he would be willing to lend 70,000 men for the planned papal crusade. Pius, however, was wary of insincerity and disregarded these proposals. A further effort to deter Skanderbeg's landing was made by Sigismondo Malatesta, the Lord of Rimini and Italy's most feared petty tyrant, who had tried to invite Mehmed to Italy with a detailed map of the Adriatic if Ferdinand sent for the Albanian. The manuscript, however, never reached the sultan and fell into Pius' hands. =Albanian situation= Duomo of Siena alt= A fresco of Pope Piuss II, one of Skanderbeg's main supporters. Constant news of Ottoman campaigns against Bosnia and Byzantine Morea but not against Albania seemed to suggest to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been considering an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter took advantage of this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lek√´ Dukagjini, who had been trying to expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses. Pius II continued to support Skanderbeg, but did not provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg's military skill and his soldiers' aptitude for battle were enough to hold back the Turkish armies. However, the pope still considered Skanderbeg's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade. In 1459, after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia, Ottoman envoys appealed for a three-year armistice between Skanderbeg's Albania and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope's crusade as he believed the crusade's only hope for success was Skanderbeg. In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion, Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope's approval. Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg's loyalty. As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans, Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania. In order to regain the pope's trust, Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace. Skanderbeg, nevertheless, was disappointed by Rome's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade. The Council ended in failure, signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West. He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged, something which Rome soon allowed. Before sending his men to Italy, Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was to receive Skanderbeg's envoy on 9 June 1460. He requested the city's support for the transport of his warriors to southern Italy over the Adriatic. Venice was not consulted since they pursued their own interests in Italy, whereas Ragusa held close economic relations with the Crown of Aragon. Meanwhile, Skanderbeg sent Martin Muzaka to Rome where he presented Pius with Skanderbeg's plans, and Pius in turn notified Ferdinand. Pius then ordered Venice to guard the Albanian coastline. Skanderbeg then decided to send a troop of his men while he remained in Albania. In mid-June 1461, Skanderbeg agreed to a ceasefire with Mehmed who used this time to finally conquer Trebizond (Trabzon) in the northeastern part of modern Turkey. The truce was agreed to last for three years. First landings On 17 September 1460, Skanderbeg sent 500 cavalry to Barletta in Apulia under the command of his nephew, Constantine, who at the time was 22 or 23 years old. The battles for the Crown of Naples up to that point had been minor with not much more than one-thousand troops per belligerent. Ferdinand's Neapolitan army as a whole stood at 7,000 men. The addition of 500 Albanian cavalry, even though they were not cuirassed like their Italian counterparts, increased his force's effectiveness. By this time, Ferdinand had lost most of his territory, and was left with some fortresses in Apulia and the area surrounding Naples. The Angevins were swiftly approaching Naples and Ferdinand prepared a counteroffensive. He first secured what he had by putting Roberto del Balzo Orsini in command, but Orsini's incompetence held up the Neapolitan army. By this time, Skanderbeg's men had already arrived, and Ferdinand commenced his offensive. Albanian light-cavalry warfare was first noted here for its swiftness and effectiveness where they were reported to travel per day as opposed to the Italian cavalry which could only travel . The Albanians were encouraged by Ferdinand to fight in their traditional manner and to raid the territory; Ferdinand informed Francisco Sforza that the Albanians had been devastating Apulia and taking whatever loot they could. These events worried the Angevins and prompted Giovanni Orsini to try to stop Skanderbeg from pouring his men into Italy. Ren√© d'Anjou had been particularly surprised by Skanderbeg's action since he believed that he had never offended the Albanian. =Orsini‚ÄìSkanderbeg correspondence= Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand's fiercest rival. He had been, however, Alfonso's faithful ally and had developed an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania. After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival, Orsini allied with the Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples. He then sent a letter to convince Skanderbeg to pull his men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand's fortunes were hopeless, that Skanderbeg's fame would die out after his supposed debacle, and that an alliance with Ren√© would be much more rewarding than an alliance with Ferdinand. Skanderbeg's letter in response, dated to 10 October 1460, stated that he was not a condottieri looking for fortune, but a mature man looking to help his ally. Furthermore, he sent another letter to Ferdinand assuring him his loyalty. Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy, something the Italian rulers did not believe. The letters elucidate Skanderbeg's political motives behind his Italian expedition, presenting himself as a noble ally, and also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg's court. They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand's rivals: Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city-states from Roman expansion. =Neapolitan counteroffensive= By October 1460, Ferdinand was able to recapture his western territories from Capua to Beneventum. In his eastern frontier, however, his enemies remained at large. The most dangerous among them was Piccinino. Piccinino had undertaken the task of blocking papal and Neapolitan troops en route to Apulia. Since Roberto Orsini, the man left in charge of the east and Giovanni Orsini's brother who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, was deemed incompetent, Ferdinand invited Constantine to Naples, offering him a leading role in an operation against Piccinino. Along with Constantine's cavalry, Francesco del Balzo, the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, managed to defeat Ercole d'Este in Gargano. They then had control over the custom-duties gathered there which brought 30,000 ducats annually from which most of Piccinino's pay came. The fighting continued for three months after which Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory. Piccinino prepared his own counteroffensive, along with Giovanni Orsini's men, laying siege to the main castles. A fierce battle soon erupted over Venosa on 28 May 1461 where the Albanian cavalry took part. Ferdinand abandoned the city and fled back to Apulia. Near Troia, he met Skanderbeg's ambassador, Gjok√´ Stres Balsha, who informed him that Skanderbeg was ready to land in Italy as soon as the proper galleys were provided. Skanderbeg's expedition =Preparations and Ragusan voyage= Before leaving for Italy, Skanderbeg needed to accumulate the appropriate finances. Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia to give a third of what it had raised for the forthcoming crusade to Skanderbeg. The pope also ordered 1,000 florins to be given to Skanderbeg from the Vatican's funds. The Ragusan banks held this amount, but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion, they refused to continue funding the crusade; Stefan Vukƒçiƒá of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania. They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg's expedition to Italy. Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships (he had, however, received several smaller ships to transport his troops), Skanderbeg's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta. Before the siege began, however, Ferndinand sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting. Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife, Donika, in charge of his affairs. Map of the alt= A map of the Republic of Ragusa which Skanderbeg visited before setting foot in Italy. A Venetian ambassador on his way from Constantinople reported that Skanderbeg had assembled 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry along with several papal and Neapolitan ships at Capo-di-Lachi () near modern-day Kavaj√´. He was still awaiting a supply of grain and two Neapolitan ships, however, so he continued to wait. On 21‚Äì22 August 1461, the four galleys sent by Ferdinand arrived. He boarded soon thereafter but he did not send his entire force directly to Apulia. He sent Gjok√´ Balsha (who had returned from Italy) with 500 cavalry and 1,000 infantry to the besieged Ferdinand, whereas Skanderbeg himself went to Ragusa to convince its rectors there to give him his needed funds. Balsha's men landed in Barletta on 24 August 1461. The Angevin forces, among whom was Giovanni Orsini, feared that Skanderbeg himself was the leader of this force, so they lifted the siege of Barletta immediately. Balsha then informed Ferdinand that Skanderbeg would arrive after his voyage to Ragusa. Ferdinand felt that Skanderbeg's personal involvement was essential and began to worry when he did not come in two days, as Balsha had promised. Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 along with the Pal Engj√´lli, the Archbishop of Durr√´s. His men stayed on the ships anchored in the harbor while he went into the city. Due to papal pressure, the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg's requests. His fame was visible when he walked through the city- gates and the population poured into the streets to see him. He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry. He then received the financial sum he had come for. His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign. His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present. On 29 August 1461, Skanderbeg set off for Apulia, but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island. On 3 September 1461, Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta. =Skanderbeg in Italy= Skanderbeg disembarking in Italy - Engraving by Jost Amman 1587 Even though they lifted the siege of Barletta upon seeing Skanderbeg's approaching men the week before, Angevin forces remained active. Once Skanderbeg arrived, Ferdinand put him in command of the fortress of Barletta whereas the King himself went to Ariano Irpino. Once left in command of the fortress, Skanderbeg moved against Ferdinand's rivals. Among them were Giovanni Orsini, Jean d'Anjou (the Duke of Calabria), Piccinino, and Francesco del Balzo. They had stationed themselves in Andria, where the Albanian assaults continued. The Albanian cavalry's light armament, swift horses, and loose ranks allowed them to quickly overcome the more heavily armed Italian cavalry, which fought in tight formations. In one of their operations, an Albanian warrior captured Alois Minutulo, the lord of the Castle of Monte Sant'Angelo who was imprisoned in the Fortress of Barletta. Three years later, Ferdinand would present Skanderbeg with the castle as a token of his gratitude. Ferdinand's opponents, under Piccinino's main command, tried to open battle with Skanderbeg, but due to the combined strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces, they withdrew from the Andrian fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti. News of Piccinino's retreat reached Venice who sent a message to Francisco Sforza. Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto, where Giovanni Orsini was prince. Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him, but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini's faithfulness, so Skanderbeg continued raiding Orsini's territory. He split his army into three parts, one under Moisi Arianit Golemi, the other under Vladan Gjurica, and the last under his command. He led attacks against Ferdinand's enemies in three directions without halt, thoroughly exhausting them. During the month of October, Skanderbeg continued to pillage Orisini's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in Calabria, where he recaptured Cosenza and Castrovillari. At this point, Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected. On 27 October, Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of Gisualdo. Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted, believing that peace was near. left Piccinino, however, did not seek to maintain the agreement as one of his deserters reported. Upon learning this, Skanderbeg decided to open battle with Piccinino's men. After feeding his men and preparing his horses, Skanderbeg set off by moonlight for the Angevin camp. He found the place empty, however, since one of Piccinino's men had already informed Piccinino on the Albanians' intentions. Skanderbeg then returned to Barletta where he was reinforced by Ferdinand and his men. He then split his army into two, one under Alessandro Sforza's command, the other under his, and he approached Troia. Jean d'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera, however, eight miles from Troia. Knowing that battle would come between Troia and Lucera, Skanderbeg set out by night to capture Seggiano, a mountain lying between the two cities, where he stationed some of his men to protect it. Thence, his men could find refuge in case of defeat. Piccinino had the same objective in mind and set out to capture the mountain, but instead met Skanderbeg's men. He thus kept his men in order for the coming battle. The next day, the two armies met. The battle lasted until dusk, but Jean's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee. Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns. He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta and 200 of his men to launch assaults on the papal state. Skanderbeg's next task was to recapture Trani, the second most important point in Apulia, aside from Barletta. He succeeded in capturing the commander of the garrison, Fuscia de Foxa, who had rebelled against Ferdinand. Fuscia was outside the walls of Trani with sixteen men when Skanderbeg saw him and surrounded him and then tried to convince him to abandon Orsini, whereby Fuscia refused for pecuniary reasons. On the morning of 28 December 1461, with Fuscia's pleas, Gracciani, the vice-commander of the garrison, surrendered Trani. Both Fuscia and Gracciani, however, refused to hand over the garrison's munitions. Skanderbeg threatened to imprison them if they did not surrender what they were asked to, forcing the two to hand over Trani's stores. After weeks of marauding, Skanderbeg and his Aragonese colleagues joined Alessandro Sforza's men. They then yielded all of the fortresses that they had recaptured to Ferdinand. Aftermath Seeing that their fortunes were dwindling, Ferdinand's rivals tried to settle for peace with Francisco Sforza. Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively, something that Ferdinand refused. This was one of Skanderbeg's last personal actions in Italy. He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 when he returned to Albania, leaving his soldiers in Italy. His reason for leaving Italy is not clear, but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary, something which could be turned against Albania. On his return route, he again visited Ragusa, where he was likewise welcomed as a hero. He wanted to set off for Albania immediately, but bad weather forced him to stay. He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors, suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land, but instead, after ten days in Ragusa, he sailed by ship to Albania. Before leaving, he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia. The war over the Crown of Naples continued for several more months after Skanderbeg left. It is not known if Albanian warriors fought in the ensuing battles. In August 1462, Ferdinand achieved a decisive victory at Orsara. Skanderbeg's expedition made him famous throughout Italy. In his book, De Bello Neapolitano (), Iovianus Pontanus sees the Albanian landing as essential to Ferdinand's victory: their quick maneuvering and swift assaults virtually immobilized the Italian warriors. Skanderbeg's expedition succeeded in lifting the Siege of Barletta, capturing Trani through a ruse, forcing the Angevins to turn from an offensive to a defensive strategy, and devastating the land to the point where its inhabitants and Giovanni Orsini were forced to submit to Ferdinand, even allowing Ferdinand to safely attend the wedding of Antonio Piccolomini, Pius II's nephew. Moreover, the campaign was instrumental in securing the Neapolitan kingdom for Ferdinand. For his services, Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant'Angelo to Skanderbeg where many of his men soon settled. They settled fifteen villages in the rolling landscapes to the east of Taranto. His return to Albania was greeted as a triumph by his followers. Despite the jubilation, however, Skanderbeg began to prepare for war. On 7 July 1462, the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania. The first major engagement was at Mokra on 7 July 1462. In the following Macedonian campaign in August of the same year, Skanderbeg defeated three Ottoman armies in one month. On 27 April 1463, Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty, but later, on 9 September 1463, Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans. On 12 October 1463, Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined.

He is principally remembered in the popular tradition for having called his bishops 'the blind leading the blind', an act of presumption for which he was punished by becoming blind himself.  Ezekiel's patriarchate  Ezekiel's birthplace is not known, but like most of the sixth-century Nestorian patriarchs he was probably a native of northern Iraq. He was appointed bishop of Zabe (Arabic: al-Zawabi), a diocese in the ecclesiastical Province of the Patriarch, by the patriarch Joseph (552‚Äì67).Chronicle of Seert, ii. 86‚Äì7 and 89 He became patriarch of the Church of the East in 570, shortly after the death of his deposed predecessor Joseph, and held the office for eleven years. Although there was some opposition to his election, he soon won over the doubters by his sensible policies. Instead of stirring up trouble by removing the men appointed by his predecessor, he confirmed all the priests and deacons ordained by Joseph. However, he was too much of a realist to be entirely successful in his handling of his bishops, who had to deal with the effects of a terrible plague in Mesopotamia that had broken out towards the end of Joseph‚Äôs reign. The Persian authorities were unable to cope with the heavy loss of life, and bodies lay unburied in the streets. In Seleucia-Ctesiphon, according to the eighth-century historian Bar Sahde of Kirkuk, the detested patriarch Joseph had led a gang of gravediggers to clear away the corpses, setting an example of courage and sacrifice that had won grudging praise even from his detractors. As the plague continued to rage during the reign of Ezekiel, the metropolitans of Adiabene and Beth Garmai did what they could to keep up the spirits of their flock. They ordered services of penitence and intercession to be held in all the churches under their jurisdiction, as the Ninevites had supposedly done in the days of the prophet Jonah. The ‚ÄòRogation of the Ninevites‚Äô, as this service was called, is still observed every year by the Church of the East. To Ezekiel, however, a service of penitence was an empty gesture, and he angrily observed that his bishops were no better than ‚Äòthe blind leading the blind‚Äô. Two years before his death Ezekiel himself went blind, a misfortune widely held to have been a divine judgement on him for his presumption.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 59 At this period there was a considerable Nestorian Christian presence in east Arabia, a region known in Syriac as Beth Qatraye.peter hellyer.

Sources for Ezekiel's patriarchate  Accounts of Ezekiel's reign can be found in several Nestorian ecclesiastical histories, including the anonymous ninth-century Chronicle of Seert and the later histories attributed to Mari (twelfth-century),  øAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). Ezekiel is also the subject of a brief notice in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280). The acts of a synod held by Ezekiel in 576 have also survived, and have been published by J. B. Chabot in his classic collection of the synods of the Church of the East, Synodicon Orientale. Modern assessments of Ezekiel's reign can be found in Wigram's An Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church, Baum and Winkler's The Church of the East and Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Wigram, An Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church, 212‚Äì14; Baum and Winkler, The Church of the East, 34; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 59‚Äì60 = The Chronicle of Seert = The following detailed account of Ezekiel's reign is given in the Chronicle of Seert, probably written in the second half of the ninth century: > This father was a disciple of the catholicus Mar Aba and the bishop of al- > Zawabi.

It is a self-governing body, both in its administrative function as well as its academic pursuits. It is one of the nine members of the symposium Some Institutes for Advanced Study (SIAS). The IIAS is located at the Edmond J. Safra Campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Givat Ram. The Institute brings together scholars from around the world to engage in collaborative research projects for periods of four to twelve months. Throughout over forty years of existence it has been dedicated to unrestricted academic research. History The Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem was founded in 1975 by Israeli mathematician Aryeh Dvoretzky, winner of the Israel Prize for Mathematics. Visits to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey inspired Prof. Dvoretzky to establish an IAS in Jerusalem in 1975. In March, 1976 Dvoretzky wrote: In 1982, Yuval Ne'eman, Professor of Physics and Minister of Science, established the first School in Theoretical Physics at the Jerusalem IAS. Prof. Steven Weinberg, Nobel laureate in Physics, was asked to become the director of the School, a post he held for twelve years. Four additional Schools were established, based on the same model, in the following fields: Economics, Life Sciences, Jewish Studies and Comparative Religion, and Mathematics. Each School is headed by a preeminent scholar in his or her field.

Each lasts seven to twelve days, and is headed by an internationally preeminent scholar, working alongside an Israeli co-director. Attendees include senior scholars, doctoral students, and postdoctoral researchers. The Institute subsidizes participants in the form of travel grants, tuition or hotel expenses. The Israeli coordinator allocates scholarships to candidates and assumes responsibility for technical arrangements. Scholars have come to the institute from Western and Eastern Europe, South and North America, East Asia, and North Africa. The IIAS also hosts conferences and lecture series, sometimes associated with schools, such as the Ada Lovelace Bicentenary Lectures on Computability during 2015‚Äì16.

In the early 1950s, Patz discovered that oxygen therapy was the cause of an epidemic of blindness among some 10,000 premature babies. Following his discovery, there was a sixty percent reduction in childhood blindness in the United States. He also conducted pioneering research in the 1960s into the use of lasers in the treatment of retinal disorders. He received the Lasker Award in 1956 for his research into the causes and prevention of blindness and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 for his lifetime of work in the field of ophthalmology. Biography =Early years= Patz was born in Elberton, Georgia. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania, and Patz was the youngest of seven children in the only Jewish family in Elberton. He attended Emory University in Atlanta and received both bachelor's and medical degrees there. After graduating from Emory University School of Medicine in 1945, Patz joined the U.S. Army and served at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. After leaving the military, Patz began a residency in ophthalmology at Gallinger Municipal Hospital (later known as District of Columbia General Hospital) in Washington, D.C. =Study of oxygen as cause of childhood blindness= While Patz was in training at Gallinger, he observed more than 20 infants who had developed severe retrolental fibroplasia after receiving continuous oxygen therapy. An epidemic of blindness among some 10,000 premature babies in the 1940s and the early 1950s became one of \\"the great medical mysteries of the postwar era.\\" Patz hypothesized that there was a correlation between the high rate of blindness and the use of pure oxygen to treat premature babies. \\"It had become standard practice to put babies in incubators and crank up the oxygen,\\" Patz said in a 2004 interview with the Baltimore Sun. Patz proposed a clinical study to test his hypothesis, but the National Institutes of Health refused to fund the study on ethical grounds, fearing the study would \\"kill a lot of babies by anoxia to test a wild idea.\\" Unable to obtain a grant, Patz borrowed money from his family to conduct a clinical study at Gallinger in the early 1950s. Patz conducted the study between 1951 and 1953 in conjunction with Leroy Hoeck (1911‚Äì2009), a pediatrician who was in charge of the newborn nursery at Gallinger. In the study, some infants were given concentrated oxygen, and others were given concentrated oxygen only if they showed signs of respiratory distress. The study confirmed Patz's suspicion as 12 infants on concentrated oxygen went blind while only one of the infants receiving normal oxygen went blind. Further study established that elevated oxygen levels caused abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye, irreversibly damaging the retina. After Patz's findings became known, the use of high-dose oxygen therapy was limited, and there was a sixty percent reduction in childhood blindness in the United States. =Johns Hopkins= In 1955, Patz accepted a part-time faculty position at Johns Hopkins University while maintaining a private ophthalmology practice. In 1970, he joined the Johns Hopkins faculty on a full-time basis as a research professor. He served as the director of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins from 1979 to 1989. He was also a founder of the Johns Hopkins' Retinal Vascular Center. In the late 1960s, Patz also conducted pioneering research on the use of lasers and collaborated with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory on the development of one of the first argon lasers used in the treatment of retinal disorders. Patz also worked with the Maryland Eye Bank, built an 80-foot radio tower at his home and \\"became known to ham-radio operators across the country for putting out word on the airwaves whenever corneas were needed for transplant.\\" =Awards and accolades= In 1956, Patz and , a biochemist who worked with Patz on a larger study that confirmed Patz's findings, received the Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award. Helen Keller presented Patz and Kinsey with the award. The Wall Street Journal called Patz the man who \\"helped solve the riddle of how 10,000 babies went blind.\\" The New York Times credited him with \\"saving countless babies from blindness\\", and, through his research on the use of lasers, with \\"preserving the sight of adults with common conditions that cause blindness.\\" U.S. President George W. Bush awarded Patz the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2004. Patz was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom \\"for his lifetime contributions to the field of ophthalmology, including his discovery of the most common cause of childhood blindness in the early 1950s.\\" At the time of the award, Bush called Patz \\"the man who has given to uncounted men, women and children the gift of sight.\\" Patz also served as president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and wrote more than 250 scientific publications and four textbooks. He was also the recipient of the Friedenwald Research Award in 1980, the inaugural Isaac C. Michaelson Medal in 1986, the first Helen Keller prize for Vision Research in 1994, and the Pisart International Vision Award from the Lighthouse International in 2001. =Later years and death= In his later years, Patz studied the impact of deafness on Beethoven's music. He also received a master's degree in liberal arts from Johns Hopkins at age 78. Patz died of heart disease in March 2010 at his home in Pikesville, Maryland. Patz died at age 89 one day before the 60th anniversary of his wedding to the former Ellen Levy.

For example, for axial-fed dish antennas, the antenna boresight is the axis of symmetry of the parabolic dish, and the antenna radiation pattern (the main lobe) is symmetrical about the boresight axis. Most antennas boresight axis is fixed by their shape and cannot be changed. However phased array antennas can electronically steer the beam, changing the angle of the boresight by shifting the relative phase of the radio waves emitted by different antenna elements, and even radiate beams in multiple directions (multiple boresights). The term boresight came from high-gain antennas such as parabolic dishes, which produce narrow, pencil-shaped beams which are difficult to aim accurately at a distant receiving antenna. These often are equipped with optical boresights to assist in aiming.

A monotypic genus, it contains the single rare truffle-like species Fevansia aurantiaca, found in old-growth forests of Oregon. The name Fevansia honors Frank Evans of the North American Truffling Society, who collected the holotype specimen. ' is Latin for \\"pale orange\\", referring to the color of the peridium. Description Truffles are fungi that have evolved to be hypogeous, or below the ground, and thus they have reduced morphological features. Some of the features commonly analyzed on truffles are the peridium, or the outside, the gleba, which is the inner tissue which contains the spores, and the spores themselves. The peridium of Fevansia is 100‚Äì200 ¬µm thick. The gleba is firm and moist and the color is pale orange with either a pink or an orange tint. The spores are 10‚Äì13 by 3.5‚Äì5 ¬µm, spindle-shaped, and smooth and appear in large groups to be gray-yellow and appear pale yellow when observed singly. Classification The fungus was originally classified as a member of the family Rhizopogonaceae (order Boletales) because of its general morphological similarity to the genera Alpova and Rhizopogon section Rhizopogonella. Recent (2013) molecular phylogenetic analysis, however, indicates that Fevansia is a member of the family Albatrellaceae in the order Russulales. For this reason, it is suspected to be mycorrhizal (like all other known Albatrellus species), although this has not yet been confirmed. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Fevansia aurentiaca truffles are found in the Pacific Northwest but are uncommon. Truffles are hypogeous by nature, leading to a certain degree of difficulty in finding them. As a result, there are few specimens available for genetic analysis. Most of the Fevansia specimens can be found in the Mycological Herbarium of Oregon State University. Truffles are most commonly found in forest ecosystems, where they form symbiotic relationships with trees, one example of this symbiotic relationship is ectomycorrhiza (ECM). While most truffles form ectomycorrhizal relationships, it is unclear is this is true of F. aurentiaca. There are no DNA matches to ECM root tips that suggests Fevasia forms these relationships. It is most likely, however, because it is most often found under ECM forming Pinaceae. The new DNA evidence that puts Fevansia in the Albatrellaceae also suggests that it is an ECM symbiont, like most members of that family.

However, this term also has a more specific meaning, referring to non-ruling but legal political parties in an authoritarian or totalitarian regime (most notably Communist regimes) as auxiliary parties and members of a ruling coalition, differing such governments from a pure one-party state, although such parties are not considered opposition parties or alternative sources of power.; ; Sometimes, bloc party is called a satellite party. Background The concept has its roots in the Popular front idea where Marxist and non-Marxist political parties and other organisations would belong in an umbrella organisation. Following the end of World War II, elections were held in areas already under Soviet influence who would become members of the Eastern Bloc, while giving voters choice, would be seen as a step towards a totalitarian, Communist-led regime. Bloc parties were able to retain their non-Marxist orientation, but in practice were always subordinate to the ruling Communist party, and all legal parties and civic organisations were required to be members of the official coalition. Elections were not competitive as the composition of legislatures was generally pre-determined. Parties only occasionally dissented from the line of the ruling party. Some parties were pre-existing, others had been newly formed, to appeal to specific sectors of society. However, during the fall of Communism, many hitherto subordinate bloc parties would begin to assert their independence and play a role in the democratisation process, while others would be unable to continue functioning either due to a loss of guaranteed yet artificial representation (granted to them by the ruling Communist Party), or due to the stigma of being associated with subservience to the Communists, and would either dissolve or fade into obscurity. Bloc parties under Communist regimes East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria operated bloc party systems where non-Marxist parties were constituent members of an official coalition. A similar system operates in China today. =East Germany= In the German Democratic Republic, the National Front was the umbrella organisation which included the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany, other political parties and various non- party organisations. Along similar lines to the formation of parties in West Germany, new parties in the Soviet zone (that would become the German Democratic Republic) were formed to replace the parties of the pre-Nazi period, whereas the Social Democratic Party of Germany and Communist Party of Germany merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. These parties were the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD), and later the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD) and Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany (DBD).B. Vogel, D. Nohlen & R.-O. Schultze (1971). Wahlen in Deutschland: Theorie, Geschichte, Dokumente 1848‚Äì1970. Berlin, New York: De Gruyter. pp. 253-283; R. Kulbach, H. Weber & E. F√∂rtsch (1969). Parteien im Blocksystem der DDR. Cologne: Verlag Wissenschaft und Politik; R. Schr√∂der (2004). Geschichte des DDR-Rechts. Jura. 26 (2): 73‚Äì81, accessible under forhistiur.de. As the Communists consolidated their power, the bloc parties all jettisoned their original programs. All of them nominally embraced \\"socialism\\", becoming loyal partners of the SED. With few exceptions, they voted unanimously for all government proposals. One of the few notable dissension of a bloc party occurred in 1972 when members of the CDU in the Volkskammer took a stand against the legalisation of abortion, with the party's deputies either voting against the law or abstaining. During Die Wende the bloc parties began to assert themselves and emerge as independent parties, leading to the first and only free election to the Volkskammer in 1990. During the process of German reunification, the bloc parties merged into their western counterparts. Non-party organisations such as the Free German Youth, Kulturbund and the Democratic Women's League of Germany broke their formal affiliation with the former ruling party, but only the Free German Youth still operates today. =Czechoslovakia= The 1946 elections saw only parties of the National Front, dominated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, take part. However, elections were competitive, with the Communists and Social Democrats prevailing in the Czech lands, and the anti-Communist Democratic Party winning a comfortable majority in Slovakia. In 1948, however, the Communists seized power and non-Marxist parties were made subordinate to the Communists. During the Velvet revolution, the parties became more assertive in pressuring for change, and transformed themselves for democratic politics. The Christian democratic Czechoslovak People's Party remains a player in Czech parliamentary politics. =Poland= The 1947 elections were blatantly rigged in favour of the Democratic Bloc, with Communist and Socialist parties being merged to form the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). In 1952 the Front of National Unity was formed, including the PZPR, the agrarian United People's Party (ZSL) and the centrist Democratic Party (SD), while up to three Catholic associations also had representation in the Sejm. Occasionally, deputies from these groups (most notably the Catholic Znak) offered limited criticism of government policies. A number of deputies from bloc parties also voted against the imposition of Martial Law in Poland, after which the Front of National Unity was replaced by the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth which included the same as well as additional member organisations. In 1989, partly free elections were held in which Solidarity won an overwhelming majority of freely contestable seats- only 35% of the Sejm- while the PZPR and bloc parties were reserved 65% of the seats. The ZSL and SD formed a coalition government with Solidarity, thus forming Poland's first non-Communist government since World War II. The SD continues today, whereas the ZSL eventually evolved into today's Polish People's Party. Two of the Catholic associations with Sejm representation continue today as lay Catholic organisations. =Bulgaria= During Communist rule in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union was the only other legal party than the Bulgarian Communist Party as a member of the Fatherland Front. A number of successor parties exist in post-Communist Bulgaria. =Other examples= In China, North Korea and Vietnam (until 1988), bloc parties also exist, playing a subordinate role to ruling Communist parties as constituent members of official coalitions. In non-communist regimes A few examples of a bloc party system also exist in non-Communist regimes. =Australia= Since the 1920s, the main centre-right force in Australian politics at the federal level has been an alliance of parties known as the Coalition: originally consisting of the Nationalist Party and the Australian Country Party, it currently includes those parties' successors, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia. The Coalition's formation was prompted by the rise of the centre-left Australian Labor Party, which remains the Coalition's main political opponent. The two parties of the Coalition draw support from different bases, with the Liberals gaining their votes in urban areas and the Nationals winning theirs in rural areas. Arrangements at state and territorial level vary, from the merger of state Liberal and National parties through to electoral alliances on the federal model and, in the case of Western Australia, a looser relationship. =Bulgaria= The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and other leftist parties in Bulgaria have been members of the leftist electoral alliance Coalition for Bulgaria since 1991. =Germany= The Christian Democratic Union of Germany does not contest elections in Bavaria, where its place is taken by the somewhat more conservative and Catholic-influenced Christian Social Union. They form a common CDU/CSU bloc in the Bundestag. =Hong Kong= The Hong Kong pro-democracy camp has been establishing an electoral coalition in local level elections. Unless there is a coordination failure, the parties within the camp will not contest against each other in local level elections. In the coming General Election, they also launch primaries to ensure the greatest coordination and thus greatest possible number of seats, at best simple majority (35+) can be achieved. =Hungary= Christian Democratic People's Party is the coalition partner of the ruling party Fidesz, and runs with Fidesz on a joint electoral list. = Mexico = In Mexico during the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, 1929‚Äì2000), partidos paleros (satellite parties) included the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution and the Socialist Popular Party. These helped the PRI government give the superficial appearance of a competitive democratic system. In fact, both satellite parties fully supported the government and co-nominated the PRI candidates for the Presidency of Mexico until 1988. =New Zealand= ACT New Zealand, a right-wing libertarian party, and United Future, a centrist party, run their leaders as candidates in Epsom and ≈åhƒÅriu electorates respectively, who are typically endorsed by the National Party, its leader and its candidates in these electorates. The minor party MPs are then offered cabinet positions and their parties serve as coalition partners in a National government. =Russia= The All-Russia People's Front includes the ruling United Russia, the Patriots of Russia, Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine,–ü—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã –ø—Ä–∏—Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏–ª–∞—Å—å –∫ \\"–ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏\\" –û–ù–§ the Russian Union of Afghanistan Veterans, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Young Guard of United Russia, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, the Agrarian Party of RussiaDas Programm und die Satzung der Landwirtschaftlichen Partei Russlands auf der Website des Ministeriums der Justiz der Russischen F√∂deration and others. =South Korea= The Future Korea Party is a bloc party of the United Future Party, the opposition party. All parties excluding the UFP accepted a new election law starting in 2020 which led to the adoption of a proportional representation election system, which is more disadvantageous for giant parties like UFP and DP before. They gets less seats under the new proportional representation system than other small parties. So, UFP made a bloc party for the 2020 South Korean legislative election, in order to get more electoral seats that are under their control. =Syria= The National Progressive Front is an umbrella organisation comprising the Ba'th Party and several other pro-government parties, who in practice play a subordinate role to the Ba'th Party. Traditionally, legal political parties were required to follow the socialist and Arab nationalist or pan-Arabist orientation of the al-Assad regime. More recently, parties have been no longer required to do so in order to receive legal recognition and one such party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, was both legalised and admitted to the NPF. This has given rise to suggestions other parties that are neither socialist nor Arab nationalist will gain recognition, but ethnically-based (Kurdish or Assyrian) parties continue to be repressed, and Islamist parties remain illegal. =United Kingdom= Labour Party The Labour Party and Co-operative Party have an electoral agreement under which elections in some constituencies are contested by Co-operative Party members as joint candidates. Northern Ireland Two of the three largest national parties do not compete in elections in Northern Ireland. The two Northern Irish parties that are affiliated with parties that compete in the rest of the UK are the Social Democratic and Labour Party with Labour, and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland with the Liberal Democrats. The Conservative Party runs candidates in Northern Ireland. =Uzbekistan= Although there is no formal coalition group, Uzbekistan may also be classified as having an example of a bloc party system, because all legal political parties are required to support the regime of President Islam Karimov.

He was known for writing Afrikaans novels, novellas, columns, youth novels, short stories, plays, radio dramas, film scripts and television dramas. Biography Barnard was born in Mataffin in the Nelspruit district of South Africa on 15 July 1939, and matriculated at in 1957. He majored in Afrikaans-Nederlands and History of Art at the University of Pretoria. In the 1960s he and several other authors were notable figures in the Afrikaans literary movement known as Die Sestigers (\\"The Sixty-ers\\"). These writers sought to use Afrikaans as a language to speak against the apartheid government, and also to bring into Afrikaans literature the influence of contemporary English and French trends. During 1962 Barnard married his first wife, Anette, and together they produced three sons; Johan, Stephan and Tian. After divorcing his first wife in 1978, he married his second wife, Katinka Heyns. His fourth son, Simon, is born out of this marriage. Barnard's second novel, Mahala, is considered an Afrikaans classic. He died on 28 December 2015 of a heart attack.

He is believed to be the creator of the Flag of Belarus in 1917.  Life  Duzh-Dushewski was born into an impoverished szlachta family. In 1912 he graduated the Vilna non-classical secondary school where he had joined the Belarusian national movement. In 1912‚Äì1918 Duzh-Dushewski studied in the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute. Being in St. Petersburg, he also took part in Belarusian social life. For instance, he was editor of the Belarusian magazine Ranica. In 1917 he joined the Belarusian Socialist Assembly. In 1918 he worked at the Refugee Assistance Department of the Belarusian National Committee in St. Petersburg. At that time, according to his own memories, he created the draft of the white-red-white Flag of Belarus that was very quickly adopted by the Belarusian national movement throughout the European part of the former Russian Empire and later adopted as the state flag of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. In 1919 Duzh-Dushewski moved to Vilna. In autumn 1919 he was appointed diplomatic representative of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in the Baltic states.

History Today's Heitkamp BauHolding GmbH has its origin in the civil engineering company E. Heitkamp, which was founded in Herne-Wanne in 1892 by Engelbert Scharpwinkel, referred to as Heitkamp. Initially, towards the end of the 19th century, the company built canals and roads for the farmers in the neighbourhood. =1902= The son of E. Scharpwinkel, Heinrich Heitkamp, assumed the management of the still young construction company and expanded the field of activity by, amongst others, entering the mining business which was the characteristic industry in the Ruhr area at the time. In the following decades, the construction activities were expanded beyond the limits of Herne: Civil engineering, track and infrastructure construction as well as mining services became the main pillar of the company. At that time the projects included, for example, the new construction of the Herne railway station, the construction of the Chemische Werke H√ºls in Marl, earthwork, canal and regulation work for the Emschergenossenschaft and the Lippeverband, the beginning of motorway constructions as well as numerous shafting sinking activities for regional coal mines (Shamrock Mine, Unser Fritz Mine and others). Head office in Herne, Germany =1946 to 1963= After World War II, the \\"E. Heitkamp Tiefbaugesch√§ft in Wanne-Eickel‚Äú ‚Äì as it was called at the time ‚Äì was renamed into ‚ÄúBauunternehmung E. Heitkamp GmbH‚Äù in 1946. In addition to Heinrich Heitkamp senior, the participators included his sons Heinrich and Robert. Following the removal of debris, the field of activity was expanded to include other areas. Buildings for government agencies and the Deutsche Bundesbahn were constructed and in the early fifties, the company started providing special mining services with underground track constructions. In 1957, Heitkamp entered the power plant construction sector by executing a contract for the Westerholt power plant owned by Hibernia AG. For the first time, refuse dumps were used for the construction of dams and roads. Heitkamp participated in the complete expansion of the Ruhr expressway from Essen via Bochum to Dortmund as well as in the new construction of the railway line between Gelsenkirchen and Haltern am See. This was followed by a participation in the construction of the Henrichsh√ºtte 2 steel plant in Hattingen as well as the power plants ‚ÄúBrassert‚Äù in Marl and ‚ÄúSpringorum‚Äù in Bochum. A patent was issued on 28 May 1958 for the track-tamping machine developed by Heitkamp for underground track construction. In 1960, Heitkamp entered the tunnel construction sector when the company built the Erbscheidt tunnel in the course of the Bigge dam construction. In addition, Heitkamp was awarded contracts for the construction of the Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany) at the ‚ÄúHardth√∂he‚Äù in Bonn. At this time Heitkamp employed about 4000 people. =1964 to 1980= In 1964, Robert Heitkamp took over the sole management and expanded the family company in the next decades to become one of the largest construction companies in Germany. In the same year, Heitkamp built the first natural-draught cooling tower for the power plant in Ibbenb√ºren. This was followed by 53 cooling towers in Germany and another 38 cooling towers worldwide (including Australia, America, Africa, Greece, Spain, Netherlands etc.). In 1995 and in the course of the largest individual contract in the history of the company, Heitkamp built two natural-draught cooling towers for the Lippendorf power plant, amongst others, and in 1998 the highest natural-draught cooling tower in the world reaching 200 m at the Niederau√üem power plant. =1970 to 1981= Heitkamp participated in national and international construction projects that included, amongst others, power plant and nuclear power plant projects, infrastructure, civil engineering, structural engineering as well as hydraulic engineering and mining projects. Heitkamp participated, amongst others, in the construction of the nuclear power plants in Brunsb√ºttel, Phillippsburg I and II and Brokdorf as well as internationally in the construction of nuclear power plants in Austria (Tullnerfeld / Zwentendorf) and Switzerland (G√∂sgen-D√§niken). Thanks to the experience gained in the construction of nuclear power plants, Heitkamp, along with the companies Hochtief AG and Dykerhoff & Widmann AG, was awarded the contract to build the reprocessing plant in Wackersdorf. The construction, however, was stopped in 1989 for political reasons. In Germany, important infrastructure projects included the participation in the construction of the subways in Berlin, Hanover, Bielefeld, Dortmund, Stuttgart and Munich as well as work on the Bundesautobahn 42, the Emscher expressway and the Bundesautobahn 45, the so-called ‚ÄúSauerland line‚Äù. Internationally, Heitkamp was involved in road construction projects in Yemen (Sana's ‚Äì Taiz and Taiz to the Red Sea), in the subway construction in Vienna and took over the technical lead management during the construction of the first channel tunnel connecting Dover with Calais, which was later interrupted for political reasons. National hydraulic engineering projects at that time included the participation in the construction of the Obernau dam and the redirecting of the Ruhr at Neheim. International projects included the construction of the Hofuf drainage project in Saudi Arabia and the construction of a drainage tunnel in Venezuela. Heitkamp expanded its civil engineering activities ‚Äì in this case turnkey construction services. Bridge structures (e.g. the 3-bay road bridge \\"Zum F√ºrstenmoor‚Äú in Hamburg-Harburg, the Emscher bridge in Dortmund-Deusen, the Annener Berg bridge in the Witten-Annen area) as well as the involvement in the construction of the underground parking at the Cologne cathedral and most tunnel projects in the course of the Bundesbahn high-speed line Kassel- W√ºrzburg clearly show Heitkamp's participation in civil engineering projects. Heitkamp was also involved in the construction of the Olympic site in Munich. During that period, Heitkamp was also involved in the construction of the \\"Technische Rathaus‚Äù in Frankfurt, the construction of the Parkstadion Gelsenkirchen, buildings for the Technical University of Berlin, work for the airport extension in Frankfurt and Hanover Langenhagen, the construction of the Lower-Saxon state parliament in Hanover, hotel constructions (Hotel Penta and Hotel Steigenberger in Berlin) and the construction of hospitals for the Federal Insurance Fund for Miners in Recklinghausen and Bochum as well as the Clinical Centre in M√ºnster. In the mining sector, Heitkamp was involved in the construction of the shaft tower with reinforced concrete for the ‚ÄúConsolidation 3/ 4/ 9‚Äù mine in Gelsenkirchen and the construction of the new ‚ÄúAn der Haard‚Äù mine in the Recklinghausen district. At this time, Heitkamp also began with the removal, marketing or stockpiling of tailings from the Ruhr area mines. The railway construction division executed, amongst others, a contract for the construction of tracks for the Elmshorn-Barmstedt-Oldesloer- Eisenbahn AG. Internationally, it participated in the renewal of the railway line between Riyadh and Dammam in Saudi Arabia. Dr. Alfred Herrhausen became the first chairman of the newly created advisory board. =1981 to 1999= In 1981, the company employed approx. 8,500 people and achieved a turnover of approx. 1.1 bn DM. Robert Heitkamp retired from the operational business and passed the management chair to his son, Prof. Dr. Dr. Engelbert Heitkamp. Until the German reunification in 1990, Heitkamp expanded the field of activity in the areas of refurbishment, modernization and redevelopment of structures. One of the first modernization projects included the two city hall towers in Marl in Westphalia. Another main pillar was added to the already existing activities: The formation of the subsidiary Heitkamp Umwelttechnik GmbH in 1985. Because of the widespread introduction of mobile phone networks, Heitkamp built stations for the C-net of the Deutsche Bundespost and later for the private D-net. Heitkamp participated in the realization of the Eurotunnel between Calais and Dover and nationally in the construction of subway and urban railway projects, e.g. in Dortmund. For the Deutsche Bahn, Heitkamp realized several engineering works in the area of the new line Cologne ‚Äì Rhine/Main. During that period the construction projects included, amongst others: ‚Äì The coating of the outer shell of the natural-draught cooling tower at the cogeneration plant in V√∂lklingen; ‚Äì The natural-draught cooling tower for the nuclear power plant Isar 2 in Landshut; ‚Äì The Hoheward railway tunnel at the Hoheward waste tip in Herten; ‚Äì ICE train wash facility for the Deutsche Bundesbahn in Hamburg-Eidelstedt; ‚Äì Subway structures, amongst others, in Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Duisburg and Berlin; ‚Äì Participation in the construction of the A 560 motorway, the Hennef by-pass and the Bundesautobahn 57 motorway between Goch and the Dutch border; ‚Äì Participation in the construction of the interim storage facility for fuel elements in Ahaus; ‚Äì An apartment hotel, administrative building, a medical centre with supermarket at the Ungererpark in Munich; ‚Äì Construction of the administrative centre for the Veba Oel AG in Gelsenkirchen-Scholven; ‚Äì Participation in the construction of the Daimler-Benz administrative centre in Stuttgart-M√∂hringen After the German reunification in 1990, Heitkamp participated in construction projects for the five new federal states and established offices in Chemnitz, Dresden, Erfurt, Magdeburg, Potsdam, Halle and Rostock. Some examples include, amongst others, the rebuilding of the new synagogue in the Oranienburger Stra√üe in Berlin, the coating of the natural-draught cooling tower in Rostock, the participation in the Markt Nordseite development in Weimar, reconstructions in the Dutch district in Potsdam, the participation in the Siemens Microelectronics Center in Dresden but also the lowering of the Rheinufer-Tunnel in D√ºsseldorf and the extension of the Bundesautobahn 2 motorway in the Bottrop area. Mining construction activities included, amongst others, the coke-side dust removal for the Zollverein coking plant in Essen as well as different reconstructions in the mining sector in the Erzgebirge. In 1999, Heitkamp merged with Deilmann-Haniel GmbH. The construction activities of both companies were combined in the Bauunternehmung E. Heitkamp GmbH while the mining activities were combined in the Deilmann-Haniel GmbH. The civil engineering projects of Bauunternehmung E. Heitkamp GmbH were also merged to make up the legally independent subsidiary Heitkamp Erd- und Stra√üenbau GmbH. =2000 until today= In 2001, the activities of former Railway Construction Division were transferred to the independent subsidiary Heitkamp Rail GmbH. The following construction projects are examples of projects carried out by or with Heitkamp: ‚Äì The so-called \\"B√ºgelbauten‚Äú (bridging structures) at Berlin Hauptbahnhof; ‚Äì \\"Gl√§serne Manufaktur‚Äú (transparent factory) of Volkswagen AG in Dresden and the Zollernhof in Berlin for the ZDF TV Studio; ‚Äì Construction of the National Bank building in Riga, Latvia; ‚Äì Construction of the double \\"water-saving\\" lock in Hohenwarte; ‚Äì Modernization of the former Mannesmann high-rise building in D√ºsseldorf; ‚Äì Construction and modernisation of the \\"Marstallplatz Munich‚Äú complex at Maximilianstra√üe (Munich); ‚Äì Construction of the new Cologne ‚Äì Rhine/Main line of the Deutsche Bahn; ‚Äì Construction of a university building including a library for the University of Malm√∂ in Malm√∂, Sweden. In 2005, the civil engineering departments of the Bauunternehmung E. Heitkamp GmbH were combined to make up the independent subsidiary Heitkamp Ingenieur- und Kraftwerksbau GmbH. Due to a massive drop in orders in the mining sector and the increasing competition in the German construction industry, Heitkamp-Deilmann-Haniel GmbH decided at the end of 2005 to take drastic restructuring measures. In the course of these restructuring measures, the ATON GmbH acquired the international and parts of the national special mining sector ‚Äì today's Deilmann-Haniel International Mining and Tunnelling GmbH. The Dutch group of companies Heijmans acquired the Heitkamp Rail GmbH. In addition, the Turnkey Construction Office in Ratingen closed along with the offices in D√ºsseldorf, Dortmund, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart. In 2008, the Heitkamp-Deilmann-Haniel GmbH was renamed into today's Heitkamp BauHolding GmbH. The Heitkamp BauHolding GmbH combines now the following four business areas: ‚Äì Civil engineering and power plant construction (Heitkamp Ingenieur- und Kraftwerksbau GmbH) ‚Äì Infrastructure building (Heitkamp Umwelttechnik GmbH, Heitkamp Erd- und Stra√üenbau GmbH) ‚Äì Universal construction (domoplan GmbH, Heitkamp ProjektPartner GmbH) ‚Äì Special construction (BuM Beton- und Monierbau GmbH, Bergsicherung Schneeberg GmbH, Bergsicherung Ilfeld GmbH) Currently, the largest project abroad involves the construction of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant in Finland. In the sector of infrastructure building, it is the participation of the Heitkamp Erd- und Stra√üenbau GmbH in the construction of the Lake Phoenix in Dortmund-H√∂rde as well as the 6-lane extension and modernization of motorways ‚Äì including the Bundesautobahn 1 and Bundesautobahn 2 (including the redevelopment of the Kamener Kreuz), the Bundesautobahn 40 and Bundesautobahn 42 motorways ‚Äì that deserves special mention. In February 2009, J√ºrgen R. Thumann, a great-grandson of the founder of the company, took over the majority of the shares in the Heitkamp Group and has ever since been the chairman of the board of directors.
