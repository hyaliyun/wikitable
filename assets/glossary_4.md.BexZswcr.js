Formed primarily as a local defence force against Taliban insurgents its members have no power of arrest and are only authorised to investigate crime if requested to do so by the Afghan National Police (ANP). It was established at the request of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Summer 2010 and is paid for by the United States. Officers undergo three weeks military and police training by ISAF personnel and receive weapons and a uniform. They are intended to defend their villages from insurgent attack and allow the ANP to focus on offensive operations. It was originally intended to function for between two and five years. The US government provided funding in February 2013 to expand the ALP to 45,000 members and to provide the programme until at least 2018, anticipating the withdrawal of most foreign troops from the country by the end of 2014. The ALP has received a mixed press with its members being involved in several green on blue attacks, though it has borne a heavy cost in its fight against the Taliban ‚Äì suffering casualty rates twice that of the ANP and Afghan Army.  Formation  US Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus meets ALP officers in April 2012 The Afghan government passed legislation to establish the Local Police in July 2010 and formal establishment occurred under a presidential decree of 16 August that year. An initial target of 10,000 members was set by the Afghan government and the US Congress agreed to provide funding for up to 30,000 policemen. It was originally planned to operate for between two and five years. By August 2011 7,000 men had been recruited. Nomination and vetting is made by local village councils, with training provided by ISAF (primarily US) forces. ALP members report to the police district chief and come under the remit of the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The ALP was established with the backing of US General David Petraeus but with strong opposition from Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The US Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command- Afghanistan (CFSOCC-A) manages the American component of the programme.  Operation  An ALP commander (in white) leads three ALP officers (in dark green) towards the sound of machine gun fire The ALP was established as an armed defence force at village-level and does not have police powers. It was intended to free Afghan security forces from the defensive role and allow them to focus on offensive operations in advance of the withdrawal of foreign military units from Afghanistan. ALP candidates receive three weeks of training some of which is delivered by US special forces personnel. The training primarily covers military skills such as marksmanship and IED detection but also covers human rights, the correct use of force and the Afghan constitution. ALP officers do not have powers of arrest but can detain individuals for a limited amount of time before turning them over to the national police. The ALP is not intended to investigate crime (and can do so only if asked by the National Police) and is uniformed in khaki in contrast to the Afghan National Police's (ANP) blue uniforms. The Local Police are not permitted to carry arms outside of their home districts ALP officers hold a one-year employment contract, there is a provision in place for officers to transfer to the ANP or the Afghan Army upon completion of their one-year service. An Afghan receives familiarisation training with the AK-47 during an ALP training programme run by the British Royal Military Police The ALP is intended to provide a local security presence whose members are known to those that they seek to protect. Previously this work fell to the Afghan National Police who were often sent from further afield and sometimes could not even speak the language of the local populace. A target of 30 ALP officers per village and 300 in each district has been set by CFSOCC-A. Potential recruits are biometrically screened in conjunction with the Afghan National Directorate of Security for potential criminal or terrorist connections. Potential ALP officers must be Afghan nationals aged between 19 and 45, demonstrate patriotism and be fit and healthy. Monthly salaries are between 6,000 and 8,250 afghanis per month. The US government funds ALP salaries, weapons, ammunition and training through the Afghan Security Forces Fund that provides the finance direct to the Ministry of Interior. The ultimate goal is for ALPs to function independently of the US security forces with all ALP posts seeking to be independent by the end of 2014. In February 2013 the US government announced plans to expand the ALP programme. The Pentagon will provide an additional $1.2 billion to extend the programme to at least 2018 and provide for 45,000 officers. US military commanders hope that the programme will allow for the withdrawal of the majority of US troops by 2014 with only a small cadre of special forces personnel remaining to provide training to ALP officers and other Afghan security forces. As of February 2013 the ALP had a presence in just 100 of Afghanistan's 400 districts, though plans were in place to expand this to a further 44 districts within the next few months.  Incidents  Afghan Local Police officers during a graduation ceremony in May 2012 The Human Rights Watch has raised concerns that the ALP simply provides arms and training to another militia and has led to abuses of power by its members. At least 77 ALP officers had been investigated for criminal activity by February 2013, this included serious allegations of murder and rape. Concerns have also been raised over the power it places in the hands of local village elders, the increased proliferation of weapons, the possible infiltration by Taliban, the financial cost and the reliance on western trainers. The use of the ALP has been likened to a local militia, the use of which by the USSR in the 1980s left Afghans wary of similar forces. The Local Police have been involved in several green on blue attacks against ISAF security forces or their Afghan colleagues. On 30 March 2012 a local policeman poisoned and shot nine of his colleagues in an attack he carried out on behalf of the Taliban in Yayakhil, Paktika Province. A local policeman killed two US soldiers in Kinisk, Farah Province on 17 August 2012 after he was handed a weapon to begin training with. The policeman was shot dead by US and Afghan forces and a National Police officer was wounded. Following a spate of such attacks the US military halted training to the ALP in September 2012 to re-vet new candidates, existing members of the force were not affected by the decision. A local policeman who had infiltrated the organisation drugged and, with Taliban forces, shot 11 colleagues and six co-operating civilians at an ALP post in Ghazni Province, the worst such incident the force has suffered. Two ALP officers The Afghan Local Police have been targeted by insurgents on numerous occasions. An attack on an ALP post in Khaki Safed, Farah Province in April 2012 left eight policeman dead and two captured and within the same timeframe a suicide bombing in the north of the country killed an ALP commander and his bodyguard and wounded 18 others. Another attack towards the end of the month killed 10 ALP officers when a roadside bomb hit the truck they were travelling in. Four policemen and five civilians were killed in a targeted suicide bombing on 18 June 2012 at Tagab in Kapisa Province, 17 civilians were wounded. Six ALP officers were killed in an explosion on 10 October 2012 in Nad Ali in Helmand Province. In all the casualty rate in the ALP runs at 6.2%, more than double that of the rest of the Afghan security forces.

It claims to be the oldest family company in Europe. It gives its name to the Mellerio cut, a 57-facet jewel cut, shaped as an oval within an ellipse. Today Mellerio is based in rue de la Paix, Paris, with branches in Luxembourg and Japan. It is a member of the Comit√© Colbert and also of the Henokiens, an international club made up of family companies over 200 years old. Directors Fran√ßois and Olivier Mellerio are the fourteenth generation to run the family business. History The firm started in 1613, founded by the Mellerio family from Valle Vigezzo, under the patronage of Marie de M√©dicis. Jean-Baptiste Mellerio (1765-1850) started trading in Versailles in 1777, and attracted the patronage of Queen Marie Antoinette. According to C√¥me Mellerio referring to his company's archives, on the day of the French Revolution (14 July 1789), the sales of the their Mellerio shop in Paris were excellent. In 1796, he set up shop on rue Vivienne, Versailles, retaining the patronage of the Empress Josephine. Francois Mellerio (1772-1843) moved the firm to Paris, initially at 4, rue du Coq Saint-Honor√©. In 1815, he moved the workshop to 9, rue de la Paix in Paris, where it remains today. After the restoration of the French monarchy in 1830, Mellerio became suppliers to Queen Marie-Am√©lie and King Louis-Philippe. Jean-Fran√ßois Mellerio (1815-1896) opened a branch in Madrid in 1850 from which he supplied customers including Queen Isabella II and the future Empress Eugenie of France. The company's estimated sales (in 2010/2011) were ‚Ç¨8 million. Notable works Mellerio has an archive of about 100,000 items. =Trophies= Mellerio made the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy, awarded to the winner of the Men's Singles competition at the French Open since 1981. It is in the form of a large silver bowl, with a vine leaf trim. Coupe des Mousquetaires (French Open - Gentlemen's single) Winners receive a pure silver replica of the trophy, specially made and engraved for each winner by the maison Mellerio. Mellerio has made the ceremonial sword for members of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, including Fran√ßois Cheng. Each sword is unique, with the hilt decorated with symbols of its owner‚Äôs achievements. =Tiaras and royal jewels= The Mellerio Shell tiara was given to Infanta Isabella of Spain as a wedding present from her mother Queen Isabella II in 1868. The tiara had been made by Mellerio for the 1867 Paris Exhibition. It is made of diamonds in the shape of shells decorated with pearls. It remains part of the Spanish Royal Family jewels, worn today by Queen Sofia of Spain. Mellerio is also attributed with the creation of the Spanish Floral Tiara, made of diamonds in a pattern of flowers, which was a wedding gift to the future Queen Sofia from General Franco on her marriage to Juan Carlos of Spain in 1962. The jewel collection of the Dutch royal family includes a tiara made by Mellerio for Queen Emma. The ruby tiara is part of a set made in 1889. Mellerio also made the rose pattern diamond tiara bought by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy for the 1868 wedding of his son, Prince Umberto, to Margherita of Savoy. A 1742 peacock brooch by Mellerio was worn by Anita Delgado as princess of Kapurthala. Mellerio family Andr√© Mellerio in The Mellerio Family by Maurice Denis, 1897. At one time, the family owned the Pavilon de Musique in Versailles, built for Princess Marie Jos√©phine of Savoy. The events surrounding the death of Antoine Mellerio in 1870 inspired Robert Browning‚Äôs 1873 poem ‚ÄúRed Cotton Night-Cap Country‚Äù. Andr√© Mellerio (1862-1943) was an art critic and publisher, and author of ‚Äò Mouvement id√©aliste en peinture‚Äô (1896) who popularised the work of the artists Odilon Redon and Charles Guilloux. Charles Mellerio (1879 ‚Äì 1978) was an artist whose watercolours were exhibited many times at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais at the Grand Palais.

Chan is the first openly gay legislator in Hong Kong and East Asia. Career Chan graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1994 with a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Sociology. In the early 1990s, under the stage name Slow Beat, he teamed up with Tam Tak-chi (aka Fast Beat) hosting a radio show on Commercial Radio Hong Kong known as Fast Slow Beats with help from Winnie Yu. The duo gained popularity when they hosted Challengers of Fire on Asia Television in 1997, but left the show one year later. They remained partners after joining Metro Showbiz in 2000 until Chan quit his career as radio host in 2007. He then spent one year practicing Buddhism in Japan. He returned as radio host at Internet radio station Hong Kong Reporter in 2010 and was named its chief executive officer in 2011. Ray Chan is a Buddhist. In early 2009, he was a Buddhist monk in a Japanese temple, and he can read some fundamental Sanskrit. In September 2010, along with several fellow hosts of Hong Kong Reporter, Chan became a co-founder and deputy spokesperson of political group Power Voters (later part of People Power), whose objective was to oppose the Democratic Party in 2011 district council elections. Chan failed to challenge Democrat Lee Wing-tat in Lai Wah of Kwai Tsing District Council. In 2012, he teamed up with Erica Yuen in running for the Legislative Council election and was ultimately elected. After the election, he came out as a gayhttp://www.ihktv.com/sudden-955-liukaichi-son.html man and voiced his support for LGBT rights in Hong Kong, including the legislation of the Sexual Orientation Discrimination Ordinance. With the successful strategic voting among the pro-democracy voters, Chan was one of the five non-establishment candidates to be re-elected in the 2016 election with 45,993 votes. In the 2017 Chief Executive election, he supported radical legislator Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats (LSD) to run for the Chief Executive through an unofficial civil petition, despite the mainstream pro-democrats backed former Financial Secretary John Tsang. On 4 June, in an attempt to disrupt the third reading of the National Anthem Bill at the Legislative Council, Chan and fellow lawmaker, Eddie Chu, attempted to disperse pungent liquid towards the President of the Legislative Council, Andrew Leung. They were stopped before they could have reached the rostrum; Chan dropped the liquid and a lantern on the floor. On 16 June, LegCo president Leung announced that Chan and Chu would be fined roughly HK$100,000 each for their actions. Chu declared the same day that he and Chan would examine and possibly challenge the decision.

The company claims to blend proprietary analytic tools, Artificial Intelligence, and subject matter expertise to produce a homonymous software system to help its users find patterns indicative of terrorist attacks and other criminal events. According to their website, company leadership includes President Dan Botsch, Director of Business Development Michael Maness, Director of Operations Mike Chang, and Director of Technology Paul Chadha. History The company was founded in 2004 by former US intelligence officers in response to the increasing threats posed by terrorist organizations against US targets. According to company documents, the first deployment of the TrapWire system appears to have occurred in 2007 and was originally built and deployed to protect US critical infrastructure. The system currently provides physical security and threat detection services to more than 2,000 public and private sector sites across the US. The system is being used to identify threats ranging from terrorism to organized crime, human trafficking, fraud and Crimes Against Children. Products The TrapWire flagship product is a cloud-based threat detection technology that received US government FedRAMP authorization in 2018. The system provides a common operating platform for analysis and information sharing between various government and private sector entities. TrapWire registered as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the submitted document, the system is described in detail. The assumption is that terrorists and criminals are vulnerable due to their need to conduct pre-attack surveillance, \\"such as photographing, measuring and signaling\\". Such suspicious activities, as detected in imagery or human reports, are entered into a database using a \\"10-characteristic description of individuals\\" or vehicle information. The data is correlated across the network, claiming a \\"network effect\\" of increased security due to this correlation. The result is a TrapWire Threat Meter (TIM) level which may be monitored by security personnel. The system distinguishes threat and vulnerability information; the latter is not shared through the network. Clients TrapWire does not list its clients online; however, a review of publicly available documents indicates the firm‚Äôs clients include, among others, the US military, state and local law enforcement, Fusion Centers, financial institutions, transportation hubs, energy sites, and the hospitality and gaming industry. Incidents In August 2012, the hack of a US-based company, Stratfor, resulted in more than one million internal Stratfor emails published via WikiLeaks. Included in the emails were claims made by Stratfor employees about the size, scope and capability of the TrapWire system. A review of various news, business and social media articles suggests these claims may be overblown. According to the Stratfor emails, TrapWire software ‚Äúfacilitates intelligence-gathering on US and global citizens, using surveillance technology, incident reports from citizens, and data correlation for local police and law enforcement agencies\\". According to a report by Russia Today, Archive link: , accessed 14 April 2018. Stratfor officials claimed that TrapWire consisted of a network of surveillance cameras installed \\"in major American cities at selected high- value targets (HVTs) and has appeared abroad as well\\". However, the FAQ section of the TrapWire website claims the firm does not tie directly to any CCTV cameras. The patent application and publicly available documents appear to show TrapWire as a cloud-based, software for service technology. The software program analyzes incident data to detect \\"suspicious\\" behavior. Any patterns detected ‚Äì links among individuals, vehicles or activities ‚Äì will be reported back to each affected facility. This information can also be shared with the law enforcement organizations, enabling them to begin investigations into the suspected surveillance cell. In one leaked email, Stratfor vice president Fred Burton stated TrapWire is in place at every high-value target in New York City, Washington, D.C, and Los Angeles, as well as London and Ottawa.

It is within the towns of Unity, Burnham, and Troy. The main tributaries are Meadow Brook, Bithers Brook, and Carlton Stream. The sole outflow is Twenty-Five Mile Stream, via a wetlands to the southwest of the lake, which in turn feeds into the Sebasticook River. The lake is surrounded by almost 300 residences, of which slightly more than half are seasonal. It is also used for boating, fishing, camping, and swimming. Kanokolus Beach on the southwest shore and Burnham Town Beach are both open to the public. Unity Pond (Lake Winnecook) History Europeans first settled Unity Pond in 1785. By the early 1800s, sawmills were established along the three main tributaries to the lake. By 1830, however, deforestation caused most of the sawmills to close. Deforestation made agriculture possible, which continued in the lands adjoining the lake well into the 20th century. Canneries were established in the area from the 1920s to the 1950s. As subsistence agriculture declined in the 1940s, it was replaced by poultry and dairy farming, and seasonal camps were built along the lake shore. Water quality The lake has been subject to eutrophication caused historically by agricultural runoff and effluent from a canning factory, and is on the state Nonpoint Source Priority Watersheds list, owing to the occurrence of summer algal blooms caused by phosphorus nutrient addition by runoff water. The watershed area surrounding the pond consists of 16.2% developed land, 71.7% non-developed land (consisting mostly of forest), and 12.1% surface water.

The season had three tropical storms and three hurricanes, none of which became major hurricanes. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Jose Fernandez- Partagas and Henry Diaz initially documented five tropical cyclones in a 1995 report on this season. A sixth system was added by Michael Chenoweth in 2003 from records taken in Col√≥n, Panama. The first tropical cyclone was observed as a tropical storm offshore the East Coast of the United States from June 15 to June 17\\\\. The second and third systems were active in mid-August and mid- September, respectively, and both attained Category 2 intensity at their peaks on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and neither made landfall. A fourth tropical cyclone caused flooding in Saint Lucia and brought heavy rain to parts of Barbados on October 5, but its track prior to that date is unknown. The fifth hurricane was known to be active for a few days in October off the East Coast of the United States. Finally, a sixth system was centered near Panama - between November 22 and November 25\\\\. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1862 till:01/01/1863 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1862 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_(TD)_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:15/06/1862 till:17/06/1862 color:TS text:\\"One (TS)\\" from:18/08/1862 till:21/08/1862 color:C2 text:\\"Two (C2)\\" from:12/09/1862 till:20/09/1862 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:06/10/1862 till:06/10/1862 color:TS text:\\"Four (TS)\\" from:14/10/1862 till:16/10/1862 color:C1 text:\\"Five (C1)\\" from:22/11/1862 till:25/11/1862 color:TS text:\\"Six (TS)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1862 till:01/07/1862 text:June from:01/07/1862 till:01/08/1862 text:July from:01/08/1862 till:01/09/1862 text:August from:01/09/1862 till:01/10/1862 text:September from:01/10/1862 till:01/11/1862 text:October from:01/11/1862 till:01/12/1862 text:November from:01/12/1862 till:01/01/1863 text:December TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale)\\" Systems =Tropical Storm One= Based on reports from four ships, a tropical storm is known to have existed for two days in mid-June off the East Coast of the United States. It formed approximately 340 miles (550 km) east of Savannah, Georgia on June 15 and moved slowly north before dissipating two days later, while located about 250 miles (400 km) east of Virginia Beach, Virginia. =Hurricane Two= A Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale was first seen on August 18, while located approximately 620 miles (1,000 km) east of Florida. Over the next three days, it tracked north and moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The system dissipated roughly 310 miles (500 km) south of Newfoundland on August 21\\\\. =Hurricane Three= On September 12, a Spanish ship, the Julian de Unsueta, was de-masted by a strong gale and thrown onto its beam ends. A few days later, she docked at Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On September 13, the barques Montezuma and Gazelle were also both de-masted by a hurricane near Barbados. No information is available on the hurricane between September 14 to September 16, but on September 17, the barques Abbyla and Elias Pike encountered the hurricane, roughly 500 miles (800 km) off the coast of North Carolina. Several ships reported encountering hurricane conditions on September 19 off the East Coast of the United States, some as far north as Sable Island. Based on these reports, the track began about 500 miles (800 km) northeast of the Virgin Islands on September 12 and ended on September 20 off the coast of Nova Scotia. =Tropical Storm Four= On October 5, a tropical storm caused flooding in Saint Lucia. That day and throughout the next, high winds and heavy rain were observed in Speightstown, Barbados. The storm may also have affected Saint Vincent. No track has been identified for the storm and it has been assigned a single location in the HURDAT database. =Hurricane Five= A modern-day Category 1 hurricane was first seen on October 14 approximately 310 miles (500 km) west of Bermuda. A schooner, Albert Treat, encountered the storm and was thrown onto its beam ends. The schooner suffered considerable damage and three men drowned. The next day, further north, the barque Acacia fell onto its beam ends, but managed to reach safety. Throughout October 16 the hurricane traveled northward, parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The ship Oder reported losing its sails in a hurricane off Sable Island that day. The Confederate cruiser Alabama lost its main yard and several sails, torn to shreds in the wind, and had two boats smashed. The storm became extratropical around midday on October 16 and dissipated completely by October 17. =Tropical Storm Six= Based on meteorological records kept by an officer of the U.S. steamer James Adger, a strong tropical storm was centered to the northwest of Aspinwall, Panama from November 22 through to November 25\\\\. The storm weakened late on November 24 and began drifting slowly westward on November 25 before dissipating later that day.

Constructed along the Rua Guerra Junqueiro beginning in 1929 and inaugurated in 1938, it is the largest synagogue in the Iberian Peninsula. History The foundation of the synagogue dates to 1923, with the initiatives of the Jewish community in Porto and of Captain Artur Barros Basto, who converted to Judaism. Generally, three organized Jewish communities had existed in Portugal: in Lisbon, Porto and Belmonte; there are 6000 people who consider themselves Jewish. Captain Barros Basto was one of the most important figures in the community, linked to the founding of an organized Jewish movement in the northern community. There were at least twenty Ashkenazi Jews in the city; since there was no synagogue, they needed to travel to Lisbon for all their religious needs. Barros Basto began to plan a synagogue, officially registering the local Jewish community, the Comunidade Israelita do Porto (Israelite Community of Porto), with the local government in 1923. During this time, the membership used a house on the Rua Elias Garcia. In 1927, Barros Basto founded the Portuguese Jewish newspaper Ha-Lapid. In 1929, with the aim of trying to convert the Marranos that existed in Tr√°s-os-Montes and Beiras into official Judaism, Barros Basto raised funds. On 13 November 1929 an application for the necessary licensing to begin work was delivered to the municipal council; a few weeks later, the first stone was laid and construction begun. The architects were Artur de Almeida J√∫nior and Augusto dos Santos Malta (who trained in the Escola das Belas Artes de Porto), in collaboration with interior designer Rog√©rio de Azevedo. Rog√©rio de Azevedo may have executed some of the finish work himself, as some touches, including woodwork in the library, were completed in a style characteristic of his work.Elvira de Azevedo Mea and In√°cio Steinhardt (1997), p.222 Between 1930 and 1935, the Israeli Technology Institute was installed in the building, even before its completion. The work progressed slowly until 1933, despite support from the Committee for Spanish-Portuguese Jews in London. In 1937, the synagogue was complete thanks to the contributions from the Jewish community in London and from funds donated by the Kadoorie family and Iraqi Jews from Portugal. Upon the death of Laura Kadoorie, the wife of prominent Mizrahi Jewish philanthropist Sir Elly Kadoorie, her children wished to honor their mother, a descendant of Portuguese Jews who had fled the country following the Inquisition. This tribute was reflected in the monetary support by the Kadoorie family to assist in the construction of large part of the synagogue in Porto, which was later renamed Synagogue Kadoorie - Mekor Haim. In the same year, Captain Artur Barros Basto was expelled from the Portuguese army for his participation in circumcisions. The synagogue was inaugurated in 1938. The synagogue has always had a small number of members and, for much of the 20th century, has been entrusted to families in Central and Eastern Europe (Roskin, Kniskinsky, Finkelstein, Cymerman, Pressman and others), who married among themselves. During the Second World War, hundreds of refugees passed through the doors of the synagogue en route to the United States. Former Captain Barros Bastos died in 1961. In 2012, the synagogue was opened to the public. Representatives from an Israeli governmental agency visited in 2014 and approved co-financing for renovations and security upgrades. On 21 May 2015, the Jewish Museum of Porto was opened to the public. It was inaugurated on 28 June in the presence of the president of the Comunidade Israelita do Porto and various cultural, education and political personalities. A fence was erected along the sides and rear of the building. The community counts among its members Jews of origins as diverse as Poland, Egypt, the United States, India, Russia, Israel, Spain, Portugal and England. The present rabbi is Daniel Litvak, a native of Argentina, and the current vice president is Isabel Ferreira Lopes, the granddaughter of Captain Barros Basto. Lag BaOmer, Kadoorie Mekor Haim Synagogue Architecture Kadoorie Mekor Haim Synagogue The building is in an urban context, on an elevated platform encircled by fencing between Rua Guerra Junqueiro and Rua Jo√£o Martins Branco, in an area of residential homes called Campo Alegre. To the north is a barrio, while to the rear is a small parking lot and the Clube de T√©nis do Porto (Porto Tennis Club). Near the rear wall is the Cemit√©rio de Agra Monte (Agra Monte Cemetery) along Rua Jo√£o Martins Branco. The temple consists of rectangular structure oriented west to east, covered in differentiated roof tile. Over the entranceway and services is a cupola. The principal facade, oriented to the west, is marked by a galilee with a large arch, with the main portal inset in a recess. In the centre is a balcony with inscriptions and a glazed colonnade, while over the center of the arch is a star of David. The lateral facades, to the north and south, are characterized by a regular rhythmic distribution of elongated triangular-topped windows. The rear facade, windowless and symmetrical, consists of a plane from which three protruding volumes of flat roof stand out. The interior is marked by an entrance space flanked by two rooms, followed by the large rectangular hall, flanked on either side by two landing steps and two accessways to further spaces. The hall is the principal celebration space, with a domed ceiling, and is contoured on the upper level by a balcony with two rows of arranged chairs. The remainder of the interior is decorated with Hebrew passages from the Torah, complemented by Moroccan- Sephardic decorations. Present Shabbaton 2020 According to the official blog of the community, it includes about 500 Jews originally from more than thirty countries and gathers all standards and degrees of observance of Judaism. In recent years, the members of the community have connected the organization with the rest of the Jewish world, written the Community's rules, restored the synagogue building, organized departments and created the necessary conditions for Jewish life to flourish again in Oporto. The organisation has a beit din, two official rabbis, and structures for kashrut. It offers courses to schoolteachers to combat anti-Semitism, and has a museum, a cinema, films about its history, and cooperation protocols with the Portuguese state, the Israeli Embassy to Portugal, B'nai B'rith International, the Anti-Defamation League, Keren Hayesod, and Chabad Lubavitch, as well as with the Oporto Diocesehttps://www.vidaeconomica.pt/vida- economica-1/comunidades-judaica-e-catolica-do-porto-doam-20-mil-euros-quatro- instituicoes-de-pobreza https://www.vidaeconomica.pt/vida- economica-1/comunidades-judaica-e-catolica-do-porto-doam-20-mil-euros-quatro- instituicoes-de-pobrezaand Oporto's Muslim community. In January 2019, the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, visited the Porto Synagogue, where he attended the celebration of the Shabbat Cabalat, after which he took the floor. Upon arrival, the Head of State was received by the President of the Jewish Community of Porto, Dias Ben Zion, and by the Chief Rabbi, Daniel Litvak.http://www.presidencia.pt/?idc=10&idi;=158818 In September 2020, the Jewish Community of Porto was received by the Mayor of Porto, Rui Moreira, in the City Hall.

Founded in 2009 under the name Acadia, it was originally a joint venture between EMC and Cisco Systems, with additional investments by Intel and EMC subsidiary VMware. EMC acquired a 90% controlling stake in VCE from Cisco in October 2014, giving it majority ownership. At the beginning of 2016, VCE was fully integrated into EMC and became the Converged Platform Division of EMC. On September 7, 2016, EMC was acquired by Dell. The Converged Platform Division of EMC is currently known as the Converged Platform and Solutions Division of Dell EMC. The company initially manufactured converged datacenter units known as Vblock, which incorporate Cisco servers and networking hardware, EMC storage systems, and VMware for virtualization. Later, VxBlock was added providing the ability for customers to run VMware NSX. In 2015, VxRack and in 2016 VxRail were added as separate products. History Cisco Systems, EMC Corporation and VMware (partially owned by EMC) unveiled a joint partnership in November 2009 to develop cloud computing platforms called Vblock Infrastructure Packages. The partnership was originally called the VMware-Cisco-EMC alliance, though the name was later shortened to VCE, for the ‚ÄúVirtual Computing Environment coalition‚Äù. At the same EMC World trade show, Cisco and EMC introduced a joint venture named Acadia. The goal of Acadia, originally set up as a separate legal entity, was to build Vblock Infrastructure Packages in a standardized and repeatable fashion for customer data centers. Michael Capellas, who also was a board member of Cisco, was named chairman of Acadia, and its first chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2010. Sales initially encountered some confusion among customers (which often had different staffs for storage and networking, for example), and different fiscal quarter sales cycles. By the end of 2010, Capellas told analysts the venture had 65 customers, with an average system costing about $2.5 million. Acadia and the Virtual Computing Environment coalition combined into a single entity in January 2011, called VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company. Originally located in Silicon Valley and Dallas, Texas, an expansion was announced in March 2011 to Richardson, Texas with an investment from the Texas Enterprise Fund. In October 2011, another office opened in Marlboro, Massachusetts, close to VCE's EMC-owned manufacturing plant in Franklin, Massachusetts. In July 2012, Cisco executive Praveen Akkiraju was appointed CEO and Frank Hauck as president. It was estimated VCE had 1200 employees at the time, with undisclosed revenues but accumulated losses. Publicized customers included Babson College and the Mississippi Community College Board. The press debated if the venture should be considered a \\"startup company\\", with one headline joking \\"VCE = virtual cash erosion\\" and questioning millions of dollars of executive compensation. Others considered the arrangement to be a wise investment. Through 2012, there was a mixture of some success (with speculation of layoffs), and continued confusion due to products from competing partners such as NetApp FlexPod and Xsigo Systems. Cisco had announced its own \\"framework\\" called CloudVerse in late 2011 that was not specific to VMware. In August 2012, EMC announced a VSPEX reference architecture and partnership with Lenovo and other distributors that was seen as competing with a lower-cost option. In a November 2012 report by Gartner, VCE had a 57.4% share of integrated infrastructure systems in the second quarter of 2012 based on revenue. Gartner had previously tracked server, networking, and external controller-based storage as individual markets. VCE was named one of the ‚Äú2013 Virtualization 50‚Äù by CRN Magazine. In May 2013, VCE estimated a $1 billion annual sales rate with more than 1,000 Vblock Systems sold. However, in US Securities and Exchange Commission filings, EMC accounted for a cumulative loss of over $430 million by September 2012, and Cisco a loss of $457 million by early 2013, since revenues are recorded to the owning companies, not VCE itself. EMC reported an investment of $667.2 million in cash and $13.2 million in stock- based compensation to VCE, for a stake of about 58%. Cisco reported a gross investment of $457 million, for a stake of about 35%. By 2013, some of the same press writers that initially criticized VCE came to view the structure of VCE as being good business for investors.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/06/emc_vce_losses/ Other press highlighted VCE as a source of innovation and financial performance for investors.http://www.eweek.com/storage/why-vces-newest-vblock-systems- demonstrate-innovation.htmlhttp://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/unfiltered- opinion/vce-stars-in-emc-financial-results.html Total VCE for 2013 has been reported at over $1B with over a 50% year-over-year growth rate.http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/VCE_Drives_Simplification_Past_$1B In October 2014, EMC announced that it had acquired majority control of the VCE venture, with Cisco maintaining a 10% stake. In January 2016, EMC announced that VCE had become the Converged Platform Division of EMC with Chad Sakac as President.https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2016/20160106-01.htm Products and services Vblock 300 FX at CA World 2011 VCE marketed converged infrastructure servers known as vBlocks, which combine VMware vSphere software running on Cisco Unified Computing Systems (UCS) connected with Cisco Nexus switches, attached to EMC Symmetrix storage. Despite the \\"block\\" in the name, the storage can be accessed as either a block device or a file server. Vblock Systems are marketed for large-scale datacenters which run software applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint or SAP ERP. They are delivered in standard 19-inch rack units to aid in planning for cooling and power requirements. =Original systems= In 2009, the Virtual Computing Environment coalition announced three models of Vblock Infrastructure Packages. Vblock 2, intended for high-end data centers, was designed to support 3,000 to 6,000 virtual machines using Cisco UCS, Cisco Nexus 1000v and multilayer director switches (MDS), as well as EMC Symmetrix VMAX storage and VMware vSphere software. Vblock 1, intended for the midmarket, was designed for 800 to 3,000 virtual machines and had had a similar configuration to the Vblock 2, but with EMC Clariion storage rather than EMC Symmetrix VMAX. Vblock 0, the intended low-end configuration, was projected for release in 2010 to support 300 to 800 virtual machines and use a similar configuration, but with EMC Celerrastorage. The term \\"infrastructure package\\" was later changed to \\"infrastructure platform\\" and then just \\"Vblock System\\". =Vblock= Vblock is the brand name VCE uses for racks containing the components of its data center products. Prepackaging, called converged infrastructure, allows customers to select preconfigured and integrated solutions, with predictable units of power, weight, cooling, and geometry for data center planning purposes.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/21/vce_acadia_ramp/ Vblock 300 FX at VCE (company) booth during CA World 2011. Vblock systems consist of storage and provisioning from EMC, switches and servers from Cisco, and VMware virtualization software running on the servers. In addition, Vblock system customers' support calls are handled by VCE. Vblock had two series based on the following compositional elements:http://vmackem.co.uk/?p=553http://www.lightreading.com/video.asp?doc_id=216883 * EMC provides storage and provisioning  VNX  VMAX  Ionix UIM/P * Cisco provides compute and networking  UCS  Nexus * VMware provides virtualization  vSphere  with vDS provided via Cisco Nexus 1000V  with MPIO provided via EMC PowerPath/VE Vblock brand naming changed since its inception.http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/08/17/is-vce-a-flailing-startup-a- study-of-snark-in-new-media/ In 2009, the term Vblock Infrastructure Packages was announced by then Acadia (technical partnership), the Virtual Computing Environment coalition, as well as their primary investors. In late 2010 and continuing through 2011, the term Packages was replaced with Platforms. By mid-2012, the term, Infrastructure Platforms was replaced with Systems in wider circulation to arrive at, simply, Vblock‚Ñ¢ Systems.http://vdi-virtual- desktop-infrastructure.tmcnet.com/articles/295096-vce-fastpath-platform- simplifies-vdi-vblock-systems.htm Meanwhile, constituent elements and technology included upgrades to the product lines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware.http://www.telegram.com/article/20111211/NEWS/112119983/1002/business Infrastructure Packages Originally, these combined a reference architecture with a physical and logical configuration step initially at a customer data center or colocation data center and later within a pre- manufacturing environment for shipment to a customer data center or colocation data center.

The Vblock System 700 included EMC VPLEX workload mobility and business continuity software, as well as support for new features in EMC Unified Infrastructure Manager, improved VMware integration, and centralized monitoring of multiple Vblock Systems. In February 2013, VCE announced Vblock 300 and Vblock 700 models with increased performance and data throughput, using upgraded server and storage components. =Midmarket and entry level systems= In 2013 VCE announced products for the midrange and remote branch office market. These models included the Vblock System 100 and Vblock System 200. The Vblock 100 was designed to host up to 200 virtual machines in a 24U or 42U rack mount space with up to eight Cisco C220 M3 blade servers, two Cisco Catalyst 3750-X switches and up to 8 TB of storage capacity on an EMC VNXe3150 or VNXe3300 array. The Vblock 200 comes configured with up to 12 Cisco servers, two Nexus 5548UP unified Ethernet and SAN switches, a Cisco Catalyst 3750 management switch, and up to 105 hard drives via the included VNX 5300 array. =Specialized systems= VCE introduced a specialized system for SAP HANA in February 2013. It combined a Vblock System with SAP HANA in-memory computing and database application software. Later in September 2013 VCE introduced specialized system for high performance database for Oracle as well as extreme applications for both VMware and Citrix VDI environments. =Hyperconverged systems= Dell introduced a hyperconverged system at EMC World 2015 in February 2015.

In 2002, he co-founded the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters network in Burma. After several imprisonments on charges related to his activism, on 29 November 2008, he was given a life sentence for allegedly planning a bomb attack in Yangon's Shwepyitha Township. Amnesty International described the evidence against him as \\"fabricated\\" and designated him a prisoner of conscience. He was released from prison on 19 November 2012, as a gesture of goodwill before a visit by US President Barack Obama.  Background  Myint Aye is an alumnus of the University of Foreign Languages, Yangon. While there in 1989, he married Daw La La Win.  Democracy activism  Myint Aye has been arrested at least seven times, in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2007. In 2002, Myint Aye co-founded the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters (HRDP) network in Burma. He was also active with the opposition party of Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy, serving as its Yangon vice chairman. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, he was dismissed from the NLD in 2005 \\"for not following the party principles\\", but remained active with the HRDP. Myint Aye was arrested in 2006 for calling for the release of leaders of the 88 Generation Students Group, but was released within weeks; he attributes the swift release to international pressure from groups like Amnesty and Front Line.  2008 life sentence  Myint Aye was active in bringing aid to Cyclone Nargis survivors in 2008. He was arrested on 8 August following a search of his home; police reportedly removed him from his father-in-law's home with a black hood over his head. Initially charged with \\"misappropriating relief funds\\", Myint Aye was later charged with participating in a bomb attack the previous month in Shwepyitha Township. Activists alleged he was tortured while in detention, and Amnesty stated that his trial \\"fell far short of international fair trial standards\\". On 29 November 2008, he was sentenced to \\"life imprisonment plus eight years\\", which he is serving in Loikaw prison. Myint Aye's sentence was protested by several international human rights organizations. The member organizations of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange called the sentencings of Myint Aye, Zarganar, and others a \\"historical low point\\" in Burmese free expression and \\"a clear message that the junta will not tolerate opposition in the lead-up to their alleged 'democratic' 2010 elections.\\" Front Line stated after his arrest that he appeared to be \\"targeted as a result of his human rights activities, in particular his work to uphold democracy\\". Amnesty named him a prisoner of conscience and in August 2012, selected his case to highlight at the annual Edinburgh Festival.  Release  On 19 November 2012, U Myint Aye was released just ahead of a visit by US President Barack Obama. Reuters described the move as \\"clearly timed to show goodwill.\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Myanmar Category:Burmese democracy activists Category:Burmese prisoners and detainees ","title":"Myint Aye"},{"id":"36698805","text":"Bocage's African fat mouse (Steatomys bocagei) is an extant species of rodent indigenous to Angola, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Given the distribution of the species across the Angolan Plateau and south-west of the DRC throughout central Africa, the probability of a 'large population', and the security of its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognises S. bocagei as stable. Whereas taxonomies early in the twentieth century posit S. bocagei as a species, more contemporary records from 1977 onwards identify it as indistinguishable from S. pratensis. In 1998, however, Crawford-Cabral proposed that the additional pair of teats in S. bocagei required separation from S. pratensis. Subsequent to Crawford-Cabral's publication, Wilson and Reader maintain in Mammal Species of the World that the size of these species also requires differentiation, where S. bocagei is significantly larger than S. pratensis and is unique or otherwise corresponds to S. opimus.

American Quarterly - Volume 62, Number 3, September 2010, pp. 763-786 After showings of Yawar Mallku, Sanjin√©s learned that many peasants had criticism about the difficulty of his films due to the use of flashback for narration, as his film-making was greatly influenced by European art cinema, and about the lack of attention to denouncing the causes of the indigenous peoples' issues.

The yachting facility is located at the eastern aspect of the middle section of Gibraltar Harbour. It is the site of what may be the oldest wharf in Gibraltar, Ragged Staff Wharf. Infrastructure Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, has three marinas. These include Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. While the first two are positioned just north of Gibraltar Harbour, between the North Mole and the airport runway, Queensway Quay Marina is located within the middle section of the harbour. The marina is east of the south entrance to the harbour and south of Coaling Island. The most southern of the three marinas has the advantage of being further from Gibraltar International Airport and its attendant noise and fuel odors. Visitors to Queensway Quay Marina enter Gibraltar Harbour through the south entrance, between the South Mole and the Detached Mole. They stop at the south pontoon (floating dock) to be assigned a berth, and are customarily berthed on the most southern of the pontoons. A coded security system controls access to the pontoons. Gibraltar's Yacht Reporting Berth closed in late 2005 and customs clearance of vessels is now handled by each marina. The marina has 185 berths, including facilities for up to eight 30 metre and two 40 metre vessels. In addition, it has a 75-metre berth, although its ability to accommodate a larger vessel is dependent upon the boat's draft (or draught). Metered water and electricity are available at all berths, and some berths have access to cable television and telephone. The marina also has shower and toilet facilities, as well as access to ice and laundry service. In addition, Queensway Quay Marina has a variety of restaurants, bars, and shops. History Ragged Staff Wharf is the quayside of Queensway Quay Marina. It is thought to be the oldest wharf in Gibraltar. While initially built by the Spanish, the wharf was further developed by the British in 1736. First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Charles Wager supervised the improvements at Ragged Staff Wharf, with the goal of providing \\"better victualling of men-at-war.\\" While there are a number of theories for the derivation of the name of the wharf, none have been proven. One theory is that it originates from the nautical term for the stump mast utilised as a hoist on the vessels that transferred barrels of water to ships at the quay. The wharf was also the site where Governors of Gibraltar would customarily arrive. The steps at that landing place were referred to as Governor's Landing, and are still utilised at the wharf. Queensway Quay Marina was a Taylor Woodrow development of a former Ministry of Defence site. Construction of phase one of the project, the Queensway Quay residences, just north of the naval docks, started in December 1990 and the marina opened between 1992 and 1994. The first three residential complexes were, in order, Queensway Quay, Cormorant Wharf, and Ordnance Wharf, the last on a historic wharf which is the southern boundary of the marina. In 2000, the marina changed ownership; later, it was enlarged by the construction of The Island, a 13,000 square metre breakwater on reclaimed land opposite Queensway Quay. Nineteen townhouses were built on the breakwater, each with its own swimming pool and 20 metre yacht mooring. The Sails is the most recent development at Queensway Quay Marina. Paul Butler, director of Marina Properties Limited, has been the owner of Queensway Quay Marina since 2000.

J. Baxter. The film documents the construction of a luxury golf course on a beach in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, by developer Donald Trump and the subsequent struggles between the locals, Donald Trump, and Scottish legal and governmental authorities. When it was announced that the documentary was to be given its British television premiere on BBC Two on 21 October 2012, Trump's lawyers contacted the corporation to demand that the film should not be shown, claiming that it is \\"defamatory\\" and \\"misleading\\". The screening went ahead. The BBC defended its decision, noting that Trump had repeatedly refused to be interviewed in conjunction with the film. In October 2016, Baxter announced the release of You've Been Trumped Too, a sequel to the film timed for release before the 2016 United States presidential election. The film focussed on the problems experienced by neighbours of the Trump International Golf Links, including a 92-year-old woman who claimed that she was forced to collect water from a nearby stream in a bucket after construction workers had cut off her supply. In response to the film, lawyers representing Trump International threatened legal action against anybody who screened the film.  Reception  Director Anthony Baxter during a Q&A; at the 2012 Miami International Film Festival premiere of the film ReelScotland reviewed the film, concluding \\"an emotive film which shows both what can happen when a Government considers money over its own laws and how those at the sharp end remain resilient throughout\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that the most fascinating aspect of the documentary is \\"Trump‚Äôs almost joyous rudeness\\" and that \\"the underlying message is that if you are rich and powerful enough, you can run roughshod over tradition and private property rights and buy your place at the table.\\" Stephen Holden wrote in the New York Times that the documentary is an \\"unabashedly hostile portrait\\" of Trump, depicting him as \\"an insensitive, lying bully\\" who tried to pressure the golf course's neighbors into sell their properties to him, including threatening them with compulsory purchase orders. Bill Forsyth, the director of Local Hero (from which the film used footage), reacted to the film positively. Forsyth saw the film at the Shetland Film Festival. The documentary and its director won several awards: *The Sheffield Green Award at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival, Sheffield, England, in 2011 *The Audience Award at the Dakino - Bucharest International Film Festival, Romania, in 2011 *The Maysles Brothers Award for Best Documentary Film at the Denver Film Festival, Denver, Colorado, USA, in 2011 *The Victor Rabinowitz and Joanne Grant Award for Social Justice at the Hamptons International Film Festival, East Hampton, NY, USA, in 2011 *The Directors‚Äô Choice Award for Best Environmental Film at the Sedona International Film Festival, Sedona, Arizona, USA, in 2012  A Dangerous Game (2014)  A follow-up documentary called A Dangerous Game was released in September 2014. The film continues the story of the locals' struggle against Donald Trump but goes further afield also. It documents Trump's plans to build a luxury golf course in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on Mount Srƒë overlooking Dubrovnik, against which local residents campaign. The residents win a referendum on the matter but this is ignored by officials.

OProfile can profile an entire system or its parts, from interrupt routines or drivers, to user-space processes. It has low overhead. The most widely supported kernel mode of \`oprofile\` uses a system timer (See: Gathering profiling events). However, this mode is unable to measure kernel functions where interrupts are disabled. Newer CPU models support a hardware performance counter mode which uses hardware logic to record events without any active code needed. In Linux 2.2/2.4 only 32-bit x86 and IA64 are supported; in Linux 2.6 there is wider support: x86 (32 and 64 bit), DEC Alpha, MIPS, ARM, sparc64, ppc64, AVR32. Call graphs are supported only on x86 and ARM. In 2012 two IBM engineers recognized OProfile as one of the two most commonly used performance counter monitor profiling tools on Linux, alongside perf tool.  User-space tools  * opcontrol is used to start and stop the daemon, which collects profiling data. This data is periodically saved to the \`/var/lib/oprofile/samples\` directory. * opreport shows basic profiling data.

This > Committee consisted of Representatives LeCompte of Iowa and St. George of > New York, with Representative Hays as Chairman.\\" Design An interfaith or non-partisan design was integral to the vision of the prayer room so that it could be used by any Senator or Representative regardless of his or her faith. To that end, an interfaith advisory committee was established, including the Chaplain of the Senate, the Chaplain of the House of Representatives, and since they were both Protestant, two additional members representing the Roman Catholic and Jewish faiths. The room includes a stained glass window of George Washington kneeling in prayer, with the words from Psalm 16:1, \\"Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I put my trust,\\" and the words President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address, \\"This Nation Under God\\". The designers of the Prayer Room felt that the image of Washington was particularly appropriate, given his words from his first inaugural address: > \\"...it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act, my > fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, > who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can > supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the > liberties and happiness of the people of the United States, a Government > instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every > instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the > functions allotted to his charge.\\" In addition to an open Bible, the simple furnishings include two prayer benches, six chairs, two candles, plants, and an American flag. The Congressional brochure notes the importance of both the symbolism and the color schemes employed in the Prayer Room: > \\"On the altar, two vases constantly filled with fresh flowers tell of the > beauty of God's world. At the right and left are two candelabra, each with > the traditional seven lights. An American flag is at the right of the altar. > In front of each candelabrum is a plain prie-dieu or prayer bench, at which > those who desire to do so may kneel.

Past religious usage In its early days, the Capitol building was actually used for religious services in addition to governmental functions, with Sunday church services regularly held until after the Civil War. According to the Library of Congress exhibit \\"Religion/ and the Founding of the American Republic\\" \\"It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became a church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.)\\" See also *Chaplain of the United States Senate *Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives *United States Capitol Rotunda References Category:United States Capitol rooms Category:1955 establishments in Washington, D.C.

The commission was set up after the Chicago riots of July and August 1919 in \\"which thirty-eight lives were lost, twenty-three Negros and fifteen whites, and 537 persons were injured\\".The purpose of the commission was to investigate the causes of the Riot and make recommendations to prevent a tragedy like this from reoccurring. The research was the first extensive research on interracial Black-white relations conducted in Chicago funded by a government agency. The sociological study was published in 1922 by the University of Chicago Press as The Negro in Chicago ‚Äì A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot. The study included a substantial review of the background of the riots, the riots themselves, and their aftermath, together with original work and investigation into the relations between and perceptions of the black and white communities in Chicago. The Negro in Chicago ran to 672 pages with a number of plates, plans and other additional matter. The Commission The Chicago Commission on Race Relations was established at a meeting of eighty-one citizens, representing forty-eight social, civic, commercial, and professional organizations of Chicago. They set up a commission composed entirely of men six African-Americans and six European-Americans: European Americans * Edgar Bancroft * William Scott Bond * Edward Osgood Brown * Harry Eugene Kelly * Victor Lawson * Julius Rosenwald African Americans * Robert Sengstacke Abbott * George Cleveland Hall * George H. Jackson * Edward H. Morris * Adelbert H. Roberts * Lacey Kirk Williams Before conducting the research, the commission felt that a strong emphasis should be placed on understanding the life of the Negro in Chicago, in particular the relations between the two races. The following six subcommittees were created: * Committee on Racial Clashes * Committee on Housing, Committee on Industry * Committee on Industry, * Committee on Crime * Committee on Racial Contracts * Committee on Public Opinion Chicago at this time experienced a substantial increase of Black migration from the South. World War I had brought industrial jobs to cities in the North but many of these jobs were subject to a color bar and only available to whites. The arrival of black people in northern cities led to an increase in rent in underdeveloped neighborhoods and white flight. Expansion of the ghetto caused friction among white residents such that \\"bombs were thrown at black owned homes\\". The research was conducted by a series of \\"conferences or informal hearings, and through research and fieldwork carried on by staff or trained investigator\\". Chicago's neighborhoods were classified into four groups: (1) mixed, unadjusted neighborhoods; (2) mixed, adjusted neighborhoods; (3) contested areas; and (4) neighborhoods that are entirely white or negro. The study concluded that there were no immediate solutions to remedy the tensions between the racial groups and suggested that \\"through mutual understanding and sympathy between the races will be followed by harmony and co-operation\\".

The last attempt at this was in 1525, by Jacob Ben-Hayim. Cohen's work demonstrates the extent to which Judaism venerates every tiny biblical calligraphic notation, to ensure that worldwide communities use exactly the same version of the Old Testament. Background According to Jewish law, a Torah is invalid for public reading if even a single letter is incorrect or misplaced, for Jewish law considers each letter as indispensable. In 1525, in Venice, Jacob Ben-Hayim, editor of the second edition of the Mikraot Gedolot, took it upon himself to fix grammatical errors in the Hebrew Bible. Ben-Hayim's version unified Judaism's varying texts and commentaries on the Bible under one umbrella, and it is this version that has remained the standard version used by generations to this day. However, Ben-Hayim had to rely on inferior manuscripts and commentaries, which caused numerous inaccuracies to appear in his version, and these were only magnified in subsequent editions. Mission In 2012, 84-year-old Israeli Judaic scholar Menachem Cohen of the Bible department at Bar-Ilan University finished a 30-year mission to fix all known textual errors in the Hebrew Bible to produce a \\"truly definitive edition of the Old Testament.\\" Cohen's edits focused mainly on grammatical errors, such as fixing the accent of a vowel, the letter in a word, or fixing biblical symbols used for accentuation and cantillation (te'amim) which were copied down incorrectly centuries ago. Cohen used thousands of medieval manuscripts to identify approximately 1,500 inaccuracies in the Hebrew Bible, which he corrected in a 21-volume set. The errors that Cohen found do not alter the meaning of the Bible or have any bearing on its stories. Most errors were not found in the Torah (or Five Books of Moses), which does not include vowel markings or cantillation notations, but rather in the final two-thirds of the Tanakh. Cohen also included the most comprehensive commentaries available, most notably that of Rashi. Cohen primarily relied on the Aleppo Codex, a thousand- year-old text considered to be the most accurate copy of the Bible. In 1947, a Syrian mob burned the synagogue that was protecting the Codex, and the Codex briefly disappeared before most of it was smuggled out into Israel a decade later. Cohen has not called for any changes in how traditional Torah scrolls are written, as this would likely result in a \\"firestorm of objection and criticism,\\" but rather aimed for accuracy in versions used by Hebrew readers for studying. Cohen said: > The people of Israel took upon themselves, at least in theory, one version > of the Bible, down to its last letter... It was amazing to me that for 500 > years, people didn't sense the errors.They just assumed that everything was > fine, but in practice everything was not fine... I want the Bible to be > user-friendly. Today, we can create sources of information and searches that > allow you to get an answer to everything you are wondering... Cohen also stressed that unity and accuracy in the Hebrew Bible were important in order to distinguish the sacred Jewish text from those used by break-away sects, such as the Christians and Samaritans. In addition, Cohen launched a digital version, with the help of his son Shmuel, a computer programmer, which he hopes will become a benchmark of the Israeli education system.

Justification from eternity is a concept within Protestant theology asserting that the justification of a believer takes place at least partially in eternity past. Justification from eternity is not part of mainstream Protestant theology, and is explicitly rejected by the Westminster Confession of Faith, which asserts, > God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, > in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their > justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit > does, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them.Westminster Confession of > Faith, Chapter XI, Paragraph 4. Reformed orthodox theologians taught that justification is part of an order of salvation, and that it follows effectual calling and a person actually believing. Francis Turretin in his Institutes of Elenctic Theology speaks of some who teach instead that justification was actually executed eternally. He agrees that justification was decreed eternally, but counters that actual execution occurs during people's lives. Justification from eternity is the teaching that justification itself is eternal rather than temporal, and that it occurs before faith rather than after it. Justification from eternity has been described as a \\"chief tenet of Antinomian Hyper-Calvinism,\\"Eternal Justification?, Banner of Truth. Early antinomians John Eaton and John Saltmarsh taught that justification precedes faith, though they did not specifically teach the doctrine of justification from eternity, and William Twisse taught that at least in some sense justification precedes faith. Justification from eternity seems to have been taught by William Pemble, and it was one of the charges against Anne Hutchinson. Tobias Crisp was one of the most notorious teachers of this view. It was later propounded by John Gill. Referring to Ephesians 1:3-4, Gill argued that \\"justification is one of those spiritual blessings wherewith the elect are blessed in Christ according to election-grace, before the foundation of the world.\\"John Gill, \\"Justification as an Eternal and Immanent Act of God ,\\" in A Body of Doctrinal Divinity, Book II, Chapter V, section II. Another exponent of this doctrine was Abraham Kuyper. G. C. Berkouwer notes Kuyper's view came out of a belief that \\"justification does not originate through faith but that it is only accepted in and through faith.\\"G. C. Berkouwer, Justification from Eternity. Opponents of the doctrine have countered with the argument that it undermines justification by faith.Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology (London, Banner of Truth, 1941), 519.

It formed on March 16 and moved westward for the first ten days of its duration. Warm waters and low wind shear allowed for the storm to gradually strengthen. After developing a well- defined eye, Nadia intensified to reach winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10 minute sustained) early on March 22, according to M√©t√©o-France (MF). In contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated winds of about 220 km/h (140 mph 1 minute sustained). On March 23, the cyclone struck northern Madagascar, causing flooding and localized damage where it moved ashore. There were 12 deaths in the country. Nadia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weakened storm, although it reintensified slightly before making landfall in northeastern Mozambique on March 24\\\\. The storm turned southward through the country, emerging over water on March 26\\\\. It turned to the northeast and meandered over waters before dissipating on April 1\\\\. Damage was heaviest in Mozambique, estimated at about $20 million (1994 USD). Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% of the houses were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5 million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the harvest, and lack of food resulted in 300 deaths in the months after the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240 deaths and injured thousands. Effects spread as far inland as Malawi. Meteorological history A disturbance in the Indian Ocean intertropical convergence zone became evident southeast of the Chagos Archipelago on March 16 after two cyclones moved away from the region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March 17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March 19 allowed for strengthening. On March 19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S. After becoming a tropical storm, Nadia quickly intensified, developing a central dense overcast and later an eye. With minimal wind shear, the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone early on March 21. That day, the JTWC estimated winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute sustained), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and late on March 21, MF upgraded Nadia into an intense tropical cyclone. While the cyclone was approaching northern Madagascar on March 22, MF estimated Nadia attained maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph 10 minute sustained) early on March 22. At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of about 220 km/h (140 mph (1-minute sustained)). While at peak intensity, Nadia had well-defined outflow and an eye no larger than . At about 0100 UTC on March 23, Nadia made landfall on northern Madagascar near Vohemar, having weakened slightly from its peak. While located over Madagascar, Nadia weakened into a tropical storm due to the mountainous terrain. With warm temperatures, the storm re-intensified slightly after entering the Mozambique Channel, and it passed about south of Mayotte at 1900 UTC on March 23\\\\. At 1700 UTC the next day, Nadia made its second landfall on Mozambique, about halfway between Nacala and Mo√ßambique. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC discontinued advisories. Despite moving further inland, Nadia retained a well-organized circulation and convection. The storm turned to the south and re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel late on March 26 near the mouth of the Zambezi River. Nadia gradually re-intensified while curving to the southeast, and it re-intensified into a tropical storm on March 28, the same day the JTWC resumed issuing advisories. The storm strengthened to reach a secondary peak intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph (10 minute sustained)), according to MF. After reaching a position about halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar, Nadia turned to the southwest on April 1 and lost its remaining convection. The JTWC and MF discontinued advisories that day, and the circulation dissipated a day later. Impact and aftermath Damaged building in Nacala, Mozambique While crossing northern Madagascar, Nadia produced widespread flooding. In Vohemar where it moved ashore, the storm destroyed most public buildings, although local churches provided assistance in the aftermath. Across the region, the storm downed power lines and destroyed more than 540 tonnes (600 tons) of rice. The cyclone killed 12 people and caused about $200,000 damage (1994 USD). Upon striking Mozambique, Nadia produced heavy rains and strong wind gusts, causing widespread tree damage and flooding. The city of Nampula recorded 126 mm (4.96 in) of rainfall in a 24‚Äëhour period. Damage was heaviest in Nampula, Zambezia, Manica, and Sofala provinces. In Nampula Province, Nadia destroyed 85% of the houses and 75% of the crops, mostly cashew trees. The city of Nacala was heavily damaged, with about 170,000 people losing their houses. Many residents evacuated Nacala, and temporary shelters were provided for those who stayed. At the port in Nacala, the local harbor was wrecked and two ships sank; one of the damaged ships spilled oil into the Bay of Nacala. The city lost power and water, and its primary hospital was destroyed. About of power lines were cut between Nampula and Nacala, and widespread road and bridge damage disrupted transportation. In the area along Nadia's path, over 120 schools were damaged destroyed, affecting over 46,864 students. Across the country, roughly 1.5 million people were left homeless. A World Food Programme building in the city was destroyed, wrecking 642 tonnes (708 tons) of stored food. Overall, Nadia killed 240 people in Mozambique and injured thousands. Damage was estimated at $20 million (1994 USD). Damage from Nadia extended as far inland as Malawi. =Aftermath= After the storm, about 300,000 people in Nampula Province in Mozambique required food and other goods. Officials sent relief to the affected areas, including iron sheeting and medical teams. Due to damage to sanitation facilities, there were outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera in the weeks after the storm. By April 20, most primary roads were cleared, bridge reconstruction had commenced, and power was being restored. Heavy crop damage depleted food supplies, The cyclone struck shortly before the annual harvest, causing heavy crop damage that depleted food supplies. Some residents who evacuated during the country's civil war returned late to assist in harvesting the remaining crops. In the six months after the storm, about 300 people died due to starvation. Many secondary roads remained blocked in the weeks after the storm, forcing relief supplies to be transported by boat. The country appealed to the international community for assistance, and by Mary 6, various international agencies and governments donated about $1.4 million in cash (1994 USD). The French government sent $48,000 worth of medicine, blankets, and food, the United Kingdom sent $373,134 for generators, water tanks, and roofing materials, and the Spanish government sent about $117,000 worth of food and tents. The charity organization Concern Worldwide sent 54,000 sets of clothing to the country. The government of Japan sent 6,000 blankets and 1,800 bars of soap, while the Italian government sent five generators, eight water tanks, and 1,150 agricultural tools. Donated generators assisted in restoring water in Nacala. In June 1994, the World Bank provided $20 million in assistance to the country due to the storm. Cyclone Nadia contributed to fishing exports decreasing by $11 million during the year.

It was established in 1802 by splitting the Byelorussia Governorate and existed until 1924. Today most of the area belongs to Belarus, the northwestern part to Latvia and the northeastern part to Pskov and Smolensk Oblasts of Russia. History The European part of the Russian Empire in 1917. Vitebsk Governorate is shown in yellow. In 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Inflanty Voivodeship and eastern Belarus were transferred to Russia. In order to accommodate these areas, Pskov Governorate was created. It was proven too big to be manageable, and in 1776 it was split into Pskov and Polotsk Governorates. In 1778 Polotsk Governorate was transformed into Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1793, the Second Partition of Poland followed, which resulted in the expansion of Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1796, viceroyalties were abolished. In particular, Polotsk and Mogilev Viceroyalties were merged into Byelorussia Governorate. On February 27, 1802 Byelorussia Governorate was split into Vitebsk and Mogilev Governorates. The governorate consisted of 12 uyezds (the administrative centers, which all had the town status, are given in parentheses) * Dinaburgsky Uyezd, from 1893 Dvinsky Uyezd (Dinaburg, currently Daugavpils, now in Latvia) * Drissensky Uyezd (Drissa, now Verkhnyadzvinsk, Belarus) * Gorodoksky Uyezd (Haradok, Belarus) * Lepelsky Uyezd (Lepiel, Belarus) * Lyutsinsky Uyezd (Ludza, Latvia) * Nevelsky Uyezd (Nevel, Russia) * Polotsky Uyezd (Polotsk, Belarus) * Rezhitsky Uyezd (Rƒìzekne, Latvia) * Sebezhsky Uyezd (Sebezh, Russia) * Surazhsky Uyezd (Surazh, split between Russia and Belarus) * Velizhsky Uyezd (Velizh, Russia) * Vitebsky Uyezd (Vitebsk, Belarus) In 1866, Surazhsky Uyezd was abolished and split between Gorodoksky, Velizhsky, and Vitebsky Uyezd. On 31 December 1917, Dvinsky, Lyutsinsky and Rezhitsky Uyezds, populated mostly by Latvians and known in Latvian as Latgale, were transferred to Governorate of Livonia, becoming a part of the Latvian Soviet autonomy of Iskolat. Following the Latvian War of Independence, in 1920 the area became a part of the Republic of Latvia under the Latvian‚ÄìSoviet Peace Treaty. After 1919, the rest of Vitebsk Governorate was a part of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished. Most of it was transferred to Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which at the time had districts as the first-level administrative division. Three uyezds, Sebezhsky, Nevelsky, and Velizhsky, were transferred to Pskov Governorate. Governors The administration of the governorate was performed by a governor.

Eidu's parents were murdered in a feud when he was very young, and he escaped only through the protection of a neighbour. At the age of twelve, he took revenge by killing his parents' murderer, after which he fled to the home of an aunt, who was married to the chieftain of the fortress of Giyamuhu. Here he became a close friend of the chieftain's son, Gahasan Hashu, who later married Nurhaci's sister. Military career In 1580, Nurhaci, then twenty-one years old, passed through Giyamuhu and stopped at the chieftain's home. The eighteen-year-old Eidu was so impressed by his qualities of leadership that he attached himself to Nurhaci and remained his close associate for more than forty years. In 1583, he accompanied Nurhaci and proved himself an able fighter. Four years later he captured the town of Barda, and received from Nurhaci the title of baturu, \\"conquering hero.\\" After a long and successful career of military achievement, he joined the Bordered Yellow Banner in 1615, and was appointed as one of the five principal dignitaries in government the following year. In 1617 he captured a number of Ming fortresses in company with Anfiyanggu, and in 1619, was at the forefront of the decisive battles waged by Nurhaci against the three armies of Yang Hao. As reward for his services, he was given a sister of Nurhaci as one of his wives. Eidu's second son, Daki, was brought up in the royal establishment, and married the fifth daughter of Nurhaci. When Daki spoke out against Nurhaci's sons, Eidu put him to death, prompting Nurhaci to call Eidu his most patriotic officer. Death and legacy Eidu died in 1621. In 1634, he was posthumously awarded the rank of a viscount, which was inherited by his sixteenth son, Ebilun. In 1636, his rank was raised to that of duke (non-hereditary). His name was entered in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, his tomb was moved to a location near that of Nurhaci. A stone tablet was erected in front of the tomb in 1654. The rank of viscount was taken from Ebilun in 1637, due to a misdemeanor, but was restored in 1713 and given to his son, Yende. After Yende was made a duke in 1724, the title of viscount was inherited by other branches of Eidu's family. Eidu had sixteen sons, among whom the most prominent were the youngest, Ebilun, and the eighth, Turgei, who took part in many military campaigns during Hong Taiji's reign, and was highly regarded for his bravery. Among the grandsons of Eidu the most notable was Centai, who served as a Grand Secretary in 1651, and was made a viscount while commanding the Manchu forces in Hunan against Ming generals. Many other descendants of Eidu held office throughout the Qing period. References * Kennedy, George A. \\"Eidu.\\" edited by Hummel, Arthur W. (1943). Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period.

Its name derives from a rivulet flowing on northern and eastern sides of the city. Initially Lyubutsk was part of the Principality of Bryansk. In the 14th century, the city was acquired by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The town was mentioned in 1372 when Algirdas of Lithuania and Mikhail II of Tver marched against Dmitry Donskoy, Grand Duke of Moscow, who managed to stop the joint army. After a period of stand off, Algirdas and Dmitry reached an agreement and concluded the Treaty of Lyubutsk. In 1408, Lyubustk became a property of Vladimir the Bold. However, in 1473 was again under the rule of Lithuania. In 1460 Lyubutsk was mentioned as a settlement reached by Akhmat Khan during his attack on Lithuania and Moscow. Finally, the city came under the rule of Moscow after the 1503 truce ending the second Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian War. Tsar Ivan III bequeathed the fortress to his son Andrey of Staritsa. In the 16th century Lyubutsk ceased to be a fortress and became a posad. In 1566 Lyubutsk was mentioned as a mere village.

It was released in 1998 by Drag City. The two-disc set comprises the band's performance at the Angry Arts Festival in Los Angeles as well as their sets from various shows at the Berkeley Folk Festival during summer 1967. Like all the music played at the festivals, it is dedicated to the troops positioned in Vietnam.  Background  Kurt Von Meier, a University of California art-history professor, became interested in the band after he heard tapes containing Coconut Hotel, Red Krayola's rejected second album. He was intrigued by the band's experimental and free-form music and invited them to perform at Angry Arts Folk Festival in Berkeley and the Greek Theater in Los Angeles in June and July. Meier also pushed to get the band to play in the Monterey Pop Festival, but was turned down by the festival's organizers.  Performance  The music played by the Red Krayola during their sets was completely instrumental and consisted of improvised drone and electronic music, comparable to early Velvet Underground. The first disc contains the band's performance at the Angry Arts Festival on June 6, 1967. The second disc is made up of three separate performances which took place in the evenings between June 27 to July 4. During the festival, the band met the folk guitarist John Fahey, who accompanied the band onstage for an improvisation session. On the 4th, the announcer mistook the Red Krayola's music for an equipment malfunction and continued to talk several minutes into the band's set.  Reception  These performances received a lukewarm response from audience and critics alike. Berkeley's underground newspaper, the Berkeley Barb, dismissed the band as being the \\"bummer of the festival.\\" Some of audience accused the music of being so abrasive that it was the direct cause of a dog's death during the festival. However, some of the audience appreciated the band's feedback-laden sound, some of whom can be heard chanting \\"More! More!\\" at the end of the band's performance on the 4th. In reviewing the two-disc release, the music critic Richie Unterberger noted his admiration of the band's dedication to experimenting in-front of an audience who expected more conventional music. He gave the album two out of five stars, writing, \\"The Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd, however, rarely stuck with this kind of inaccessible freakiness for more than a few minutes at a time on record, even at their most willfully obscure.

History Afrikaner sheep are one of the oldest native sheep breeds in South Africa, along with sheep such as the Damara, Blackhead Persian, Pedi, and Zulu (Nguni). Their ancestors were brought down from the middle east by the Khoikhoin people. Ronderib Afrikaners are thought to be the first sheep imported to Australia, with the First Fleet in 1788, but today are very rare in the country.  Varieties  There are two varieties of Afrikaner sheep; The Namaqua Afrikaner and the Ronderib Afrikaner. Their long, fat tail is an energy store which helps them survive long dry seasons, when fat or lipid breaks down it provides energy and water at the same time; hydrogen is present in all lipids, although hydrogen is not water when not combined to another molecule it automatically grabs two oxygen molecules and becomes H20 water, the rest of the molecules associated with the lipid become energy and combine to form other nutrients. The Namaqua Afrikaner is known for its hardiness in extreme environmental conditions. It is a slender, lanky sheep with a fat tail, and is not particularly favored for modern lamb production. Namaqua Afrikaners are generally white with a red or black head, and large fat tails. What the breed lacks in market meat desirability, it makes up for in its foraging ability and hardiness in desert conditions. The Ronderib Afrikaner is one of the larger breeds of South African indigenous sheep. There are two known sub varieties of this breed, one that has soft, fine, shiny hair being the Blinkhaar Ronderib Afrikaner, and the Steekhaar Ronderib Afrikaner having coarse hair, which was thought to be extinct. However, twenty animals were found in 1995 on a farm near Upington. The ribs of both are oval in cross section rather than flat. It is these two characteristics of coat and rib shape which distinguish this distinctive breed. Like the Namaqua Afrikaner (mentioned above) the breed is very adept to desert conditions and is remarkable for the long Seasons it can survive with little or no water. The Ronderib Afrikaners show further characteristics of desert animals in that, similar to the gemsbok, their heels are close together. The aim of the old Ronderib breeders was to develop sheep with shiny coats suitable for making of skin blankets.

The methods use the theory of bounded operators on Hilbert space. They can be used to deduce regularity properties of solutions and to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problems. Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions Let be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Since is contained in a large square in , it can be regarded as a domain in by identifying opposite sides of the square. The theory of Sobolev spaces on can be found in , an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as and .

Since such form a dense subspace of , it follows that on . *Support properties: Let be the complement of and define restricted Sobolev spaces analogously for . Both sets of spaces have a natural pairing with . The Sobolev space for is the annihilator in the Sobolev space for of and that for is the annihilator of . In fact this is proved by locally applying a small translation to move the domain inside itself and then smoothing by a smooth convolution operator. :Suppose in annihilates . By compactness, there are finitely many open sets covering such that the closure of is disjoint from and each is an open disc about a boundary point such that in small translations in the direction of the normal vector carry into . Add an open with closure in to produce a cover of and let be a partition of unity subordinate to this cover.

Convolving by smooth functions of small support produces smooth approximations in the annihilator of a slightly smaller domain still with complement in . These are necessarily smooth functions of compact support in . *Further vanishing properties on the boundary: The characterization in terms of annihilators shows that lies in if (and only if) it and its derivatives of order less than vanish on . In fact can be extended to by setting it to be on . This extension defines an element in using the formula for the norm ::\\\\h\\\\_{(k)}^2=\\\\sum_{j=0}^k {k\\\\choose j} \\\\left \\\\\\\\partial_x^j\\\\partial_y^{k-j} h \\\\right\\\\^2. :Moreover satisfies for g in . *Duality: For , define to be the orthogonal complement of in .

Application to Dirichlet problem =Invertibility of = The operator defines an isomorphism between and . In fact it is a Fredholm operator of index . The kernel of in consists of constant functions and none of these except zero vanish on the boundary of . Hence the kernel of is and is invertible. In particular the equation has a unique solution in for in . =Eigenvalue problem= Let be the operator on defined by :T = R_1\\\\Delta^{-1}R_0, where is the inclusion of in and of in , both compact operators by Rellich's theorem. The operator is compact and self- adjoint with for all . By the spectral theorem, there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions in with :Tf_n = \\\\mu_nf_n, \\\\qquad \\\\mu_n >0, \\\\mu_n \\\\to 0. Since , lies in .

Sobolev spaces without boundary condition To determine the regularity properties of the eigenfunctions and solutions of :\\\\Delta f =u,\\\\qquad u\\\\in H^{-1}(\\\\Omega), f\\\\in H^1_0(\\\\Omega), enlargements of the Sobolev spaces have to be considered. Let be the space of smooth functions on which with their derivatives extend continuously to . By Borel's lemma, these are precisely the restrictions of smooth functions on . The Sobolev space is defined to the Hilbert space completion of this space for the norm :\\\\f\\\\_{(k)}^2 = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k {k\\\\choose j} \\\\left \\\\\\\\partial_x^j\\\\partial_y^{k-j}f \\\\right\\\\^2. This norm agrees with the Sobolev norm on so that can be regarded as a closed subspace of . Unlike , is not naturally a subspace of , but the map restricting smooth functions from to is continuous for the Sobolev norm so extends by continuity to a map . *Invariance under diffeomorphism: Any diffeomorphism between the closures of two smooth domains induces an isomorphism between the Sobolev space. This is a simple consequence of the chain rule for derivatives. *Extension theorem: The restriction of to the orthogonal complement of its kernel defines an isomorphism onto . The extension map is defined to be the inverse of this map: it is an isomorphism (not necessarily norm preserving) of onto the orthogonal complement of such that . On , it agrees with the natural inclusion map. Bounded extension maps of this kind from to were constructed first constructed by Hestenes and Lions. For smooth curves the Seeley extension theorem provides an extension which is continuous in all the Sobolev norms. A version of the extension which applies in the case where the boundary is just a Lipschitz curve was constructed by Calder√≥n using singular integral operators and generalized by . :It is sufficient to construct an extension for a neighbourhood of a closed annulus, since a collar around the boundary is diffeomorphic to an annulus with a closed interval in . Taking a smooth bump function with , equal to 1 near the boundary and 0 outside the collar, will provide an extension on . On the annulus, the problem reduces to finding an extension for in . Using a partition of unity the task of extending reduces to a neighbourhood of the end points of . Assuming 0 is the left end point, an extension is given locally by ::E(f) = \\\\sum_{m=0}^k a_m f \\\\left (-\\\\frac{x}{m+1} \\\\right ). :Matching the first derivatives of order k or less at 0, gives ::\\\\sum_{m=0}^k (-m-1)^{-k} a_m =1. :This matrix equation is solvable because the determinant is non-zero by Vandermonde's formula. It is straightforward to check that the formula for , when appropriately modified with bump functions, leads to an extension which is continuous in the above Sobolev norm. *Restriction theorem: The restriction map is surjective with . This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the support properties for Sobolev spaces with boundary condition. *Duality: is naturally the dual of H‚àík0(Œ©). Again this is an immediate consequence of the restriction theorem. Thus the Sobolev spaces form a chain: ::\\\\cdots \\\\subset H^2(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset H^1(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset H^0(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset H^{-1}_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset H^{-2}_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\subset \\\\cdots :The differentiation operators carry each Sobolev space into the larger one with index 1 less. *Sobolev embedding theorem: is contained in . This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the Sobolev embedding theorem for . *Characterization: consists of in such that all the derivatives ‚àÇŒ±f lie in for Œ± ‚â§ k.Here the derivatives are taken within the chain of Sobolev spaces above.See:  Since is weakly dense in , this condition is equivalent to the existence of functions fŒ± such that ::\\\\left(f_\\\\alpha,\\\\varphi \\\\right)=(-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\left (f, \\\\partial^\\\\alpha \\\\varphi \\\\right ), \\\\qquad \\\\alpha \\\\leq k, \\\\varphi \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}_c(\\\\Omega). :To prove the characterization, note that if is in , then lies in Hk‚àíŒ±(Œ©) and hence in . Conversely the result is well known for the Sobolev spaces : the assumption implies that the is in and the corresponding condition on the Fourier coefficients of shows that lies in . Similarly the result an be proved directly for an annulus . In fact by the argument on the restriction of to any smaller annulus [‚àíŒ¥',Œ¥'] √ó T lies in : equivalently the restriction of the function lies in for . On the other hand in as , so that must lie in . The case for a general domain reduces to these two cases since can be written as with œà a bump function supported in such that is supported in a collar of the boundary. *Regularity theorem: If in has both derivatives and in then lies in . This is an immediate consequence of the characterization of above. In fact if this is true even when satisfied at the level of distributions: if there are functions g, h in such that (g,œÜ) = (f, œÜx) and (h,œÜ) = (f,œÜy) for œÜ in , then is in . *Rotations on an annulus: For an annulus , the extension map to is by construction equivariant with respect to rotations in the second variable, ::R_t f(x,y)=f(x,y+t). :On it is known that if is in , then the difference quotient in ; if the difference quotients are bounded in Hk then ‚àÇyf lies in . Both assertions are consequences of the formula: ::\\\\widehat{\\\\delta_h f}(m,n) = h^{-1}(e^{-ihn}-1)\\\\widehat{f}(m,n)=-\\\\int_0^1 in e^{-inht}\\\\, dt \\\\,\\\\,\\\\widehat{f}(m,n). :These results on imply analogous results on the annulus using the extension. Regularity for Dirichlet problem =Regularity for dual Dirichlet problem= If with in and in with , then lies in . Take a decomposition with supported in and supported in a collar of the boundary. Standard Sobolev theory for can be applied to : elliptic regularity implies that it lies in and hence . lies in of a collar, diffeomorphic to an annulus, so it suffices to prove the result with a collar and replaced by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta_1 &= \\\\Delta -[\\\\Delta,\\\\psi]  &=\\\\Delta + \\\\left(p\\\\partial_x + q\\\\partial_y - \\\\Delta \\\\psi \\\\right)  &=\\\\Delta +X. \\\\end{align} The proof proceeds by induction on , proving simultaneously the inequality :\\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)} \\\\le C\\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k-1)} + C \\\\u\\\\_{(k)}, for some constant depending only on . It is straightforward to establish this inequality for , where by density can be taken to be smooth of compact support in : :\\\\begin{align} \\\\u\\\\_{(1)}^2 &= (\\\\Delta u, u)  &\\\\le (\\\\Delta_1 u,u) +(Xu,u)  &\\\\le \\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(-1)}\\\\u\\\\_{(1)} +C^\\\\prime \\\\u\\\\_{(1)}\\\\u\\\\_{(0)}. \\\\end{align} The collar is diffeomorphic to an annulus. The rotational flow on the annulus induces a flow on the collar with corresponding vector field . Thus corresponds to the vector field . The radial vector field on the annulus is a commuting vector field which on the collar gives a vector field proportional to the normal vector field. The vector fields and commute. The difference quotients can be formed for the flow . The commutators are second order differential operators from to . Their operators norms are uniformly bounded for near ; for the computation can be carried out on the annulus where the commutator just replaces the coefficients of by their difference quotients composed with . On the other hand, lies in , so the inequalities for apply equally well for : :\\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\delta_h u\\\\_{(k+1)} &\\\\le C\\\\\\\\Delta_1 \\\\delta_h u\\\\_{(k-1)} + C \\\\\\\\delta_h u\\\\_{(k)}  &\\\\le C \\\\\\\\delta_h \\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k-1)} + C\\\\[\\\\delta_h,\\\\Delta_1] u\\\\_{(k-1)} + C \\\\\\\\delta_h u\\\\_{(k)}  &\\\\le C\\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k)} + C^\\\\prime \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)}. \\\\end{align} The uniform boundedness of the difference quotients implies that lies in with :\\\\Y u\\\\_{(k+1)} \\\\le C \\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k)} + C^\\\\prime \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)}. It follows that lies in where is the vector field :V = \\\\frac{Y}{\\\\sqrt{r^2+s^2}} = a\\\\partial_x + b\\\\partial_y, \\\\qquad a^2 + b^2 = 1. Moreover, satisfies a similar inequality to . :\\\\V u\\\\_{(k+1)} \\\\le C^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\left (\\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k)} + \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)} \\\\right). Let be the orthogonal vector field :W=-b\\\\partial_x + a\\\\partial_y. It can also be written as for some smooth nowhere vanishing function on a neighbourhood of the collar. It suffices to show that lies in . For then :(V \\\\pm iW)u =(a \\\\mp i b) \\\\left (\\\\partial_x \\\\pm i \\\\partial_y \\\\right)u, so that and lie in and must lie in . To check the result on , it is enough to show that and lie in . Note that :\\\\begin{align} A &=\\\\Delta - V^2 - W^2,  B &=[V,W], \\\\end{align} are vector fields. But then :\\\\begin{align} W^2u &=\\\\Delta u - V^2u - Au,  VWu &= WVu + Bu, \\\\end{align} with all terms on the right hand side in . Moreover, the inequalities for show that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Wu\\\\_{(k+1)} &\\\\le C \\\\left (\\\\VWu\\\\_{(k)} + \\\\left \\\\W^2u \\\\right \\\\_{(k)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C \\\\left \\\\ \\\\left (\\\\Delta - V^2 -A \\\\right )u \\\\right \\\\_{(k)} + C \\\\(WV+B)u\\\\_{(k)}  &\\\\le C_1 \\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k)} + C_1 \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)}. \\\\end{align} Hence :\\\\begin{align} \\\\u\\\\_{(k+2)} &\\\\le C \\\\left (\\\\Vu\\\\_{(k+1)} + \\\\Wu\\\\_{(k+1)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C^\\\\prime \\\\\\\\Delta_1 u\\\\_{(k)} + C^\\\\prime \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)}. \\\\end{align} =Smoothness of eigenfunctions= It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the dual Dirichlet problem that the eigenfunctions of in lie in . Moreover, any solution of with in and in must have in . In both cases by the vanishing properties, the eigenfunctions and vanish on the boundary of . =Solving the Dirichlet problem= The dual Dirichlet problem can be used to solve the Dirichlet problem: : \\\\begin{cases}\\\\Delta f_\\\\Omega = 0  f_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} =g & g \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\partial \\\\Omega)\\\\end{cases} By Borel's lemma is the restriction of a function in . Let be the smooth solution of with on . Then solves the Dirichlet problem. By the maximal principle, the solution is unique. Application to smooth Riemann mapping theorem The solution to the Dirichlet problem can be used to prove a strong form of the Riemann mapping theorem for simply connected domains with smooth boundary. The method also applies to a region diffeomorphic to an annulus. For multiply connected regions with smooth boundary have given a method for mapping the region onto a disc with circular holes. Their method involves solving the Dirichlet problem with a non-linear boundary condition. They construct a function such that: * is harmonic in the interior of ; * On we have: , where is the curvature of the boundary curve, is the derivative in the direction normal to and is constant on each boundary component. gives a proof of the Riemann mapping theorem for a simply connected domain with smooth boundary. Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that . The solution of the Dirichlet problem shows that there is a unique smooth function on which is harmonic in and equals on . Define the Green's function by . It vanishes on and is harmonic on away from . The harmonic conjugate of is the unique real function on such that is holomorphic. As such it must satisfy the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations: :\\\\begin{align} U_x &= -V_y,  U_y &= V_x. \\\\end{align} The solution is given by :V(z)=\\\\int_0^z -U_y dx + V_x dy, where the integral is taken over any path in . It is easily verified that and exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of . Thus is a smooth function on , vanishing at . By the Cauchy-Riemann is smooth on , holomorphic on and . The function is only defined up to multiples of , but the function :F(z) =e^{G(z)+iH(z)}= z e^{f(z)} is a holomorphic on and smooth on . By construction, and for . Since has winding number , so too does . On the other hand, only for where there is a simple zero. So by the argument principle assumes every value in the unit disc, , exactly once and does not vanish inside . To check that the derivative on the boundary curve is non-zero amounts to computing the derivative of , i.e. the derivative of should not vanish on the boundary curve. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations these tangential derivative are up to a sign the directional derivative in the direction of the normal to the boundary. But vanishes on the boundary and is strictly negative in since . The Hopf lemma implies that the directional derivative of in the direction of the outward normal is strictly positive. So on the boundary curve, has nowhere vanishing derivative. Since the boundary curve has winding number one, defines a diffeomorphism of the boundary curve onto the unit circle. Accordingly, is a smooth diffeomorphism, which restricts to a holomorphic map and a smooth diffeomorphism between the boundaries. Similar arguments can be applied to prove the Riemann mapping theorem for a doubly connected domain bounded by simple smooth curves (the inner curve) and (the outer curve). By translating we can assume 1 lies on the outer boundary. Let be the smooth solution of the Dirichlet problem with on the outer curve and on the inner curve. By the maximum principle for in and so by the Hopf lemma the normal derivatives of are negative on the outer curve and positive on the inner curve. The integral of over the boundary is zero by Stoke's theorem so the contributions from the boundary curves cancel. On the other hand, on each boundary curve the contribution is the integral of the normal derivative along the boundary. So there is a constant such that satisfies :\\\\int_{C} \\\\left (-U_y \\\\,dx + U_x \\\\, dy \\\\right ) = 2\\\\pi on each boundary curve. The harmonic conjugate of can again be defined by :V(z)=\\\\int_1^z -u_y \\\\,dx + u_x \\\\, dy and is well-defined up to multiples of . The function :\\\\displaystyle{F(z)=e^{U(z) + i V(z)}} is smooth on and holomorphic in . On the outer curve and on the inner curve . The tangential derivatives on the outer curves are nowhere vanishing by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, since the normal derivatives are nowhere vanishing. The normalization of the integrals implies that restricts to a diffeomorphism between the boundary curves and the two concentric circles. Since the images of outer and inner curve have winding number and about any point in the annulus, an application of the argument principle implies that assumes every value within the annulus exactly once; since that includes multiplicities, the complex derivative of is nowhere vanishing in . This is a smooth diffeomorphism of onto the closed annulus , restricting to a holomorphic map in the interior and a smooth diffeomorphism on both boundary curves. Trace map The restriction map extends to a continuous map for . In fact :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\widehat{\\\\tau f}(n)=\\\\sum_m \\\\widehat{f}(m,n),} so the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality yields :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left \\\\widehat{\\\\tau f}(n) \\\\right^2 \\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}} &\\\\le \\\\left(\\\\sum_m \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right)^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )^{k}}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum_m \\\\left \\\\widehat{f}(m,n) \\\\right ^2 \\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )^k\\\\right)  &\\\\le C_k \\\\sum_m \\\\left \\\\widehat{f}(m,n) \\\\right ^2 \\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )^k, \\\\end{align} where, by the integral test, :\\\\begin{align} C_k &= \\\\sup_n \\\\sum_m \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\\\left (1+m^2 +n^2 \\\\right )^k} < \\\\infty,  c_k &= \\\\inf_n \\\\sum_m \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\\\left (1+m^2 +n^2 \\\\right )^k} > 0. \\\\end{align} The map is onto since a continuous extension map can be constructed from to . In fact set :\\\\widehat{Eg}(m,n)=\\\\lambda_{n}^{-1} \\\\widehat{g}(n) \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\\\left (1+n^2+m^2 \\\\right )^k}, where :\\\\lambda_n= \\\\sum_m \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )^k}. Thus . If g is smooth, then by construction Eg restricts to g on 1 √ó T. Moreover, E is a bounded linear map since :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Eg\\\\_{(k)}^2 &= \\\\sum_{m,n} \\\\left \\\\widehat{Eg}(m,n) \\\\right ^2 \\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )  &\\\\le c_k^{-2} \\\\sum_{m,n} \\\\left  \\\\widehat{g}(n) \\\\right ^2 \\\\frac{\\\\left (1+n^2 \\\\right )^{2k-1}}{ \\\\left (1+m^2+n^2 \\\\right )^k}  &\\\\le c_k^{-2} C_k \\\\ g \\\\_{k-\\\\frac{1}{2}}^2. \\\\end{align} It follows that there is a trace map œÑ of Hk(Œ©) onto Hk ‚àí ¬Ω(‚àÇŒ©). Indeed, take a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary and a smooth function œà supported in the collar and equal to 1 near the boundary. Multiplication by œà carries functions into Hk of the collar, which can be identified with Hk of an annulus for which there is a trace map. The invariance under diffeomorphims (or coordinate change) of the half-integer Sobolev spaces on the circle follows from the fact that an equivalent norm on Hk + ¬Ω(T) is given by :\\\\f\\\\_{[k+\\\\frac{1}{2}]}^2 = \\\\f\\\\_{(k)}^2 + \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\left f^{(k)}(s)-f^{(k)}(t) \\\\right ^2}{\\\\left e^{is} -e^{it} \\\\right^2} \\\\,ds\\\\, dt. It is also a consequence of the properties of œÑ and E (the \\"trace theorem\\"). In fact any diffeomorphism f of T induces a diffeomorphism F of T2 by acting only on the second factor. Invariance of Hk(T2) under the induced map F* therefore implies invariance of Hk ‚àí ¬Ω(T) under f*, since f* = œÑ ‚àò F* ‚àò E. Further consequences of the trace theorem are the two exact sequences :(0) \\\\to H^1_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\to H^1(\\\\Omega) \\\\to H^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} (\\\\partial\\\\Omega) \\\\to (0) and :(0) \\\\to H^2_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\to H^2(\\\\Omega) \\\\to H^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} (\\\\partial\\\\Omega) \\\\oplus H^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}(\\\\partial\\\\Omega) \\\\to (0), where the last map takes f in H2(Œ©) to f‚àÇŒ© and ‚àÇnf‚àÇŒ©. There are generalizations of these sequences to Hk(Œ©) involving higher powers of the normal derivative in the trace map: :(0)\\\\to H^k_0(\\\\Omega) \\\\to H^k(\\\\Omega) \\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{j=1}^k H^{j-\\\\frac{1}{2}}(\\\\partial\\\\Omega) \\\\to (0). The trace map to takes f to Abstract formulation of boundary value problems The Sobolev space approach to the Neumann problem cannot be phrased quite as directly as that for the Dirichlet problem. The main reason is that for a function in , the normal derivative cannot be a priori defined at the level of Sobolev spaces. Instead an alternative formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian on a bounded region in the plane is used. It employs Dirichlet forms, sesqulinear bilinear forms on , or an intermediate closed subspace. Integration over the boundary is not involved in defining the Dirichlet form. Instead, if the Dirichlet form satisfies a certain positivity condition, termed coerciveness, solution can be shown to exist in a weak sense, so-called \\"weak solutions\\". A general regularity theorem than implies that the solutions of the boundary value problem must lie in , so that they are strong solutions and satisfy boundary conditions involving the restriction of a function and its normal derivative to the boundary. The Dirichlet problem can equally well be phrased in these terms, but because the trace map is already defined on , Dirichlet forms do not need to be mentioned explicitly and the operator formulation is more direct. A unified discussion is given in and briefly summarised below. It is explained how the Dirichlet problem, as discussed above, fits into this framework. Then a detailed treatment of the Neumann problem from this point of view is given following . The Hilbert space formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian on a bounded region in the plane proceeds from the following data: * A closed subspace . * A Dirichlet form for given by a bounded Hermitian bilinear form defined for such that for . * is coercive, i.e. there is a positive constant and a non-negative constant such that . A weak solution of the boundary value problem given initial data in is a function u satisfying : D(f,g)=(u,g) for all g. For both the Dirichlet and Neumann problem :D(f,g) = \\\\left (f_x, g_x \\\\right ) + \\\\left (f_y, g_y \\\\right ). For the Dirichlet problem . In this case :D(f,g) = (\\\\Delta f,g), \\\\qquad f, g \\\\in H. By the trace theorem the solution satisfies in . For the Neumann problem is taken to be . Application to Neumann problem The classical Neumann problem on consists in solving the boundary value problem :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\Delta u =f, & f, u \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\Omega^-), \\\\partial_n u =0 & \\\\text{on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega \\\\end{cases} Green's theorem implies that for :(\\\\Delta u,v)= (u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y) - (\\\\partial_n u,v)_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}. Thus if in and satisfies the Neumann boundary conditions, , and so is constant in . Hence the Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants. Consider the Hermitian form on defined by :\\\\displaystyle{D(f,g)=(u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y).} Since is in duality with , there is a unique element in such that :\\\\displaystyle{D(u,v) =(Lu,v).} The map is an isometry of onto , so in particular is bounded. In fact :((L+I)u,v)=(u,v)_{(1)}. So :\\\\(L+I)u\\\\_{(-1)} =\\\\sup_{\\\\v\\\\_{(1)}=1} ((L+I)u,v)= \\\\sup_{\\\\v\\\\_{(1)}=1} (u,v)_{(1)}=\\\\u\\\\_{(1)}. On the other hand, any in defines a bounded conjugate-linear form on sending to . By the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem, there exists such that :\\\\displaystyle{(f,v)=(u,v)_{(1)}.} Hence and so is surjective. Define a bounded linear operator on by :T=R_1(I+L)^{-1} R_0, where is the map , a compact operator, and is the map , its adjoint, so also compact. The operator has the following properties: * is a contraction since it is a composition of contractions * is compact, since and are compact by Rellich's theorem * is self-adjoint, since if , they can be written with so ::(Tf,g)=(u,(I+L)v)=(u,v)_{(1)}=((I+L)u,v)= (f,Tg). * has positive spectrum and kernel , for ::(Tf,f)=(u,u)_{(1)}\\\\ge 0, :and implies and hence . *There is a complete orthonormal basis of consisting of eigenfunctions of . Thus ::Tf_n=\\\\mu_nf_n :with and decreasing to . *The eigenfunctions all lie in since the image of lies in . *The are eigenfunctions of with ::\\\\displaystyle{Lf_n=\\\\lambda_nf_n, \\\\qquad \\\\lambda_n=\\\\mu_n^{-1} -1.} :Thus are non-negative and increase to . *The eigenvalue occurs with multiplicity one and corresponds to the constant function. For if satisfies , then ::(u_x,u_x) + (u_y,u_y) = (Lu,u) = 0, :so is constant. Regularity for Neumann problem =Weak solutions are strong solutions= The first main regularity result shows that a weak solution expressed in terms of the operator and the Dirichlet form is a strong solution in the classical sense, expressed in terms of the Laplacian and the Neumann boundary conditions. Thus if with , then , satisfies and . Moreover, for some constant independent of , :\\\\u\\\\_{(2)} \\\\le C\\\\\\\\Delta u\\\\_{(0)} + C \\\\u\\\\_{(1)}. Note that :\\\\u\\\\_{(1)} \\\\le \\\\L u\\\\_{(-1)} + \\\\u\\\\_{(0)}, since :\\\\begin{align} \\\\u\\\\_{(1)}^2 &=(L u, u) +\\\\u\\\\^2_{(0)}  &\\\\le \\\\L u\\\\_{(-1)} \\\\u\\\\_{(1)} + \\\\u\\\\_{(0)} \\\\u\\\\_{(1)}. \\\\end{align} Take a decomposition with supported in and supported in a collar of the boundary. The operator is characterized by :(Lf,g)= \\\\left (f_x, g_x \\\\right )+ \\\\left (f_y, g_y \\\\right )= (\\\\Delta f, g)_\\\\Omega - \\\\left (\\\\partial_n f, g \\\\right )_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}, \\\\qquad f,g \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\Omega^-). Then :([L,\\\\psi]f,g)=([\\\\Delta,\\\\psi]f,g), so that :\\\\displaystyle{[L,\\\\psi]=-[L,1-\\\\psi]=\\\\Delta\\\\psi +2\\\\psi_x\\\\partial_x + 2\\\\psi_y\\\\partial_y.} The function and are treated separately, being essentially subject to usual elliptic regularity considerations for interior points while requires special treatment near the boundary using difference quotients. Once the strong properties are established in terms of and the Neumann boundary conditions, the \\"bootstrap\\" regularity results can be proved exactly as for the Dirichlet problem. Interior estimates The function lies in where is a region with closure in . If and :(Lf,g) = (\\\\Delta f,g)_\\\\Omega. By continuity the same holds with replaced by and hence . So :\\\\Delta v= Lv=L(\\\\psi u) =\\\\psi Lu +[L,\\\\psi]u=\\\\psi(f-u) +[\\\\Delta,\\\\psi]u. Hence regarding as an element of , . Hence . Since for , we have . Moreover, :\\\\v\\\\_{(2)}^2 = \\\\\\\\Delta v\\\\^2 + 2\\\\v\\\\_{(1)}^2, so that :\\\\v\\\\_{(2)} \\\\le C \\\\left ( \\\\\\\\Delta(v)\\\\+ \\\\v\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right ). Boundary estimates The function is supported in a collar contained in a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary. The difference quotients can be formed for the flow and lie in , so the first inequality is applicable: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\delta_h w\\\\_{(1)} &\\\\le \\\\L \\\\delta_h w\\\\_{(-1)} + \\\\\\\\delta_h w\\\\_{(0)}  &\\\\le \\\\[L, \\\\delta_h] w\\\\_{(-1)} +\\\\\\\\delta_h Lw\\\\_{(-1)} + \\\\ \\\\delta_h w\\\\_{(0)}  &\\\\le\\\\[L, \\\\delta_h] w\\\\_{(-1)} +C\\\\Lw\\\\_{(0)} + C\\\\ w\\\\_{(1)}. \\\\end{align} The commutators are uniformly bounded as operators from to . This is equivalent to checking the inequality :\\\\left \\\\left( \\\\left [L,\\\\delta_h \\\\right] g,h\\\\right)\\\\right \\\\le A\\\\g\\\\_{(1)}\\\\h\\\\_{(1)}, for , smooth functions on a collar. This can be checked directly on an annulus, using invariance of Sobolev spaces under dffeomorphisms and the fact that for the annulus the commutator of with a differential operator is obtained by applying the difference operator to the coefficients after having applied to the function: :\\\\left [ \\\\delta^h, \\\\sum a_\\\\alpha \\\\partial^\\\\alpha \\\\right ] = \\\\left (\\\\delta^h(a_\\\\alpha)\\\\circ R_h \\\\right ) \\\\partial^\\\\alpha. Hence the difference quotients are uniformly bounded, and therefore with :\\\\Y w\\\\_{(1)} \\\\le C\\\\L w\\\\_{(0)} + C^\\\\prime \\\\w\\\\_{(1)}. Hence and satisfies a similar inequality to : :\\\\V w\\\\_{(1)} \\\\le C^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\left ( \\\\L w\\\\_{(0)} + \\\\w\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right ). Let be the orthogonal vector field. As for the Dirichlet problem, to show that , it suffices to show that . To check this, it is enough to show that . As before :\\\\begin{align} A &= \\\\Delta - V^2 - W^2 B &= [V,W] \\\\end{align} are vector fields. On the other hand, for , so that and define the same distribution on . Hence :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left (W^2w, \\\\varphi \\\\right ) &= \\\\left (L w - V^2w - Au,\\\\varphi \\\\right ), (VWw,\\\\varphi) &=(WVw + Bw,\\\\varphi). \\\\end{align} Since the terms on the right hand side are pairings with functions in , the regularity criterion shows that . Hence since both terms lie in and have the same inner products with 's. Moreover, the inequalities for show that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Ww\\\\_{(1)} & \\\\le C \\\\left (\\\\VWw\\\\_{(0)} + \\\\left \\\\W^2w \\\\right \\\\_{(0)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C \\\\left \\\\ \\\\left ( \\\\Delta - V^2 -A \\\\right )w \\\\right \\\\_{(0)} + C \\\\(WV+B)w\\\\_{(0)}  &\\\\le C_1 \\\\L w\\\\_{(0)} + C_1 \\\\w\\\\_{(1)}. \\\\end{align} Hence :\\\\begin{align} \\\\w\\\\_{(2)} &\\\\le C \\\\left ( \\\\V w\\\\_{(1)} + \\\\W w\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C^\\\\prime \\\\\\\\Delta w \\\\_{(0)} + C^\\\\prime \\\\ w \\\\_{(1)}. \\\\end{align} It follows that . Moreover, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\u\\\\_{(2)} &\\\\le C \\\\left ( \\\\\\\\Delta v\\\\ +\\\\\\\\Delta w\\\\ + \\\\v\\\\_{(1)} + \\\\w\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C^\\\\prime \\\\left ( \\\\\\\\psi\\\\Delta u\\\\ + \\\\(1-\\\\psi)\\\\Delta u\\\\ + 2\\\\[\\\\Delta, \\\\psi] u\\\\ +\\\\u\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right )  &\\\\le C^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} \\\\left (\\\\\\\\Delta u\\\\ + \\\\u\\\\_{(1)} \\\\right ). \\\\end{align} Neumann boundary conditions Since , Green's theorem is applicable by continuity. Thus for , :\\\\begin{align} (f,v) &= (Lu,v) + (u,v)  &= (u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y) +(u,v)  &= ((\\\\Delta+I)u,v) +(\\\\partial_{n} u,v)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}  &= (f,v) + (\\\\partial_{n} u,v)_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}. \\\\end{align} Hence the Neumann boundary conditions are satisfied: :\\\\partial_n u_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} = 0, where the left hand side is regarded as an element of and hence . =Regularity of strong solutions= The main result here states that if and , then and :\\\\u\\\\_{(k+2)} \\\\le C\\\\\\\\Delta u\\\\_{(k)} + C \\\\u\\\\_{(k+1)}, for some constant independent of . Like the corresponding result for the Dirichlet problem, this is proved by induction on . For , is also a weak solution of the Neumann problem so satisfies the estimate above for . The Neumann boundary condition can be written :Zu_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}=0. Since commutes with the vector field corresponding to the period flow , the inductive method of proof used for the Dirichlet problem works equally well in this case: for the difference quotients preserve the boundary condition when expressed in terms of . Smoothness of eigenfunctions It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the Neumann problem that the eigenfunctions of in lie in . Moreover, any solution of with in and in must have in . In both cases by the vanishing properties, the normal derivatives of the eigenfunctions and vanish on . Solving the associated Neumann problem The method above can be used to solve the associated Neumann boundary value problem: :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\Delta f_\\\\Omega = 0  \\\\partial_n f_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} = g & g \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}(\\\\partial \\\\Omega)\\\\end{cases} By Borel's lemma is the restriction of a function . Let be a smooth function such that near the boundary. Let be the solution of with . Then solves the boundary value problem.

Enugu was invaded after the Biafran retreat from the Mid-Western Region only 14 days earlier after the Nigerian 2nd and 3rd Marine Division cleared them of the area.  Background  In the late 1960s ethnic tensions rose dramatically in Nigeria. Many Igbo people of eastern Nigeria feared domination and discrimination from other ethnic groups. In September 1966 soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces inflicted a series of massacres against easterners residing in the northern portion of the country, triggering the flight of thousands more to the eastern city of Enugu. On 30 May 1967, Nigeria's Eastern Region declared that it was seceding from the country to become the independent state of Biafra. Enugu was made Biafra's capital, and the state was led by the former Eastern Region Military Governor, Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu. The Nigerian government planned to suppress the secession in a four-phase operation that would last one month. Their first major goal was to secure Enugu and Nsukka. On 6 July Nigerian federal troops launched their offensive to recapture Biafra, initiating the Nigerian Civil War. Federal officials initially declared that their forces would seize Enugu \\"in 48 hours\\", but the conflict soon developed into a stalemate, with heavy fighting taking place near Nsukka. At the start of the war, Enugu was home to almost 140,000 residents, mostly Christian Igbos. Once conflict broke out, they started leaving the city in search of refuge deeper in Biafran territory. Foreign nationals were advised by their own government to leave Biafra, and by late July only about 50‚Äîmost of them journalists, arms dealers, diplomats, and traders‚Äîremained in Enugu. Prelude Satellite image of Enugu and other communities neighbouring it. When Nsukka fell to the Nigerian 1st and 2nd Brigades Ojukwu knew that his capital would be the Nigerian's next target. After a failed invasion of Nsukka on July 30, 1967 resulted in the death of Major Kaduna Nzeogwu President Ojukwu began drawing up plans for an invasion of Nigeria's Mid-Western Region in an attempt to divert attention away from Enugu. The invasion of August 9 was a tremendous success for the Biafrans and was followed by a sort of 44-day stalemate, before it was broken by the Nigerian 2nd Division's invasion of Ore. Biafran soldiers retreated from the region on September 20, 1967 and fled back to their homeland, pursued by Nigerian soldiers. The commander of Nigerian troops stationed in Nsukka, General Mohammed Shuwa, was relieved of his command and replaced with Lt. Col. Theophilus Danjuma. The Biafran 53 Brigade under Colonel Alexander Madiebo, the newly appointed head of the Biafran Army, was tasked with defending Enugu, but the unit had been exhausted by previous engagements and was unable to call upon reinforcements. In an attempt to bolster the city's defence, Ojukwu ordered all able-bodied men mobilised in Biafra. Approximately 10,000 arrived in the capital. Aside from a handful of dane guns in their possession, the men were unarmed and the Biafran administration struggled to feed them. According to Madiebo, Ojukwu intended to equip them with machetes and move them through Eke from where they would swarm federal troops at Abor. Madiebo doubted the plan's feasibility. In contrast to the motley defenders of Biafra's capital, the unit tasked with attacking Enugu, the 1st Division, was the most experienced force in the Nigerian Army. It included large numbers of World War II veterans. Nigerian offensive Due to a flank attack by Biafran units at Ebe, the Nigerian 22nd battalion found itself pursuing retreating Biafran soldiers to Abor, which was already occupied by the Nigerian 5th battalion and almost led to a \\"friendly fire\\" incident. The sector commander altered the original plan and ordered both battalions to advance on Nine Mile corner using Abor as launchpad. It was no longer necessary for the 22nd battalion to jump from Eke and arrangements were made for Eke to be shelled by artillery from Abor. As Nigerian soldiers advanced down the Nine Mile there was a stampede of Biafran vehicles that struggled to get away from the impending federal forces. There was a three-day delay by federal forces at Abor in order to reorganize. Sector commander Lt. Col. Theophilus Danjuma sent a wireless message to Nigerian President Yakubu Gowon that stated he had begun shelling Enugu from Ukena. The message was intercepted by Biafran units who began shelling Danjuma's position a few minutes later, narrowly escaping death. On 3 October, the Biafrans began evacuating the city. On 4 October, the Nigerian 1st Division occupied Enugu. Ojukwu was asleep in the Biafran State House when the federal troops attacked, and awoke at the sound of gunfire and mortar explosions to find the building deserted of his guards and aides and surrounded by the federal forces. Disguising himself as a servant, he was able to walk past the cordon without incident and escape. Aftermath = Situation in Enugu = Danjuma described the fall of Enugu as \\"an anticlimax\\". His troops garrisoned the city in the immediate aftermath of the battle, while Ukpabi Asika, an Igbo professor at Ibadan University, was appointed to lead the civil administration in the locale and surrounding areas held by federal forces. After its capture, buildings in Enugu were ransacked by looters and federal troops, including the Presidential Hotel and the United States Consulate. The vast majority of the population fled, and only approximately 500 civilians remained, most too ill, old, or young to leave. Nigerian federal officials unsuccessfully appealed for residents to return to the area. Over a year after the battle, the city remained mostly deserted, and of the few hundred civilians in Enugu most were being sheltered and cared for by Catholic missions. The International Red Cross established a station in the locale, and used it to direct the distribution of relief supplies to the surrounding area. As late as 1978, signs of damage from the battle remained in the city. = Course of the war = Many Nigerians hoped that Enugu's capture would convince the Igbo's traditional elite to end their support for secession, even if Ojukwu did not follow them. This did not occur. Ojukwu relocated his government without difficulty to Umuahia, a city positioned deep within traditional Igbo territory. The Biafrans constructed an underground bunker there to serve as the new government headquarters. The fall of Enugu contributed to a brief destabilisation of Biafran propaganda efforts, as the forced relocation of personnel left the Ministry of Information disorganised and the federal force's success undermined previous Biafran assertions that the Nigerian state could not withstand a protracted war. On 23 October the Biafran official radio declared in a broadcast that Ojukwu promised to continue resisting the federal government, and that he attributed the loss of Enugu to subversive actions. The federal forces pressed on with their offensive throughout the month, securing Asaba and Calabar, further encircling Biafra. Umuahia was not taken by Nigerian government troops until 22 April 1969.

History Since ancient times, the notion that weather can somehow foreshadow coming seismic activity has been the topic of much discussion and debate. Geologist Russell Robinson has described \\"earthquake weather\\" as one of the most common pseudoscientific methods of predicting earthquakes. Aristotle proposed in the 4th century BC that earthquakes were caused by winds trapped in caves. Small tremors were thought to have been caused by air pushing on the cavern roofs, and large ones by the air breaking the surface. This theory led to a belief in 'earthquake weather', that because a large amount of air was trapped underground, the weather would be hot and calm before an earthquake. A later theory stated that earthquakes occurred in calm, cloudy conditions, and were usually preceded by strong winds, fireballs, and meteors. A modern theory proposes that certain cloud formations may be used to predict earthquakes; however, this idea is rejected by most geologists.Curious cloud formations linked to quakes New Scientist, 11 April 2008. Accessed 2009-02-25. Background on earthquakes An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they can get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge of a tectonic plate overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that is felt. For example, in California, there are two plates, the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The Pacific Plate consists of most of the Pacific Ocean floor, and also includes Baja California and the California coastline. The North American Plate comprises most of the North American continent, including the inland parts of California, as well as parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans' floors. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is more than 800 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other smaller faults like the Hayward (San Francisco Bay Area) and the San Jacinto (Southern California) join with the San Andreas to form the San Andreas Fault Zone. The Pacific Plate grinds northwestward past the North American Plate at a rate of about two inches per year. Psychology It has been proposed by W. J. Humphreys that earthquake weather is not of geological causes, but merely a psychological manifestation. Humphreys argued that \\"the general state of irritation and sensitiveness developed in us during the hot, calm, perhaps sultry weather given this name, inclines us to sharper observation of earthquake disturbances and accentuates the impression they make on our senses, so that we retain more vivid memories of such quakes while possibly over-looking entirely the occurrences on other more soothing days\\". Scientific validity Some recent research has found a correlation between a sudden relative spike in atmospheric temperature 2‚Äì5 days before an earthquake. It is speculated that this rise is caused by the movement of ions within the earth's crust, related to an oncoming earthquake. However, the atmospheric changes are caused by the earthquake, rather than the earthquake being caused by any change in atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, this relative temperature change would not cause any single recognizable weather pattern that could be labelled \\"earthquake weather\\". At the 2011 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, Shimon Wdowinski announced an apparent temporal connection between tropical cyclones and earthquakes. In April 2013, a team of seismologists at the Georgia Institute of Technology re-examined data from the 2011 Virginia earthquake using pattern-recognition software and found a correlation between Hurricane Irene's nearby passage and an unexpected rise in the number of aftershocks.

The violin Blackbird. Blue Lady, sculpture in blue glass  Education  He studied Archaeology and Art History at Uppsala University, Sweden. Later, he studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts in Oslo (1982‚Äì85) focusing on the three dimensional work. He chose Oslo due to a desire to work with figurative sculptures.  Work  Lars Widenfalk has been involved in several projects in the three-dimensional expression, often in collaboration with his wife Alena Matejka. She is educated in the Czech Bohemian glass tradition. It was she who introduced him to the crystal glass, a material he often uses in combination with stone. His imagery is figurative. His early works were often realistic and figurative. But this has changed to sculptures with symbolic and soulish expression. Many of his works center around the theme of place and people. For example his work on the room or the house, is usually open with simple geometric shapes. Marked only by four corner columns and a roof. Usually a full-length human or a human head is located in the house. He has also built several large aquariums, where he puts his sculptures along with living fish. In water the stone's color becomes much more intense. One of his major works are the black violin, Blackbird, made from stone after drawings by Antonio Stradivari (Stradivarius), but with some technical adjustments in order to play. The violin is made of diabase (dolerite), a rock that was left over from his grandfather's tombstone. At its thinnest the stone is just 2.5 mm thick. The thin walls of the resonance box was contour cut with water and then machined with hand tools. It took two years to make the violin.Kalsi, Jyoti. As a work of art it is unique. Gulf News.

The Mosque occupies a unique and cultural significance in Pakistan. The economic policies proposed under the banner of \\"Islamisation\\" in Pakistan include executive decrees on ZakƒÅt (poor- due), Ushr (tithe), judicial changes that helped to halt land redistribution to the poor, and perhaps most importantly, elimination of riba (defined by activists as interest charged on loans and securities). Perhaps the foremost exponent of Islamisation among Pakistan's rulers‚ÄîGeneral Muhammad Zia-ul- Haq‚Äîadvanced a programme in 1978 to bring (according to Zia and his supporters) Pakistan law in line with the principles of Sharia law. Conceived in late 1977 and carried out during his reign, the programme came in response to an upsurge in Islamic activism, and the problems and controversies associated with the policies of Zia's predecessor, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Zia's stated intention was to \\"eradicate the scourge of interest\\" on loans and securities, and create an \\"interest-free economy\\". On January 1, 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks, making Pakistan the first country in the Muslim world with Islamic banking. However, in spite of the public support allegedly demonstrated for it (and other Islamisation policies) by the 1984 Islamisation referendum and the programme's initial gains and success, it failed to achieve international targets and to meet commercial interactions with other major international banks. Islamic activists were also displeased that Zia's ordinances and proclamations did not ban interest paying accounts. Zia's successors were not as active in their pursuit of Islamisation. While conservative Prime minister Nawaz Sharif publicly supported Islamisation, his economic policies focused on privatization and economic liberalization.See: Privatization in Pakistan and Economic liberalisation in Pakistan Many Pakistani economists and business people worry that attempting to impose an Islamic economy on Pakistan would have \\"devastating economic, political, and social consequences for the country\\", though others (such as governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Husain), have termed fears of Islamlisation \\"absurd\\" and based on Western stereotypes. Islamisation has continued through the efforts of the Islamic courts Zia created, including activists on the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, although it was given a setback when the government of Pervez Musharraf came to power and pressured a number of activist judges to retire. History and background As a state created specifically for Muslims, Pakistan has long had Islamic activists advocating for more thorough Islamisation of that country, and specifically for the elimination of riba (defined as interest on loans). But the country has also had Islamic modernists and secularists in positions of influence and \\"generations of Muslim usage and custom supported by the fatwa of respected ulema that held low rates of interest to be acceptable, non-usurious, and not riba\\", according to economist Feisal Khan.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.79 Even Allama Iqbal \\"the Thinker of Pakistan\\" (Mufakkir-e-Pakistan) \\"cited approvingly\\" the fact that Muslim princely states in India did not restrict modern banking or \\"attempt to impose some sort of \`Islamic\` concept of interest-free financial transactions.\\"Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.80 Consequently enthusiasm for Islamisation has waxed and waned throughout Pakistan's history. It has been strong when \\"religious elements are in ascendancy\\", such as during partition, the 1977 Nizam-e-Mustafa movement, and during the rise in fundamentalist after 2000. At other times \\"only lip service\\" is paid to the issue.Asi, Anwar, \\"Towards Islamic banking system\\", 2002 (dead link) Maududi and other Islamist hoped to make Pakistan \\"a new Medina\\" which would become \\"the leader of the Islamic world in the twentieth century, a laboratory where experiments in Islamic modernity would be successfully conducted en route' to ushering a new Islamic renaissance\\" Ashraf Qureishi and Abul A'la Maududi, two of the pioneer theoreticians of Islamic banking, who preached that interest was riba, forbidden to Muslim, and \\"laid the foundations of current\\" Islamic Banking and Finance in the 1940, were from South Asia. (Maududi moved to Pakistan where he became an influential Islamist leader.)Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.2, 60-64 According to Feisal Khan, \\"South Asians in general and Pakistanis in particular are \`over- represented\`\\" among Islamic Banking \\"theorist and practitioners,\\" and Pakistanis are \\"found in Islamic banks and financial firms throughout the [Persian] Gulf at all levels, from tellers to the boardroom.\\"Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.2 Article 28 of Pakistan's 1956 Constitution called for the elimination of riba \\"as early as possible\\". The 1962 Constitution provided in the principles of policy that \\"usury\\" should be abolished. Similar provisions were found in the 1973 Constitution. In 1969 the state-sponsored advisory body known as the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), declared that Pakistan's banking system was \\"fundamentally based upon riba\\", and unanimously called for its elimination. The mid and late 1970s were a time of Islamic revivalism throughout parts of the Muslim world, including Pakistan. Zia's predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced economic problems of stagflation and opposition to his programme of nationalization and land reform. In 1976 and 1977, vigorous opposition to Bhutto's policies united under the revivalist banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa (\\"Rule of the prophet\\") and preached that establishing an Islamic state based on sharia law would bring a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled Muslims. In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamization, Bhutto also called for Islamisation and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing. Confrontation between Bhutto's PPP and the opposition Pakistan National Alliance, street protests, loss of life and property, all preceded the military overthrow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by Zia in 1977. On coming to power, Zia committing himself to enforcing Nizam-e-Mustafa, a significant turn from Pakistan's predominantly secular law, inherited from the British. Less than two years after the coup, Pakistan's Shia neighbor, Iran, saw a very unexpected Islamic revolution overthrow its well-financed pro-Western, secular monarchy. The new self-proclaimed revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran believed in the necessity of Islamic sharia law for Islam to survive and prosper, and in the need to spread this doctrine to other Muslim states. While part of the Islamic revival, the revolution created a new conflict in the Islamic world by pitting revolutionary Shia Iran against its doctrinal and geopolitical rival the conservative Wahhabi Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for leadership of the Islamic world. As poor, predominantly Sunni country, Pakistan has been closely tied to the petroleum-exporting Saudi Arabia which has employed many Pakistani guest workers. This competition for influence affected many things in Muslim countries, including economic policies. =Timeline of riba and banking= *1956 - first constitution of Pakistan states that the state was to \\"eliminate riba as early as possible\\" (article 29(f)), but does not define riba.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.40 *1969 - the Council on Islamic Ideology recommends that riba be abolished and the banking system be overhauled, recommendation is ignored by the government. *1971 - the Council on Islamic Ideology recommends that riba be abolished and the banking system be overhauled, recommendation is also ignored by the government. *1979, July - interest is eliminated from three financial institutions by order of General Zia. Effective 1 July 1979, General Zia declared that the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit-loss sharing (PLS). *1980, detailed Report on the Elimination of Interest from the Economy 1980, is issued by the Central Institute of Islamic Research at the request of ruling General Zia-ul-Haq. Calls for a complete elimination of interest in Pakistan's economy over a five year period.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.78 *1991, November - \\"monumental decision\\" by Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan overturning 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam, forbids riba absolutely without exceptions.

Pleading that implementation of the judgment would \\"create enormous problems\\" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's \\"official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world\\", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench. *2002, May 24 - SAB is reconstituted by new President General Pervez Musharraf.

State Bank of Pakistan declares that banks and \\"windows\\" made \\"Islamic\\" as part of General Zia's 1979 Islamisation are not truly Islamic, but conventional. No new conventional banks are to be allowed in Paksitan.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.96 Banks (such as Meezan Bank and Al Baraka Bank) are converted into \\"full-fledged\\" Islamic commercial banks,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.127-134 following global Shariah-compliance standardsKhan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.159 with Shariah Boards,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.97 but also following conventional global banking norms such as the Basel Accords. Policies and difficulties Despite its success in initial first five years, the programme was fractured in many obvious reasons, and the stagflation again began to bite the country's resources, as well as many technical and scientific problems arise in the new economic system that the military government and Zia-ul-Haq himself was unable to solve. The newly elected, but technocratic government of Prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo refused to pass the new and more stricter version of Sharia bill. Zia abruptly dismissed the government on May 29, 1988, and the dissolved parliament the next day, alleging a slow pace of Islamization, corruption, deterioration of law and order, and mismanagement of the economy. =Banning Riba, building Islamic banking= General Zia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit and loss sharing finance (PLS). On January 1, 1980, he appeared on national television and announced the introduction of a \\"Profit and Loss Sharing System\\", according to which account holders were to share the losses and profits of the bank. In 1980 the Council of Islamic Ideology issued a report with \\"detailed and far reaching reforms\\" to eliminate interest. The military government employed Islamic scholars and economists led by professor Khurshid Ahmad to compile laws about Islamic financing. Zia's government responded to the council's report by replacing interest-bearing savings accounts with PLS instruments in Pakistan's five state banks. The government also introduced and encouraged such banks to adopt financing schemes based upon the principles of mudaraba and or musharaka. *Murabaha is a practice in which the \\"lender\\" (usually a bank) purchases, in its own name, goods that the borrower (usually an importer or trader) wants, and then sells the goods to him at an agreed mark-up. The technique is used for financing trade, but because the bank takes title to the goods, and is therefore engaged in buying and selling, its profit derives from a real service and entails a degree, albeit minimal, of risk. *Musharaka is a practice in which the \\"lender\\" (usually a bank) enters into a partnership with the borrower/client in which both share the equity capital‚Äîand perhaps even management‚Äîof a project or deal, and both share in the profits or losses according to their equity shareholding. However these Islamisation policies did not include a ban on interest-paying accounts and \\"in most instances\\" Pakistani banks continued to offer accounts with fixed interest rates.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.128-9 For example, for term deposits, the banks substituted the phrases 'rate of interest' with 'expected rate of profit' and \\"kept the entire regime of interest-based deposits intact.\\"Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.297 While the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) ‚Äî established by General Zia to, among other things, examine existing laws and strike down those that did not comply with Shari'a law ‚Äîwould have been the way to put a stop to such interest-paying accounts, Zia had created an article in the constitution (203B) which specifically removed from the FSC's jurisdiction \\"fiscal law or any law relating to the levy and collection of taxes and fees or banking or insurance practice and procedure\\", until government deemed it appropriate to withdraw the ban. Furthermore, after the death of general Zia-ul-Haq, this programme was neglected by his long-time opponent Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, while Zia ally Nawaz Sharif launched a twin intensified programme, Privatization programme and the economic liberalisation to promote the GDP growth rate as well as reverting the economy back to Westernized economic system. To surmount this obstacle, Islamic activists worked to #educate or convince the public that an interest-free economy was both viable and religiously necessary #pass a bill to make the shariat \\"superordinate\\" to the constitution #encourage superior courts to expand their definitions of jurisdiction of shariat to constitutional questionsKennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.129-30 ;Education Muslims agree that the Quran condemns Riba, but do not all agree over what riba is.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.130-1 While Muslim activists (and most Pakistanis) agree that riba is interest on debt, others believe that riba is usury (unethical loans that unfairly enrich the lender) and not interest charged under state-regulated banking practices. Such people were to be found disproportionately among \\"the economists, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats\\" who \\"would be responsible to administer an interest free system\\".Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.131 To convince these people and others, Jamat-e-Islami and like-minded groups have sponsored, and Saudi Arabia has financed, numerous symposia \\"dedicated to the task of defining the modalities of an interest-free economy.\\" A \\"vibrant\\" and abundant literature has emanated from these conferences, but many mainstream economists have remained unpersuaded. Activists also had no luck getting a law enacted to make the constitution subordinate to shariat, but had more luck in the courts. ;Superior Courts While Zia had blocked the shariah courts ability to ban interest with Article 203B, he had also added Article 2A (also known as the Objectives Resolution) to the constitution, which included the statement that Muslims' lives should be ordered \\"in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.\\" One superior court judgein the Sindh High Court at the time known as a particularly \\"skillful\\" Islamic activist and judicial activist -- Tanzil-ur-Rahman‚Äîargued that Article 2A required shariat law be enforced and was a \\"supra-Constitutional\\" grund norm of law in Pakistan,Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.95 which meant that it gave superior courts jurisdiction to overrule parts of laws otherwise protected by the constitution if they are in violation of article 2-A, unless that court was specifically excluded.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.132-3 (Article 203B specifically excluded the FSC from examining fiscal laws for repugnancy to Islam, but not the high courts.) Several decisions handed down in the late 1980s and early 1990s supported Tanzil-ur-Rahman's interpretation,Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.99-100 but most high court justices did not subscribe to his application of the Objectives Resolution, nor to a ban on interest, and Tanzil-ur-Rehman retired from the bench in 1990. ;Faisal Case However, in 1990, the Benazir Bhutto government was dismissed by the president and Tanzil- ur-Rehman was brought out of retirement and appointed chief justice of the FSC. In November 1991 in a \\"monumental decision\\" he overturned 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam.Case: Mahmood-ur-Rehman Faisal vs. Secretary, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary AffairsKennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.134-7 The decision forbade riba absolutely without exceptions, defined it as \\"any addition, however slight, over and above the principal\\", including any system of markup, any indexing for inflation, payment by value rather than kind. It forbid riba in \\"production loans\\" as well as \\"consumptive\\" loans. It specifically declared invalid two Islamic Modernist interpretations that avoided strict prohibition: considering anti-riba Quranic verses (2:275-8) allegorical, and use of ijtihad (independent reasoning) of the issue based on finding the public good (maslaha).Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.135-6 The government was publicly committed to Islamisation, but also pursuing a liberalization of Pakistan's economy and had a semi-autonomous state bank file an appeal. After much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld in 1999 by the Shariah Appellate Bench in the Aslam Khaki decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy. Pleading that implementation of the judgment would \\"create enormous problems\\" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's \\"official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world\\", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench. By this time, however, Pervez Musharraf had staged a coup and come to power and limited the power of the courts. He required judges to take a \\"fresh oath of office\\" in which they would undertake to uphold the \\"Provisional Constitution Order\\" established by the coup, which required judges to not \\"make any order against the Chief Executive or any other person exercising powers or jurisdiction under his authority.\\" Two justices of the Shariah Appellate Bench resigned rather than take the oath, a new appeal with new judges found many \\"errors\\" in the Aslam Khaki case and overturned the ruling of a couple months earlier. Kennedy, Pakistan's Superior Courts and the Prohibition of Riba, 2006: p.111-113 ;Aftermath In Pakistan's financial sector, as of 2006, a system of Islamic banking has been adopted that operates in parallel with the conventional banking system. Pakistanis can choose between the two modes of financing. Most informed Pakistanis, however, insist that there is \\"no concerted move\\" to do away altogether with the conventional banking system, or to replace existing linkages and relationships with international financial markets.Hathaway, Islamization and the Pakistani Economy, 2006: p.2 As of March 2014, the new \\"rebooted\\" Islamic banking sector made up 9.4% of Pakistan's banking assets,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.130 but like the old Islamic banking sector is still overwhelmingly based on markup, not profit and loss sharing.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.131 As of 2015 the Faisal case decision that banned all interest on bank loans but was sent back to Federal Shariat Court (FSC) for \\"definitive finding on all the issues ...\\" in 2002 remains unheard in the Federal Shariat Court.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.162 Islamic activists (such as M. Akram Khan), maintained that Islamic banking and economics had \\"effectively failed\\"Khan, M. Akram, \\"Islamic Banking in Pakistan: The Future Path\\", All Pakistan Islamic Education Congress, Lahore, 1992. because of lack of \\"political will\\", ignorance of Islamic banking's \\"potential\\", the \\"inexperience\\" of the banking sector, failure to interest the public,Khan, M. Fahim, \\"Islamic Banking as Practiced now in the World\\" in Ahmad Ziauddin et al(ed.), Money and Banking in Islam, Institute of Policy Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan, 1983. etc. ;Studies of industry and customers Critic and economist Feisal Khan has noted that the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has been supply driven rather than demand driven (mandated by General Zia-ul-Haq, court rulings, and the State Bank of Pakistan, rather than by customer interest or popular movements).Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.151 In series of interviews conducted in 2008 and 2010 with Pakistani banking professionals (banker in conventional and Islamic, Shariah banking advisors, finance-using businessmen, and management consultants), Khan noted many Islamic bankers expressed \\"cynicism\\" over the different or lack thereof between conventional and Islamic bank products,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.138, 142 the lack of requirements for external Shariah-compliance audits of Islamic banks in Pakistan,Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.144 shariah boards lack of knowledge of un-shariah compliant practices in their banks or power to stop these practices.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.138-9 However this did not deter patronage by the pious (one of whom explained that if his Islamic bank was not truly shariah compliant, 'The sin is on their head now, not on mine! What I could do, I've done.') Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.146 One estimate of banking customer preference (given by a Pakistani banker) was that out of the entire Pakistani banking sector, was that about 10% of customers were \\"strictly conventional banking clients\\", 20% were strictly Shariah-compliant banking clients, and 70% would prefer Shariah- compliant banking but would use conventional banking if \\"there was a significant pricing difference\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.138 A survey of Islamic and conventional banking customers found (unsurprisingly) Islamic banking customers were more observant (having attended hajj, observing salat, growing a beard, etc.), but also had higher savings account balances than conventional bank customers, were older, better educated, had traveled more overseas, and tended to have a second account at a conventional bank. Another study, using \\"official data\\" reported to State Bank of Pakistan, found that for lenders who had taken out both Islamic (Murabaha) financing and conventional loans, the default rate was more than twice as high on the conventional loans. Borrowers were \\"less likely to default during Ramadan and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion ‚Äì either through individual piousness or network effects ‚Äì may play a role in determining loan default.\\"Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.149-50 ;Criticism Other economists had different and more critical explanations and observations. In 2000, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Hussain contended that \\"Pakistan is far removed from the day when it will be ready to adopt a full-fledged Islamic economic system. ... Most of the assumptions and premises on which the (scientific) hypotheses about the Islamic economic system have been constructed are serious flawed... \\"Hathaway, Islamization and the Pakistani Economy, 2006: p.4 A report by the IMF noted that the government has been unable to formulate non- interest based instruments for financing budget deficits, \\"thus the government, which is the major exponent of the implementation of the Islamic system, is forced to raise funds through borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return\\". Another critic of \\"Islamization\\" of the economy, Feisal Khan, argues that one reason for the failure of the equity investment proposed by Islamic finance proponents to catch on is the \\"long established consensus\\" that debt finance is superior to equity investment because accurately determining the credit-worthiness of the borrower/investee is both time consuming and expensive, and much more crucial for equity investors than debt lenders. The quality and quantity of such information is particularly problematic when tax evasion is high and the underground economy large. This is very much the case in Pakistan where the 2005 incidence of tax evasion was between 5.7 and 6.5% of GDP, and the size of the unofficial/underground economy as between 54.6 and 62.8 percent of GDP, \\"among the world's highest\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015, p.99 (The average size of the informal economy is about 30% in Asia.) Economist Izzud-Din Pal argues that \\"Islamising\\" the economy in Pakistan cannot be seen apart from the wider attempt of regimes and political elites with low levels of legitimacy and popularity to use religion to win public support. Unfortunately, according to another author Yoginder Sikand, \\"rather than focusing on the Islamic imperatives of equality and social justice, which are so central to the Qur‚Äôanic text, successive regimes in Pakistan have sought to focus on particular economic injunctions of the Qur‚Äôan abstracted from wider issues of justice and equality\\". Because the debate on \\"Islamising\\" Pakistan's national economy has been reduced to issues related to interest-free banking, the abolition of riba (interest), the laws of inheritance and the levy of the \\"zakƒÅt\\", Sikand believes all that is being offered are \\"magical solutions\\" to the complex modern problems of Pakistan's economy. Feisal Khan also argues that instituting a strictly Islamic banking system of mudaraba and musharaka, as called for by the 1999 Aslam Khaki decision of the Shariah Appellate Bench could lead to financial catastrophe. If murabaha and other fixed income instruments were banned and replaced by the more \\"authentic\\" profit and loss sharing, banks could only finance enterprise by taking \\"a direct equity state\\" as called for in mudaraba and musharaka. Credit would contract and central banks would be unable to prevent a liquidity crisis by buying bonds, commercial paper, etc. to expand credit.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: pp.160-61 =Land reform and Islamisation= Land ownership is concentrated in Pakistan ‚Äî as of 2015 a reported one-half of rural households in Pakistan are landless, while 5% of the country's population owns almost two-thirds of its farmland. Some reformers believe concentrated land ownership plays a part in \\"maintaining poverty and food insecurity\\" in Pakistan, and several attempts have been made to redistribute land to peasants and landless (laws created in 1959, 1972 and 1977). However, most provisions of these laws have been overruled as un-Islamic by Pakistan courts. The first attempts at land reform in Pakistan occurred under Ayub Khan's government in 1959, were successfully opposed by the landed elite who mobilized the Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami to defend the \\"sanctity of private property in Islam\\". In 1971 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan People's Party came to power, land reforms were \\"at the center\\" of that government's plans to transform Pakistan in to a \\"democratic Islamic socialist\\" state. The regime issued two land reform laws. A 1972 law (Martial Law Regulation - MLR 115, \\"promlogated\\" by the prime minister rather than passed by the National Assembly) was designed to place ceilings on the agricultural holding of Pakistan's large landlords (usually 150 acres but 300 acres if the land was unirrigated; exceptions were granted for tractors or installed tubewellsKennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.122). Land was to be seized by the state without compensation and distributed to the landless.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.109 Another provision of the law gave \\"first right of pre-emption\\" (right of first refusal to buy the land) to the existing tenants. In 1977, a bill was passed by the National Assembly, reducing the ceiling still further to 100 acres‚Äîalthough this act provided for compensation to landlords. The implementation of land reforms was criticized for the modest amount of land seized and redistributed to the peasants, less-than-equitable administration‚Äîimplementation was much more robust in the NWFP and Balochistan, where opposition to Bhutto was centered‚Äîand for being inherently \\"un-Islamic\\".Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.110 Many of Pakistan's large landlords mobilized against the reforms which they saw as \\"a direct challenged to their long-standing interest in maintaining political control in Pakistan's rural areas\\". ;Undoing After Ali Bhutto was overthrown, landlords who had lost as a result of land reform appealed to \\"Islamic Courts\\" (i.e. the Shariah Appellate Bench and Federal Shariat Court), established by Bhutto's successor General Zia-ul-Haq, and these, rather than the executive or legislature of Pakistan, undid much of Ali Bhutto's reform program. According to scholar Charles H. Kennedy, the courts effectively \\"suspended implementation\\" of the land reforms, \\"repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings\\". \\"In early 1979, the \\"Shariat Bench\\" of the Peshawar High Court\\" found the section of the 1972 law granting tenants the right to buy land they worked before other offers (\\"right to preemption\\") was \\"repugnant to Islam\\" and thus void. The petitioners against the law had successfully argued that \\"nowhere in the Holy Quran or Sunnah\\" was there mention of a tenant's right to preemption.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.111 The right to preemption according to the a hadith (the recorded reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that make up much of the Sunnah) according to the petitioners and judges of the Shariat Bench went instead to the #shafi sharik (in Shariat law, \\"cosharers\\" or co-owners of the land)Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.114 #shafi khalit, (\\"participants in immunities and appendages\\", i.e. those sharing special right on the property such as right of passage, right of irrigation, etc.,); # shafi jar, (contiguous owners, those \\"owning an immovable property adjacent to the immovable property sold\\"). This decision was reaffirmed by the Federal Shariat Court in 1981in Hafiz Muhammad Ameen vs Islamic Republic of Pakistan PLD 1981, FSC 23.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.112 (although the court acknowledged that \\"Islam recognized the validity of state imposed limits on wealth for the purpose of alleviating poverty or providing for the public good\\", which was a goal of the land reform laws), and upheld by the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court in 1986 in a 3 to 2 decision. This decision was \\"clarified and reclarified\\" in subsequent decisions,Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.117 (but confusion over what land transfers were valid or not under the \\"old law\\" remained since legal proceedings with \\"final decree\\" prior to the August 1986 ruling remained valid). In August 1989 the Shariat Appellate Bench struck down several more measures of the 1972 land reform law.Case: Qazalbash Waqf and Others vs. Chief Land Commissioner It ruled unanimously that provisions that allowed the confiscation of land without compensation were un-Islamic. On other measures it divided 3 to 2. It ruled that Waqf (an Islamic religious endowment, typically a donated plot of land or building) land was exempt from any provision of land reform laws; that the ceilings on amount of land owned were an undue restriction on property rights,Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.119 on the grounds that \\"Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be.\\" Dissenting justices argued that under Islam the rights of property holder must be balanced against the needs of the community.Kennedy, Islamization of Laws and Economy, 1996: p.120 (The repudiation of a major feature of Ali Bhutto's domestic policies during the regime of his daughter underscoring judicial independence (i.e. power), and the weakness of the elected government.) According to barrister writing in dawn.com, \\"The net result of the Qazalbash Waqf v Chief Land Commissioner (the 1989 Shariat Appellate Bench decision) is that land reforms in Pakistan are now at the same level as they were in 1947, as the 1972 regulations and the 1977 act have seen their main provisions being struck down and the 1959 regulations have been repealed.\\" =Other issues= Other ordinances dealing with Islamic finance included the ZakƒÅt and Ushr Ordinances issued on 20 June 1980, to Islamize taxation. The new system expelled the secular and international financial institutions and consisted only Islamic organizations, associations and institutions. The ZakƒÅt was to be deducted from bank accounts of Muslims at the rate of 2.5% annually above the balance of Rs. 3,000. The Ushr was levied on the yield of agricultural land in cash or kind at the rate of 10% of the agricultural yield, annually. Authorized by General Zia-ul-Haq, the government appointed Central, Provincial, District and Tehsil Zakat Councils to distribute Zakat funds to the needy, poor, orphans and widows. The Shia Muslims were exempted from Zakat deduction from their accounts due to their own religious beliefs. According to critics (Arskal Salim) the program has not been a great success: > \\"Since it was introduced through the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance No. 17 of 1980 > ... the real lives and economic conditions of millions of Pakistani citizens > have been completely unchanged, but a great number of socioreligious and > political problems have arisen from state involvement in zakat > administration.\\" Another economist (Parvez Hasan) writing in 2004 states zakat collections were insufficient to help the poor as it makes up only \\"0.17 percent of GDP ... Rs. 5-6 billion\\". The present level of grants \\"would add only 5-6 percent\\" to the income of the 1.2 million of the poorest Pakistani households even if every rupee of zakat collected went directly to these poor.

It is also known as Rahe Neer & City of Mosques. History There are some historic indications that Rander was an important port of Western Hind in the ancient era that conducted trade with the Arabian heartlands, Egypt, Sudan and beyond. During the rule of Shanprat in AD 200, Jain, an important trading community in India worked here and built their temples in and around Rander. It is believed that the Jain settlement dates back to earlier than 1200 AD when Rander was a small prosperous village that formed the hinterland of Suvali. Suvali was a thriving port town back then that had connections with the Middle East owing to the trade of crockery, silver articles, wooden artefacts and furniture. Also, Rander became a principal commercial centre, which had trading connections with many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Burma. Also, ships laden with spices, silk, benzoin and porcelain from as far as Sumatra and China docked in Rander. The earliest recorded mention of Rander was in the year 1050 in the book \\"Kitab al Hind\\" by Al Biruni. Nawayath Arabs, who settled in the area by 1225, were the main traders. It was in 1225 A.D. that the Arabs came from Kufa, overpowering the existing Jain population whose traces can be observed in the old temples such as Manibhadra temple, Kanch nu Derasar (Mirror hall temple). Shaikh Randeri (a.k.a. Shaikh Raneri) was famous for spreading the Islamic faith to Indonesia. Nuruddin ibn Ali ar-Raniri () (also transliterated Nur ud-Din ar-Raniri / Randeri, died 1658) of Yemeni lineage was an Islamic mystic and scholar from Rander in Surat province of Gujarat, in India, who worked for several years in the court of the sultan of Aceh in what is now Indonesia. He was the most prolific of the authors of the Acehnese court, and helped contribute to its international reputation as a center of scholarship. His work was considered the oldest Muslim scholarship of South east Asia.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258506236_KITAB_AL- SIRAT_AL-MUSTAQIM_OLEH_SHAYKH_NUR_AL-DIN_AL-RANIRI_SATU_SOROTAN By the late medieval period it had become an important port in western India, though smaller than ports such as Broach in Gujarat. In 1514, the Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa wrote: Ranel (Rander) is a good town of the Moors, built of very pretty houses and squares. It is a rich and agreeable place ...... the Moors of the town trade with Malacca, Bengal, Tawasery (Tannasserim), Pegu, Martaban, and Sumatra in all sort of spices, drugs, silks, musk, benzoin and porcelain. They possess very large and fine ships and those who wish Chinese articles will find them there very completely. The Moors of this place are white and well dressed and very rich they have pretty wives, and in the furniture of these houses have china vases of many kinds, kept in glass cupboards well arranged. Their women are not secluded like other Moors, but go about the city in the day time, attending to their business with their faces uncovered as in other parts. Thus according to Barbosa, the Moors of Rander did not observe the Islamic purdah. However the piety of Navayat Arabs is evident by the many mosques and durghas they built. By 1225, Arabs merchants and sailors settled in the area after displacing the local Jain rulers. In 1874, the Hope bridge was built across the river. Rander to villages on the other side of the river. =Rander Eid-Gah= Mughal Badshah Jehangir and his companions on their way to Ahmedabad stopped at this historic place near Jehangirpur which is now called Rander Eid-Gah. Jehangir accepted the invitation (dawat) from the mayor of Rander, Malik Tujjar. Malik Tujjar was one of the richest business man of his time. To honour & welcome the Badshah Jehangir, red carpet was laid from the Mayors palace to Jehangirpur. The dinner was served in golden plates and after dinner the plates were given to the charity. Badshah Jehangir offered Friday prayer at the Jumma Masjid Rander and Eid Salah at Eid-Gah. Today over 5 Lakh people around Rander offer their Eid Salah in the Eid-Gah =Rander Mehfil-e-Islam= The Rander Mehfil- e-Islam Kutub Khana was established 1888, and registered in 1913, as a charity society for Muslims.

He competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics and did so winning Bronze in the Team BC1‚Äì2. and Silver in the BC1 individual event watched by a record Boccia crowd at the Excel arena. David competed for Paralympics GB for a third time in Rio where he won Gold in the individual BC1 event for the first time in his career. In doing so, David has become the joint most successful British Boccia player in history. David currently holds the 'triple crown' of major tournament wins following his recent win at the World Championships in Liverpool. Early life and family He was born David John Smith at Southampton General Hospital, the son of Mary Windless (1952‚Äìpresent) and Clive Smith (1953‚Äìpresent). David was the first of two children; he was born two years before is sister Dawn. David was brought up in Eastleigh. Education =Early years and Primary school= David diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy aged 1, went to a developmental centre in Winchester for disabled children. Aged 3, he went to Cedar School, Southampton for special needs children. David first played Boccia aged 6 at Cedar School when the school competed at National junior games in Stoke Mandeville. Throwing sideways, David never really won a game and the sport took time to ignite his interest. The school really struggled to challenge David and his potential to learn was being held back by the lack of academic ability of his peers. =Secondary School= After a long battle with the council, David's parents managed to get David a place at Treloar School. Aged 11, David finally changed schools and went to Treloar School in September 2000. Immediately (much to the annoyance of Social services) David began to flourish, his confidence grew rapidly and he really developed his talent for Boccia, drumming, wheelchair hockey, wheelchair football and Para-athletics. He became the youngest ever player to win the British Boccia Championships at the age of 14 and won numerous national titles in the other sports. David was elected head boy in 2004 and managed the wheelchair hockey and football sessions. =College= The move to college was straight forward for David as it was the same organisation. Whilst at Treloar College, David attended Alton College to complete his A'levels in Physics and Maths. The demands of his, now international, Boccia career meant that a lot of the hobbies he had at school had to be phased out. =University= After the Beijing Paralympics, David went to Swansea University to study Aerospace Engineering. Due to Boccia, David took 6 years to complete the Degree. However, David was able to set up a permanent base in Swansea with the sports support services and facilities necessary to remain successful. International Boccia =Early career= Coached by Barry Bowden since he started Treloar, David joined the England and Wales squad in 2004 soon after his first British title. David's international debut followed the same year. David went to the European Championships in 2005, his first Major ranking international. There he beat the world ranked number 6 player 6-0 in a pool game and got all the way to the quarter-finals. In the team event he helped the England team secure a silver medal. David had disappointing second major in 2006 this time representing GB, where he finished 13th and the team got a bronze at the World Championships in Rio. In 2007, David became double world champion at the age of 18. Sadly, Barry decided to step down as his coach after this tournament after 7 years together following disputes with the new GB squad. David competed in Beijing 2008 but due to the continued coaching issue only managed 13th individually. The team did much better and inspired by his teammate Nigel, David raised his game and helped the team achieve an historic Paralympic Gold. =Middle career= After Beijing, David built up a friendship with Sarah Nolan who in 2010 became his coach. New management in the GB squad helped David untie the bad practices of the previous era and slowly the sport became professional. In 2009, David won his first Europeans to become world ranked number 1 for first time. In 2010, David and the team lost in quarter-finals to Tadtong of Thailand at the World Championships. Drastic changes were needed and Sarah started reworking how David played the game to suit the new style of play from Asia. In 2011, Sarah became David's permanent on-court assistant. In 2012, David won two medals at the Paralympics for the first time. In 2013, Claire Morrison became David's coach whilst Sarah remained his on-court assistant took over as captain of the team and won double gold at the Europeans that year. In 2014, David became world champion for a second time winning the final spectacularly 8-2. In 2015, David captained the team to another European Gold and the team gained an automatic slot for the Rio Paralympics. In 2016, David claimed a bronze at the World Individual Championships in Beijing having lost once in the pool stages and losing again to Tadtong. In Rio, David recovered from the disappointment of Team failure and the loss of a must win Pool game to beat his long term Thailand rival for the first time. After the pool game David parted company with his coach and Sarah took over the coaching duties. Thanks to Sarah steadying the ship and giving David clarity, two days later, David was Paralympic Champion. =Late career= Glynn Tromans took over coaching after Rio and David won the European championships for a third time and went through the whole 2017 season undefeated. In 2018, David suffered a shock defeat at Montreal World open which was the first time in over 18 months. However, David responded immediately and went on to reclaim his World title at the World Championships in Liverpool. David now has the 2016-2018 Triple crown of being reining Paralympic, European and World champion. In 2019, David defended his European title automatically qualifying to Tokyo in the process. Domestic Boccia David has remained unbeaten at annual English Nationals and GB Championships since 2004 clocking up a record 15 British and 11 National titles. In 2016, David retired from the English nationals due to the long standing trophy and competition being replaced with a new format that didn't offer the same incentives. He was able to focus on his international career and give the next generation of English BC1s a taste of success. Personal life David is currently based at Swansea where, after completing his degree studying Aerospace Engineering at Swansea university, he is living and training full-time. He has a passion for aircraft with a particular interest in World War II aircraft. He is an active member of the local Green party, a strong advocate of independent living for the disabled and a critic of successive governments cuts to spending on social care. David's car is heavily adapted to enable him to drive independently across the country. David is a Patron of his former School, Treloars in Alton. David was selected to go on Dreamflight in 2003 and since then has been a regular supporter and visitor to events in successive years. He is also a drummer in his spare time as well as a keen driver and advocate of the motability scheme. Appearances David has made two appearances on The Last Leg where he has performed his trademark \\"doughnut\\" in his wheelchair. Awards He was Given the Freedom of the Borough of Eastleigh in 2013. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to boccia  References   External links  * * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Paralympic boccia players of Great Britain Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Great Britain Category:Paralympic silver medalists for Great Britain Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Great Britain Category:Paralympic medalists in boccia Category:Boccia players at the 2008 Summer Paralympics Category:Boccia players at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:Boccia players at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Category:Cerebral Palsy category Paralympic competitors Category:Sportspeople with cerebral palsy Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Eastleigh ","title":"David Smith (boccia)"},{"id":"36700574","text":"Mary Martha Pearson (n√©e Dutton) (1798 ‚Äì1871) was an English portrait painter. Life Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere by Mary Martha Pearson William Taylor Copeland, MP, Lord Mayor of London by Mary Martha Pearson She was born on 18 June 1798 Some dates and spellings are corrected by in a letter to the editor on p, 303 of the same volume. in Birchin Lane in the City of London, daughter of Robert Dutton, a bookseller who also ran a circulating library in Gracechurch Street, and his wife Martha, daughter of John Comberbach of Haughton Hall. She had lessons with a drawing-master called Lewis. From 1813 she made copies from the old masters in the gallery of the British Institution in Pall Mall, and in 1815 was awarded a gold medal by the Institution for her copy of Claude's The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba. This copy, and one of Titian's Daughter, were then hung alongside the originals. In 1817 she married Charles Pearson, who later became the solicitor to the City of London and a member of parliament. Following her marriage, she continued her study of the old masters, as well as painting portraits and some landscapes. She won silver medals for views of the Rhine, and of Bodiam Castle. She exhibited 31 works, almost all portraits, at the Royal Academy between 1821 and 1842. She was an early member of the Society of British Artists, and exhibited 37 works at their gallery in Suffolk Street. Reviewing her portrait of Lady Mostyn, shown there in 1834, the critic of Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts said > The portraits by Mrs. Pearson have ever an air of identity about them, and > in the opinion of many, this, after all, in portraiture, is the only quality > that the artist need to be so very solicitous to produce. The head of Lady > Mostyn, however, is worthy of higher note. When her husband developed a site in Westminster, on the south side of St James's Park, the block of buildings constructed included both offices for himself, and a studio and gallery for his wife. Elmes, the building's architect, describes Pearson as \\"the distinguished portrait-painter\\" She painted numerous portraits of leading figures in the Corporation of London, including several Lord Mayors. The Times, reviewing her painting of one of them, William Taylor Copeland, shown at the Royal Academy in 1836, said that, in the light of her civic portraits, \\"the least the Corporation of London could do, would be to present the fair delineator of their well-fed countenances with the freedom of the city, emblazoned on a rosewood palette\\". She did not show work at any of the major London exhibitions after 1842. In 1844 she presented a portrait of Lord Chief Justice Denman to the Corporation of London. According to a report in The Athen√¶um Journal, at the time, her accompanying letter announced it as \\"the last picture of that magnitude which it is her intention to undertake.\\" Her sister, a miniature painter (named in the catalogues simply as \\"Miss Dutton\\") showed portraits of her at the Royal Academy in 1834 and 1852. She exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1830 and 1856 She had a daughter, Mary Dutton Pearson. She died on 15 April 1871, aged 72, at Brighton, and was buried with her husband in a large sarcophagus tomb at West Norwood Cemetery.

Written by Saeroen, directed by Albert Balink, and starring Rd Mochtar, Roekiah and Eddie T. Effendi, Terang Boelan follows two lovers who elope after one is almost forced to marry an opium smuggler. The film was shot in the Indies and Singapore, and was partially inspired by the 1936 Hollywood film The Jungle Princess. It was aimed at native audiences and included keroncong music, which was popular at the time, and several actors from Balink's previous work Pareh (1936). Terang Boelan was a commercial success in both the Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at Malay audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was followed for decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran described it as a turning point in the history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era, Terang Boelan has been lost since at least the 1970s. Plot Rohaya (Roekiah) must separate from her lover, Kasim (Rd Mochtar), so that she can marry her father's choice, the disreputable but rich Musa (Eddie T. Effendi). The night before the wedding, Kasim plays the song \\"Terang Boelan\\" for Rohaya, and they agree to elope. The following day, Rohaya and Kasim escape from Sawoba Island to Malacca, where Kasim begins work at a drydock and Rohaya keeps busy as a housewife. They discover that Kasim's old friend, Dullah (Kartolo), has lived in Malacca for some time. Their life together is interrupted when Musa, who is revealed to be an opium dealer, discovers them. While Kasim is away at work, Rohaya's father (Muhin) comes and takes her back to Sawoba. Kasim, having discovered Musa's deeds, also returns to Sawoba and rallies the villagers to his side by telling them of Musa's opium dealings. He and Musa begin fighting. When it appears Kasim may lose, he is saved by Dullah, who had followed him back to Sawoba. The villagers and Rohaya's father agree that Kasim and Rohaya should be together, as they are truly in love. Background During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been made by the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that there was a very low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres. In an attempt to show that locally produced, well-made films could be profitable, the Dutch journalist Albert Balink, who had no formal film experience, produced Pareh (Rice) in 1935 in collaboration with the ethnic Chinese Wong brothers (Othniel and Joshua), and the Dutch documentary filmmaker Mannus Franken. The film cost 20 times as much as an average local production, in part because of Balink's perfectionism, and was ultimately a failure. The Indonesian writer and cultural critic Armijn Pane wrote that Pareh had performed poorly with native audiences as it was seen as looking at them through European eyes. Pareh bankrupted its producers, and enabled The Teng Chun to dominate the industry ‚Äì although with less traditional stories ‚Äì for a further two years. Production One of the Wong brothers, 1947; the Wongs' collaboration with Balink on Terang Boelan was their second, after Pareh. By late 1936 Balink had obtained financial backing from several domestic and foreign companies with which he, the Wongs, and Franken opened the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF) in Batavia (now Jakarta). Although this new establishment focused mainly on newsreels and documentaries, on 1 January 1937 ANIF announced that it would produce several feature films, one of which was Terang Boelan. The story for Terang Boelan was written by Saeroen, a reporter with the newspaper Pemandangan who had close connections to the theatrical community, shortly after the domestic release of the American-produced Dorothy Lamour vehicle The Jungle Princess (1936), which served as an inspiration. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran wrote that this gave Terang Boelan stylistic and thematic similarities to the earlier film. The Indonesian film critic Salim Said also recognised such similarities, describing Terang Boelan as reflecting the \\"jungle princess\\" works popular at the time. Saeroen named the fictional island on which Terang Boelan takes place \\"Sawoba\\" after the crew: Saeroen, Wong, and Balink. Production had begun by February 1937, under Balink's direction and with the Wongs as cinematographers, only to be interrupted by the relocation of ANIF's offices. Filming had begun by May of that year.; ; Sources conflict as to whether Franken was involved: Biran wrote that Franken had been left in charge of the studio's documentaries, while the American film scholar Karl G. Heider recorded Franken as co- directing the film. As opposed to The Teng Chun, who aimed his films at lower- class audiences, Balink aimed his film at educated native Indonesians, attempting to show them not from a European perspective but as they viewed themselves. According to Said, this arose as a reaction to failure and resulted in a less ethnological approach. Terang Boelan was shot in black-and- white using highly flammable nitrate film at Cilincing in Batavia, Merak Beach in Banten, and Tanjong Katong in Singapore.; The use of nitrate film may have been a factor in the film's later loss. The cast of Terang Boelan mainly consisted of actors who had appeared in Pareh. This included the leading actor, Rd Mochtar, and several minor players, including Eddie T. Effendi and Soekarsih. Other cast members, including the leading lady Roekiah and her husband Kartolo, were drawn from traditional toneel theatrical troupes; this may have been part of an effort to attract theatregoers. The film, which included the songs \\"Terang Boelan\\" and \\"Boenga Mawar\\" (\\"Rose\\"), required its cast to sing keroncong music (traditional music with Portuguese influences); because Mochtar's voice was ill-suited to the task, the musician Ismail Marzuki ‚Äì who also composed the film's score ‚Äì sang while Mochtar lip synced. Release and reception Terang Boelan premiered on 8 December 1937 at the Rex Theatre in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies; it played to a nearly full theatre. Also marketed under the Dutch title Het Eilan der Droomen, the film was advertised as showing that the Indies were as beautiful as Hawaii, a popular island paradise in Hollywood films. Posters also emphasised the use of Indonesian-language dialogue. William van der Heide, a lecturer on film studies at the University of Newcastle in Australia, notes that the film continued a trend of \\"Indonesianisation\\", or the application of a national (Indonesian) understanding to borrowed concepts; for Terang Boelan this indigenisation process involved the inclusion of \\"exotic local settings\\" and keroncong music. Such adaptations of foreign films had arisen several years earlier and continued long after Terang Boelan release. The film was a commercial success, both in the Indies and nearby British Malaya. Native audiences filled the cinemas, most of them working-class people, including native fans of toneel and keroncong who rarely watched films. After being licensed by RKO Radio Pictures, the film was screened in British Malaya, where it was advertised as \\"the first and best Malay musical\\" and earned 200,000 Straits dollars (then equivalent to US$ 114,470) in two months. Terang Boelan proved to be the most successful production in the area until Krisis (Crisis) in 1953, released after the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949. Despite the success, ANIF was displeased with the film and halted its other non-documentary productions; one of the studio's cameramen, an Indo man named J.J.W. Steffens, suggested that ANIF's management preferred works of non-fiction as a more intellectual medium. Disappointed by the company's reaction, Balink left the Indies and emigrated to the United States in March 1938.; Terang Boelan cast left ANIF not long afterwards and, after briefly touring Malaya, joined Tan's Film. They made their first film for Tan's, Fatima, in 1938. Mochtar, who soon married fellow Terang Boelan actress Soekarsih, continued to be cast as Roekiah's lover; the two were a popular screen couple until Mochtar left Tan's in 1940 over a wage dispute.; ; Legacy Roekiah and Rd Mochtar (pictured in Siti Akbari) continued to be cast as lovers until 1940. The success of Terang Boelan led to an increase in film production in the colony, many of the films following the same formula, including songs, beautiful scenery and romance. Before Terang Boelan, local studios had generally been unsuccessful in finding a formula popular with audiences, but the triple successes of Terang Boelan, Fatima, and Alang-Alang (Grass, 1939) revived the industry. Four new production houses were established in 1940, and actors and actresses previously attached to theatrical troupes entered the film industry, which was reaching new audiences. Most locally produced films released in the Indies were made between 1939 and the Japanese occupation in 1942. Meanwhile, in Malaya, the brothers Run Run and Runme Shaw, drawing inspiration from Terang Boelan and Alang-Alang success with Malay audiences, established Malay Film Productions in Singapore, where it became one of the more successful production houses. Heider considered Terang Boelan one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's earlier film Pareh was the other. He notes that Terang Boelan \\"set the tone for popular Indonesian cinema\\", a tone that remained dominant into the 1990s. Biran considered the film a turning point in the history of Indonesian cinema, showing the possibilities of the medium and serving as a catalyst for further development. Said concurred, describing the film as a milestone in Indonesia's history because of the widespread formula it introduced. The repeated use of Terang Boelan formula has been criticised. The director Teguh Karya, for instance, denounced films that used it without building on it, leaving the formula \\"undeveloped and static\\". Terang Boelan is considered lost, as are most domestic productions from the era. The Filipino film historian and director Nick Deocampo noted that productions made with nitrate film ‚Äì such as Terang Boelan ‚Äì burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that copies of the film may have survived until the 1970s. In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator John H. McGlynn expressed hope that a copy of the film might be lying around in someone's attic or closet in Indonesia or the Netherlands.

He subsequently commanded the 1st Australian Task Force in South Vietnam in 1969‚Äì70. Early life Born on 29 December 1922 in Canterbury, Victoria, the son of a manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Weir spent his childhood in Fiji. He was subsequently educated at Camberwell Grammar School in Melbourne, Victoria. After joining the Australian Army in 1938 he graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon as a lieutenant in the infantry in June 1942 at the age of 20.. Military career Transferring to the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF), Weir subsequently served in New Guinea during the Second World War. Weir married Loloma Green of Richmond in 1944; the daughter of a missionary, Green had also grown up in Fiji and the couple later had a son, Tony.. Weir was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions as a platoon commander in the 2/3rd Battalion fighting against the Japanese near Wewak in February 1945.... A regular officer, Weir continued to serve in the post-war Interim Army. As a captain he was posted to Army Headquarters before being discharged from the AIF in 1948 following the establishment of the Australian Regular Army. As a major Weir commanded a company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) against Chinese forces in Korea in 1952‚Äì53, before holding instructional positions at Duntroon, the Staff College at Queenscliff and the UK Staff College, Camberley.. He went on to command 1 RAR during counter-insurgency operations in the Malayan Emergency in 1960‚Äì61.. Promoted to colonel in 1964 he was appointed Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters in Canberra, a position he held until 1967. From January to August 1969 he served as acting commander of the 1st Division in Sydney, as a brigadier.. Weir took over as Commander 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in South Vietnam on 1 September 1969. Believing that 1 ATF's primary role was to find and destroy Viet Cong main force concentrations and bases in the remote areas of the province, he moved away from the population protection operations of his predecessor and returned to earlier tactics which saw attrition of communist forces as paramount. Reflecting his aggressive approach, during his tenure the Australians conducted 21 major operations. These operations proved effective and the Viet Cong were unable to mount a major offensive in Phuoc Tuy Province during this time. Meanwhile, following signs that the main forces had left the province Weir pursued the local forces. By early 1970 the Viet Cong 274th Regiment in the Hat Dich no longer posed a threat to the task force, while D440 and D445 Provincial Mobile Battalions were reported to have left the province. After nine-months in command Weir handed over to Brigadier William Henderson on 31 May 1970.. Retirement and later life Shortly after returning to Australia he suffered a heart attack and was medically retired from the Army in 1971.. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his command in Vietnam. Weir subsequently settled in Buderim, Queensland, with his wife, and in his later years enjoyed golf, historical research, gardening, painting and writing. He died on 3 December 2004.

Biography Tilden was born on 31 May 1887, the son of William Augustus Tilden, a prominent chemist who discovered synthetic rubber. Educated at Bedales and Rugby, Tilden joined the Architectural Association in 1905, leaving in 1908 to become an articled pupil to Thomas Edward Collcutt, with whom he later went into partnership. By 1917, he had established his own practice and for the next twenty years worked almost exclusively for a small circle of rich, interconnected, patrons for whom he designed, or re- constructed, country houses, gardens, chapels and churches, castles and a vast tower that was intended to sit on top of Gordon Selfridge's department store on Oxford Street, London. His best known works, apart from the unexecuted design for the Selfridges tower, were all for politicians: from 1918 to 1923 he designed the Moorish Courtyard, compared by Honor Channon to a \\"Spanish brothel\\", and the gardens and swimming pools at Port Lympne for Lloyd George's secretary, Philip Sassoon and may also have worked for Sassoon at Trent Park. Later in 1920s he completely reconstructed Chartwell Manor for Winston Churchill and during the same period built Bron-y-de, at Churt in Surrey, as a country house for David Lloyd George. By the late 1920s, Tilden's career had peaked: near bankruptcy, following some failed speculative developments; combined with a mental breakdown, which Bettley attributes to Tilden's attempting to reconcile his homosexuality with his marriage to Amalia Broden, a Swedish author; led to his leaving London entirely and moving to Devon. The latter part of his career was spent mainly in the West Country, where he undertook the restoration of a number of, mostly, less important country houses for a variety of less eminent clients. Examples include the reconstruction of Antony House in Cornwall and of Sydenham House in Devon. Many of Tilden's buildings now enjoy Listed Building status although this is sometimes due to the fame of their owners, or to work that pre-dated Tilden, rather than to his own efforts: examples include Port Lympne Mansion, Grade II* listed as at 29 December 1966; Chartwell, Grade I listed as at 16 January 1975 and Antony House, Grade I listed as at 21 July 1951. In 1954 Tilden published his autobiography, True Remembrances: the memoirs of an architect. Bettley considered it highly unreliable. Philip Tilden died on 25 February 1956 at Shute, Devon.

Mehtabuddin, clueless on how to solve Khalilullah's mysterious power, seeks help from his knowledgeable and bookworm friend Jalal. Despite their strict examination of Khalilullah's exhibition of special power, the mystery remains unresolved. Meanwhile, Tuntuni, an otherwise loner, strikes friendship with Khalilullah. Khalilullah reminisces that he grew his special power following a heavy bout of high fever in his childhood; he does not remember anything before. The school teacher from Netrokona further informs Mehtabuddin that Khalilullah may be a jinn. Mehtabuddin becomes increasingly restless and uncomfortable by Khalilullah's unresolved mystery. Jalal suggests that he could be \\"Homo superior\\", the next evolutionary stage of Homo sapiens. Mehtabuddin locks Khalilullah in a room. Moved by Tuntuni's telling of her mother's untimely death, Khalilullah endeavours to create a machine that would help reconnect with the dead. Tuntuni questions why Mehtabuddin locked Khalilullah.

Its pawnbroking monopoly was legalized in a Dutch East Indian government decree. Several savings and loan co-operatives de facto also offer pawnbroking services.  History  The first Pegadaian building at Sukabumi As a state-owned enterprise, Pegadaian has a long history which began in the 18th century when Dutch East India Company (VOC), established a Bank van Lening. Then the Dutch East Indian government issued State Gazette no. 131 of 12 March 1901 that principally govern that establishment of pawnshop was monopolized and only government runs such business. In accordance with this law, the first Pegadaian was established in Sukabumi, West Java on 1 April 1901. In the early days of the government of the Republic of Indonesia, the office was moved to the Pegadaian Karanganyar, Kebumen because of the increasingly heated war. Dutch Military Aggression II forced office of Pegadaian moved again to Magelang. After the war of independence, Perjan Pegadaian back to Jakarta and Pegadaian run by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. In this period, Pegadaian has several times changed status, namely as a Perusahaan Negara (PN) since January 1, 1961, then by Regulation No.7/1969 a Bureau Company (Testament), and then based on Government Regulation. 10/1990 (as amended by Government Regulation No.103/2000) changed again into Perusahaan Umum (Perum). Later in 2011, the status change occurred again from Perum to the PT as set out in Government Regulation (PP) No.51/2011 which was signed on December 13, 2011. However, the change is effective after the base budget is submitted to the authorities on 1 April 2012.  Products Pegadaian old logo Until now there are many people who know Pegadaian from its core business, fiduciary. And in addition, the product is actually quite a lot. Here are some of the Pegadaian's services. = Conventional =  Conventional pawnbroking (KCA / Kredit Cepat Aman - Fast Secure Credit)  Pegadaian's standard product is the standard pawnbroking product. A valuable item such as jewellery, motor vehicles or electronics is pawned. The credit term is 120 days. The interest rate will vary according to amount borrowed and is per 15 days or part thereof. The minimum interest rate is 0.75% for each 15 day period, but higher rates such as 1% per 15 days are typical. In addition, a fixed insurance premium of 1,000rp is payable to the national insurance company Jasa Raharja. This pays 50% of the amount borrowed, to a maximum of 2,500,000rp in case of death. In addition, the insurance covers the interest due, up to 20,000,000rp, in case of death by natural causes. In case of death by accident, the insurance also covers the principal, to a maximum of 100,000,000rp. In addition to the insurance, an administration fee is payable at the time of pawning. For example if borrowing 1.3 million rp against gold worth 5 million, administration + insurance of 21,000rp would be charged. At 1%/15 days, 104,000rp interest would be due after 120 days. The pawning could then be extended with the interest rolled up with the principal, subject to a payment of new administration + insurance. Thus in this case 1.3 million borrowed and extended to 360 days would incur total interest (assuming 1%/15 days) & fees of 400,000rp. The lowest annual interest rate possible is 18.25%, but this does not include the administration/insurance. In addition, by counting interest in full 15 day periods, the actual interest earned by Pegadaian will tend to be higher than advertised.  Kreasi  This product is aimed at micro and small business loans as an alternative to collateral reg (fiduciary) and loan repayment through installments.  Krasida  Krasida is lending to the micro-small entrepreneur on the basis of the return of mortgage loans through installments.  Krista  Krista is the provision of loans to micro households in need of funds in the form of working capital loans through the loan repayment installments.  Kremada  Kremada is provision of loans to the low-income groups to build or repair housing with return in installments. Cooperate with the Ministry of Housing.  Kucica  Kucica is money remittance service, and cooperate with Western Union. = Sharia =  Rahn  Rahn is a product fiduciary services are based on the principles of Sharia with reference to the modern administrative system.  Arrum  Arrum is a product of the construction guarantee micro-fiduciary for small businesses with Islamic principles.  Mulia  Mulia is gold selling by Pegadaian to the public who are interested to invest in gold for cash and installment. Gold has been purchased from Mulia can be sold back at the Noble Exchange at a later date if the needed money in a short time.

The name is used to refer to the group of buildings as a whole, as they were constructed together as an architectural project within the framework of renovation of the city center of Lelystad. The word kade means \\"quay\\" or \\"embankment\\", as the buildings face an artificial body of water within a small park called Zilverpark. The Zilverparkkade was conceptualized by Adriaan Geuze of the urban planning and landscaping bureau West 8, who envisaged it as a mixed development of both office and residential use, with 10 narrow plots for separate buildings of differing height. Every building was designed by a different architect, resulting in a striking postmodernist lineup of facades. The concept of a number of different narrow, tall facades mirrors the historic canal house arrangement typical of many Dutch cities. Due to its modern and tall appearance, it is also compared to arrangements such as the Vlissingen seaside boulevard. The individual buildings are (from left to right):  Calliste  Designed by Eric van Egeraat of the architectural bureau EEE, Calliste is an office building at the corner of Zilverparkkade.  Dominor  Dominor, designed by Ren√© Zuuk, is an office building with a facade adorned by concrete decorations resembling tree branches.  Koh-I-Noor  Named after the famous diamond, it is a work by Rob Bakelaar of Tekta Architecten.  Fensalir  The Fensalir by Jeroen van Schooten (of Van Schooten and Meyer Architecten in Amsterdam) is the tallest building in Zilverparkkade. The ground floor and first floor (mezzanine) are designated for commercial space, storerooms and staircase with access to apartments which fill the upper floors. Floors 11, 12 and 13 form a \\"head\\" that stands above the neighbouring buildings, visually separated by the tenth floor breaking the line of the walls and exposing steel girders supporting the upper floors. This break is further emphasized by the upper floors being oriented east-west, providing the inhabitants with views not available from the lower floors and the other buildings, which are oriented north-south. Furthermore, the southern wall, facing Zilverparkkade and the Zilverpark, is \\"blind\\" on those floors. The building is named after Fensalir, a location mentioned in Norse mythology.  Aeratus  The Aeratus is a nine-storey building by Pim van der Ven of Mei Architecten en stedenbouwers B.V. of Rotterdam. The five lower levels are devoted to office space, while the four upper ones are apartments. This is apparent from the facade, as only the upper floor levels have balconies. The facade is covered with oxidized copper (verdigris), which is reflected in the name of the building‚Äî\\"aeratus\\" means \\"fitted with copper (or bronze or brass)\\" in Latin.  The Wave  With five storeys, the Wave is the lowest building in Zilverparkkade. Its English- language name, as well as principal theme, was inspired by the wavy bicycle bridge crossing Zilverpark pond. This is reflected by the wavy balcony floors between all levels, blurring the otherwise straight order otherwise reigning on the Zilverparkkade facades (although the building's floors actually follow the set order). The striking design is the work of Bjarne Mastenbroek of Amsterdam's SeARCH bureau.  Identi  The Identi subscribes to the most popular combination in Zilverparkkade by having commercial space on the ground and first floors and apartments from the second storey up. The apartment floors are visually separated from the commercial floors by having balconies placed in white aluminium-lined recesses in the dark brick facade. The painted aluminium casings and facade recesses are used to emphasize the separate apartments, which include a maisonette on the fourth and fifth floor. The building stands out by being taller than most others in Zilverparkkade. Its top, eleventh floor is a penthouse with an atrium and glass roof providing lighting in lieu of the facade, which has been blinded. The Identi, completed in 2007, was designed by Paul van Bussel, who worked for the architecture bureau De Zwarte Hond.  Jocator and Klusor  The Jocator and Klusor were the last two buildings to be completed in Zilverparkkade. Most of the other buildings were completed by 2007, leaving a gap. Harry Abels of IAA Architects of Enschede designed the two very different buildings to fill this gap. The construction of both began on December 19, 2008 and was completed in 2010, bringing the Zilverparkkade to a finished state. Jocator can be translated from Latin as \\"joker\\" or \\"jester\\", and the building reflects the theme by having golden \\"broken smiles\\" surround its glazed balconies within its brick facade. Ten stories tall, it has commercial and office space on the first two floors and apartments from the second floor on. The Klusor is lower by two stories, and serves as a visual bridge between the Jocator and the lower, recessed \\"Zilverparkkade 130\\". This is visually and functionally emphasized by Klusor's large balconies, whose wrapping balustrades are constructed of transpartent glass covered with red patterns by the artist Hielke Leuk.  Zilverparkkade 130  This building formally closes the Zilverparkkade, although a corner building at Stadhauisstraat adjoins it as well. To match the frontage of that building, Zilverparkkade 130 is slightly recessed from the frontage of other Zilverparkkade buildings. Zilverparkkade 130 features a restaurant stretching from the ground floor through first floor, and office space from the second to sixth floors. Most office floors have 192 square meters of lettable office space. The third floor houses a meeting room, while the sixth floor features another meeting room / office space of 67 square meters adjoining a terrace atop the fifth floor. The office floors have a double-skin facade with accessible balconies between the two glass \\"skins\\". Zilverparkkade 130 was designed by Jouke Post, Aart van der Meulen and Constantin White of XX architecten (Rotterdam) and completed between 2006 and 2007.

Composition  Stravinsky composed this sonata when he was in Biarritz and Nice in the summer of 1924. He finished it on October 21 that year. It was premiered by the composer himself at the Donaueschingen Festival in July 1925. It was eventually edited by Albert Spalding and published by Boosey & Hawkes in 1925. It is dedicated to the Princess Edmond de Polignac, Winnaretta Singer.  Structure  The sonata is in three movements and takes between 9 and 11 minutes to perform. The movements are: In some recordings, the first movement is titled Moderato and the third Allegro moderato; however, such titles or tempo markings are not present in the original score.  Analysis  The first and the third movement are related to each other: both share the same tempo and both are in sonata form, each with its own recapitulation; furthermore, as for the thematic material, the first theme played on two hands simultaneously at the beginning is played again at the coda in the last movement. The first movement counters triplets with eighth notes, whereas the invention-like third movement consists of sixteenth notes that makes it more lively, closer to Baroque styles. The second movement is closer to the Romantic style of Beethoven, who, in Stravinsky's estimation, was one of the \\"greatest musical geniuses\\"; therefore, the ornamentation of the melody is more dense, which is unlike Stravinsky's simple and direct compositional style employed in the prior movement.

Mitchell, Jr. (June 18, 1937 ‚Äì January 4, 2011), credited as Herb Mitchell and sometimes Herb L. Mitchell, was an American actor, director, and teacher. He was a stockbroker before he made the switch to acting, appearing in films; stage plays such as The Fiddler on the Roof, in which he played the lead role of Tevye; television shows including The Practice, on which he had a recurring role; and commercials, including ones for stock brokerage firms Dean Witter Reynolds and Paine Webber. He was married twice and had five children.  Early life  Herb Mitchell was born June 18, 1937, in Bar Harbor, Maine. He was one of three sons of Herbert L. Mitchell, Sr., and Estella Mae Bourgeois Mitchell. He grew up in Bar Harbor, where he attended local schools, served as an altar boy in the local Catholic church, and participated in high school sports. Following studies at the University of Maine and the Maine Maritime Academy, he became a stockbroker in Bangor, Maine.  Acting career  In the late 1960s, Mitchell joined a community theater group in Ellsworth, Maine, the Ellsworth Players; he eventually became its president. He was purely a behind-the-scenes participant in the group's stage productions until 1971, when director Bill Raiten persuaded him to take the role of Tevye in a production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. His portrayal won praise, including a favorable review by playwright Samuel A. Taylor. A New York City producer who saw the show offered Mitchell a chance to play the same role in an off-Broadway production of the musical in Brooklyn. Mitchell, as the father of four children, felt committed to his financial career and declined the offer. However, he continued to act in local productions in the following years, became disenchanted with his job, and decided to pursue acting as a profession. During the 1970s, he became co-owner of a jazz club and bar that operated seasonally in Maine; he spent the off-season acting on stage in southern California. He auditioned for the television series M*A*S*H (1972‚Äì83) without success. By 1980, he was working in Los Angeles as an actor, appearing in films, television programs, live performances, and commercials. He portrayed roles in commercials for stock brokerage firms Dean Witter, as the company spokesman, and Paine Webber, as an executive. In 1992, while living in Los Angeles, Mitchell bought a home in Blue Hill, Maine. In the early 1990s, he operated the Company of CharActors Theatre, which performed stage plays, one of which he directed, in Studio City, California. In the 1993 film Gettysburg, set during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65), he portrayed the real-life Union Army flag bearer Sergeant Andrew Jackson Tozier. In the early to mid-2000s, he survived three cancers and then moved back to Blue Hill with his family, where he semi-retired while occasionally appearing in local stage productions. He reprised his role as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof in May 1990 and August 2006, again directed by Raiten. He appeared in the television courtroom drama series The Practice (1997‚Äì2004) as the recurring character Judge Rodney White. In August 2006 he appeared at Ellsworth High School, in Ellsworth, Maine, as Eddie Carbone in a production of Arthur Miller's play A View from the Bridge. Over the years, he was mentored in singing by Sheldon Bisberg, \\"his longtime musical collaborator\\".  Personal life and death  Mitchell was the father of four children with his first wife, Scarlett Kinney, and one daughter with his second wife, Janet Ahearn. At the time of his death he also was a grandfather of four. On January 4, 2011, he died in the Blue Hill home of his daughter Kathy and her husband.

The building houses a council chamber for Corby Borough Council, a Registry Office, a public library, a 450-seat theatre and a 100-seat studio theatre. The theatre has a programme of live productions, dance, music and standup comedy, complemented by a participation programme encouraging involvement of the whole Corby community. The theatre also screens films twice a week, including current mainstream and independent releases. History The building with was designed by Hawkins\\\\Brown and built by Galliford Try at a cost of ¬£47.5 million, opened as the headquarters of Corby Borough Council on 2 November 2010. Financial and building controversies A report by Corby Borough Council in 2012 revealed that the Cube was built with dangerous design flaws and almost double its original estimated costs and a capacity of only half of what was planned. In 2012 the working group of the council‚Äôs Overview and Scrutiny Panel published its report into Cube. It looks into the development and construction of the building. However, the full report contained commercial, financial and legally sensitive information so the public version of the report which was issued was heavily redacted with considerable blanking of text. In August 2012, the firm of architects of the Cube, Hawkins Brown, threatened to take Corby council to court over the report into the ¬£12 million authority-overspend on the Cube complex. Along with criticising the council board that ran the building project, the report claims architects Hawkins Brown did not stick to its brief. Among its conclusions, the report stated that the current Labour-controlled council: \\"incurred substantial unforeseen costs in order to bring the building into an occupiable state but with limitations on occupancy still unresolved\\". In September 2012, Hawkins Brown withdrew its threat of legal action against the borough council. The firm had, however, written to every borough councillor, asking for a chance to defend itself. Councillors were told not to respond \\"for legal reasons\\". In February 2013, water began dripping through the council chamber's ceiling forcing councillors to hold meetings in the canteen. This followed snow and heavy rain. The BBC reported that the Cube cost ¬£47 million, over budget by ¬£12 million, but the final report on the project had not yet been released. Also in February, the length of time taken to publish the audit report into the overspend was called \\"very disappointing\\" by Local Government Secretary of State Eric Pickles. In June 2013 auditors found that the council had sold land now being developed by Tesco for millions of pounds below its market value. Corby Borough Council \\"may have made decisions contrary to law\\" in its management of a ¬£67 million regeneration scheme, auditors KPMG said. Also in June 2013, management of regeneration programmes, including the Cube, by Corby Council was condemned by consultants appointed by the Audit Commission. KPMG said arrangements obscured who should make key decisions, oversight at critical points was insufficient and project and financial management was poor. In July 2013 the Conservative group on Corby Council handed what they described as \\"suspicious\\" findings of an audit report into the financial dealings of Corby Borough Council to the police for investigation. In August 2013 it was announced than another ¬£600,000 was needed to mend roofs that have been leaking since the building was occupied. Work also needs completing on office space in the building which does not meet building fire safety regulations. Chief Executive Norman Stronach later said that the council would \\"seek redress\\" from the architect and contractor and that action to recover extra money spent on the Cube is \\"a growing inevitability\\". On 8 December 2014, Northamptonsire Police began an investigation into financial dealings by Corby Borough Council. In July 2013, Conservative councillors had handed the \\"suspicious\\" findings of an audit report to the police to see if a crime had been committed. The audit report examined four major projects, including the Corby Cube, the cost of which went from ¬£35 million to ¬£47 million. In January 2015, the BBC reported that repairs to the Cube were still going on five years after it opened. In March 2015 whistle-blower Steven Redfern, Corby Borough Council's former head of property, lodged a ¬£1 million damages claim at the High Court against Corby Council. Redfern said he became \\"a target for people's venom\\" after complaining about high-profile land deals in the town. The case was listed to go to the High Court in the summer, but was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In October 2015, Corby Council stated that work on the Corby Cube had been completed, five years after it opened but with a ¬£13 million overspend. On 3 February 2020, The Council was advised to abandon any legal action against the builder and designer.

Executed in 1622 and 1623, the sculpture is now in the Kunsthalle Hamburg, in Germany. Although possibly mentioned by one of Bernini's early biographers, the bust had been considered lost and therefore makes no appearance in Rudolf Wittkower's catalogue of Bernini‚Äôs sculptures of 1955. However, the bust was identified in the 1980s and is now considered an authentic work by Bernini.Hess, Catherine. \\"Ritratto del Cardinal Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto\\", I marmi vivi: Bernini e la nascita del ritratto barocco, pp. 230‚Äì32. Commissioning Bernini had already been commissioned by Cardinal Montalto to create the Neptune and Triton fountain for his gardens at the Villa Montalto on the outskirts of Rome, and was involved in the commissioning of the David statue that eventually ended up in the Villa Borghese. But the precise reason behind this bust is unclear; given that Cardinal Montalto died in 1623, it has been suggested the bust was created as part of a funerary tomb.Lavin, Irving. \\"Bernini's bust of Cardinal Montalto\\", Burlington Magazine, 1985, vol. 127, pp. 32‚Äì38. However, Montalto may well himself have commissioned the bust prior to his death History The bust was recorded as being in the Villa Montalto in the early 1660s and then in the \\"Casa Peretti\\" in 1682. The bust arrived in Hamburg Kunsthalle after 1910, being donated as part of the collection of the Anglo-German Sir John Henry Schroder. Appearance Although only recently re-discovered by art historians the sculpture is well appreciated. Hess comments that \\"the expression of deep thought and concentration on the cardinal ... gives a great sense of animation to this bust. Bernini has included remarkably naturalistic details, such as the fine hair of his unshaven cheeks, the fleshly lower lip ... and the pockmarks flanking his nose\\". Meanwhile, Lavin mentions the ‚Äúextraordinary qualities of vitality and refinement with which Bernini suffused the conventions of formal ecclesiastical portraiture.‚Äù  Gallery  File:Sculpture of Cardinal Montalto by Bernini.JPG File:Sculpture of Cardinal Montalto by Bernini 7.JPG File:Sculpture of Cardinal Montalto by Bernini 3.JPG File:Sculpture of Cardinal Montalto by Bernini 5.JPG  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography    External links  * Category:1620s sculptures Category:Busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini Category:Busts in Germany Category:Marble sculptures in Germany Category:Monuments and memorials in Germany Category:Sculptures of men in Germany ","title":"Bust of Alessandro Peretti di Montalto"},{"id":"36701387","text":"Steffen Gebhardt (born 22 July 1981) is a German modern pentathlete.

This modularity is intended to make repairs and maintenance easier, or to allow the vehicle to be reconfigured to suit different functions. Another application of modular vehicle design is to enable the exchange of batteries in an electric vehicle. In a modular electric vehicle, the power system, wheels and suspension can be contained in a single module or chassis. When the batteries need recharging, the vehicle's body is lifted off and placed onto a fresh power module. By using this Modular Vehicle system, the vehicle's batteries do not have to be removed or reinstalled, and their connections remain intact. History of the modern modular vehicle The Ridek III body and chassis can be separated to change body styles or to put the same body on a chassis with fully charged batteries. The world's first road- licensed quick-change modular electric vehicle, based on a patent awarded to Dr Gordon E Dower in 2000,Dower, Gordon E, 2000, US Patent: \\"Modular vehicle construction and transportation system\\" was shown at the World Electric Vehicle Association 2003 Electric Vehicle Symposium EVS-20 in Long Beach, California, USA. Dower described the vehicle's two parts as its motorized deck, shortened to Modek, and its \\"containing module\\" or Ridon. When attached to each other, the vehicle thus formed was dubbed the Ridek. Mechanical connections between the modules for braking and steering automatically engage when the body is lowered on to the chassis. In 2004, General Motors attempted to patent a modular vehicle called AutonomyPatent application 10/966,548, filed 10/15/2004, assigned General Motors, lead inventor Adrian B Chernoff but the attempt was unsuccessful because Dower‚Äôs patent already existed.Patent 10/966/548,denied 2/23/2006, Attorney docket no: GP -3015791/GM0268PUS-1 A team at GM did, however, continue to work on Autonomy, which was intended to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. They unveiled a non-drivable version of their modular vehicle in January 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show.King, Ralph, \\"GM's Race to the Future - the inside story of how the world's biggest automaker came to see the hydrogen car as its salvation - and took the lead in the engineering challenge of the century\\", Business 2.0 Magazine, Oct 1, 2003. GM unveiled a drivable prototype, called Hy-wire at the Paris Auto Show in September, 2002. The name referred to the Hydrogen fuel and the \\"drive-by- wire\\" system that electronically connected the vehicle modules for steering, braking and controlling the 4 wheel motors. Hy-wire did not go into production. Flexibility Modular vehicles make it possible to use different types of bodies, e.g. sedan, sports car or pickup truck, on one standardized chassis.Chernoff, Adrian B et al, 2003 US Patent: \\"Vehicle body interchangeability\\" Also, the modular chassis, with its batteries and motor, are relatively easy to work on, since there is no vehicle body to impede access.

His songs denounced the social inequalities and autocratic political system of the day. Trader and writer Ganesh Lal was born in Bhimphedi, Makwanpur District to father Madhav Lal and mother Chandra Kumari Shrestha. His first wife Chandra Maya died in 1948, and he was married a second time in 1956 to Narayan Devi. Bhimphedi, located 35 km to the southwest of the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, is a market town on the old trade route linking India and Tibet. Ganesh Lal's family owned a store shop which sold general merchandise and cloth. Ganesh Lal looked after the shop and spent his free time composing songs. During festivals, he took part in stage performances and music recitals. Bhimphedi began to wither after the district headquarters was shifted to Hetauda. Subsequently, Ganesh Lal moved there and opened a cloth shop. He died in Hetauda. In 1999, a statue of Ganesh Lal was erected on the premises of Nepal Bhasa Khala in Hetauda.

Winstead and Paul play a married couple, Kate and Charlie Hannah, both alcoholics. After a series of embarrassing incidents caused by her drinking habit, Kate decides to get sober with the help of a coworker and a sponsor from Alcoholics Anonymous. The script was partly based on Burke's own experience of giving up alcohol at a young age, since she felt that her narrative had not yet been told on film. She and Ponsoldt wrote the script over six months, and the main roles were cast in September 2011. The film's US$500,000 budget was financed by independent investors including Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf. It was shot in Los Angeles in October 2011. It premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012 and was released by Sony Pictures Classics on October 12, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with Winstead's performance receiving unanimous praise, and was nominated for several awards for her acting. Plot Kate Hannah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an elementary school teacher, arrives at work hungover and vomits in front of her class. Asked by a student if she is pregnant, she pretends she is, then continues the lie to the school principal, Mrs. Barnes (Megan Mullally). Her co-worker Dave (Nick Offerman) reveals that he knows she has been drinking and she makes him swear not to tell anyone. Attending a party with her husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) and his brother Owen (Kyle Gallner), Kate drinks heavily. While leaving, she meets a woman who asks Kate for a ride. Kate is offered crack and the two get high together. The next morning, Kate wakes alone on the street. She finds her car and drives home, where Charlie acknowledges they both are alcoholics. They get intoxicated and have sex before Charlie passes out. Kate heads out alone to buy wine but is turned down by the cashier. She urinates on the floor because the bathroom door is locked, then steals a bottle of wine. Waking up, Kate realizes she has passed out again. At work, Dave, a recovering alcoholic, invites her to an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. There, she befriends Jenny (Octavia Spencer), who has chosen a passion for food and cooking over alcohol. Kate decides to become sober and change her life. Dave drives Kate home, but bluntly makes an offensive comment which upsets her. When Kate and Charlie visit her estranged alcoholic mother, Rochelle (Mary Kay Place), Kate mentions the AA meetings but Rochelle is skeptical; Kate's father left them after getting sober and now lives in another state with his \\"shiny new family\\". Kate is surprised the next day when she is thrown a baby shower by her colleagues. She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind them. At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them. Kate tells Charlie she feels she must confess to Mrs. Barnes the truth about her faked pregnancy. Charlie discourages her, warning that she will lose her job, and they begin to fight over financial issues. Kate lashes back that she would never depend on Charlie's parents' money and that she has struggled her whole life. Kate decides to tell Mrs. Barnes the truth and is fired. In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie. After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating one year of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, to give him a chance to redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.

Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived on opposite sides of the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months. Casting negotiations for the film's main roles‚Äîplayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aaron Paul, Octavia Spencer and Nick Offerman‚Äîtook place in September 2011. To prepare for her role, Winstead talked with Burke about her recovery and attended a variety of AA meetings, where she spoke with other young women who had gotten sober. To act drunk, she used Ivana Chubbuck's method as described in her book The Power of the Actor. Paul said that in preparation for the film he recorded himself \\"getting severely intoxicated\\" and studied the footage. In order to build a rapport together, Winstead and Paul got drunk together the night before filming began, which Winstead described as being \\"very messy\\". Smashed was filmed in Los Angeles over 19 days in October 2011. It was shot on a $500,000 budget, which was sourced by producers Jonathan Schwartz and Andrea Sperling of Super Crispy Entertainment from independent financiers, including Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf. Release =Box office= Smashed premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012. It was also screened at the Deauville American Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Athens Film Festival, Jameson CineFest, the Stockholm International Film Festival, and the Hamptons International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics bought the film's distribution rights after its premiere at Sundance and gave it a limited release on October 12, 2012. On its opening weekend, the film grossed $26,943 from four theaters, averaging $6,736 per theater and ranking number 53 at the box office. The film earned $376,597 domestically from 13 weeks in release, with a widest release of 50 theaters. It earned $123,128 internationally for a total gross of $499,725. =Critical response= Mary Elizabeth Winstead was praised by many critics for her performance in the film The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 83% based on 107 reviews with an average score of 6.8 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Smashed resists the temptation to play up its serious subject matter for high theatrics, opting instead to let its gentle tone and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's marvelous performance carry the day.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Variety critic Justin Chang commended Smashed for its \\"sheer emotional generosity\\" and Ponsoldt and Burke for their optimistic and sympathetic approach to the story. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's neutral and unsentimental tone and its \\"refus[al] to indulge a voyeuristic taste for ... sordid details\\". Similarly, Empire magazine's James White commended the film for avoiding clich√©s and condescension \\"by combining a light, frank, comic touch with real emotion and weighty, human performances by all those involved\\", and gave it 4 out of 5 stars. In a review for The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy praised Smashed for its emotional intimacy and realism. Michael O'Sullivan, writing for The Washington Post gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, likening it to \\"a dramatic public service announcement\\" rather than an insightful narrative. Slant Magazine Chris Cabin also opined that the story was underdeveloped and that the film \\"offers a cheap and easy sort of inspiration in lieu of genuine inquiry\\" into the recovery process of alcoholics. Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle did not find the film to be insightful, writing that the filmmakers were \\"preaching to the choir\\" with their portrayal of alcoholism and recovery. Winstead received critical acclaim for her role. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, wrote that she \\"is sort of wonderful in this movie, worn and warm\\" and commended her decision not to portray the character as a victim. Rolling Stone Peter Travers described Winstead's performance as \\"unmissable and unforgettable\\", praising the comedy and intellect she simultaneously brought to the role. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Winstead was striking as Kate and speculated that Smashed would prove to be \\"the doorway to great things\\" in her career. Joe Williams from St. Louis Post- Dispatch gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and stated \\"There will never be another Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, but Hollywood may have found a new Lee Remick in Mary Elizabeth Winstead.\\" =Accolades= When Smashed premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Ponsoldt was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize in the Dramatic category, while producers Andrea Sperling and Jonathan Schwartz received a nomination for the Special Jury Prize for Excellence in Independent Film Producing. Winstead was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. Octavia Spencer received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress at the Black Reel Awards.

He had six brothers and a sister. Among his children was Confederate general Edward Lloyd Thomas (1825‚Äì1898). Biography Edward Lloyd Thomas was the son of Phillip Thomas, who served as a Corporal in the Revolutionary WarRoster of Revolutionary Soldiers in Georgia, Volume 3 by Mrs. Howard H. McCall, Ettie Tidwell McCall, page 166, and Elizabeth Covington Wailes of two prominent Maryland Families. Edward L. Thomas was a Methodist preacher (see Methodism), a planter, land speculator and surveyor. He learned surveying from his Uncle Levin Wailes. In 1808, at age 23, he was a Justice of the Peace of Franklin County, Georgia and was Captain of the Militia District 209. About 1813, he was ordained a Methodist minister, and was living at Watkinsville, Georgia in Clarke County, Georgia. Thomas was the father of Lovick Pierce Thomas, I and Edward Lloyd Thomas, grandfather of lawman Heck Thomas and Col. Lovick Pierce Thomas, Jr. Edward surveyed land in many Georgia locations: in 1819, a district of Walton County, Georgia, in 1820 the county and district lines of Hall County, Georgia and Habersham County, Georgia, in 1821 Henry County, Georgia district lines, and in 1824, Dooly County, Georgia. He was chief surveyor of a commission appointed by the governor of Georgia to establish the western boundary of Georgia in 1826; for years Alabama disputed this survey, but in 1840, it was accepted. Dec. 24, 1827, after the Creek Indians (see Muscogee people) ceded lands, the State Legislature passed \\"an act to lay out a trading town, and to dispose of all the lands reserved for the use of the State near the Coweta Falls, on the Chattahoochee River, and to name the same.\\" Edward was selected to lay out the town of Columbus, Georgia on 1,200 acres. He took with him his young son, Truman, to work on his crew. The boy got sick and died in a small house that still stands on 808 Broadway; his was the first burial in Linwood Cemetery, Columbus. The boundary between the Cherokee and Creek Indian lands was disputed; the final line was a compromise of Andrew Jackson's in 1829. Early in 1831, Edward Lloyd Thomas ran sectional lines for the Cherokee Country which was most of northwest Georgia, north of the Chattahoochee River. In the summer, he ran the Georgia-Florida line which was not agreed upon until 1859. His last important work was in 1837 when he laid out the town of Oxford, Georgia at a site designated by the Georgia Methodist Conference for the establishment of a college, Emory College (see Emory University). There, he built his house and lived out his years. He is buried in the Oxford Cemetery. His house still stands. Edward's Will Stated: \\"being at this time free from the bondage of debt, the hardest of all masters as far as regards temporal matters‚Äîand intending to remain thus free the balance of my life whether long or short, as a valuable legacy, by way of parting advice to my children & all connected with them by marriage, that they imitate my example, and keep clear of debt, if they wish to preserve a serene mind and an unruffled temper.\\" He was buried in the Oxford Historical Cemetery. Mary \\"Polly\\" Hogue, of Clarke County, Georgia, married Edward in August 1806. She was one of nine children, four brothers and four sisters. Her Father Jacob Hogue owned a large farming operation; he died in 1817. Polly and Edward Lloyd had eight children. Ed and Fletcher died in infancy. All the men served in the American Civil War. Henry Phillip (1810-1863) was a Colonel in the 16th Regiment of Georgia Infantry and was killed leading a charge in the Battle of Fort Sanders Knoxville, Tennessee. Lovick Pierce Thomas, I, (1812-1878), served as the quartermaster 35th Georgia Infantry. Wesley Wailes (1820-1906), was a Major in Co. F, Phillip's Legion of Cavalry. Edward Lloyd Thomas, II (1825-1898), by the War's end, was General of the 35th Georgia Infantry. Several of Thomas' works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Works Edward Lloyd Thomas is cited in the NRIS database of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places five times, for his having some association with National Register listings. In Columbus, Georgia, four National Register listings cite him: Edward Lloyd Thomas' drawing of plan for Oxford, Georgia and Emory College *For the Colored Cemetery, 10th Ave. Columbus, Georgia, Thomas is cited as probably having set aside its area in Thomas's 1828 plan for the city of Columbus. *For the Columbus Historic District (Boundary Increase), bounded by Ninth and Fourth Sts., Chattahoochee River and Fourth Ave., Columbus, Georgia, Thomas is also citedThomas' association is presumably described in the corresponding National Register inventory/nomination document. *For the Old City Cemetery, Linwood Blvd., Columbus, Georgia, Thomas is also cited.Thomas' association is presumably described in the corresponding National Register inventory/nomination document. *For Rankin Square, bounded by Broadway, 1st Ave., 10th and 11th Sts., Columbus, Georgia, Thomas is also cited.Thomas' association is presumably described in the corresponding National Register inventory/nomination document.

Northeast India refers to the easternmost region of India consisting of the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura, as well as parts of northern West Bengal (districts of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Koch Bihar). Background An ongoing separatist struggle has continued in the region since the late 1940s, making it the longest running separatist struggle in South Asia. There are multiple parties involved in the struggles including different ethnic groups and states, some of whom want total independence from India while others call for a restructuring of the states. There are existing territorial conflicts within the Northeastern states, including between Manipur and Nagaland, Nagaland and Assam, Meghalaya and Assam, and Mizoram and Assam. These are often based on historical border disputes and differing ethnic, tribal or cultural affinities. There has been a number of insurgent activities and regional movements in all parts of the northeast, often unique in character to each state. Military action by the armed and paramilitary forces and political action have led to the intensity of these insurgencies fluctuating and to the resolution of the insurgency in Mizoram. Human rights abuses on the part of Indian forces in the area are frequently traced to immunity granted to Indian security forces under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958. The act has been criticized by Human Rights Watch as a \\"tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination\\".\\"Crisis in Kashmir\\" Council on Foreign Relations The South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre argues that the governments' call for increased force is part of the problem.India: Repeal Armed Forces Special Powers Act; 50th Anniversary of Law Allowing Shoot-to-Kill, Other Serious Abuses.

According to Human Rights Watch, the fighting has led to a strict curfew, with police being given \\"shoot at sight\\" orders for curfew violators. Multiple police shootings were reported after the order was given.Human Rights Watch, India: Rescind \\"Shoot at Sight\\" Orders in Assam, 27 July 2012 Allegations of sexual assault Women are mostly raped during militant attacks where men of the villages or towns are gathered outside their homes and women are forced to stay indoors.

Rawlins was a right-handed batsman. He was born at Blunham, Bedfordshire, and was educated at Wellingborough School. Rawlins made his debut for Bedfordshire against the Kent Second XI in the 1926 Minor Counties Championship. He played minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire from 1926 to 1935, making seventy appearances, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire. Playing minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire allowed Rawlins to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, who he made his first-class debut for against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1930. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 216 all out, with Rawlins being dismissed for a duck by Len Hopwood. Lancashire then made 188 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by reaching nine without loss, at which point the match was curtailed by rain and declared a draw. He later made a second first-class appearance for the team against Oxford University at the University Parks in 1934. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 539/8 declared, with Rawlins scoring 74 runs before he was dismissed by Kenneth Jackson. Oxford University then made 469 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by reaching 129/4, with Rawlins scoring 36 runs before he was dismissed by Jake Seamer. The match ended as a draw. He died at Biddenham, Bedfordshire, on 27 December 1968.

It is one of the most ancient monasteries in the world and in the region of the Middle East and North Africa, traditionally held to have been founded by Byzantine emperor Justinian I in 547 AD. It is run by a religious order of nuns. It is an important pilgrimage site for Christians and Muslims, who visit an icon of Saint Mary which is attributed to Saint Luke. Description The main chapel has numerous icons and a wooden iconostasis in front of the altar. The pilgrimage shrine, separate from the main chapel, contains the aforementioned icon of Mary, called Shaghoura (\\"the Illustrious\\"). The icon is kept hidden behind an ornate, silver-doored niche, while on either side of this shrine are a number of later icons. Numerous beaten silver crosses and other religious symbols, left as ex votos by pilgrims, are displayed on the walls. History Mosaic depiction of Mary ordering Justinian not to kill her but to build a church on the rock in the background, after having first appeared to him as a gazelle. The scroll she holds reads: (\\"No, thou shalt not kill me, Justinian, but thou shalt build a church for me, here, on this rock\\"). Tradition holds that the monastery was built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in 547 AD, following two visions of Mary. One indicated the intended site of the church, while the other outlined its design. Justinian dedicated the finished project on the Feast of Mary's Nativity, and annually thereafter on September 8, both Christian and later Muslim pilgrims arrive at the monastery to honour Our Lady of Saidnaya. The monastery was damaged during the Syrian civil war.Damage to the soul: Syria's cultural heritage in conflict ()  See also  *List of heritage sites damaged during Syrian civil war *Mary in Islam *Shrines to the Virgin Mary  References   External links  * Our Lady of Saydnaya Patriarchal Monastery (antiochpatriarchate.org) Category:Christian monasteries in Syria Category:Christian pilgrimage sites Category:Eastern Orthodox church buildings dedicated to Theotokos Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries Category:Greek Orthodoxy in Syria Category:Shrines to the Virgin Mary Category:540s establishments in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Our Lady of Saidnaya Monastery"},{"id":"36702065","text":"Carlos Filipe Fonseca Chaby (born 22 January 1994) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for Acad√©mica de Coimbra on loan from Sporting CP as an attacking midfielder.

History The model is made from molten and beaten zinc and is hand-painted. It was hand-crafted between 1864 and 1873 by Stefan Ill√©s (, Ill√©s Istv√°n), a Hungarian Catholic who lived in the city making a living from book binding. The scale model reflects the city under the later stages of Ottoman rule. The model is considered the first scientific relief model of the city. After being displayed in the Ottoman Pavilion at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, the model was displayed around Europe and was purchased in 1878 by community leaders in Geneva where it was displayed in the Calvinium, also known as the Salle de la Reformation, for 40 years. In 1920 the building in which the model was housed was leased by the League of Nations. The model was moved and soon forgotten. In 1985, then graduate student Moti Yair of the Hebrew University came across a reference to it and tried to track down its location. With the help of some friends and a librarian from the Library of Geneva, the model was found in the library's attic.

Rashid rose to prominence during the Iran-Iraq war, and was regarded as one of Saddam's best generals,Karsh, Efraim The Iran-Iraq War 1980‚Äì1988, London: Osprey, 2002 page 48 serving as Chief-of-Staff of the Iraqis after being brought out of retirement, which he had been forced into in 1983. Rashid also played a prominent role in helping Iraq to regain her initiative during the war. Not all assessments of Rashid were so kind, and Ra'ad al-Hamdani refers to him as \\"one of the dumbest generals in the army\\". Iran‚ÄìIraq War High Iraqi losses during the conflict nearly led to a mutiny led by Rashid, father-in-law of Hussein's second son. Rashid began by public criticizing Saddam Hussein, and claimed that many of Iraq's casualties were caused by Saddam's meddling into military affairs. Saddam ordered him back to Baghdad due to both his public criticism and his failure to remove the Iranians from the al-Faw peninsula. Aware that an order to return to Baghdad was probably a death sentence for Rashid, his officers warned Saddam that if anything were to happen to Rashid they would mutiny.Karsh, Efraim The Iran- Iraq War 1980‚Äì1988, London: Osprey, 2002 page 53 This confrontation with the military led to the greater independence of military planning from Ba'athist- leadership interference. Shortly afterwards, the Iraqi Air Force once again established air superiority. Despite this, Rashid was placed under house arrest following the end of the Iran-Iraq war in an effort to reduce the power of Generals who had become influential during the war years in order to prevent any possible coup attempts from forming. 1991 Uprisings Following the Gulf War Iraq experienced a wave of uprisings and Saddam called on Rashid to help put down the uprising against the Ba'athist government. Iraq War & Aftermath Rashid was given command by Saddam over the Iraqi Armed Forces's Southern Command in the run up to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Saddam also appointed him as the General Supervisor for the Iraqi Army's 3rd, 4th, and 7th Corps. After the fall of the Iraqi government Rashid disappeared, before being arrested in July 2003 in Tikrit. He spent the next five years in prison. Following Rashid's release in 2008 Rashid returned to Tikrit, and lived in his farm near Tikrit. Death Rashid died on 29 June 2014 in hospital in the city of Sulaymaniyah in Iraq, two months after having suffered a stroke. Rashid had also been suffering from a long-standing illness. He was survived by his family, including his two grandsons, Yahya Qusay Saddam al-Tikriti and Yaqub Qusay Saddam al-Tikriti; who were also the surviving children of Qusay Hussein. Personal life Rashid was a Sunni Muslim from Tikrit, and was both a close friend of Saddam Hussein and also a member of the same tribe; the Al- Bu Nasir tribe. In 1985 his daughter, Sahar, married Saddam Hussein's son Qusay. Rashid had promised to liberate the al-Fao peninsula in the Iran-Iraq war and had offered his daughter to Saddam's son Qusay to show his certainty. They had three children but later divorced.

Written by Lou Breslow and Owen Francis, the film is about a generations-old feud between two families that is resurrected when the town banker tries to contrsuct a highway through the area bearing a monument to the frontiersman ancestor of one of the families.Magers 2007, p. 159. Shooting High was Gene Autry's first film away from Republic Pictures, his first as a mere co-star, his first without the comic presence of Smiley Burnette since 1934, and his first playing a character other than himself.Magers, pp. 158‚Äì160. Plot The Carsons and the Pritchards have been feuding in the town of Carson's Corners for generations. The budding romance between Will Carson (Gene Autry) and Marjorie Pritchard (Marjorie Weaver) is now being threatened by the long-standing feud. Margorie's father, Calvin Pritchard (Frank M. Thomas), is the bank president and mayor of Carson's Corners. Calvin pretends to support Will's courtship of his daughter because he needs to acquire a piece of Carson property for a proposed highway through the area. When Will learns of Calvin's true motives, he accuses Marjorie of scheming with her father to steal Carson land. The long simmering feud between the Carsons and the Pritchards erupts over Will's accusation. Just as the families renew their bickering, Gabby Cross (Jack Carson), a publicity agent for Spectrum Pictures, arrives in town and offers the townspeople $20,000 to use Carson's Corners as a filming location for a movie he is making about Wild Bill Carson, Will's grandfather and the founder of Carson Corners. Still angered by Will's undermining his highway plan, Calvin refuses Gabby's offer. His youngest daughter, Jane (Jane Withers), suggests a compromise that would allow Spectrum Pictures to use the town as a filming location if the highway proposal were approved by the Carsons. With all parties agreeing to the proposal, the movie company arrives in town and begins production. The star of the film, Bob Merritt (Robert Lowery), begins to court Marjorie. Wanting her sister to marry Will, Jane and the sheriff devise a plan to frighten Merritt out of town, telling him a lynch party is after him. After Merritt leaves town, the head of Spectrum Pictures threatens to sue Pritchard for the defection. Gabby suggests giving the part to Will, who agrees on the condition that Pritchard extend the Carson mortgages. While the movie is being filmed, three gangsters arrive in town. During a bank hold- up scene, the three gangsters put on actors' costumes and steal the money from the bank. Learning of the theft, Will pursues the gangsters on horseback, catches them, and brings them back to Carson Corners with the money. Will's heroic actions wins the respect of the Pritchards, as well as Margorie's respect and hand in marriage.

The thirteen-year-old movie star called Joseph M. Schenck, then head of 20th Century Fox, directly telling him she wanted to do a film with Gene Autry. Schenck liked the idea, but suspected Republic Pictures would never load out the singing cowboy to another studio. Withers then contacted the head of Republic Pictures, Herbert J. Yates, and suggested that a group of Fox contract players be loaned to Republic in exchange for Autry. The studios agreed and the film became a hit. Autry, who earned $71,000 per year at Republic, earned $25,000 for his work in this film. =Filming= Shooting High was filmed November 18 to December 16, 1939. =Filming locations= * 20th Century Fox backlot, Calabasas, California, USA * Santa Susana Pass, Simi Valley, Los Angeles, California, USA * Corriganville Movie Ranch, Simi Valley, California, USA =Stuntwork= * Foxy Callahan * Frank McCarroll * Henry Wills =Soundtrack= * \\"Wanderers\\" (Felix Bernard, Paul Francis Webster) by Gene Autry and Jane Withers * \\"Shanty of Dreams\\" (Gene Autry, Johnny Marvin) by Gene Autry and Jane Withers * \\"Only One Love in a Lifetime\\" (Gene Autry, Johnny Marvin, Harry Tobias) by Gene Autry * \\"Little Old Band of Gold\\" (Gene Autry, Charles Newman, Fred Glickman) by Gene Autry * \\"On the Rancho with My Pancho\\" (Harry Akst, Sidney Clare) * \\"Bridal Chorus (Here Comes the Bride)\\" (Richard Wagner) References ;Citations ;Bibliography  * External links  Category:1940 films Category:1940 Western (genre) films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Alfred E.

It is located about south of Fitzroy Crossing and north east of Yungngora in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, The area was first explored by Alexander Forrest in 1879, who gave enthusiastic reports of the well grassed and watered country that would be suitable for grazing lands. Among those to take up leases were the Durack and the Emanuel families who together claimed over one million acres along the Fitzroy River in the West Kimberley and a similar amount along the Ord River in the East Kimberley. After an expedition to the area the Duracks decided to take up the lands along the Ord and the Emanuels took the area along the Fitzroy. The station was established in 1885, and in 1902 occupied and area of . The country is on the flood-plain of the Fitzroy River and is well covered in Mitchell and Flinders grass with large areas of spinifex. A large number of cattle was lost on Gogo and on Fossil Downs Station in 1906 following an extended dry spell. Other neighbouring stations lost several hundred cattle each. By 1910 the station had an estimated herd of 35,000 cattle and the station manager was being paid an annual salary of ¬£600 a year. In 1911 the station was being managed by George Piper and was owned by the Emanuel Bros., who also owned Noonkanbah Station located further to the south east. Following the advent of the revision of the Land Act limiting holdings up to one million acres, several of the properties of the Emanuels had to be disposed of. Gogo was dissolved into three separate properties; Margaret Downs (also known as Gogo), Cherrabun and Christmas Creek, and these together with Meda Station are still held by the descendants of the original partners. Moola Bulla Station bought 50 bulls from Gogo to improve their herd in June 1912. A stockman died at the station in 1913 when he was thrown from his horse. The man, Frank Odman, did not regain consciousness after the accident and died the following day. By 1917 the station had a herd of 50,000 cattle and was regarded as one of the \\"best run stations in the Kimberley\\". The current homestead was built in 1918 of concrete blocks on a concrete floor, it is situated adjacent to several nearby caves that were had carved in the 1940s. Cattle tick reached the property in 1918‚Äì19, probably transferred from Louisa Downs Station where the stock had been infected in 1916‚Äì17. It affected the herd so severely that branding at Gogo was reduced from 12,000 the previous year to 4,800 in 1918. Put up for auction in 1920 the station along with its neighbour, Noonkanbah Station. Gogo was advertised as having an area of on one compact block equipped with of fencing. The property is described as being abundantly watered by the Fitzroy River, Margaret River, Christmas Creek and various other creeks, but still having several bores with windmills and troughing. The total stock on the property was 60,000 shorthorn cattle along with 400 horses, 50 mules and 44 donkeys. The average rainfall at the station since 1894 is advertised as per annum. The station was not sold as the Emanuels still owned the station in 1923. A new station manager, Ted Millard, arrived in 1921. By this stage the frontage pastures along the river and waterholes had become degraded as a result of overgrazing for the last 30 years. Over the entire property the only fenced areas were two horse paddocks and some branding yards, stock were left to graze on the open range. During the 1920s Millard had ten wells sunk and equipped in the back country so stock could make use of the feed in the area and give relief to the over grazed areas. Millard also started fencing paddocks to control stock movement with over of fences being installed in seven years. Shorthorn bulls were slowly introduced into the herd to breed out white skinned beasts that were unsuitable to the tropical climate. Millard remained on the property for 30 years eventually managing all of the Emanuels properties; Gogo, Cherrabun, Meda and Christmas Creek. He was also noted for taking good care of his Aboriginal workers. The herd size was estimated at 90,000 in 1928 and Gogo was the biggest station in Western Australia. The station delivered 394 cattle and 39 bales of wool in 1929 to the port of Derby to be loaded aboard Minderoo and steamed to Fremantle. In 1930 gas was struck in a water-bore that was drilled at the station. The Freney Oil company held concessions for the area. The well had sunk to a depth of and the presence of gas was confirmed by the station manager, Mr Millard. Over 500 cattle were shipped from the station in 1932 aboard Centaur from the port in Derby. A further 883 bullocks were shipped on Minderoo to Port Hedland in 1935 then another 454 were shipped in 1936 also aboard Centaur and bound for Carnarvon. A shipment of 526 cattle were shipped from Gogo in 1937 aboard Centaur, with another 422 sent in 1938 aboard Charon and 450 sent from Derby aboard Gordon bound for Fremantle. During an influenza epidemic in the Kimberleys in 1934, 12 Aborigines died from the disease on Gogo out of the 129 fatalities overall. In 1947 Gogo shipped 2,580 cattle from Derby out of 6,760 that were sent from all the stations in the surrounding area, in 1948 450 bullocks were shipped aboard Gorgon. During the wet season in 1949, six Aborigines were struck by lightning during a tropical storm. They were all severely burnt and one as still unconscious the next day when they were taken to Fitzroy Crossing hospital. In a report made to the Commonwealth Government in 1950 by the Department of Agriculture it was found that in a survey performed by a Mr. Poggendorff that of Gogo would be suitable for rice cultivation, despite the fact that previous experimental plots had failed in the Kimberley in 1948. The Emanuels continued to improve the herd by purchasing poll shorthorn bulls from the Melara stud including Melara Formidable (6) and Melara Royal Rebel (4) in 1950. The area was struck by drought between 1951 and 1953 with the number of cattle being reduced by half. This was the first drought suffered by pastoralists in 70 years with many hurriedly sinking bores and buying feed to keep their stock alive. Other nearby properties that were affected in Noonkanbah, Liveringa, Quandan, Cherrabun, Glenroy, Fossil Downs, Luiluigui, Christmas Creek and Bohemia Downs Station. In 1954 at Gogo Station, Preston Walker of UAM Mission Fitzroy Crossing married their head stockman Jock Shandley and his bride Rita.Westralian gems for Christ's crown by S Preston Walker, 2001, p.33 In 1985 an area of was excised from the property to form the Aboriginal community of Yakanarra which is home to about 150 Indigenous Australians. In 2010 the station was owned by the New South Wales based Harris family. A trial for wet season cropping on a large scale was conducted in 2010 with of sorghum being planted. The crop in turn will be used to fatten the cattle prior to export. Thousands of hectares at Gogo were burnt out in 2011 when a fire was deliberately lit at the Muludja Community near Fitzroy Crossing. A local man started the fire after an argument and was affected by alcohol, he was later arrested and charged with arson following a tip-off from the public.

The district is known for its Georgian architectural heritage and is the core area of Limerick's Georgian Quarter. It is one of the three towns that make up modern-day Limerick City Centre, the other two being the older Englishtown and Irishtown, which date from the medieval period. Newtown Pery houses the largest collection of Georgian townhouses in Ireland outside of Dublin. In 1837, Samuel Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland described Newtown Pery as \\"one of the handsomest towns in Ireland\\".http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-City-Topography.php History Limerick - O'Connell Street looking north east. The majority of this section of Newtown Pery was rebuilt in the mid to late 20th Century Prior to the development of Newtown Pery, the historical City of Limerick was situated just north of the present day city centre, stretching from King John's Castle towards where St. John's Cathedral is today. The city was made up of two distinct towns; Englishtown (populated by Old English settlers) located on the historical island city and Irishtown (populated by natives) located on the southern bank of the Abbey River.http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/limerick%20history%2005.pdf The two towns were connected by one bridge Baal's Bridge over the Abbey River, while Thomond Bridge beside King John's Castle was a major crossing point of the River Shannon from Englishtown into modern-day County Clare. As with most cities of this time, Limerick was heavily fortified and walled and the streets were characteristically narrow, winding and cramped. Prior to the construction of Newtown Pery, Limerick was also beginning to exhibit some early Georgian styles within the old city. Examples surviving today include the Old Bishop's Palace at Castle Street and at John's Square (Limerick's first example of fashionable architecture and civic spaces). Early photographs of the old city areas also show the old (pre-Georgian) continental and Dutch gabled styled townhouses as being altered somewhat to appear more Georgian. Very few of these survive today. Originally the land south of the medieval city that was to become Newtown Pery was owned by the Franciscans and known as South Priors Land. Following the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII this land was granted to Edmund Sexton of whom Edmund Sexton Pery was a descendant and on whom much of Georgian Limerick is credited.http://limerickslife.com/rediscovering-limericke-3/ Following the turbulent years of the 17th century, Limerick began to prosper in the 18th century and was completely transformed into the city it is today.http://georgianquarter.com/264-2/ Easy access from most parts of Ireland facilitated by the River Shannon and the opening of canals enabled Limerick to become the main port city on the western side of Ireland, which in turn brought much prosperity to the city and to its merchants and landowners with trade between Britain and America. The boundaries of the city of Limerick, where the municipal corporation had authority, were smaller than the county of the city of Limerick, where the city grand jury had parallel authority. The area within the county of the city but outside the city proper was termed the city liberties. The development of Newtown Pery can be attributed to the work of Edmund Sexton Pery (created Viscount Pery in 1785) and his plan for the development of a new town on lands he owned in the south liberties of the city. In 1769, he commissioned the Irish engineer Christopher Colles to design a town plan on his estate which has since become known as Newtown Pery. Colles devised an impressive plan for the Pery Estate which divided the estate into a grid plan of equal rectangular plots and length and of a distinctive architectural unity which still defines the city centre to this day. The town was built in stages as Pery sold off leases to builders and developers who built 4 and 5 story townhouses in the Georgian fashion with long wide and elegant streets in grid plan design with O'Connell Street (originally known as George's Street) as its centre, which was mostly in accordance with Colles' plan.http://www.garrymiley.com/2007/05/05/TheConservationOfGeorgianLimerick1.aspx The earliest houses are located along Bank Place, Rutland Street, Patrick Street which were built by the Arthur family - a prominent Limerick family during the 18th century. Some of the finest examples of Georgian Architecture can be seen at the Crescent area and Pery Square. The Custom's House (Hunt Museum), designed by Italian architect Davis Ducart, is also one of the city's finest examples of Georgian Architecture. By the turn of the 19th century, Newtown Pery was rapidly growing as most fashionable area of the city. In 1807 its leading residents secured a private act of the UK parliament to establish a body of improvement commissioners as municipal authority for the civil parish of St Michael's, within which Newtown Pery was located. The commissioners were abolished in 1853, when the area was absorbed into Limerick city. One brake on the town's development was that the only crossing point on the Shannon remained at Thomond Bridge in the old and now less fashionable Englishtown district. In 1835, a new bridge was built over the Shannon connecting the west directly with Newtown Pery. It was originally called Wellesley Bridge after The 1st Marquess Wellesley, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when the act to pay for it was passed. It cemented Newtown Pery's position as Limerick's premier urban district as connections to the area improved. The five-arch bridge was designed by Alexander Nimmo based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. In 1882 it was replaced with the current Sarsfield Bridge. Details Tait Memorial Clock Tower and Dominican Church, Baker Place From its development Newtown Pery has served as Limerick's CBD. It is also the city's main retail district which is centered on O'Connell Street, William Street and the adjoining streets. In addition to the quality of the Georgian heritage in the district, another striking feature of the development is the grid plan layout of the streets in the area running north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest in similar fashion and design as found in New York City, Philadelphia, Glasgow, Bristol and Berlin albeit on a smaller scale. This distinguishes Limerick's Georgian stock to the other major Irish Georgian development in Dublin, as Limerick's terraces are more uniform. This is due to the fact that the Pery owned all the land that was developed and it enabled a single development plan. Limerick continued to expand following the Act of Union and into the early 19th century; however, Pery's plan for the city was never fully realised. It was intended that the city would continue further southwards; however, a crippling economic decline in Ireland caused by the Great Irish Famine put an end to the development. The terrace at Pery Square was the last development of the great Georgian expansion of Limerick. The terrace itself was intended to be part of a Georgian square enclosing the People's Park, similar to Fitzwilliam Square or Mountjoy Square in Dublin; however, the plans were never realised as the development coincided with the beginning of the Famine. Another distinguishing feature of Georgian Limerick to Georgian Dublin is that Newtown Pery was a completely new \\"greenfield\\" development. Limerick's medieval city was left completely intact and remains to this day. But most of the built infrastructure of medieval Limerick did not survive past the mid-20th century following the clearance of slum living in the city. Some examples survive, and the street outlines remain in Nicholas Street, Mary Street, Broad Street, John Street and Mungret Street. Much of Georgian Dublin, in contrast, was undertaken by the Wide Streets Commission, which almost completely rebuilt Dublin over the older medieval city. Decline O'Connell Street in the early 20th century featuring the imposing facade of Cannock's Department Store and its landmark clocktower. It was rebuilt in the early 1960s, losing its Georgian character Although housing an important collection of Georgian architecture and acting as Limerick's city centre, unfortunately Newtown Pery's position as the one time fashionable area of the city is long over. In addition to this, its Georgian heritage has been severely compromised, in particular around the retail core of O'Connell Street and William street. Economic decline and stagnation plagued Limerick during the 20th century which saw some townhouses converted to tenements such as at Arthur's Quay and Bank Place. During this time very little investment was seen in Newtown Pery, only the exodus of families and industries to new suburban districts around the city due to modern requirements. By the mid-20th century, dereliction had taken its toll as the townhouses at Arthur's Quay, Francis Street and Bank Place were completely lost. Lax development controls enabled the almost complete rebuilding of the northern end of O'Connell Street and replacing what were some iconic and illustrious buildings with more modernist (and perhaps less attractive) 1960s-style architecture. The loss of Todd's Department Store to a fire which gutted the building, the rebuilding of Cannock's Department Store, Royal George Hotel, AIB Bank amongst many more, completely altered the look of city and ultimately resulted in a loss of the districts heritage and character. Nevertheless, much of the districts Georgian townhouses remained intact, however many were converted to offices or flats, while others remained unoccupied or neglected. However, despite the architectural losses and economic conditions, Newtown Pery remained the premier retail and services district for Limerick and the greater Mid-West Region well up into the late 20th and early 21st century. Economic stagnation in Limerick was only broken by the Celtic Tiger in the late 20th century. But Newtown Pery still lagged behind with regards to investment and planning, with exception to the riverfront of the Shannon. Suburban areas of Limerick have seen massive investments, particularly in retail, which has seen the onetime retail core of O' Connell Street and William street been eclipsed by massive retail developments in the suburbs. Poor planning and lack of investment has resulted in high vacancy rates and further dereliction, which plagues some parts. Amongst the casualties of this poor planning has been the Patrick Street, Rutland Street & Ellen Street areas which were all part of the ill- fated Opera Centre development. These streets are now almost completely derelict & vacant. Urban depression in Limerick unfortunately is not confined to these areas alone as much of central Limerick is now exhibiting the effects, mainly of heavy suburbanisation but also the effects of economic recession. The area is now a shadow of its former self as more and more businesses & retail facilities leave the city centre for the convenience of the new shopping centres. Future In order to arrest the decline of Limerick's CBD and Newtown Pery in general, both Limerick City Council and national government have introduced schemes to counteract the heavy suburbanisation of the city. Amongst the most elaborate plans is the ‚Ç¨250 million Limerick 2030 plan which will see a complete redevelopment of the Arthur's Quay area into a new and modern retailing complex.http://www.limerickcity.ie/Planning/EconomicDevelopment/Limerick2030AnEconomicandSpatialPlanforLimerick/ It will also see the development of a higher education campus to include facilities from LIT, UL, and MIC and a refurbishment of the city's main streets. Another plan is the Living City Initiative, which provides tax relief for residents who refurbish Georgian houses in designated areas. It also provides tax relief to retailers who carry out works to upgrade or re-fit their shops in the designated Georgian area.http://www.limerick.ie/business/whatsnew/2013-02-18limerickcityandcountycouncilswelcomelivingcityinitiative.html Newtown Pery is a testament to Limerick's rich & eventful past and remains one of the most important remnants of Ireland's Georgian Era. It remains to be seen if the above schemes can stop the decline of the city's historic & elegant stock of buildings.

Product description The product is a dietary supplement, not a drug, and hence it doesn't need to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Clinical Studies TRX2 has been tested by Oxford Biolabs in a clinical study. In the study, 59 male and female volunteers showing signs of alopecia completed 18 months of therapy, receiving either TRX2 or a placebo. The results of the study showed that 26 (out of a total 29) participants who had taken TRX2 recorded and increase of at least 10% in the number of hair strands in the evaluation area and/or a 10% increase in hair weight. Controversy In January 2014 the UK Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint against TRX2 and Oxford Biolabs, citing that advertisements that the company had run for TRX2 were misleading and in breach of EU advertising codes.

Mettupatty (Agrahara Mettupatty) is a small village near Valayapatty in Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu. It is south of Namakkal and south of Valayapatty Panchayat. It is at the bank of Karaipottan river. History The name Agrahara Mettupatty derived from the Iyers as most of the peoples were Iyers (Brahmins). They hold major agricultural fields in the village. The Iyers received those lands from the Zamindars and local rulers. The rest of the people were working for the Iyers and took care of their agricultural fields & cattle. Later on, most of the Iyers left the village and settled in the nearby cities. As a result, people bought the agricultural lands from the Iyers and started working on it. Pyramid Shape Temple Towers There is a Lord Siva (Sri Sivakama Sundari Udanurai, Sri Chithambareshwarar Aalayam) and Kothanda Perumal temple present in this village. It has been a significant importance to this village as it is constructed in the shape of pyramids (Egyptian pyramids). The Mettupatty Zamindars, who ruled the entire eight villages, including Agrahara Mettupatty, had constructed this pyramid-shaped temple 300 years before. The temple towers are also in the shape of pyramids. There is a Pirathosa Pooja every 15 days in the month. All the peoples from surrounding areas, including local politicians, used to come and attend the Prirathosa pooja. Business and Economy The entire village's economy and business is based on agriculture and farming. In the earlier days, agriculture was the main source for their livelihood. Due to several factors like changes in lifestyle and education, and due to lower rainfall, the people are moving towards the cities. Even though it is a village, the people still take up vocations such as medicine, banking, police, law, etc. Category:Villages in Namakkal district ","title":"Agrahara Mettupatty"},{"id":"36702654","title":"Alberth Bravo"},{"id":"36702657","title":"Kristijan Efremov"},{"id":"36702658","text":"Elvin Chia Tshun Thau (born 26 April 1977) is a retired Malaysian swimmer.

Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, published Harmondsworth, England, 1960 R v Penguin Books Ltd was the public prosecution in the United Kingdom of Penguin Books under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 for the publication of D. H. Lawrence's 1928 novel Lady Chatterley's Lover. The trial took place over six days, in No 1 court of the Old Bailey, between 20 October and 2 November 1960 with Mervyn Griffith-Jones prosecuting, Gerald Gardiner counsel for the defence and Laurence Byrne presiding. The trial was a test case of the defence of public good provision under section 4 of the Act which was defined as a work \\"in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or of other objects of general concern\\". The jury found for the defendant in a result that ushered in the liberalisation of publishing, and which some saw as the beginning of the permissive society in Britain. Legislative and legal background The Obscene Publications Bill was first put before the UK Parliament in 1955 as a private member's bill on the recommendation of the Herbert CommitteeAt the instigation of the Society of Authors. Penguin had previously run the risk of prosecution for obscene libel with the publication of Germinal and The Decameron, . See in response to what was seen as the failure of the existing common law offence of obscene libel. The Bill‚Äôs sponsor Roy Jenkins cited five prosecutions in 1954 which highlighted the uncertainty of the law on obscenity and that the basis of the existing law, R v Hicklin, had the effect of a stringent literary censorship. Consequently, the resultant Act made specific provision for a defence of public good, broadly defined as a work of artistic or scientific merit, intended to exclude literature from the scope of the law while still permitting the prosecution of pornography or such works which would under section 2 of the Act ‚Äùtend to deprave and corrupt persons likely to read it‚Äù. The Act also required the court to consider the work as a whole, put a time limit on prosecutions, provided booksellers with a defence of innocent dissemination, gave publishers a right of defence against a destruction order, provided the right of appeal, and limited the penalty of conviction. The Act came into force on 30 August 1959. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Sir Theobald Mathew, made submission to the Bill's Commons Select Committee on 27 May 1957 that his office would \\"take into account the existing reputation of the author, the publisher, the printer\\" before deciding on prosecution. Roy Jenkins wrote to The Spectator on 26 August 1960 that the DPP's decision to indict Penguin was a misapplication of the law. Publication history Lawrence‚Äôs novel had been the subject of three drafts before the final unexpurgated typewritten transcript was submitted to the Florentine printers on 9 March 1928 with the intention of publishing a private limited edition of 1000 copies. Martin Secker refused to publish the work in this form,Michael Squires in D. H. Lawrence: Lady Chatterley's Lover and A Propos of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. xxviii-xxxv forcing Lawrence to publish the first edition of the final version himself without copyright protection in July 1928. That August US customs confiscated imported copies of this edition, as indeed did Scotland Yard. Although The First Lady Chatterley published by the Dial Press in 1944 was declared obscene by a US court (overruled several months later), it took until 21 July 1959 for a US court to rule that the first authorised unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover (published by Grove) was not obscene. On 16 August 1960, Penguin published the first unexpurgated English edition of Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover. On 18 March 1960 the Chief Constable of Peterborough wrote to the DPP seeking advice regarding the imminent publication of the book, though there was no evidence of publication at this time. On 16 August Penguin presented 15 copies to D.I. Monahan; legal proceedings were instituted, and a summons was issued on 25 August at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. Trial =Counsels' opening addresses= Prosecuting, Mervyn Griffith-Jones began by urging the jury to decide if the book was obscene under section 2 of the Act and if so whether its literary merit provided for a 'public good' under section 4, and that they must judge the book as a whole. Inviting them to consider as a test of whether it would deprave or corrupt he asked \\"Would you approve of your young sons, young daughters‚Äîbecause girls can read as well as boys‚Äîreading this book? Is it a book you would have lying around your own house? Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?\\" This last question was the cause of some amusement in the court, and as a signal of how out of touch the establishment were with everyday life has echoed in popular culture since.Robertson in He also conceded that Lawrence was a writer of stature and that the book may have had some literary value but the obscenity of its language, its recommendation of what appears to be adulterous promiscuity and that the plot is mere padding for descriptions of sexual intercourse outweighed any such defence. Gerald Gardiner outlined the case for the defence: that the book was not obscene under section 2 as it would not deprave or corrupt anyone, and that due to Lawrence‚Äôs status the work satisfied section 4. That \\"Lawrence‚Äôs message, as you have heard, was that the society of his day in England was sick, he thought, and the sickness from which it was suffering was the result of the machine age, the 'bitch-goddess Success', the importance that everybody attached to money, and the degree to which the mind had been stressed at the expense of the body; and that what we ought to do was to re-establish personal relationships, the greatest of which was the relationship between a man and a woman in love, in which there was no shame and nothing wrong, nothing unclean, nothing which anybody was not entitled to discuss.\\" Therefore, the descriptions of sex were necessary and appropriate. The defence then called 35 witnesses to testify to the artistic, sociological and moral value of the book. The prosecution called two witnesses; DI Monahan and Stephen Webb from the Board of Trade. =Bishop of Woolwich= The defence called Dr John Robinson, the Bishop of Woolwich, to elicit \\"[w]hat, if any, are the ethical merits of this book?\\" After objection from the prosecution on the relevance of this testimony the judge agreed it satisfied the \\"other objects\\" criterion of subsection 2 section 4 of the Act. Robinson said that while Lawrence‚Äôs view was not Christian his intention \\"is to portray the sex relationship as something essentially sacred.\\" He continued \\"...as in a real sense a holy communion. For him flesh was completely sacramental of spirit. His descriptions of sexual relations cannot be taken out of the context of his whole, to me, quite astonishing sensitivity to the beauty and value of all organic relationships.\\" Pressed by Griffith-Jones on whether the book had any instructional value the Bishop admitted it did not but, asked by Gardiner if it were a book Christians ought to view, Robinson said \\"yes\\", over the objection of the prosecution that it was for the jury to decide if its publication was justified. Nevertheless, the Bishop‚Äôs statement led to the newspaper headline \\"A BOOK ALL CHRISTIANS SHOULD READ\\". =Richard Hoggart= In testimony that was later seen to have had a deciding influence on the trial the sociologist and lecturer in English Literature Richard Hoggart was called to testify to the literary value of Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover. In a detailed textual analysis of the book under defence examination, Hoggart was asked about the purpose of the obscene words in the book: \\"[t]he first effect, when I first read it was some shock, because they don‚Äôt go into polite literature normally. Then as one read further on one found the words lost that shock. They were being progressively purified as they were used. We have no word in English for this act which is not either a long abstraction or an evasive euphemism, and we are constantly running away from it, or dissolving into dots, at a passage like that. He wanted to say, 'This is what one does. In a simple, ordinary way, one fucks,' with no sniggering or dirt.\\" Cross-examining for the prosecution, Griffith-Jones pursued Hoggart's previous description of the book as \\"highly virtuous if not puritanical\\". \\"I thought I had lived my life under a misapprehension as to the meaning of the word 'puritanical'. Will you please help me?\\" \\"Yes, many people do live their lives under a misapprehension of the meaning of the word 'puritanical'. This is the way in which language decays. In England today and for a long time the word 'puritanical' has been extended to mean somebody who is against anything which is pleasurable, particularly sex. The proper meaning of it, to a literary man or to a linguist, is somebody who belongs to the tradition of British Puritanism generally, and the distinguishing feature of that is an intense sense of responsibility for one‚Äôs conscience. In this sense the book is puritanical.\\" =Legal argument and ruling= During examination of James Hemming the question was submitted by Gardiner whether reference to other books was permissible as evidence with respect to the author‚Äôs intention and particularly the production of other books to show by way of comparison what the climate of literature was and how well the authorial intention was carried out; further, that the 1959 Act had changed the law regarding judging the work as a whole and whether the Act required proof of criminal intent. Gardiner‚Äôs contention was that intent to deprave and corrupt was a rebuttable one and hence evidence can be called to prove there was no intent to deprave. In reply, Griffith-Jones cited R v Montalk 1932 that \\"the offence of uttering and publishing an obscene libel [...] is established as soon as the Prosecution has proved the publication and obscenity of the matter charged, and a jury should not be directed that, beyond this, they must find an intent to corrupt public morals.'\\" Gardiner countered that while he accepted the prosecution's argument in R v Montalk that intent to corrupt public morals is inferred from the act of publication, that presumption is itself a matter of fact and rebuttable. The judge gave his opinion that the defence was not justified in calling evidence to prove that there was no intent to deprave and corrupt, that defence could not produce other books with respect to evidence of the present book's obscenity rather than literary merit and that expert testimony could not be called as to the public good of the work which was a matter for the jury. =Closing statements= In a lengthy speech, which has been praised for its 'forensic advocacy',Robertson in Gardiner began by recapitulating the testimony of the defence witnesses, after which he went on to examine the tactics of the prosecution: \\"In answer to what these witnesses have said, hardly any question has been put to them by the prosecution about the book as a whole. The technique has been just as it used to be before the Act: to read out particular passages and say \\"Now do you call that moral?\\", or \\"Do you think that is a good bit of writing?\\" The one thing which this Act has made plain is that in future, in fairness to the author, the book must be judged as a whole.\\" In reference to the desirability of publication Gardiner invited the jury to consider that, \\"In my submission to you the defendants have shown, on the balance of probabilities, that it would be for the public good that this book should be generally available. I say on the balance of probabilities because ... where the prosecution has to establish something in a criminal case the burden which rests on them is to satisfy a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; where the defence have to discharge some burden of proof it is a lesser burden, it is the burden of satisfying a jury on a mere balance of probabilities.\\" And in referring to the judge's ruling on the admissibility of other books for comparison Gardiner simply entreated the jury: \\"All you can do is to judge it as a whole in the existing climate of literature and with your own knowledge of human life\\" In his closing remarks Griffith-Jones examined the definition of obscenity and the change of its wording in law: \\"It is true that the old definition is now altered, and the words 'those whose minds are open to such influences', are changed to 'those who may in all the circumstances read the book'. You may think that place rather a less burden upon the prosecution than hitherto, that it rather widens the scope of this Act than otherwise, for now, irrespective of whether the person reading the book is one of a rather dull or perhaps retarded or stupid intellect, one whose mind may be open to such influences, there is not any such restricted class. It is anyone who may read the book in all the circumstances.\\" With respect to the moral character of the book he observed: \\"It is said that this book condemns promiscuity. Does it? [...] But it does [condone promiscuity], doesn't it? The earlier sexual experiences of both parties, then Michaelis, then Mellors ‚Äì it is said that this is only showing how perfect sexual intercourse can lead to ultimate happiness. Members of the jury, the short answer to that view of the matter is this, which I think I put to one witness: what is there in the book to suggest that if the sexual intercourse between lady Chatterley and Mellors had not eventually turned out to be successful she would not have gone on and on and on elsewhere until she did find it?\\" In a point not raised in cross-examination Griffith-Jones asked the jury to consider the passage of the novel on p. 258 which suggested heterosexual buggery, then a criminal act in England and Wales, which (though Griffith- Jones didn't belabour the point), had it been examined more closely, might have been damning to the defence case that the book was not obscene. After three hours of deliberation the jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty. Legal and cultural consequences Lord Teviot moved for the Second Macmillan ministry to ban all such publications on 14 December 1960; peers exchanged 18,770 words but voted down his motion on an aye/noe (spoken) vote. An aye vote would have needed Commons backing to make legal change. Richard Hoggart in his autobiography wrote of the trial: \\"It has been entered on the agreed if conventional list of literary judgements as the moment at which the confused mesh of British attitudes to class, to literature, to the intellectual life, and to censorship, publicly clashed as rarely before ‚Äì to the confusion of more conservative attitudes. On the far side of that watershed and largely as a consequence, the favoured story continues, we had the Permissive Society. All of which is excessive and over-simple, but has some truth.\\" Philip Larkin referred to the trial in his 1974 poem Annus Mirabilis: See also * The Chatterley Affair * Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt * Oz trial * Penguin Group (USA) Inc. v.

It runs from Radolfzell via Stockach to Mengen. The line was built as a mainline connection from Ulm via Lake Constance (Bodensee) to Switzerland. Regular passenger services were abandoned between 1972 and 1982. Passenger services were reactivated on the southern section between Radolfzell and Stockach in 1996 and has since been operated under the brand name of Seeh√§sle. The northern section from Stockach to Mengen is however only used for freight trains and passenger excursion trains. In 2005, it had to be temporarily closed because of the deterioration of the infrastructure on some sections. Description of line and route The brand name Seeh√§sle is based on the brand name Seehas (named after a mythical \\"lake hare\\"), which is used for the S-Bahn-like services of the former Mittelthurgau-Bahn (now operated by THURBO, a subsidiary of the Swiss Federal Railways) in the Konstanz district on the line between Konstanz and Engen. The original name of the line as the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway (Hegau-Ablachtal-Bahn) is still common, as the line runs through the Hegau, running from the vicinity of Schwackenreute parallel with the Ablach river to Mengen. In Stahringen, the Lake Constance Belt Railway (Bodenseeg√ºrtelbahn) branches from the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway to Lindau. History On 2 September 1859, an international meeting of delegates from the region between the Alps, Lake Constance and the Black Forest adopted a proposal for the construction of a railway line between Ulm, Lake Constance and the Black Forest. Railway committees were established in all the cities on the planned route. These committees planned a new line from Ulm via Ehingen, Riedlingen, Mengen, Me√ükirch, Stockach, Radolfzell, Singen, Schaffhausen, Waldshut and S√§ckingen to Basel and a branch from Me√ükirch via Tuttlingen and Donaueschingen to Freiburg and beyond via the Rhine and the Vosges as far as Chaumont. They considered this route of great importance because it would be part of the shortest route between Vienna and Paris and would also gain importance as part of the shortest route from Berlin and Milan, running via Leipzig, Nuremberg, Ulm, Radolfzell, Schaffhausen and Zurich. In 1866, the loose German Confederation collapsed, but the sovereign states of the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg signed trilateral treaties to promote the \\"transnational\\" rail project and its passage through the Prussian Hohenzollern Province. These treaties permitted, among other projects, the construction of the T√ºbingen‚ÄìSigmaringen railway, the Ulm‚ÄìSigmaringen railway and the Radolfzell‚ÄìMengen/Sigmaringen and Schwackereute‚ÄìAltshausen lines. The lines would connect the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway and the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways at Sigmaringen, Mengen and Pfullendorf. The two southern states committed to the precise routed planned so that their lines could attract as much through traffic as possible. W√ºrttemberg began the construction from Ulm to Mengen, while Baden delayed its part of the project. =Construction of the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway = The construction of the Hegau-Ablach Valley between 1865 and 1873 by the Baden State Railways was preceded by consideration of the route by regional planning bodies and the local railway committees. The Hegau-Ablach Valley was built in several sections and opened as follows. The Radolfzell‚ÄìMe√ükirch section was built between 1866 and 1870. The embankment was designed for a two-track line, as were the stone abutments of the bridges, which can still be seen in the two main bridges between M√ºhlingen and Zizenhausen. However, it has never had more than one track north of Stahringen. The first section from Radolfzell to Stahringen and Stockach was opened on 20 July 1867.According to another source 10 July 1867 It was followed by the opening of the Stockach‚ÄìSchwackenreute‚ÄìMe√ükirch section on 3 February 1870. The continuation of the line between Me√ükirch and Mengen needed to cross the Prussian Hohenzollern Province. Prussia did not seek to build its own railway in southern Germany but wished to see the two main cities of the province connected to the rail network of the neighbouring countries. In authorising the passage of the line through the Hohenzollern district of Krauchenwies, Prussia introduced the condition that Baden would have to build a branch line from Krauchenwies to Sigmaringen. Thus, the two lines, Me√ükirch‚ÄìMengen and Krauchenwies‚ÄìSigmaringen, were then built at the expense of Baden in 1873. The two lines ran parallel to each other from Krauchenwies station through the royal park. In the park the remnants of the rail sidings and piers of the Ablach bridge mark the formerly double-track line. Further away, in the vicinity of the modern lakeside resort of Steidlesee, the Krauchenwies‚ÄìSigmaringen line branched off to the north. On 6 September 1873, the section from Me√ükirch via Krauchenwies to Mengen was opened together with the line from Krauchenwies to Sigmaringen. Prussia also achieved a connection of the railways of neighbouring countries to the Hohenzollern Province in Hechingen without having to build its own rail network. There was local resistance to the construction of branch lines from Me√ükirch to Pfullendorf and from Me√ükirch to Tuttlingen, although the route of the latter line had already been marked out. The engineer Robert Gerwig, who had designed the Black Forest Railway and the line from Radolfzell to Me√ükirch, moved the planned railway junction at Me√ükirch to a green fields site near Schwackereute. Schwackereute station was designed on a large site as a crossing station. So the Baden State Railways opened a connection from Schwackereute to Pfullendorf (the western part of the Altshausen‚ÄìSchwackenreute railway) on 11 August 1873. A fork was also projected to the Black Forest to the west of Schwackereute, bypassing Tuttlingen to a junction with the Black Forest Railway in Hattingen. The plan was not executed but instead W√ºrttemberg built the Danube Valley Railway (see Ulm‚ÄìSigmaringen railway and Tuttlingen‚ÄìInzigkofen railway) from Mengen via Sigmaringen and Tuttlingen to Immendingen. The regional function of the line was fulfilled only in part‚Äìno trains ran on the Ulm‚ÄìRadolfzell route. On 1 November 1873, a fast pair of trains was introduced, requiring 100 minutes to run from Radolfzell via Mengen to Ulm, but in 1875 it was abandoned for lack of profitability as there was little demand. In 1879, the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway was downgraded to a branch line. The whole line was now served by local trains, which stopped at all stations.According to Matthias Lieb of Verkehrsclub Deutschland in Stuttgart in =The line and the Second World War= In the Second World War the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway was involved in the war effort. From the summer of 1944, it had become apparent that the Allies had air supremacy in the south of the country. Low-flying air raids, unscathed by the barely functioning German air defences, targeted military and transport infrastructure. On 24 July 1944, fighter-bombers attacked a freight train loaded with cattle between Bichtlingen and Me√ükirch and a farmer and livestock trader and businessman from Messkirch was killed. With progressive loss of air superiority during the day it was soon not possible to operate on the line. In early 1945, a train was fired on between Stockach and Schwackereute. Two 17 years boys aged were killed by machine-gun fire in the course on the way home from √úberlingen. On 22 February 1945, shortly before the end of the war, seven American Mosquito fighter-bombers attacked the major stations along the Singen‚ÄìMengen‚ÄìUlm line, as part of the Allied Operation Clarion, intending to make the line unusable through targeted attacks. They also targeted Singen, Stockach and Mengen. In Me√ükirch fighter bombers fired on the station, a freight train and a shunting locomotive. =Between closure and preservation= The route was closed by Deutsche Bundesbahn in stages, passenger traffic on the Krauchenwies‚ÄìMengen section were closed on 13 December 1954, all traffic ended on 1 September 1960 and this section of line was then dismantled. Here, the rails were removed from the Krauchenwies station premises to the connection with the siding to Dillmannschen sawmill near Mengen. The passenger services on the line between Me√ükirch and Krauchenwies were closed on 1 June 1969. Not even three years later, on 28 May 1972, passenger services on the Stockach‚ÄìMe√ükirch section were closed. Ten years later, on 25 September 1982,According to another source, 26 September 1982 this was followed by the closure of the southern section from Stockach to Radolfzell. Krauchenwies station Bridge over the Ablach in the royal park in Krauchenwies On 29 September 1986, at the initiative of the Tegometall company, the Krauchenwies‚ÄìMengen section was returned to service after it had been rebuilt with state subsidies for freight. A siding, which was about 900 meters long, was built south of Ablacher Stra√üe to the company‚Äôs works. After the construction of two railway crossings on federal highway 311 and state highway 456 and the bridge over the Andelsbach, the line was ready for freight operations. The track from the Tegometall works to Mengen was officially classed as a\\"siding of Mengen station‚Äù, as on the same day, 29 September 1986, freight traffic was abandoned on the Me√ükirch‚ÄìKrauchenwies line.According to other information the Krauchenwies‚ÄìMengen line was decommissioned in 1960 and subsequently dismantled; it was reopened on 1 October after the laying of new tracks. At the same time the Me√ükirch‚ÄìKrauchenwies was closed and the tracks were later removed. see The line was formally closed on 1 March 1987, but it was reopened for freight traffic on 28 May 1989. As a result of rail reform and regionalisation of the railways in the 1990s, there was a renaissance of rail transport, which also benefited the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway. On 8 September 1996, the abandoned section between Stockach and Radolfzell was reactivated for passengers and operated by the Mittelthurgaubahn. The district of Constance (Konstanz) rented the section between Stahringen and Stockach from Deutsche Bahn, which let it fundamentally reorganise it. =Operations between Radolfzell and Stockach, 1996‚Äì2006 = NE 81 set in the depot of the HzL in Immendingen Following the reactivation of the regional rail services in 1996, the Seeh√§sle services were operated by Mittelthurgaubahn using three prototypes of class GTW 2/6 diesel multiple units of Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail (Bm 596 671‚Äì673). From 2005, two additional converted control cars were used because of the large demand for school transport. After the liquidation of Mittelthurgaubahn in 2003, the operation was taken over by EuroTHURBO, which in turn was incorporated as part of the German SBB subsidiary SBB GmbH in 2005. Due to frequent breakdowns of the GTW sets, a variety of replacement vehicles were used from 2001: these included a MAN railbus set (class VT 98 + VS 98) of the Hochwald Railway, a RegioSprinter of the Rurtalbahn GmbH and Regio-Shuttles of the Hohenzollerische Landesbahn (HzL). From October 2005 all three of the GTW sets were out of operations; they were replaced by a MAN railbus set and three NE 81 sets (built by DUEWAG and Waggon Union) owned by Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn. It was only from 28 August 2006 that the two refurbished GTW were used again. Since the GTW prototypes could not be made permanently operational and SBB GmbH demanded funding for replacement vehicles, the agreement between the district of Constance and SBB GmbH was terminated at the end of 2006. The GTW prototypes were sold through an intermediary to the Italian company Ferrovie del Sud Est.  Operations between Radolfzell and Stockach since 2006 Ringzug-Regio- Shuttle running as the Seeh√§sle service in Radolfzell station The HzL won the contracts for operations for both the periods of 2006‚Äì2008 and of 2009‚Äì2023. Until 2008 three NE 81 sets formerly operated by Bodensee-Oberschwaben-Bahn were used as an interim solution. Since they have been replaced by new Regio- Shuttle diesel multiple units (and the NE 81 sets were transferred to S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft). Traffic is controlled from the HzL Ringzug (ring train) operations centre in Immendingen, where the railcars are also maintained. At peak times on weekdays services operate every half- hour between Radolfzell and Stockach. Outside the peaks and on weekends trains operate hourly, with convenient connections in Radolfzell towards Konstanz (Constance) and Singen, with generally poorer connections to the hourly services to Friedrichshafen. In November 2008, all level crossings in Stahringen and Wahlwies were rebuilt and adapted to modern standards.

It acts as a minor impediment to prevent accidental entrance to that area or situation and as a result enhances general safety. Barricade tape is also known as construction tape or barrier tape or in reference to the safety hazard involved as caution tape, warning tape, danger tape or hazard tape. When used by a police force, the tape is named police tape. The tape is often wrapped and affixed as a visual warning sign and demarcation, for instance against entering a dangerous area, such as an industrial or commercial building site, a roadworks construction site or the scene of an accidentCaution Tape or a crime (for crime scene preservation), or against handling inoperative machinery or appliances.  Description  Barricade tape is made with durable, resilient, tear-proof plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon. Different manufacturers offer different sizes and thicknesses of barricade tape. Barricade tape often has a bright background and pre-printed bold warning text. It is also possible to purchase plain barricade tape and write a custom message on it. However, care should be taken when using custom tape, as barricade tape designs may be required to comply with regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) regulations (when used for purposes subject to regulation by these organizations) in the USA.  Types  Police tape marking off a crime scene Barricade tape is used according to the color specifications set by OSHA and ANSI. Barricade tape may be use primarily as a safety precaution for various industries and procedures. ; Construction tape: This is used in construction zones to notify people about ongoing construction and that there are possible hazards within the demarcated area. Construction tape usually employs a yellow-black color combination and incorporates printed text, such as \\"Under Construction\\", \\"Caution\\", \\"Work Zone\\", and \\"Keep Out\\" (among others). This type of barrier tape is commonly found at the site of renovations, demolition, and minor repairs. ; Hazard tape:This is used in locations containing a substantial danger. Examples include electrocution hazards or areas within which there is a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. In some regions, the specific color combination indicates the type of threat. For example, yellow- black tape may be used to signal the presence of a physical hazard (e.g., a hole), while magenta-yellow can denote a radiation hazard. This type of barrier tape is commonly used in laboratories, production areas, and industrial zones. ; Traffic control device tape:Barricade tape used by Madeira Civil Protection during the 2010 Madeira floods and mudslidesThis type of barrier tape, as its name implies is used to control traffic, whether foot traffic or vehicle traffic. Traffic control device tapes are used as temporary traffic signal to redirect traffic during parade or whenever a road is closed. These are usually brightly colored, either in solid orange or orange-white combination. ; Police tape or law enforcement tape: This type of barrier tape is used to isolate, protect and preserve a crime scene. Police tape is used to notify the public that an investigation is on going and that a particular area is restricted. This is usually seen with a yellow-white, yellow-black or blue- white color combination. ; Firefighter tape: This serves the same purpose as police tape and hazard tape. Firefighter tape is used to isolate a particular area during or after a fire to keep the public away from fire-related risks (e.g., smoke inhalation, airborne particulate matter, and damaged structures).  Foreground (tape) and background colours  The choice of colours of barricade tape depends on the contrast with its background, which in the case of the sky, can vary from black to white. To have a reasonable chance of being visible against most backgrounds, the tape needs a light colour (white or yellow) and a darker colour.  Requirements for barricade tape  The seven OSHA color combinations for barricade tape. Requirements for barricade tape vary according to the health and safety laws of the country or region it is being used in. = United States = OSHA and ANSI provide precise specification for barricade tape colors. These are found in OSHA regulations 1910.22 and 1910.144 and ANSI Z535.5-2007, Safety Tags and Barricade Tapes (for Temporary Hazards). However, the dimension, thickness, and materials of the barricade tape are left to the discretion of the manufacturer.  OSHA- specified barricade tape colors  # Red / white for Fire Prevention and Protection Equipment. # Black / white for Housekeeping and Aisle Marking # Magenta / yellow for Radiation Hazards # Green / white for Safety and First Aid # Blue / white for Defective Machinery # Orange / white for Traffic and Caution Warning # Black / yellow for Physical Hazards  ANSI-specified barricade tape colors  # Yellow/Black Barricade Tape serves as CAUTION and POTENTIAL HAZARD from: #* Excavation less than 1.2 meters (4 feet) in depth #* Identification of trip hazards and low hanging objects #* Material storage on site # Red Barrication Tape indicates DANGER and SERIOUS HAZARD from: #* Overhead work #* Live electrical components #* Scaffold under construction #* Around swing radius of equipment with a rotating superstructure # Magenta (Purple)/Yellow Tape denotes DANGER and POSSIBLE RADIATION EXPOSURE # Underground warning tape (custom) warns about: #* Digging underground gas- pipeline, electric cable and OFC cable installation #* Custom thickness and width are available #* Underground work #* Protection from overground work = United Kingdom = Red and white tape (top) or yellow and black tape (bottom) can both be used to mark hazards under UK health and safety regulations Health and safety regulations state that markings should be placed around obstacles or dangerous locations. This includes where any of the following present a risk: * people tripping or falling * objects falling * people or vehicles colliding with objects These markings should be made up of alternating red and white or yellow and black stripes of equal size at a 45 degree angle.

As of 2016 the service was shut down and the company placed into bankruptcy. The Israel-based company had very high expectations to compete with similarly-purposed rivals Vine and Instagram. but never managed to attain a reliable user base and was shut down in mid-2016.  Design  CEO and founder Moshe Hogeg said Mobli's goal is to ‚Äúmake it possible to see what is happening in the world through other people‚Äôs eyes.‚Äù Mobli's mobile app allows mobile sharing of photos and video recorded on mobile devices to its website where other users can view the content. Users can browse the websites content feeds in real time by location, subject, or uploader. Hogeg compared the service to Instagram saying, ‚ÄúIf the substance of Instagram is effects of pictures and shares, we want to offer the option of seeing what is happening at the Eiffel Tower or at Barcelona‚Äôs Camp Nou Stadium.‚Äù Mobli apps were initially built in HTML5 but this approach was abandoned due to poor performance. The apps were re-built in native code on iOS and Android while dropping support for BlackBerry in favor of Windows Phone. The new apps, also with a re-designed user experience, were slated to roll out in late 2012 starting with its Windows Phone app. A stand-alone search product that emphasizes location, time and relevance is slated to launch in early 2013. The product has an \\"autotagging\\" feature that can recognize and identify certain objects from images. Mobli's main revenue stream was on-site advertising.  History  Mobli was founded in 2010 by Moshe Hogeg, Oded Hogeg, and Emmanuel Merali. Moshe Hogeg was the chief executive officer, Yossi Shemesh was Vice President - Production and Emmanuel Merali was the chief technology officer. Francis Bea of Digital Trends said Mobli, which he called ‚Äú[potentially] the YouTube of short-form video,‚Äù could succeed in debuting the next generation of Internet personalities with YouTube ‚Äúbeginning to sway under the weight of its own hosted talent.‚Äù Mobli found early success in celebrity investors including American actor Leonardo DiCaprio who supposedly invested $4 million in 2011. It was later revealed that DiCaprio's investment was actually less than $10. DiCaprio's social involvement on the site attracted other celebrities. Mobli investor and board member Kenges Rakishev In May 2012, CEO Hogeg said the company was prioritizing increasing Mobli's installed base on mobile devices from three million to 10 million before focusing on turning a profit. Hogeg planned to experiment with money-making strategies such as selling virtual goods, promoting sponsored posts and displaying targeted advertising. Mobli partnered with Tropfest to host the festival's first Micro Film Festival contest, run by Mobli investor, actor Tobey Maguire, on Mobli's TropfestMicro channel, a channel Mobli calls ‚Äúa film festival in your pocket.‚Äù The contest, announced by Maguire in June at Tropfest Las Vegas, uses the designated Mobli channel as the hub for submitting and viewing short-form videos until deadline in January 2013. The best video, selected by panel, receives $10,000 in winnings and will debut at Tropfest Australia 2013. The Canyons used Mobli in July 2012 to cast the role of Caitlin, a role that went to Lauren Schacher who was one of 125 who submitted auditions using the platform. In July 2012, Mobli announced tennis player Serena Williams had invested an undisclosed amount in Mobli. In September 2012, Mobli was worth an estimated $100‚Äì300 million and Mobli said shared content had tripled over the previous two months. A series B venture round of funding to develop its platform and user base brought in $22 million including $20 million from Kazakhstani businessman Kenges Rakishev. Rakishev's funding earned him a spot on Mobli's board. In November 2012, a photo of cyclist and Mobli investor Lance Armstrong relaxing in his trophy room and posted to Mobli by Armstrong accumulated more than 320,000 views in two days making it the most trafficked Mobli post for a 48-hour period. By November 2012, Mobli had received two different acquisition offers. On November 6, 2013, Mobli announced that they raised 60 million dollars from Am√©rica M√≥vil the Latin American telco giant led by billionaire Carlos Slim. In June 2015, Mobli launched an image search engine named EyeIn.Catherine Shu, TechCrunch. ‚ÄúAfter Three Years In Development, Mobli Unveils Real-Time Image Search Engine EyeIn.‚Äù June 15, 2015.

Critical response Ashes to Ashes was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. Jonah Weiner of Rolling Stone gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying \\"On this mixtape ‚Äî too uneven to match the gruff grandeur of 2010's Teflon Don, but featuring some thunderous production by Lex Luger and Boi-1da ‚Äî Ross brags with such actorly gusto you don't really notice (or care) how little sense he makes: \\"I'm smokin' dope! I'm on my cellphone!\\" he roars on \\"9 Piece\\". That shouldn't sound impressive, but with Ross pitching it, it does.\\" Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 7.1 out of ten, saying \\"The tape moves from bangers to slick, more meditative tracks before returning to bangers, and it might work better if it were all bangers, all the time. Ross knows he's onto something with \\"B.M.F.\\", and he sounds more urgent and alive over churning minor-key trunk-slams than over just about everything else. But other than one godawful chorus from the Chester French chump, the whole thing comes off slick and professional‚Äîmore than enough to tide the world over in the brief period between Ross albums.\\" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the mixtape a five out of ten, saying \\"Obviously, it‚Äôs a bit silly to complain about free music, and while Ross feels like a bit player in his own game once again, it mostly works to this tape‚Äôs advantage because of his weaknesses on the mic. So Ashes to Ashes succeeds in its main goals of keeping Ross in the public eye and verifying his ear for production.

History  The nation's first nursing school based on Florence Nightingale's principles, the Training School for Nurses, opened at Bellevue in 1873. Sister Helen Bowdin of the All Saints Sisterhood in London was the first Superintendent. In 1952, the administration of the Bellevue Schools of Nursing and the Bellevue Hospital Nursing Service was split for the first time with Associate Directors. In 1954, the school moved to the new building that is Hunter-Bellevue's current location and enrolled in the National Student Nurses' Association. In 1967, an agreement with Hunter College was reached to transfer the Bellevue facilities to Hunter. In 1969, the final students in the diploma program were graduated. Hunter began educating nurses in 1943 and admitted the first enrollees in the Basic Collegiate Nursing Program leading to a Bachelor of Science (Nursing) degree in 1955 and to the graduate program leading to a Master of Science (Nursing) in 1961. The Hunter College Department of Nursing then expanded and moved to the facilities of the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing in 1969 as the latter program was absorbed by Hunter Department of Nursing. From June 1974 until it became independent again in 2008, Hunter-Bellevue Nursing School was part of the Division of the Schools of the Health Professions of Hunter College.

Built in 1914, it is a distinctive local example of Mediterranean Revival architecture, designed by New York architect Samuel Very. It was built for Emily Means, a nationally known horticulturalist. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Birch Island is a small island on the east side of Rutherford Island, which makes up the southernmost portion of the town of South Bristol. Birch Island is just northeast of the village of Christmas Cove, and is separated from the larger island by narrow channel, which is now spanned by a private bridge. The Emily Means House is set on the east side of Birch Island, overlooking Johns Bay. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of terra cotta tile finished in smooth stucco, and covered by a tile hip roof. The roof has extended eaves with exposed rafters. The ground floor on the eastern (water-facing) side consists of a terrace with an arcade of rounded arches. The main entrance, located on the north side, is also set in a round-arch opening. The interior of the house is in an austere and restrained version of the Colonial Revival, and retains significant original woodwork. The house was built in 1914 as a summer residence for Emily Means, a nationally known horticulturalist. It was designed for her by New York City architect Samuel R.T. Very, and is distinctive within the small community for its Mediterranean styling. Means had purchased Birch Island in 1900, and planted extensive rock gardens with exotic specimens on the island.

Porter was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm slow. He was born at Kensington in London. Porter made his debut for Suffolk County Cricket Club against Lincolnshire in the 1934 Minor Counties Championship. Prior to the start of World War II in 1939, Porter made 32 appearances for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship. Playing minor counties cricket for Suffolk allowed him to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, who he made his first-class debut for against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1935. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 195 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 38 runs by Jahangir Khan. Cambridge University then made 163 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by making 144 all out, with Porter being dismissed for 4 runs by James Grimshaw. Set a target of 177 for victory, Cambridge University reached their target with four wickets to spare. He made a second first-class appearance for the team in 1935 against Oxford University at the University Parks. Oxford University won the toss and elected to bat first, reaching 169/4. With the match heavily impacted by poor weather, this was the only innings possible during the match, which ended as a draw. Following World War II, Porter returned to play minor counties cricket for Suffolk, making an additional 21 appearances, the last of which came against Bedfordshire in 1949. He later served as the President of Suffolk County Cricket Club from 1967 to 1969. In September 1939, he married Barbara Mary, with the couple having five children. He died at Ealing, Middlesex, on 8 January 1982.

Contemporary Ahom chronicles described him as a good king and the people under him were happy and prosperous. He ruled for a long period of 49 years. The only trouble which was recorded during his reign was the raids of Tangsu Nagas, which was dealt with the use of force, but not without losses. Ancestry and accession Susenphaa was the eldest son of Ahom king Suphakphaa by a Tipam princess. His parents named him Tyaophasuphuk. After the death of his father, he ascended the throne in 1439 CE and was named as Susenphaa. Reign =Expedition against Tangsu Nagas= The Tangsu Nagas were conducting frequent raids on the people of Ahom kingdom, causing much harm to the lives and properties of the people. They also attacked neighbouring Naga tribes and inflicted heavy casualties. One of the Naga tribe, the Akhampa Nagas (also known as Akhampani Nagas) came to Susenphaa with a present of swords as a token of their submission. They complained Susenphaa about the atrocities committed by Tangsu Nagas and sought his help to defend them from these frequent raids of the Tangsu Nagas. Susenphaa immediately rallied his men and personally led an expedition against the strongholds of the Tangsu Nagas. The battle was fierce and bloody and the Ahoms lost one hundred and forty men, but, finally they managed to rout the Tangsu Nagas at the end. According to one account, the Ahoms almost lost the battle and was forced to retreat. Susenphaa himself was forced to flee from the battlefield in a litter, being so overcome with panic that he was purged as he sat there. In that moment of chaos, an Ahom officer, Banrukia Gohain, rallied the troops, attacked and defeated the Tangsu Nagas with heavy loss. The Ahoms destroyed the villages of Tangsu Nagas and forced them to submit. A victorious Susenphaa returned to the Capital. =Birth of Sankardev= It was during the reign of Susenphaa, Sankardev, the most revered and renowned Vaishanava reformer was born in Borduwa or Batadroba in Nagaon, in 1449 CE. He was the son of Kusumbar Bhuyan, who was a Bhuyan chieftain of the region. Death and legacy Susenphaa died in 1488 CE after a long reign of forty-nine years. The scanty references to his long reign in the Ahom Buranjis may perhaps be taken as proof that he was a good king and that under his rule the people were contended and prosperous.
