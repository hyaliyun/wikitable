Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  The history of censorship in Poland dates to the late 15th or the first half of the 16th century. The first recorded incident dates to the late 15th century in the Kingdom of Poland related to a complaint by Szwajpolt Fio≈Ç (a Franconian from Neustadt living in Krakow) against a Polish bishop who forbade a printer in Krak√≥w from printing liturgical books in Cyrillic script; Fio≈Ç lost the case and was sentenced to prison, becoming the first known victim of censorship in Poland. In 1519 sections of the book Chronica Polonorum by Maciej Miechowita, critical of the ruling Jagiellonian dynasty, were censored, making it in turn the first known Polish work to be subject to cuts by censors. A decree of king Zygmunt I Stary of 1523 has been called the first law about censorship in Poland. Together with a series of further edicts by Sigmismund August it prohibited the import and even reading of a number of books related to the Reformation. An edict of Stefan Batory of 1579 in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth introduced the idea of wartime censorship, prohibiting distributing information on military actions. In the 17th century Poland saw the publication and adoption of the first Polish editions of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1601, 1603, 1617), which among others banned the books of Erasmus of Rotterdam, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Copernicus, Stanis≈Çaw Sarnicki, Jan ≈Åaski, as well as some other satires (:pl:Literatura sowizdrzalska). Extensive internal censorship was also used by the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, as well as by other denominations in Poland, including the Protestant and the Orthodox Churches as well as by the Polish Jews. Outside the religious sphere, several royal decrees from the 17th century explicitly prohibited distribution of several texts, mainly those critical of the royalty; occasional regulations in this matter were also issued by the local municipal governments. The idea of freedom of speech was in general highly valued by the Polish nobility, and it was one of the key dimensions distinguishing the Commonwealth from the more restrictive absolute monarchies, common in contemporary Europe. Only the banning of books that attacked the Catholic faith was relatively uncontroversial, and attempts to ban other types of works often led to heated debates. In the last century or so of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the issue of censorship was therefore occasionally debated by Polish Sejm and regional sejmiks, usually with regards to individual works or authors, whom some deputies either defended or criticized. There were a number of lawsuits concerning individual books, and some titles were judged and sometimes doomed to be destroyed by burning. Since there was no overall law about the censorship, there were often disputes about jurisdiction in this matter between the bishops, the state officials and the Jagiellonian University. Some country-wide laws related to censorship would be eventually discussed and passed in the Sejm in the last years of the Commonwealth's existence. In particular, the Constitution of May 3, 1791, while it did not address the topics of freedom of press or censorship directly, it guaranteed the freedom of speech in its Article 11 of the \\"Cardinal and Inviolate Rights\\".  Partitions  Following the partitions of Poland, which ended the existence of the independent Polish state in 1795, censorship was in force on the annexed Polish lands, as the codes of occupying states generally contained severe censorship laws. Out of the three regimes, the Russian censorship was the harshest. During some periods, the censorship was so invasive that even the usage of words Poland or Polish was not allowed.  Second Polish Republic  Following Poland regaining independence in 1918, the cabinet of Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski who served as the first Prime Minister of the Second Polish Republic between November 1918 and January 1919 removed preventive censorship, abolishing a number of laws inherited from the partition period, and replacing them with ones more supportive of the freedom of press. New press laws were issued on 7 February 1919, introducing press regulation system and giving the government control over printing houses. In 1920 during the Polish-Soviet war, information about the war was required government's approval. The March Constitution of 1921 confirmed the freedom of speech, and explicitly abolished any preventive censorship and concession system. Following the May Coup of 1926 censorship targeting opposition press and publications intensified. In practice, Second Polish Republic has been described as having \\"mild censorship\\". The censorship was carried by the Ministry of Interior. Printing presses had to provide an advance copy to the Ministry, which could order the publication to be stopped. The publishers were allowed to dispute the Ministry decision in the courts. Newspapers were allowed to indicate that they were subject to censorship by publishing blank spaces. It was common for publishers to skirt the law, for example by delaying the sending of the first copy of a book to the Ministry, which meant that many controversial books were sold in the bookstores before the Ministry censors made their decision. The April Constitution of 1935 did not discuss the freedom of press issue, which has been seen as a step backwards in the issues related to censorship, and a Press Law decree of 1938 introduced a provision which allowed Ministry of Internal Affairs to prevent the distribution of foreign titles. 1939 saw the controversial arrest of a publisher and journalist Stanis≈Çaw Mackiewicz. In the Second Polish Republic, censorship was often employed \\"in defense of decency\\" against writers whose works were considered \\"immoral\\" or \\"disturbing the social order. Polish historian described the censorship of that time as \\"focused primarily on anarchists, leftists, and Communist sympathizers among the avant-garde writers\\". Polish writers whose works were censored included Antoni S≈Çonimski, Julian Tuwim, J√≥zef ≈Åobodowski, Bruno Jasie≈Ñski, Anatol Stern, Aleksander Wat, Tadeusz Peiper and . Film censorship (focused on ensuring decency) has been described as extensive, as the law prohibited not only pornographic films but also films showing content that \\"generally violates codes of morality and law\\", a formulation that has been used to justify a number of controversial decisions, and according to its critics, made the film censors equal in power to the film directors. The director of the Central Film Bureau within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, colonel , has been described as the \\"terror of the film- makers\\".  World War II  Following the Germany and Soviet occupation of Poland in 1939, the occupying powers once again introduced significant levels of censorship to Polish territories. The Germans prohibited publication of any regular Polish-language book, literary study or scholarly paper. Censorship at first targeted books that were considered to be \\"serious\\", including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote Polish patriotism; only fiction that was free of anti-German overtones was permitted. Banned literature included maps, atlases and English- and French-language publications, including dictionaries. Several non-public indexes of prohibited books were created, and over 1,500 Polish writers were declared \\"dangerous to the German state and culture\\". The index of banned authors included such Polish authors as Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S≈Çowacki, Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski, Boles≈Çaw Prus, Stefan ≈ªeromski, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski, Julian Tuwim, Kornel Makuszy≈Ñski, Leopold Staff, Eliza Orzeszkowa and Maria Konopnicka. Mere possession of such books was illegal and punishable by imprisonment. Door-to-door sale of books was banned, and bookstores‚Äîwhich required a license to operate‚Äîwere either emptied out or closed. The press was reduced from over 2,000 publications to a few dozen, all censored by the Germans.  People's Republic of Poland  Following the communist takeover of Poland, the ' (G≈Ç√≥wny UrzƒÖd Kontroli Prasy, Publikacji i Widowisk, GUKPiW) was established in the People's Republic of Poland on 5 July 1946 although it traced its origins to the organs established by the provisional Polish communist authorities in 1944. Censorship affected all forms of media: print, television, radio and all kinds of performances. All publications and spectacles had to receive prior approval from GUKPiW, and it also had the right to annul any media publishing or broadcasting licenses. The press laws were subject to major revisions in 1984 and 1989. Communist era censorship targeted topics associated with Soviet repression against Polish citizens, works critical of communism or labeled as subversive, and much of the contemporary √©migr√© literature. As elsewhere in the Soviet Bloc, the censorship was seen as enforcing the party line of the communist party. The controls were particularly severe during the early years of the communist period (i.e., during the Stalinist era in Poland). During that time, censorship meant not only policing content, as even refusal to print government-endorsed texts could have severe consequences, as evidenced by an incident in 1953 when the weekly Tygodnik Powszechny was temporarily closed and lost its printing house after it refused to print the obituary of Joseph Stalin. The censorship law was eliminated after the fall of communism in Poland, by the Polish Sejm on 11 April 1990 and the GUKPiW was closed two months later. The closing of the GUKPiW has been described as \\"the formal and legal fact of lifting censorship [in Poland]\\" and the year 1990 has been said to have seen the \\"definite elimination\\" of censorship in Poland.  Third Polish Republic  The freedom of the press is guaranteed in both the modern Constitution of Poland (1997) and in the revised press law. Another article of the Constitution explicitly prevents preventive censorship, although it does not prohibit post-publishing repressive censorship which in theory might be not incompatible with the modern Polish law. A plan for Internet censorship legislation that included the creation of a register of blocked web sites was abandoned by the Polish Government in early 2011, following protests and petitions opposing the proposal.\\"Security Question 2 in Country Report: Poland\\" , BSA Global Cloud Computing Scorecard, Business Software Alliance, 22 February 2012\\"Government stopped from preparing 'illegal' anti-internet piracy legislation\\", Polskie Radio, 2 March 2012\\"Polish Government Feels Urge to Regulate Internet\\", Marcin Sobczyk, Wall Street Journal, 16 March 2011 The 2018 amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance has been described by some historians and activists as censorship because it criminalizes certain statements regarding the extent of Polish responsibility for the Holocaust. On 24 May 2019, Poland filed an action for annulment of the European Union's Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market with the Court of Justice of the European Union. Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Konrad Szyma≈Ñski said the directive \\"may result in adopting regulations that are analogous to preventive censorship, which is forbidden not only in the Polish constitution but also in the EU treaties\\".  Bypassing censorship  To avoid censorship, throughout the periods that censorship affected the Polish writers, some authors turned to self-censorship, others attempted to cheat the system with metaphors and Aesopian language, and yet others had their works published by the Polish underground press.

As a colonel of the Royal Serbian Army, he was one of officers that staged the May Coup of 1903 against King Alexander I of Serbia. Early life and career Ma≈°in was the son of immigrants originally from Cerhenice in the Kingdom of Bohemia, who had settled in the Principality of Serbia in 1846, during the reign of Prince Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. His father, , was a skilled physician who worked at the Prince's court and always kept loyalty to the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. Despite this and thanks to his intelligence, Ma≈°in received protection, as a young officer, from King Milan I, from the rival Obrenoviƒá dynasty. He became aide-de-camp to the monarch. Thanks to the favor of Milan, his son King Alexander I sent him as plenipotentiary representative to the Principality of Montenegro in 1897. He participated as a military expert in the Serbian delegation sent to the Hague Convention of 1899. Ma≈°in was the brother of , first husband of Draga Ma≈°in, later Queen of Serbia by her marriage to King Alexander. Ma≈°in's relations with his sister-in-law, always bad, further deteriorated after her marriage to the sovereign in 1900, with Ma≈°in, then General Staff Colonel, passing into the reserve. The conspirators against the royal couple, led by Captain Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá Apis, chose him as leader of the assault against the Royal Palace. He chaired the meeting that decided the assault on the palace on . Participation in the May Coup On , according to plans finalized two days earlier by the conspirators, Ma≈°in spent the afternoon at the Officers' Club in Belgrade. Around midnight, after putting on his military uniform, he went to the headquarters of the 7th Regiment where he took command and led them to the Royal Palace. The regiment surrounded the palace and waited for the arrival of a regiment led by another conspiracy officer. General Lazar Petroviƒá, aide-de-camp to Alexander I, who tried to defend the royal couple and died in the attack on the palace. Ma≈°in waited outside the palace for the unsuccessful search for the royal couple in the old palace, and prevented the ploy of General Lazar Petroviƒá, aide-de-camp to the King, attempting to divert the attackers' attention to the new palace once they had not found the couple in the old palace. He participated in the second search of the palace that led to the discovery of the couple hidden in a secret chamber attached to the bedroom. At four in the morning he led the group of officers who received the Russian representative, who requested the removal of the bodies of the couple from the palace garden (present-day Pioneers Park). He ordered Lieutenant Vojislav Tankosiƒá to assassinate Queen Draga's two younger brothers. Both were executed by firing squad at their division headquarters. He also ordered the murder of Interior Minister Velja Todoroviƒá, who managed to survive, presumed dead. During the interval between the first and the second search for the royal couple, he ordered the capture of members of the government, to prevent the aid to the couple and ensure the success of the coup. Later career Immediately after the coup, Ma≈°in was one of the conspirators who became part of the new provisional government, as Minister of Construction. He opposed the proclamation of a republic, which some conspirators argued for. Between 1905 and 1906, he was acting Chief of the Serbian General Staff. He was one of the top 6 conspirators that the British demanded that they lose their public jobs to re-establish Serbia‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations. In May 1906 the Serbian government was willing to comply with British demands and Ma≈°in, among other military personnel, retired, which allowed the resumption of diplomatic relations between Serbia and the United Kingdom on the third anniversary of the May Coup .

The name translates as \\"ruins of Alexander [the Great],\\" which references a nearby village. Though the original name of the site is not known, the site is known for its Early Bronze Age settlement, which is millenia before the time of Alexander the Great. The site itself is an example of archaeological finds of the first known human cities and their rise, growth, and collapse. The site was known as a Canaanite settlement, during a time where human writing was first discovered. Picture of the site taken by photographer Bashar Tabbah. The site is located south of Madaba and east of the Dead Sea, on the banks of Wadi el Wala, a perennial river and important source of water for the upcoming urban settlements. It is a site on the famous ancient trade route called the \\"King's Highway.\\" The sites significance also lies in its role in the development of human societies from small groups of hunter-gatherers into more complex, stratified societies. The cite works closely with the American Center for Oriental Research (ACOR) in Amman, Jordan, as well as with Jordan's Department of Antiquities. The cite has been excavated nine time since 2016, also from 1982, 1984, 1987, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2010, and 2013.  Layout and Findings  Archaeologist Nelson Glueck is often seen as the first to authoritatively study the cite during the Early Bronze Age settlements. According to archaeologists at the Khirbat Iskandar dig, there was a transition to include non-urban societies, likely in the EB III/IV period, co- existing within and outside of a walled and gated city. In the walled city there is a gate, a corridor and steps, as well as stone benches. The site includes a courtyard, a storage room, and likely a kitchen. There is evidence of common rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens. Part of the city includes a tabun oven and adjacent grain-milling and cooking rooms that was probably used as a food-milling or cooking station. In the city there was a place where bronze knives and other tools were manufactured. A particular blade made of flint was manufactured, that was believed to be used in tandem with a sickle tool to cut and harvest grain. It is referred to sometimes as a \\"Canaanean blade.\\" The site is unique because partly due to its fortifications, many of which were periodically re-built, it was a relatively long-lasting and continuously inhabited city. However, archaeologists at Gannon University have mentioned that Khirbat Iskandar during the Early Bronze Age IV is example of interaction between semi-nomadic populations and more sedentary, agricultural communities. It was previously believed that the city became semi-nomadic because of the city being invaded and destroyed by other traveling nomads. This is likely not true. Archaeologist Suzanne Richard, a fellow at the American Center for Oriental Research (ACOR) in Amman, Jordan characterizes the EB IV period as one of a complex mix of post-urban, rural life, but also nomadism. She argues that a new reading of the EB IV settlements complicate the narrative about the fall of cities: namely, the continuity of urbanism in Syria, and its relationship with maritime trade in Egypt, in the post EB III period. According to the American Center for Oriental Research, the latest findings are quite embryonic and not fully developed, but they chart archaeologists on the path of the complicated history of semi-urban, semi-rural life in the EB III and IV eras. Their blog argues that the layout of the site \\"raises serious questions\\" about the reductive use of the term \\"pastoral-nomadism\\" to describe the final Early Bronze Age period. The blog also argues that \\"radiocarbon modeling techniques\\" of the cite raise questions about how archaeologists date and periodize the transition from the Early Bronze Age III to IV, and the complex bases of human economies within them. The floodplain of the site was believed to be destroyed, accounting for its decline at the end of the EB IV.

Black as she is often known, was a Canadian librarian and suffragist. Black was the president of the Ontario Library Association from 1917 to 1918 and was a member of the American Library Association.  Early life  Mary Johanna Louisa Black was born on April 1, 1879 in Uxbridge, Ontario to parents Fergus Black and Georgina Elizabeth Macdonald. Mary had four brothers. In September 1907, several years after the death of her mother, Mary and her father relocated to Fort William, Ontario to live with Mary's brother, Davidson William.  Career  Despite her lack of formal education, Black was appointed Chief Librarian of the Fort William Public Library in 1909. She was the first librarian there. When Black began working at the library, it was a single room in the City Hall basement. In 1912, with funding from the Carnegie Family, the Fort William Public Library opened the Carnegie Library, since renamed the Brodie Resource Library. As part of her work as Chief Librarian, Black organized the first mobile library collections in Ontario and was a proponent the rights of rural citizens to access public libraries. In 1913, Black became a councillor of the Ontario Library Association. Black later served as president of the Ontario Library Association from 1917 to 1918. She was the first woman to be appointed to that position. In 1918, Black was elected a school trustee. She was re- elected to the same position in 1920. Black supported Robert James Manion across party lines when he sough federal election in 1917 as a Unionist and in 1921 when Manion ran as a conservative. Black was a member of the American Library Association, which, at the time, represented both Canadian and American libraries. She held several positions there including being a member of the extension board, being the chair of the Small Libraries Round Table, and being the chair of the lending section. From 1918 to 1932, Black was actively involved with the Thunder Bay Historical Society. Her involvement included serving as secretary-treasurer and maintaining the archives. Black was the society's president from 1928 to 1932. Black, John Ridington, and George H. Locke were hired by the Carnegie corporation to form a commission of inquiry into the conditions of Canadian public libraries. Black toured Canada with her fellow commissioners, beginning in 1930, to investigate the libraries across the country. The commission concluded in 1933 with the publication of Libraries in Canada: A Study of Library Conditions and Needs. Black, along with Dr. Clara Todson and Anne J. Barrie, co-led the women's suffrage and reform movement in the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William, which were later almagameted into Thunder Bay. From 1916 to 1918, Black was the president of the Fort William branch of the Women's Canadian Club which she also founded. Black was also a member of the West Algoma Equal Suffrage Association and the Women's Business Club, the latter of which she was the president of in 1921. Black was also the district commissioner for the Girl Guides of Canada. Black was forced to retire from the Fort William Library in the spring of 1937 due to illness.  Death and legacy  Due to her ill health, in late 1938, Black relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia to stay with her brother, Norman F. Black. She died in Vancouver on January 4, 1939. In 1938, a branch of the Thunder Bay Public Library in Thunder Bay, Ontario was dedicated the Mary J. L. Black Library. The Mary J. L. Black Library was renovated in 2010 with estimated costs around four million dollars. In 2018, the Ontario Library Association posthumously recognized Black's achievements with a plaque at the Thunder Bay Public Library.

The color channels range within the wavelengths of 460‚Äì500 nm (blue), 520‚Äì560 nm (green), 580‚Äì620 nm (yellow-orange), 640-680 nm (orange-red), 700-740 nm (red) and 780‚Äì860 nm (near infrared). Films and filters can be variously combined. Nevertheless, all photos of all lenses have to be free of optical distortions and require an identical image scale regardless of their spectral range. In order to acquire the desired quality, the developers of Carl Zeiss Jena created a completely new lens type. Moreover, the camera moves in the flight's direction during exposure to compensate for the carrier satellite's or spacecraft's orbital movement and speed of approximately , which otherwise causes smearing and blurry images. Manufacture of the lenses was also very complex. Each of the lenses was framed separately and then clamped in a purpose-built lathe. The mounted lenses were centered in such a way that the axis of rotation of the machine and the optical axis of the lenses matched exactly. Thus, the lens frames could be reworked with highest accuracy and then arranged in tubes of precise interior diameter. Parallel to the MKF-6, a multispectral projector, the MSP-4 was developed. With it, several spectral images, on top of each other and under various filters can be projected on a screen or photographic film. The PKA precision copying machine was designed for image reproduction.  Operation  The geoscientific flight test program, developed by the Central Institute for Earth Physics (Zentralinstitut f√ºr Physik der Erde) took place aboard Soviet military aircraft. The MKF-6 was first used in September 1976 on board of Soyuz 22. The spacecraft was modified and equipped with a module that accommodated the camera. A completely revised version of the device, the MKF-6M, that could be remotely operated from the ground was introduced in 1978 and deployed at the Salyut programme of Salyut 6 and 7 and the MIR space station. A total of eleven MKF-6 cameras was produced. Beginning in September 1979 it was also installed in utility/agricultural aircraft, such as the Antonov An-2 for terrestrial surveys and recordings.  National significance  MKF-6 control panel For the various research institutes of East Germany, the MKF-6 project represented the first steps towards advanced scientific orbital and airborne remote sensing of the earth's surface, the assessment of water and soil quality, military reconnaissance, environmental and meteorological research, among many other fields. Eventually, as a division of the Interkosmos program of the socialist Comecon countries a department for Remote terrestrial sensing was established. Considered to be the best spectral camera of its time, the development and construction costs of the MKF-6 camera amounted to 82 million East German marks. The MKF-6 is still occasionally being used. Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Carl-Zeiss-Jena for the equipment of satellites and earth terminals began in the mid-1970s. Altogether around 100 devices, developed and produced in East Germany were utilized in space missions of the Interkosmos program and about 150 devices for ground stations.  Advanced scientific research  Achievements and experiences with the MKF-6 were applied to research and data analysis for further missions and the development of new devices. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was developed and used to study the atmosphere of Venus (Venera 15/16 missions in 1983). Device development and research participation in the 1986 Vega program (probes Vega 1 and Vega 2 for Venus and Comet Halley), in which all image data of Halley's Comet was recorded, processed and interpreted. Contributions to the planetary mission Mars 96, with the development of the Wide-Angle Optoelectronic Stereo Scanner (WAOSS). Participation in the 1988/89 Mars lunar Phobos program, which greatly exceeded GDR involvement in the Vega missions. The Central Institute for Cybernetics and Information Processes (Zentralinstitut f√ºr Kybernetik und Informationsprozesse) played a major role in the development of the Fregat Camera Complex. The Phobos mission failed due to premature probe failure as only very little data and images could be acquired, which, however were thoroughly studied and evaluated.

The council is responsible for providing leadership in the field of librarianship by regulating education for library and information science and its practice in Nigeria.  History In the formative years of librarianship in Nigeria, all staff within libraries were regarded and addressed as librarians irrespective of their educational backgrounds. The need to have professional body to define who is a librarian, regulate the affairs of librarians and librarianship in Nigeria led the \\"process to establish a regulatory body for the library and information science profession.\\" In 1975, a committee was set up by Nigerian Library Association leadership led by Mr. E. B. Bankole as Chairman during the Association's Annual Conference in Badagry, Lagos, Nigeria. The conference was presided over by Alhaji Abdullahi Haruna Ningi. In 1995, Decree 12 of 1995 establishing the Librarian Council Registration of Nigeria, was signed into law by the then-Head of State, General Sani Abacha. The council is charged with determining who is a librarian; determining what standards of knowledge and skills are required by persons seeking to become librarians, and then must be registered and addressed as registered librarians; maintaining a register of librarians; and maintaining discipline within the profession. The body was not inaugurated and/or funded to function when the then-Minister of Education Professor Babalola Borisade inaugurated the first LRCN Governing Council in May 2002. Dr. James Daniel the then-NLA President was elected as the Chairman and Dr. Victoria Okojie as the Acting Registrar. In July 2005, the Council successfully conducted the induction of the first batch of librarians (534). After the expiration of their tenure in 2005, the Council was not reconstituted by the government until October 2009. In 2009, the Federal Government appointed Victoria Okojie as the Acting Registrar for the second time, this time with a budgetary allocation. Beginning in 2016, Michael Afolabi was the Registrar. Over 5000 librarians have been certified by the Council since 2009.  Publications * LRCN Bulletin is a monthly publication of the Council. The first edition was published in March, 2011.

The song was released as a single from the band's third and final studio album, Special Beat Service, finding moderate chart success in Britain. Inspired by the romantic escapades of English tabloids and Wakeling's own personal relationships, the song featured a piano performance led by touring keyboardist Dave \\"Blockhead\\" Wright. As the album's third single, \\"I Confess\\" found moderate success on the charts, reaching number 54 in the UK. The song was praised by critics. A music video for the track was also produced, featuring the band's parody of the New Romantics. Background Lyrically, \\"I Confess\\" was a mix of Beat frontman Dave Wakeling's personal experiences and sensationalized stories that he had read in magazines. Wakeling had been a frequent reader of these magazines; he recalled, \\"At the same time, I had a bit of an obsession with what was called 'Photo Love' in England. They were those teen magazines where they had photographs with bubbles coming out of their mouths. Broken hearts and redemption, that sort of thing. I loved the cloying, hyper-driven emotion of them, and I'd had my photograph as a pin-up in a couple of them\\". Wakeling then connected his \\"own tawdry tales of young love\\" with a tabloid story about a man who \\"had been caught having sex with his new bride's sister on their wedding day\\". Musically, the song had originated from a riff composed by Beat touring keyboardist Dave \\"Blockhead\\" Wright. Wright had filled in for Beat saxophonist Saxa and introduced a piano part he had composed to Wakeling. Wakeling explained, Wakeling compared David Steele's bass part to Chic. Release and reception \\"I Confess\\" was released as the third single from Special Beat Service, with \\"Sole Salvation\\" on the B-side. The single reached number 54 in the UK. AllMusic's Stewart Mason pointed to the song's atypical lyrics and musical style as off-putting for some Beat fans, leading to a level of skepticism toward the song. In the US, the track went to number 34 on the Billboard Dance/Disco Top 80 chart. \\"I Confess\\" has seen positive critical reception since its release. Mason said of the track, \\"It's actually a startlingly well-constructed song, as well as one of the group's most unforgettable singles\\", while fellow AllMusic writer Jo-Ann Greene praised its \\"Joe Jackson-esque piano line\\". In a 1982 interview, Elvis Costello praised the song as \\"one of the most beautiful bits of singing I've heard all year\\". Wakeling had previously named Costello's \\"Secondary Modern\\" as one of his all- time top ten favorite songs. Music video The song's single release was accompanied by a music video. Wakeling recalled that the video satirized the \\"New Romantic\\" style that had been gaining in popularity during the early 1980s.

In 2020, Michael Gudinski (from Mushroom Group and Frontier Touring Company) wanted to provide an event which was positive and uplifting during the time of isolation. 9 days prior to Anzac Day, Michael Gudinski spoke with Jimmy Barnes and the Premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews about the concept of a concert to pay respects to the Anzacs and to recognise the work that is being done by those on the frontline in the medical community during the Covid-19 pandemic, whereby musician performed songs while in isolation and raising awareness for Support Act, RSLs and RSAs. The line-up of Australian and New Zealand artists performed a song from their homes, and it was then produced as a live concert and screened on Network 9 in Australia, Channel Three in New Zealand and YouTube internationally. The host for the evening was David Campbell and co-hosted by Christian O'Connell from Gold 104.3 and Australian musicians Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian. Adrian Swift, Head of Content Production and Development at Network Nine said \\"Music from the Home Front is a salute from Australia and New Zealand's music communities to everyone serving our nations under lockdown. From the military this Anzac Day to all those on the frontline fighting COVID-19 and those working to keep food delivered, shelves stacked and streets cleaned. And it's an opportunity for everyone watching to say thanks too just by texting us as we go to air this very different Anzac Day.\\"  Funds raised  Unlike the special projects that have come before it, Music from the Home Front is not a telethon. Gudinski told The Industry Observer \\"This is not contrived, we're going to dwell much more on the frontline workers and the Anzacs. The only fundraising element will be a commercial for Support Act and an ad for the frontline workers and hospital people. It's up to people to donate.\\" Reception Brodie Lancaster from The Guardian said \\"With a three-hour runtime and multiple montages... the energy of the event often threatened to dip into an inescapably sombre place\\" continuing with \\"It's understandably hard to have fun when the message is one of sacrifice and loss, but sensitivity and vitality can co-exist, as proved by a few performers who cracked through the downcast mood.\\" Lancaster said DMA's cover of \\"Better Be Home Soon\\" was a stand-out moment from the whole night. James Jennings from Sydney Morning Herald thought at times it veered a little too closely to a \\"Triple M Greatest Songs of All Time countdown\\" but the \\"decent smattering of newer artists' \\"freshened things up\\". Jennings said \\"As an event designed to lift spirits and remind us that we are all in this together, Music from the Home Front succeeds admirably. We may not have as many family members around us to faithfully belt out Australian classics such as 'When the War Is Over', as Jimmy Barnes and his brood do at the event's conclusion, but at least there are now new ways for us to feel a little less lonely while sitting around the living room wondering what‚Äôs next.\\"  Performers and set list  Reception  The concert was the most watched program of the night on Australia's free to air multi channels and subscription channels, and the fourth most watched program overall, peaking at 4.7 million viewers. Music from the Home Front On 29 May 2020, a live album from the concert was confirmed and scheduled for released on 19 June 2020 by Bloodlines. Michael Gudinski said \\"I am so proud of the results, humbled by the reaction to our incredible musical talent, and now so pleased to bring you this album to commemorate that special night.\\" 100% of profits from the release are going to Support Act - Australia's only charity delivering crisis relief services to artists, crew and music workers as a result of ill health, injury, a mental health problem. =Track listingCharts= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" +Chart performance for Music from the Home Front - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2020) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australian Albums (ARIA)  1 } =Release history= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Region ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" Catalogue - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australia / New Zealand  19 June 2020   rowspan=\\"2\\"  BLOOD75 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australia  4 September 2020  Limited, individually numbered 3√óLP  BLOODLP75 }  References  Category:Music festivals in Australia Category:Benefit concerts in Australia Category:2020 music festivals Category:2020 in Australian music Category:April 2020 events in Australia Category:April 2020 events in New Zealand Category:2020 in Australian television Category:2020 in New Zealand television Category:Benefit concerts Category:2020 albums ","title":"Music from the Home Front"},{"id":"64116197","text":"Dobrowoda founded by Archbishop Floriana Mokrski Florian Mokrski (Jelita Coat of arms) was born around 1305 and died on February 6, 1380 in Krak√≥w) and the son of Peter Mokrski.

He was a keen amateur sportsman, who played football for the Royal Engineers in the 1878 FA Cup Final. Family and education Bond was born at Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 10 August 1856, the eldest son of Revd. Frederick Hookey Bond (1821‚Äì1897) and his wife, Mary Isabella n√©e Delafosse (1833‚Äì1916). His father was the headmaster of Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School from 1853 to 1876. His paternal grandfather was Francis Godolphin Bond (1765‚Äì1839), who was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. With his parentage, Bond was originally intended for a career as a naval chaplain, before opting for a military career. Bond was baptised at St Mary the Virgin Church, Marlborough on 21 September 1856. Bond was educated initially at his father's school, before attending Marlborough College and then joining the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Football career Bond played rugby for Marlborough College, and both football and rugby while at the Royal Military Academy. On joining the Royal Engineers, Bond became a member of the Royal Engineers football team, although his football career was brief and was effectively terminated when he was posted to South Africa in 1879. At this time, the Royal Engineers were among the best football sides in England, having participated in the FA Cup since its inception in 1871‚Äì72, reaching three finals and winning the trophy in 1875. In the early stages of the 1877‚Äì78 FA Cup tournament, Bond (playing at inside-left) scored twice with goals against Oxford University in the 4th round replays on 27 February and 12 March 1878, thus helping the engineers into the semi-final. This was a straightforward 2‚Äì1 victory over Old Harrovians, setting up a final against the Wanderers, who had won the cup in the two previous seasons. In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 23 March 1878, the \\"Sappers\\" put up a hard fight, but were unable to prevent the Wanderers winning their third consecutive FA Cup with a final score of 3‚Äì1. After the final, Bond was praised for his \\"good service in the cup-ties, keeping well on the ball and rarely missing a shot\\". Military career Bond passed third in his class from the Royal Military Academy, and was commissioned as a (temporary) lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 2 August 1876, subsequently made permanent with retrospective effect from 2 February 1876. On leaving the School of Mechanical Engineering at Chatham in November 1878, Bond was selected for the Telegraph Troop at Aldershot. After a few months, however, Bond was sent to South Africa on 2 April 1879, arriving at the Cape on 13 May 1879 to participate in the Anglo- Zulu War. During the war, he was employed on lines of communication in Zululand and Natal in connection with the field telegraph and signalling, including creating and maintaining the Utrecht to Wakkerstroom telegraph line in the Transvaal. He remained in South Africa until 24 November 1879, arriving back in England on 27 January 1880. For his services during the Zulu War, Bond was awarded the South Africa Medal with clasp. On his return to England, he served at the Royal Engineers depot at Aldershot, spending May and June 1880 at the School of Musketry at Hythe, Kent, until 8 August 1882, when he was sent to Egypt to take part in the Egyptian Campaign. In Egypt, he was employed in connection with Field Telegraph under Maj-Gen. G. Graham and later in charge of Pioneers attached to HQ Staff of the Cavalry Division under General Drury-Lowe. He was present at the action of Kassassin on 28 August and at Tell el Kebir on 13 September 1882, and the subsequent march to and capture of Cairo. He was withdrawn from Egypt on 20 October 1882, and returned to Aldershot. His service in Egypt earned him the Egypt Medal with clasp and the Khedive's Star. After nine months at Aldershot, Bond was appointed adjutant of the Royal Engineer troops on 8 August 1883, retaining this post until 19 September 1887, having been promoted to captain on 2 February 1887.

From 12 March to 17 June 1891, Bond was Field Engineer in the 1st Brigade under Major-General W.K. Elles during the Hazara Expedition against the Black Mountain tribes. For his part in this expedition, Bond was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the India Service Medal with clasp. In January 1893, Bond returned to the U.K., spending ten months at Edinburgh and ten months at Aldershot, until November 1894 when he returned to India, where he spent the remainder of his active service, other than a year in South Africa. During this period at \\"home\\", Bond (as commander of a pontoon troop) earned the Humane Society's Medal for saving the life of a sapper, at Marlow on the River Thames, after Sapper Dudley had fallen into the river and become \\"hopelessly entangled in the weeds\\". > Capt. Bond, seeing the man struggling in the water, jumped in, and, at > considerable risk, succeeded in effecting his rescue. On his return to India, Bond re-joined the Bengal Sappers and Miners, being promoted to major with effect from 29 March 1895. In 1896, he became Superintendent of Instruction at Roorkee. Between December 1897 and February 1898, Bond commanded the 5th Brigade Bengal Sappers & Miners with the Peshawar column during the Tirah Expeditionary Force under Brig-Gen A.G. Hammond, followed by the operations in the Khyber Pass and Bazar Valley.

On 7 February 1911, Bond was promoted to Brigade Commander in charge of the Southern Brigade with HQ at Wellington, Madras, under Sir O'Moore Creagh. Bond retired on 10 August 1913, on reaching the age of 57, with the honorary rank of Brigadier-General. =Service during the First World War= Following the outbreak of the First World War, on 26 August 1914 Bond was recalled, and was appointed Assistant Director (Quartering) by his former colleague in India, General Sir John Cowans, now Quartermaster-General to the Forces.

Description  The gate is located in the northern/northeastern corner of the city walls and dates back to around 1126 CE when the Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf built the first walls of the city. It was originally known as Bab Fes (\\"Gate of Fes\\"), but this name was apparently lost during the Marinid era. The gate's current name (el-Khemis) refers to the souk or open-air market which historically took place here every Thursday (al- Khamis in Arabic). Nowadays, the market continues almost all week right outside the gate, while a permanent flea market, Souk al-Khemis, has been constructed a few hundred meters to the north. Also just outside the gate is a qubba (domed mausoleum) housing the tomb of a local marabout or Muslim saint. The gate's outer entrance is flanked on either side by square bastions. The gate's passage originally consisted of a bent entrance which effected a single 90-degree turn; one entered the gate from the north and then exited westwards into the city. According to legend, the door leaves of the gate were brought from Spain by a victorious Yusuf ibn Tashfin. During the Almohad period, the gatehouse was expanded such that its passage effected three more right-angle turns before exiting southwards. This gave it a similar form and layout to several other major Almohad gates such as Bab er-Rouah. The outline of the gate's original exit, now walled-up, can still be seen in its interior western wall. The gate underwent a significant renovation in 1803-04 on the orders of Sultan Moulay Slimane, noted by a marble inscription found inside. At some point in the 20th century, the inner wall of the passage was opened up to allow a straight passage directly through the gate in order to facilitate the heavy traffic in the area, resulting in the current form of the gate.

Kaufman and Moss Hart that follows the oscillating fortunes of a fictitious Broadway theater, the Alexandria, in the 30-year period between 1900 and 1930. The play's title has since entered the vernacular as a synonym for the theater.  Production history  In 1937, Moss Hart conceived the notion for The Fabulous Invalid after acquiring hundreds of back issues of Theatre magazine and immersing himself in the magazine's documentation of a vanished theatrical era. With his frequent collaborator George S. Kaufman, Hart began to develop an historical pageant that traced the evolution of the American theater from the 1700s to the present, potentially starring Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. (When told of the project, Lunt was reportedly most excited about the prospect of wearing blackface in a section devoted to minstrel shows.) Kaufman and Hart soon scotched the project due to structural issues; upon further research, they also discovered \\"that the early days of the American theatre were not permeated with much apparent romance and that the plays then produced were appallingly and incredibly dull.\\"\\"'The Fabulous Invalid,'\\" The New York Times 30 Oct. 1938. In the spring of 1938, the team revived the idea in a scaled- down form, deciding that it would follow the fortunes of a single Broadway theatre, the fictitious Alexandria, during the 30-year period between 1900 and 1930. Over the course of the play, the Alexandria devolves from a legitimate playhouse to a movie theater to a burlesque hall before it is climactically rescued from the wrecking ball by a young repertory company that resembles the Mercury Theatre.Atkinson, Brooks. \\"Moss Hart and George Kaufman Celebrate the Theatre in 'The Fabulous Invalid,' The New York Times 10 Oct. 1938. The passage of time in The Fabulous Invalid is illustrated by a Living Newspaper- style cavalcade of scenes from 26 plays and musicals, including Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1901) by Clyde Fitch, Little Johnny Jones (1904) by George M. Cohan, The Lion and the Mouse (1905) by Charles Klein, Within the Law (1912) by Bayard Veiller, Anna Christie (1921) by Eugene O'Neill, and What Price Glory? (1924) by Maxwell Anderson and Laurence Stallings; actors recreated the performances of legendary stage stars such as Ethel Barrymore, Minnie Maddern Fiske, and Elsie Janis.Meredith, Scott. George S.

Kaufman: His Life, His Theater. New York: Oxford University Press, 1979. 309. The Fabulous Invalid opened on Broadway on October 8, 1938 at the Broadhurst Theatre with a 73-person cast that included Richard Gordon, Doris Dalton, Stephen Courtleigh, Jack Norworth, and Ernest Lawford. The Washington Post deemed the play \\"too obvious to be affecting,\\" and while The New York Times' Brooks Atkinson praised Kaufman and Hart's ambition and the sumptuousness of the physical production, he ultimately dismissed it as \\"a ponderous show that reaffirms the commonplace.\\"Reed, Edward. \\"Two Lost Opportunities,\\" The Washington Post 5 Feb. 1939. The Fabulous Invalid closed on December 3, 1938 after 65 performances. The play has never been revived on Broadway, and Hart later described it as \\"unmourned and over-sentimental.\\" Chock full o'Nuts was mentioned disparagingly in the play, prompting the company to sue Kaufman and Hart for $24,500 in damages. The suit was dismissed, partly because Kaufman and Hart told the judge that they had previously satirized the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George V without incident. In 2003, a revised version of The Fabulous Invalid was produced at Emerson College; the playwright Jeffrey Hatcher reworked the text to encompass the 100-year history of Boston's Cutler Majestic Theatre, and the production featured Alice Ripley and Steve Hendrickson as two of the theater's \\"ghosts.\\" Legacy Kaufman and Hart coined the phrase \\"the fabulous invalid\\" to describe the resilience of the theater despite continual pronouncements of its demise. In 1940, The New York Times referred to it as \\"a fond phrase that will probably stick,\\" and the phrase has indeed entered the vernacular.\\"'Fabulous Invalid,'\\" The New York Times 21 Apr. 1940.Siegel, Ed. \\"A quick-witted gift for the Majestic's 100th,\\" The Boston Globe 19 Nov. 2003.

The more acclaimed version is the 1924 recording by The Wolverines, with Bix Beiderbecke. History Though it is attributed to Nick LaRocca and Larry Shields, of the Original Dixieland Jass Band, who first recorded it New York on June 25 1918 and released it on Victor 18564, George Gershwin's biographer Howard Pollack states that Gershwin once woke up at 3 am and penned the tune \\"Fidgety Feet\\". The Wolverines, with Bix Beiderbecke recorded it on 18 February 1924 and had a hit with it. Fletcher Henderson's orchestra recorded the tune on 19 March 1927, and it was released on July 7 of that year. Bud Freeman and The Summa Cum Laude Orchestra recorded the tune and \\"Big Boy\\", released it on a '78 named \\"Wolverine Jazz\\" in 1940. Benny Strickler & The Yerba Buena Jazz Band recorded it and released it as a single in 1950. It was also covered by the Kid Ory and His Creole Band and stride piano was introduced to it. Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith continued with a stride version backed by a Dixieland band which appeared on his 1957 album Intimate Jazz in Hi Fi. In 2011, the Berlin Hot Jazz Band, a German dixieland group, recorded it for their album Berlin Blues. Composition It begins in B-flat major and modulates to A-flat major. Beiderbecke biographer Jean Pierre Lion wrote that the 1918 original recording was \\"played at a jumpy tempo, sounds mechanical , and the trombone' s plaintive breaks are dated\\" . He approved more of the Wolverines recording which was recorded at a slower tempo, stating that it is more \\"relaxed and varied, breaks are more sophisticated, and Jimmy Hatwell's solo, using the lower register is deeply original. Lion states that Beiderbecke avoided repetition on the second time through the chorus inserting \\"some graceful melodic lines within a rich harmony\\".

The book was written around the year 1947‚Äì48 and published posthumously 20 years later. Plot summary The story describes the life of a 12-year-old girl, Champa, who is married to Ramakanta but being self-reliant, she could not stay her home and she runs away. Due to some disease, the husband cannot have physical contact with the girl. One day he decides to leave home because he fears that if he goes close to his \\"tempting\\" wife his life may be at risk. Due to this Champa is blamed by her in-laws. This novel has however no distinct ending. Themes, and critical reception The novel is unique among Devkota's works as the only one depicting contemporary social issues and roles of women in society. Set in Kathmandu during the Rana rule, it depicts a society firmly adhering to traditional gender roles, with men engaged in learning and travelling, and women, uneducated and limited to household chores and religious activities. Critic Bindu Sharma considers the novel's use of Freudian psychoanalytic theories to explore unequal relationships and conflict within family groundbreaking, and argues that it makes Devkota the first psychological novelist of Nepali literature. Sharma also considers it one of the most important novels of the early period of Nepali novel development (years 1936 ‚Äì 1960).  Publication history  According to the book's foreword, the manuscript released to the publishers by Nepal Bhasha Pratisthan had arrived with the title \\"Nepali Samajik Upanyas () on its cover. It was deemed unsuitable, and \\"Champa\\" was chosen as the novel's title for publication, in keeping with other works from Devkota many of which are named after the works' respective heroines. The first edition of the novel was published in 2024 BS (AD 1967‚Äì68). The second edition was published by Sajha Publications the following year. The third edition was published in 2029 BS, fourth in 2052 BS, fifth in 2055 BS, and the sixth edition was published in 2064 BS. The cover art for the book was done by Tekbir Mukhiya. =Translations= Champa was translated to Hindi by Dhurablal Sahani.

Each of them was a famous Muslim judge, scholar or Sufi saint (wali) venerated for their piety or other mystical attributes. Their tombs form the basis of a centuries-old annual pilgrimage, a ziyara, during which visitors pray at each of their tombs over the course of seven days.  Historical background  The tradition of the pilgrimage, or ziyara, to the tombs of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh was created on the initiative of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il (ruled 1672‚Äì1727) in the late 17th century. The motivation for this act was a political desire to exploit the popular influence of the zawiyas (Sufi brotherhood institutions) and to counter the popularity of the \\"Seven Saints\\" of the Regraga Berber tribe, which were the basis of another pilgrimage at Djebel al-Hadid near Essaouira at the time. There were also other examples of \\"Seven Saints\\" elsewhere in Morocco, including in Fes, which in turn may have had a precedent in the legend of the Seven Sleepers mentioned in the Qur'an. It may also have been significant that the \\"saints\\" selected for the new pilgrimage were mostly of Arab background, in opposition to the Berber saints of the Regraga-sponsored pilgrimage. Moulay Isma'il charged an influential religious figure called Abu 'Ali al-Hasan al- Yusi, a man of Berber origin who was familiar with the country's zawiyas, with instituting the pilgrimage in Marrakesh. The pilgrimage was ultimately beneficial to Marrakesh by enhancing the city's spiritual reputation (though the city was already home to the tombs of many other awliya) and attracting travelers to boost its economy. It became so well known that the \\"Seven Men\\" (Sab'atu Rijal) became another name for Marrakesh itself. Even later sultans like Muhammad ibn Abdallah who were known for being inclined to Wahhabism, a more puritan school of thought opposed to heterodox practices such as the veneration of saints, nonetheless patronized the zawiyas and tombs of the Seven Saints and expanded or restored their shrines. Today the practice is not as widely followed as it once was, but the tombs and zawiyas are nonetheless important shrines in the city. In 2005 the mayor of Marrakesh inaugurated a monument outside Bab Doukkala (the northeastern gate of the old city), known as Place des Septs Saints (Seven Saints' Square or Plaza), which commemorates the Seven Saints.  Description of the pilgrimage  alt= The pilgrimage takes place over most of a week, starting on Tuesday and ending on Monday. It also proceeds in a circular fashion around the city, starting in the southeast and finishing in the southwest, mimicking the counterclockwise direction of the circumambulation of the Kaaba in Mecca. Each day the pilgrims would stop and pray at a different tomb. The first stop was the tomb of Sidi Yusuf ibn 'Ali Sanhaji near Bab Aghmat (the southeastern gate of the city) on Tuesday. On Wednesday they entered the city and stopped at the tomb of Qadi 'Iyyad. On Thursday they exited the city via Bab Aylan and passed by Bab el-Khemis to visit the mausoleum of Sidi Bel Abbes as-Sabti (which was outside the city walls up until the 18th century). On Friday they moved to the mausoleum of Sidi Ben Sliman al-Jazuli, then to the tomb of Sidi Abd al-'Aziz at-Taba'a (a disciple of al-Jazuli) on Saturday, and then to the mausoleum of Sidi Abdallah al-Ghazwani (a disciple of at-Taba'a) on Sunday. Lastly, on Monday, they ended at the tomb of Sidi al-Suhayli near Bab er-Robb (the southwestern gate of the city).  The Seven Saints and their shrines  The Seven Saints of Marrakesh are listed below in chronological order of their deaths ‚Äî as opposed to the order in which their tombs are visited during the pilgrimage (see previous section). Note that there are many alternate spellings of the saints' names (due to varying transliterations of Arabic names). The name \\"Sidi\\" is an honorific common in the Maghreb. * Qadi 'Iyyad ibn Musa (also known as Qadi Ayyad), died 1149. He is buried in a mausoleum near Bab Aylan, one of the western gates of the old city. * Sidi al-Suhayli (also known as Imam al- Suhayli, also spelled al-Soheili or al-Souheili), died 1185. His tomb is located in the cemetery named after him, just outside Bab er-Robb, on the site of a former city gate known as Bab ash-Sharia. * Sidi Yusuf ibn 'Ali as- Sanhaji (also known as Sidi Youssef Ben Ali), died 1196. Hie is buried in a zawiya dedicated to him outside Bab Aghmat. * Sidi Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti (also known as Sidi Bel Abbes), died 1204. He is buried at the Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes in the northernmost neighbourhood of the medina. His tomb was one of the earliest major zawiyas to be popular in Marrakesh, generations before Sufi zawiyas became more generally influential. He was even venerated by the Jewish inhabitants of the city. * Sidi Ben Sliman al-Jazuli (also known as Sidi Ben Slimane or as al-Jazuli), died 1465. He was the only one of the seven saints who died outside Marrakesh and was initially buried elsewhere. His body was transferred from the village of Afoughal to Marrakesh by the Saadians in 1523‚Äì24. His tomb is found at his zawiya, located south of the zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes. * Sidi Abd al-'Aziz at-Taba'a (also known as Sidi Abdelaziz), died 1508. He is buried in his zawiya north of the Mouassine Mosque and south of the zawiya of al-Jazuli. * Sidi Abdallah al-Ghazwani (also known as al- Ghazwani or as Moulay Ksour), died 1528. He is buried in a zawiya just northwest of the Jemaa el-Fnaa. = Gallery = File:Marrakech,QadiAyyad.jpgThe tomb of Qadi 'Iyyad File:Marrakech,SidiSouheili.jpgThe mausoleum of al-Suhayli, located in a cemetery along the southwestern walls of the city, near Bab er-Robb File:Marrakech,SidiYusuf.jpgThe Zawiya of Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali, near Bab Aghmat File:Cour ext√©rieure de la Zaou√Øa de Sidi Bel Abb√®s.JPGThe central courtyard of the Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes.

Photographer: Hermann Schieberth Karl Schenker, (born Karol Schenker on 23 October 1886 in Sereth, Bukovina, Austro- Hungarian Empire; died 18 August 1954 in London) was an Austrian photographer, illustrator of fashion magazines and painter. The artist, who mainly worked in Berlin, was Jewish and had to emigrate from Germany to London in 1938 and received British citizenship in 1948. Karol Schenker was born on 23 October 1886 in Sereth (now Siret in Romania) the son of tax inspector Jakob Schenker and Rosa Schenker (n√©e Schleisberg). After the family moved to Lemberg (in the Austro-Hungarian part of the former Poland, now Ukraine), Schenker became a member of the Friends of Artistic Photography around 1900 and has regularly participated in the association's exhibitions from 1904. Karol Schenker exhibited his work at the International General Photography Exhibition for Amateur Photography in Krak√≥w at the age of 18. In the amateur photography category, he was awarded a silver medal.Miriam Halwani: Karl Schenkers Mond√§ne Bildwelten, hrsg. Museum Ludwig. S. 203‚Äì205. Early career It is believed that Schenker studied at the Technical University of Lemberg. Together with photographer Eduard Wasow he ran a photo studio in Munich for a few months in 1910 before moving to Berlin in 1911 and opening his own studio at Kurf√ºrstendamm 29. Karl Schenker also worked for Ullstein-Verlag, which regularly published photographs by him in its magazine \\"Die Dame\\". Around the same time, he was taking numerous portrait photographs for private individuals and artists. Karl Schenker regularly took part in national and international photography exhibitions, including the London Salon of Photography in 1913 and the Cologne Werkbund exhibition in 1914. In 1913, the Vienna-based photographers Madame d'Ora and Arthur Benda worked in his studio, with whom he visited Vienna in 1916. In the same year he started teaching in his studio and in the Berlin's Lette-Verein. His students included the Dutch photographer Richard Polak and Toni Arens-Tepe. On 16 March 1915 he married the Russian chemist Olga Labenskaja, whom he frequently portrayed in the following years. The couple went their separate ways after a few years. Post-WW1 Career Karl Schenker was one of the founding members of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner (GDL), founded in 1919. At this time his studio was located at Matth√§ikirchstra√üe 27 in Berlin W1. For the Ufa films Bismarck and Fridericius Rex, he made accompanying photo portfolios with portraits. In 1920 Schenker moved to a more comfortable studio at Kurf√ºrstendamm 6 (which was renamed the Budapester Stra√üe in 1925). His old studio was taken over by the painter Jeanne Mammen, who lived and worked here until the end of her life. At the beginning of the 1920s, Schenker took part in many renowned photography exhibitions, including the annual exhibitions of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner, the Berliner Photographie exhibition and the Deutsche Gewerbeschau in Munich. During this time he also portrayed Leni Riefenstahl, who was teaching at the Kurf√ºrstendamm in the Helene Grimm-Reiter dance school. The portrait appeared on the front page of the magazine \\"Uhu\\" on 1 October 1924. From 1922 to 1924, Eleonore Feininger, the daughter of Lyonel Feininger and Clara F√ºrst, worked as a student at Schenker's studio. One of his avant-garde activities was the creation of wax mannequins which he would then photograph.Johanna Thal: Mannequins oder Wachspuppen? In: ¬ªDie Dame¬´ 52, 23/1925, S. 6‚Äì9.Eckhardt K√ºhn: Inszenierte Mannequins oder Puppen. In: ¬ªFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung¬´, 2013, S. 4. Using wigs, false eyelashes. and his skills as a painter, Schenker elevated the art of the store dummy to new levels of refinement and verisimilitude. Some of these images ended up in \\"Die Dame\\" and have become a subject of interest in exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale. In 1923, Schenker met the Viennese Lilli Behrend, whom he married a short time later. During these years, Schenker concentrated on portrait and fashion photography. In 1925 the couple moved to New York and the photographer Mario von Bucovich took over Schenker's photo studio in Berlin. In America Karl Schenker mainly worked as a painter and draftsman reverting to his birth name Karol Schenker. At an exhibition dedicated to him in the Gainsborough Galleries, he showed a picture cycle that included portraits of Enrico Caruso, Giacomo Puccini and Gerhart Hauptmann, among others. Return and Exile In November 1930 the family returned to live in Berlin, with his studio at Aschaffenburger Stra√üe 9 from 1931‚Äì34. Schenker resumed work for the Ullstein publishing house. In addition to fashion photographs for the magazine \\"Die Dame\\", he also published again in the monthly magazine \\"Uhu\\". In addition, he was booked by department stores, including the Nathan Israel store and fashion journals, to create catalog and advertising shots. In 1932 he met Ruth Elisabeth Engel, who then worked as an employee in his studio. After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party, the Ullstein publishing house was \\"aryanized\\" and the magazine \\"Uhu\\" was discontinued in 1933. It was becoming increasingly difficult for Karl Schenker to make a living in Berlin. In the meantime, widowed, he had to travel to London to be able to marry Ruth Engel on 10 December 1936, as this was no longer possible in Germany for those classified as Jewish. On 15 February 1938 Karl Schenker was expelled from the German Reich for \\"improper conduct in public (road) traffic\\". The family emigrated to London, where he opened a photo studio on Regent Street for fashion, portrait and colour photography, retouching, drawing and advertising in 1938. Inge Ader worked as a trainee in his studio. His customers also included numerous celebrities in London, including the rally-driver Jacqueline Evans de Lopez and Australian Prime Minister John Curtin. On 30 September 1948 Karl Schenker was granted British citizenship. He died on 18 August 1954 at Putney Hospital in London's Borough of Wandsworth. Exhibitions There was an exhibition of Schenker's photographs of wax mannequins at the Pinacoteca Agnelli for the Venice Biennale in 2013. The Museum Ludwig in Cologne was able to buy around 100 photographs from the estate of photographer Hermann Koczyk from Oschatz in 2014 and dedicated a four-month retrospective to Karl Schenker in 2016.Master of Beauty.

SportsChannel televised the San Jose Lasers' opening game on Friday, October 25, 1996 and would televise their January 5 game against the Richmond Rage. =BET= BET initially would televise eight Saturday night games, starting with the New England Blizzard at the Columbus Quest on January 4, 1997 and ending with a playoff semifinal February 22. New England home games on January 25 and February 15 would also be shown during the 1996‚Äì97 season. Come the second year, the ABL's television package included 36 games combined on Fox Sports Net and BET. During 1997, the ABL averaged a 0.6 rating while rival league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) scored nearly a 2 rating on NBC. A rating point is equal to 980,000 TV households. Besides NBC's weekly game, ESPN and the Lifetime channel also each got a weekly WNBA game. That's a total weekly exposure of 130 million homes, more than double the 66 million the ABL reached on SportsChannel and BET. BET was scheduled to televise 12 games on Saturday nights. After broadcasting four games in December 1997, the remaining eight would be aired starting on January 4 and the following Saturdays through February. The ABL's revenue came solely from the BET. In comparison, the WNBA (as previously mentioned) boasted major television deals with NBC, ESPN, and the Lifetime cable network. BET would use the games to build a lead-in audience for reruns of 227. =Fox Sports Net= When league officials were negotiating with Fox Sports Net, it was in revision of a contract that the league signed with Fox Sports Net's forerunner, Prime Network. The ABL games were often broadcast on tape delay on BET and Fox Sports Net. All the while, the ABL had paid a fee to have two games of its championship series aired on CBS had the 1998‚Äì99 season been played in full and 16 games on Fox Sports Net, which at the time, comprised 22 regional sports cable channels, up to seven playoff games, including all of the best- of-5 ABL championship series. Fox Sports Net's primary broadcast team included Tracy Warren (play-by-play), Debbie Antonelli (color commentary), and Heather Cox (sideline reporter). Also utilized by Fox Sports Net were Ron Barr (play- by-play) and Debbie Gore (color commentary).

Town center after the explosion The Smederevo Fortress Explosion was a disaster that occurred in Smederevo, then in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia (part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia under German occupation, now in modern Serbia), on the 5 June 1941. Stockpiled ammunition and gasoline in Smederevo Fortress belonging to defeated Royal Yugoslav Army exploded due to unknown reasons. The number of casualties is also uncertain, estimates range from several hundreds to 2,500 killed. Background After the capitulation of the Yugoslavia in the April War, the Germans designated Smederevo as a place where captured equipment, weapons, ammunition and gasoline of the former Royal Yugoslav Army would be stored. From there it would be transferred to Germany, which was preparing to attack the USSR. Smederevo was connected by railway and is located on the Danube. The seized material was loaded by RYA prisoners. Explosion The day of the explosion was a market day and the inhabitants of the surrounding settlements came to the city to trade. School certificates were also being given to pupils that day. The explosion happened around 2:10 PM, at the time the train for Velika Plana was passing by the fortress which was transporting workers home. According to witness statements, shots were heard first (which could mean that ammunition was set on fire first), followed by a large explosion about two minutes later. The explosion created a crater 50 meters wide and 9 meters deep and destroyed most of Smederevo. Window glass was cracked in settlements around Smederevo, and the tremor was felt in Velika Plana, Bela Crkva, Vr≈°ac and Belgrade. Among the victims were Milan Nediƒá's son, daughter-in-law and grandson. For the reconstruction of the city, the Commissioner Government appointed Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, a lawyer from Smederevo and the president of Zbor, as the Extraordinary Commissioner for the Reconstruction of Smederevo. He brought 120 young members of his movement to Smederevo and organised a plan for the reconstruction of the city with them. It has been speculated that the explosion was caused by a discarded cigarette butt from a German soldier, an English plane flying over Smederevo or a local patriot. Another theory is that Soviet agent Mustafa Golubiƒá, who was arrested two days later in Belgrade, was responsible for it. In 1973, a monument to the victims of the explosion was erected. The monument was sculpted by Selimir Jovanoviƒá, who had survived the explosion.

Cudkowicz is Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, director of the ALS clinic and the Neurological Clinical Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and chair of the Department of Neurology at MGH. Cudkowicz has led several large scale collaborations and clinical trials to test novel treatments for ALS and as of 2020 researches ways to detect early biomarkers of ALS to improve diagnosis.  Early life and education  Cudkowicz was born in Buffalo, New York. Her parents were both immunologists, her father a professor and her mother a research technician. From a young age she knew she wanted to pursue science and ended up studying engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was interested in nuclear engineering at the time so she majored in chemical engineering. By the end of undergraduate degree at MIT, Cudkowicz decided that she wanted to attend medical school instead of a PhD, she stayed in Boston to take a medical degree at Harvard Medical School. She joined the Health Sciences Technology program at Harvard Medical School and became very passionate about neuroscience as well as providing care for patients in the clinic. During her time at Harvard, she also obtained a master's degree in clinical epidemiology through the Harvard School of Public Health. After her medical degree, Cudkowicz completed her internship at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City and then returned to Boston to complete her neurology residency and fellowship at MGH. During her residency, Cudkowicz became the chief resident in Neurology at MGH.  Career and research  During her residency, Cudkowicz decided to pursue clinical research centered around experimental therapeutics. Since the clinical neurology program at MGH at the time was non-existent at the time, Cudkowicz explored collaborations in order to improve the involvement of academic clinicians in clinical trials for neurotherapeutic innovations. In 1994, she established the Neurology Clinical Trial Unit at MGH. The program has since become the Neurological Clinical Research Institute (NCRI). She is director of the program which organizes patient data for clinical trials for neurological disorders. Cudkowicz also developed the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) during her residency with partner Jeremy Shefner in 1995. The goal of NEALS is to perform collaborative and academic led clinical trials for ALS. NEALS began with the involvement of 9 academic clinical centers and has since expanded to almost 100 centers worldwide. Cudkowicz has since remained involved in the leadership of NEALS and is co-director of NEALS Clinical Trials Network. After her residency training, Cudkowicz became a professor at Harvard Medical School. She is now Julieanne Dorn Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, chief of the Neurology Service at MGH, co-director of the Neuromuscular Division at MGH, and director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at MGH, which she launched in 2019. Her academic research focuses on ALS and she develops novel diagnostics and treatments for patients with ALS and organizes large clinical trials to bring new approaches closer to use in the ALS patient population. As a principal investigator in the NeuroNEXT Clinical Coordinating Center at MGH which is a part of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke's Neurology Network of Excellence in Clinical Trials, Cudkowicz is involved in leading the group to expedite therapy development for neurological disorders. Through this initiative, she launched the first ALS treatment discovery pipeline, the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which will promote expedited research for ALS. = Clinical trials for ALS therapeutics = Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) gene was discovered to be linked to the development of ALS. Cudkowicz partnered with Robert Brown, who discovered the link between SOD-1 and ALS, to develop methods to target this gene in patients with ALS. Since gain of function mutations in SOD-1 are associated with ALS development, Cudkowicz and her colleagues explored the potential of silencing this gene product in patients with ALS. They developed SOD-1 antisense oligonucleotides which, when given to rats, extended their survival and reversed the loss of compound muscle action. Cudkowicz and her team began conducting some of the first clinical trials intrathecally administering SOD-1 antisense oligonucleotides into ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Cudkowicz has also led clinical trials for the use of ceftriaxone, an excitatory amino acid transporter, to minimize glutamate mediated over-excitation as a treatment for ALS. Targeting over-excitability in an alternate way, Cudkowicz has been leading a trial to test the effects of Ezogabine, a potassium channel agonist, in phase II clinical trials. In 2019, Cudkowicz started to test the efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of ALS. The results have paved the way for future trials and use of intrathecal autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells administration. = Investigating immune and glial cells in ALS = To better understand the pathogenesis of ALS, Cudkowicz explored the role of various immune cells and glial cells in disease progress and treatment. She found that infusion of autologous regulatory T cells in patients with ALS slowed the progression of disease. Cudkowicz has also explored the role of glial cells in ALS. Using PET imaging with TSPO ligands, Cudkowicz was able to deduce that glial cell activation occurs in regions associated with motor control in patients with ALS. Her findings supported findings that reported activation of glial cells in neural degeneration, and confirmed their presence in brain regions associated with ALS symptoms. Then, using ligand C11-PBR28, Cudkowicz and her colleagues found further support for activation of glia correlating with severity of Upper Motor Neuron Burden, a scale used in ALS diagnosis.

It is based on the myth of Orpheus, dealing largely with the supernatural.Oxenhandler, page 132 While contemporary critics called the work \\"superficial\\", it has later been called \\"a brilliantly conceived homage to the supernatural\\".Oxenhandler, page 135 Cocteau later adapted the play to the better known film Orpheus (1950).Jean Cocteau and the French Scene, page 28 Plot The scene is Orpheus and Eurydice's home in Thrace. There is a mirror on the left wall and at stage rear a white horse, protruding from a niche. As the play begins Orpheus is trying to interpret a message that the horse is tapping out with his hoof. Eurydice expresses her jealousy for the supernatural nag who takes so much of her husband's time. Orpheus angrily replies that the horse brings him phrases from the unknown that are more astonishing than all the poems in the world. The poem the horse taps out for Orpheus reads \\"Madame Eurydice Reviendra Des Enfers\\" (\\"Madam Eurydice Will Come Back From Hell\\"). Orpheus enters the poem in a contest but the judges are infuriated because the initial letters of the words spell \\"MERDE\\".Oxenhandler, page 134-135 While Orpheus is at the contest Eurydice is murdered by her ex-friends, the Baccantes. Returning, Orpheus decides to rescue her from death. Instructed by the angel Heurtebise he passes through the mirror and brings Eurydice back to life, but life together is impossible as he is not allowed to look at her. The Baccantes returns to harass Orpheus, claiming he has submitted an obscene poem. Orpheus is decapitated and Eurydice leads him back through the mirror. The angel puts Orpheus head on a pedestal, where, in answers to questions from the police, it announces it is Jean Cocteau and gives Cocteau's address, 10 rue d'Anjou.

It was the first region known to have been called Brabant, and it included the modern capital of Belgium, Brussels. Although it was eventually divided between powerful neighbouring counties, the parts which went to the Counts of Leuven, not only kept the name in use, but became the primary name of their large lordship. This led to many other regions now being named Brabant, such as the French and Dutch-speaking areas east of the Dyle, including Leuven and Wavre; and the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. It is and was multi-lingual, divided between Dutch (Flemish) speakers in the north, and French (and Picard) speakers in the south. Today the region is divided between the modern Belgian provinces of Vlaams Brabant and East Flanders (Dutch speaking), Hainaut and Walloon Brabant (French speaking), as well as Brussels, which is officially bi-lingual. Geographical definition The medieval pagi of Hainaut (pink dots) and Brabant (purple dots) are compared to the modern provinces of Belgium. Blue is modern Flemish Brabant; Green is modern Walloon Brbant; but much of early medieval Brabant is now in East Flanders (mauve) and Hainaut (yellow). The green markers were in the Silva Carbonaria. It lay between the rivers Scheldt, Rupel, Dyle (in some areas perhaps its tributary the Lasne) and Haine.Vanderkindere Vol.2 p.102: \\"au nord et √† l'ouest l'Escaut, au sud la Haine, √† l'est la For√™t charbonni√®re et la Dyle\\". Nonn, p.113: \\"\\"Bonenfant, der die sicher identifizierten Orte sorgf√§ltig verkartet hat, best√§tigt im wesentlichen die von Vanderkindere angenommenen nat√ºlichen Grenzen des Gaus: im Westen und Norden die Schelde, im Osten die Dyle, im S√ºden die Haine.\\" This territory includes not only Brussels but also Aalst. It does not include Louvain. The modern Dutch province of North Brabant was not originally part of Brabant, but acquired the name because it was integrated politically. In the modern Belgian province of Antwerp, Klein-Brabant is geographically in the original pagus of Brabant. Etymology In its earliest forms such as those collected by Nonn, the first part of the name was written with variants such as brac-, brag-, brach-, braim, and brei. According to Deru (p.190) this element could derive from Germanic *brakti implying fallow land, or *braki implying marshy land (related to modern Dutch \\"broek\\"). These would both be derived from reconstructed Proto-Germanic *brekanƒÖ \\"to break\\". The second element of the name -bant is found in several other Frankish pagus names in this region, such as nearby Oosterbant, and Swifterbant and Teisterbant, to the north, and is believed to be connected to the medieval concept of a \\"ban\\", relating to areas of duty and authority. Pre-history As demonstrated by Deru, the pagus of Brabant between the Scheldt, Haine, Lasne and Rupel rivers, corresponds closely with the northern extension of the Belgic Nervii, both in terms of archaeological evidence such as Nervian coin finds, and also because it lay within the Roman era civitas of the Nervians, and its successor, the medieval bishopric of Cambrai - both of which had their main centres in the south, in the areas of Hainaut and Cambrai. History The oldest records of Brabant come from the Liber Traditionem of Saint Peter's Abbey in Ghent, beginning around 750. Though it was on the opposite side of the Scheldt from Brabant, St Peter's had a strong involvement in lands between the Scheldt and Dender. In 870, in the Treaty of Meerssen Brabant was mentioned as containing four counties (in Bracbanto comitatus IIII), but the definitions of these political entities can now only be speculated upon. Much of its history in the Early Middle Ages (before 1000) is difficult to reconstruct. Although Leon Vanderkindere (in 1901) and Paul Bonenfant (in 1935) both attempted it, these attempts have been criticized by later historians. What can be said is limited:Vanderkindere p.106; ; . Nonn p.116: \\"Wir k√∂nnen lediglich festhalten: 1. Zum Zeitpunkt des Meersener Vertrages existierten im Gebiet des Gro·∫ûgaus Brabant vier Comitate. 2. Einer dieser Comitate mit dem Namen Brabant umfa·∫ûte Orte in den Dekenaten Br√ºssel und Halle. 3. Im nordwestlichen Teil des Gro·∫ûgaus ist Ende des X./Anfang des XI. Jahrhunderts ein comitatus Biest belegt; ob er schon 870 als einer der vier Grafschaften existierte, l√§·∫ût sich nicht entscheiden.\\" De Waha p.33: \\"Les quatre comt√©s braban√ßons ne nous sont connus que par les quelques textes citant le comt√© de Brabant, la mention d'un comte Jean dont on peut d√©duire qu'il en √©tait le comte en 978, par deux textes situant des biens dans le comt√© de Biest et par l'√©vocation √† Chi√©vres d'un compte Egbert, qui doit √™tre report√©e non √† 928-939, mais vers 1010.\\" *There was a count named John in 978, who had a county, itself called Brabant, which included Sint-Kwintens- Lennik. Vanderkindere equated him with one or two other Johns, not described as count, mentioned in a 966 record of benefices made to Nivelles Abbey, and granting land at Lupoigne and Tongrines.A modern critical edition of the 966 charter is here. *Among places named as being within a county, not just a pagus, named Brabant were Gooik and Lennik (877 and 897). Possibly also Wambeek, Tubize and Ittre (see Nonn note 494); Meslin-l'Ev√©que and Lessines, both near Ath (946); Dikkele (991). That John's county may have been so widespread has been taken by de Waha to suggest that his county encompassed the whole pagus. *There was a county within western Brabant named Biest (Bisuth, Bisit), which included places between Oudenaarde and Aalst: Herzele and Walsegem. This was the part of Brabant which would later come under Flemish control, and is still part of East Flanders province. It was named in only two texts, in 971 and 1011, and no count of Biest was named. *There was a count named Egbert associated with Chi√®vres around 1010 (wrongly dated by Vanderkindere according to de Waha). This was in the southern, Romance- speaking, part of Brabant which would later come under Hainaut control. After 925 the boundary between the major Frankish kingdoms became permanently fixed along the Scheldt river, making Brabant a frontier province or \\"March\\" of what would become the Holy Roman Empire, and eventually Germany. On the western side of that boundary lay the expansionist Counts of Flanders, who were within the western Frankish kingdom that would become France. They developed the fortified city of Ghent upon this river frontier. In response to this situation, the emperors in Germany established their own March on their side of the Scheldt. One of the first frontier lordships named was at Ename in Brabant, and there were also Valenciennes to the south and Antwerp to the north. As the 11th century progressed, three large parts of Brabant became permanently politically connected to their powerful neighbours. *The western part of Brabant, including Aalst and stretching from the Scheldt to the Dender, became part of the Flanders, making the lords of Flanders major land- holders in the Holy Roman Empire. This is referred to as \\"Imperial Flanders\\" in contrast to \\"Crown Flanders\\" (under the French king). *The southeastern part of Brabant came under the control of the County of Hainaut. *An eastern part of Brabant including Brussels became a lordship of the Counts of Leuven, who then referred to themselves as Counts of both Leuven and Brussels. The remaining part of Brabant between Brussels and the Flemish part of Brabant, also came into the hands of the counts of Leuven and Brussels at some point, and from at least 1085 they referred to themselves also as Landgraves of Brabant, indicating a higher status than a normal Count. Van Droogenbroeck has argued that the counts of Leuven acquired this title to Brabant from their relative Hermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia, who died at this time.

His \\"Treatise On The Theory And Practice Of Naval Architecture\\" was published in several places including the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and he became editor of Naval Science. He became admitted as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1842, and also became founding member of the first Royal School of Naval Architecture. In 1844 he took employment with Lloyds Register in 1844 as Principle Shipwright Surveyor. At the Great Exhibition of 1851 he was one of the judges for the improvement of naval architecture. AFB Creuze died in 1852 aged about 52. He bequested his collection of books to Lloyds Register which led to the formation of their library and archive. Lloyds renamed their marine training room at their \\"Augustin FB Creuze\\" as a recognition.

It was organized by Catholic priests in preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma but discussed only cultural and economic issues. The organizers attempted to invite representatives of different social classes and political affiliations leading to disagreements between socialists and Catholic clergy, and between educated intellectuals and less educated villagers. The congress resolved to establish the Lithuanian Women's Union. However, disagreements between the liberals and the Catholics led to splintering of the women's movement and to the establishment of the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922. Organization The Lithuanian Women's Association was established in September 1905 during the Russian Revolution in Vilnius. It was organized and headed by women members of the intelligentsia. Different developments took place in Kaunas where women's issues were taken up by the members of the Catholic clergy, particularly by priest . The priests organized the Society of Saint Zita for female servants and maids. In preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma, Janu≈°eviƒçius organized the First Congress of Lithuanian Women (the women were not allowed to vote in the election). According to Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó, the congress originated from an idea to establish a shop of homemade textiles and a need to recruit village women for the enterprise. There were very few women intellectuals in Kaunas. The priests selected seven women for the organizational committee, however, according to Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó, only one of them ‚Äì Cecilija Leonienƒó, the wife of attorney Petras Leonas ‚Äì had attended a gymnasium. The organizational committee invited women from villagers (more conservative and Catholic) and the women intellectuals from Vilnius (more liberal and anti- religious). To obtain the government permit for the gathering, it would not discuss any social or political issues, only cultural and economic affairs. Proceedings The congress was opened by writer Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó-Bitƒó. Priests then wanted to elect a board to preside over the congress with a priest as its chairman. Petkeviƒçaitƒó felt it was insulting to the women and proposed herself as the chair of the congress. She also proposed Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó as vice-chairs, as secretary, and Petras Leonas as advisor. According to Leonas, due to poor health and weak voice, Petkeviƒçaitƒó presided over the proceedings only on paper; Pleirytƒó- Puidienƒó managed most of the actual work. None of the members of the original organizational committee got included on the board which left them feeling sidelined and snubbed. The proceedings opened with a cantata about Lithuanian women composed specifically for the event by . The first day featured several speeches and presentations on the women's movement in Lithuania by Leonienƒó, on hardships of village women by Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó-≈Ωemaitƒó, on public duties (e.g. working as low-paid teachers or volunteer as nurses) of women intellectuals by Petkeviƒçaitƒó, on women's professional education by , on teaching the history of Lithuania by Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlioninenƒó, on women's honor by Peƒçkauskaitƒó, on schools, on ways to combat alcoholism, on homemade textiles, on vegetables and fruits. Most speakers stressed the need for education to improve one's circumstances. Women attendees also complained about their suffering ‚Äì villagers about husbands who abused alcohol, city maids and servants about their exploitative employers. The women planned to publish a book will all presentations, but could not find a publisher. Three presentations were published in Vilniaus ≈æinios. The second day saw more heated debates between socialists and Catholic clergy. Men became more active during these debates; they constituted a third of all speakers. The congress discussed whether to establish a newspaper dedicated to women's issues as well as the relationship between Lithuanian Women's Association and the Russian Union for Women's Equality. It was decided that the Lithuanian association should not become a chapter of the Russian union and should collaborate with the union as long as this collaboration did not hinder the women's movement in Lithuania. The congress concluded with the adoption of a resolution which called for the establishment of the new Lithuanian Women's Union which would participate in the international women's movement. Most contentious issue was the election of a 10-member committee to organize this new union as socialists and Catholic clergy fought for influence. The committee included Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó as chair, Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó as vicechairs, and as secretaries, Celina Leonienƒó and Kotryna Norkytƒó as treasurers, and Joana Griniuvienƒó, Elena Vaitkeviƒçienƒó, and Teklƒó Augustinaviƒçi≈´tƒó as members of the revision sub-committee. Several other women, including Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó and Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó, were selected as candidates in case of any resignations. Attendees The apolitical agenda attracted representatives from different organizations and political parties. Therefore, the congress included women from different social classes and political convictions but since the proceedings were in the Lithuanian language, other nationalities (Russian, Polish, Jewish) were not represented. The total number of attendees is unknown. Participants later put estimates ranging from 350 to 700. The attendees had to purchase tickets that cost 25 kopeks for women and one ruble for men. The women attendees included essentially all Lithuanian cultural elite at the time ‚Äì Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó- Bitƒó, Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó, , Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó-≈Ωemaitƒó, Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó (≈†atrijos Ragana), Cecilija Leonienƒó, Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó, , , . Men participants included Petras Leonas, Mykolas Sle≈æeviƒçius, Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas, Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas, , Vincas Kapsukas, Karolis Po≈æela, Steponas Kairys, , Kazys Grinius. Aftermath The congress failed to unify women activists ‚Äì women's movement in Lithuania split into two main branches: conservative Catholic and liberal-socialist. The disagreements became evident during the congress and only deepened when each side began publishing accusing articles in the Lithuanian press. The 10-member committee started working on the statute of the planned Lithuanian Women's Union. The first draft was prepared mainly by Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and Pleirytƒó-Puidienƒó based on the statute of the Russian Union for Women's Equality. In November, the statute was submitted to the Governor-General of Vilna for approval, but it was rejected. The Catholics protested this statute as they wanted to copy examples of organizations of Belgian and German Catholic women, not Russian liberals. After a failed attempt to find a compromise in December 1907, the Catholic camp established the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Catholic association was approved by Kovno Governorate. The Tsarist authorities would not approve another women's organization thus effectively preventing the Lithuanian Women's Union from being organized. The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.

He was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of Lieutenant Colonel Luis S√°nchez Cerro (1930‚Äì1931). In the second government of √ìscar R. Benavides, he served as Minister of Justice, Instruction, Worship and Charity (1934‚Äì1935), Minister of Public Education (1935‚Äì1939) and President of the Council of Ministers (1936‚Äì1939). He was also a senator of the Republic (1939‚Äì1948) and President of the Senate (1939‚Äì1941). In 1950, Ernesto wanted to compete against General Manuel A. Odr√≠a in the presidential election, but he was arrested and exiled. He was the father of Ernesto Montagne S√°nchez, who, like his father, was also a military officer and politician, who became Prime Minister of Peru in the government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado . Biography He was born to Adhemar Montagne Crepin, who was of French descent and Mar√≠a Eugenia Markholz Walsh, who was of German descent. He studied at the Licentico cientifico, at the Colegio Aleman , Colegio San Jos√© de Cluny (1889) and then at the Technical School of Commerce (1900). He entered the Military School of Chorrillos in 1902 and obtained the sword of honoraafter his graduation and the rank of ensign in 1905 . He specialized in Topography (1906‚Äì1908). After being promoted to lieutenant in 1908, he became a professor of Topography at the Military School (1908‚Äì1911). While serving as a captain, he entered the Superior War College (1911‚Äì1912). Due to his merits, he was sent to the Paris Higher War College (1913‚Äì1914) but returned at the outbreak of the First World War. In 1909, in the chapel of the House of Armies, he married Raquel S√°nchez- Benavides La Rosa, with whom he had seven children, including General Ernesto Montagne S√°nchez. Promoted to sergeant major in 1915, he was assigned as an adjunct to the Infantry and Shooting Inspectorate. In 1918, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was appointed head of a section in the General Staff of the Army; but shortly afterwards he was transferred to the Military School to take charge of his subdirectorate. When the coup d'√©tat of Augusto Legu√≠a took place on July 4, 1919, he requested to be withdrawn. But soon he accepted appointment at the General Directorate of National Shooting, and then, the headquarters of the Infantry Regiment No. 15 which was organized in Sicuani . Ernesto was noted for the vigour he demonstrated while serving these posts. He returned to Lima in 1922 as deputy to General Wilhelm Faupel, a German officer who had been appointed Inspector General of the Army. Promoted to colonel in 1928, he was again appointed deputy director of the Military School in 1929. When Legu√≠a was overthrown, he did not recognize the cabinet formed in Lima headed by General Ponce, on August 24, 1930, and rather supported the putsch led in Arequipa by Lieutenant Colonel Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro. Cerro immediately moved to Lima on the 27th of August and organized a new Government Junta, in which Ernesto Montagne was appointed as Minister of Foreign Relations. He held that position until February of the following year and later went to serve as the Comptroller General of the Army. When the conflict with Colombia broke out as a result of the occupation of Leticia by a group of Peruvians who were discontent with the Solomon-Lozano Treaty , Montagne was transferred to Iquitos as chief of staff of the Army foe Operations of the North-East in 1933. He remained there for two years and returned to Lima in 1935. At that time, General Oscar R. Benavides was ruling the country. Ernesto was appointed Minister of Justice and Worship on 21 May 1935 and then became head of the newly created portfolio of Education in October 1935. Following the resignation of President of the Council of Ministers Manuel E. Rodriguez , he replaced him as prime minister from April 13, 1936 to April 12, 1939). He simultaneously held the first vice presidency of the Republic. He was promoted to brigadier general on June 3, 1936. During the period, general elections were held on October 11, 1936, which were annulled, and Benavides' mandate was extended for another three years. Initially, his cabinet was predominantly filled with Army officers, Later, from October 1937, important civilian figures joined him, such as Dr. Carlos Concha (Foreign Relations), Benjam√≠n Roca (Finance and Commerce) and Rafael Escard√≥ (Public Health, Works and Social Welfare). In December 1938, Manuel Ugarteche replaced Roca, and Dr. Guillermo Almenara replaced Escard√≥. After the coup attempt by General Antonio Ramirez Rodr√≠guez (who was a government minister) and the government's subsequent announcement to call general elections, the Montagne cabinet resigned on March 29, 1939, but his resignation was not accepted. He again requested it in April and then President Benavides oversaw the formation of another cabinet, headed by Manuel Ugarteche Jim√©nez, what was the last government of Benavides era. Montagne was elected senator from Loreto (1939‚Äì1945), and became President of the Senate for two terms (1939‚Äì1941). While serving in the post, he had to received the presidential sache from the hands of Benavides and place it on the new president, Manuel Prado Ugarteche, at the ceremony of handover of presidency on December 8, 1939. Once again elected senator from Loreto in 1945, he supported President Jos√© Luis Bustamante y Rivero and, together with lawmakers of the National Democratic Front, tried to contain and mitigate the opposition, APRA. The Bustamante government was overthrown after the coup d'√©tat of General Manuel A. Odr√≠a on October 27, 1948, who formed a Military Junta and called for presidential elections in 1950. Odr√≠a would be the candidate, but there was a problem: according to the constitution, an incumbent president can not be candidate in presidential elections, for which he had to resign at least six months prior to the elections. Odr√≠a then implemented his famous \\"descent to the plain\\": with barely a month to go before the elections, he left power to General Zen√≥n Noriega (June 1950). The opposition, united into the National Democratic League, in turn nominated General Ernesto Montagne as the candidate. But the National Electoral court rejected his registration on June 11, 1950; the next day the deadly Arequipa rebellion broke out, The government blamed the National Democratic League for the revolt and Montagne was arrested under various pretexts, although he was released after two weeks. The Military Junta then decided to deport General Montagne to Argentina, asking him to request it in writing, a request that they did not obtain. So the alleged extradition was never carried out. Odr√≠a as the sole candidate in that election, which was regarded as a farce. Retired to private life, General Montagne died a few years later, in 1954.

The song is the opening track on their third studio album Sheer Heart Attack. The song features one of Queen's longest guitar solos which is more than three minutes long. The solo has been performed live by Brian May at most concerts since its release. The song gained popularity after its prominent use in the 2017 Edgar Wright film Baby Driver.  History  May wrote the song shortly before the completion of Queen II in 1973, but because the band did not have enough time to record it, it was not included. Before the song being recorded in 1974, variations of the solo were part of \\"Son and Daughter\\". There were many working titles for the song including; \\"Happy Little Fuck\\", \\"Happy Little Day\\", \\"Blackpool Rock\\", \\"Bognor Ballad\\", \\"Southend Sea Scout\\", \\"Skiffle Rock and \\"Herne Bay\\". The title is something of a pun: Brighton rock is a long, cylindrical sugar candy traditional to that seaside resort. The term was also iconic in UK pop culture as the title of a dark Graham Greene thriller/noir novel later adapted into a successful film starring Richard Attenborough as a teenage sociopath. The song, the first track on the album, tells the story of two young lovers named Jenny and Jimmy meeting in Brighton on a public holiday.Brighton Rock Allmusic. Retrieved 1 September 2011 Jenny cannot linger because she is afraid her mother will find out \\"how I spent my holiday\\", but afterwards \\"writes a letter every day\\"; Jimmy, eager on the day, is not so happy with her \\"nothing can my love erase\\": now he is the one afraid of discovery by \\"my lady\\". The song was listed among Guitar World's Top 100 Greatest Guitar Solo's of All Time, ranking at #41. The song was prominently featured in two scenes in the 2017 Edgar Wright film Baby Driver. The song was used during the climactic face-off between Baby (portrayed by Ansel Elgort) and Buddy (portrayed by Jon Hamm) at the end of the film. The song was previously heard in the film while the two discussed the song earlier. This conversation leads to Buddy playing the song during their final confrontation, as Baby had described the song as \\"his killer track\\". The song's usage in the film led to a resurgence of popularity for the track.  Live performances  The song is probably best known for its lengthy guitar solo interlude, which was rather similar to the solo of 1968 Smile (May's old band) song \\"Blag\\". This featured May's technique of using multiple echoes used to build up guitar harmony and contrapuntal melodic lines. The studio version only contains one \\"main\\" guitar and one \\"echoed\\" guitar for a short section, but live, he would usually split his guitar signal into \\"main\\" and two \\"echoed\\", with each going to a separate bank of amplifiers. Variations of this solo often featured during live Queen concerts, either as part of a rendition of Brighton Rock, a medley of it with some other songs (as witnessed on the News of the World tour where it segued after Freddie Mercury's multiple echoed vocal solo at the end of \\"White Man\\" and May's solo would segue into \\"The Prophet's Song\\" or \\"Now I'm Here\\"), or on its own as a guitar solo. In the late '70s, the guitar solo was adapted to include some bass and drums, including a timpani solo by Roger Taylor (from October 1978 to November 1981). This is most notably heard on their live albums Live Killers and Queen Rock Montreal. From late 1979 through 1981, the solo was included as a medley with \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", before becoming a performance in its own right. During the recent tour of Queen + Paul Rodgers, a modified version, incorporating bits of \\"Chinese Torture\\" (from The Miracle) and the introduction from \\"Now I'm Here\\" was featured in the concerts. The Queen + Paul Rodgers version is featured on their live album Return of the Champions, simply titled \\"Guitar Solo\\". The live piece is often between 9 to 13 minutes long. May performed part of the \\"Brighton Rock\\" solo at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\\"Olympics closing ceremony - playlist\\". The Telegraph.

Early life Cecil Vivian Parker was born in Secunderabad, India. His father's name was P. R. Parker and his mother's was Smt E. S. Parker. Military career Parker was commissioned into the Indian Air Force (IAF) on 31 Aug 1952. After joining the Indian Air Force, he saw action in both the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pakistan Wars. In October 1966, as Wing Commander, he formed an operational training unit and was the Unit's first Commanding Officer. Here, he implemented a high level of instructional technique, standardisation and ensured a high quality of training for the pupils that passed through the unit, for which he was awarded the Vayu Sena Medal. During the 1971 war, as commanding officer of the No. 20 Squadron IAF, a fighter bomber squadron equipped with Hawker Hunter aircraft. He also led a number of deep penetration missions into Pakistani territory attacking heavily defended targets including Pakistani airfields, oil refineries and in support of Army operations. On one of the missions, his formation was attacked by Pakistani F-86 Sabre aircraft. In the ensuing air fight, Wing Commander Parker shot down one Sabre and heavily damaged another. During another strike mission, Wing Commander Parker attacked an oil refinery at Attock, Pakistan, in the face of intense anti-aircraft and small arms fire, causing serious damage to the refinery. For bravery and leadership displayed in combat missions, Wing Commander Parker was awarded the Mahavir Chakra, India's second highest gallantry award. Wing Commander Parker led what was later called the greatest IAF air strike and acknowledged by a Pakistani Air Force officer, Air Commodore, M. Kaiser Tufail (retd), in his book 'In the Ring and on Its Feet'. In the book, he said the Indian Hunter aircraft destroyed five Pakistani F-86 Sabre jets during the raid on its airbase at Murid. The F86 was the Pakistan Air Force's premiere aircraft and the single-biggest challenge for the IAF in air battles in the 1965 and 1971 wars. During his career in the IAF spanning 35 years, he created a record of flying 22 types of aircraft and logged 3,850 flying hours.

Background  It was established on 14 February to advise the Cabinet of Japan from a medical point of view, following the first confirmed Covid-19 death in Japan. Takaji Wakita, Director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, chairs the Expert Meeting and Shigeru Omi who was instrumental in SARS measures as director of WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and later worked to respond to the 2009 swine flu pandemic in Japan is a vice chairman. The members are composed of Prof. Hitoshi Oshitani, who is the leader of the Cluster Measures Team and remedied the situation in the SARS outbreak as an infectious disease advisor at WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, and others.  Dissolution  At a press conference on June 24, Yasuhiro Nishimura, Minister for Economic and Fiscal Policy, announced that the Expert Meeting would be abolished and that a new subcommittee of infectious disease experts would be established under The Advisory Council on Countermeasures against Novel Influenza and Other Diseases as a substitute for the Expert Meeting. The reason for the abolition is that \\"it was not based on the law and its position was unstable\\" (Minister Nishimura). The announcement seemed to be unexpected, and Vice Chairman Shigeru Omi, who was present, was unable to hide his confusion. On July 3, The Novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease Control Subcommittee was established based on the Novell Cornavirus Special Measures Act. The members consisted of infectious disease specialists as well as local representatives, trade union executives, economists, risk communication specialists and other experts. Shigeru Omi serves as chairman.  Japan's Strategy for COVID-19  The aim of the Expert Meeting is to curb the pandemic while maintaining socio- economic activities. If countries around the world repeatedly block the city and lift the blockade every time an outbreak occurs, the global economy and society will collapse. They think that urban blockade is a 19th-century measure, and that there is a 21st-century-type measure to curb the spread of infection by controlling the behavior of people. Vaccine development takes time, and we don't know if we can actually make a vaccine. Herd immunity cannot be achieved unless a large number of victims are killed and about 70% of the population is infected. There were three pillars of basic strategy that they chose. (1) Early \\"cluster crushing\\" by investigation of mass infection. (2) \\"Preventing aggravation\\" by strengthening the medical system. (3) \\"Changing people's behavior\\" to prevent the spread of infection. = Three C's = The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan, which became the first wave of COVID-19 in Japan, and discovered the conditions under which clusters occur, \\"\\". They concluded that most of the primary cases that touched off large clusters were either asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms, and thought it is impossible to stop the emergence of clusters just by testing many people. The first strategy they hammered out was to avoid places of \\"Three C's (Closed spaces, Crowded spaces and Close-contact settings).\\" The main routes of infection were considered to be \\"contact infection\\", which is transmitted by touching a substance to which the virus is attached, and \\"droplet infection\\", which is transmitted by inhaling droplets from a sneeze or cough. However, it has been pointed out that the possibility of \\"micro droplet infection\\" is pointed out as a new infection route. A small particle of less than 10 micrometers in diameter containing the virus, a micro-spray floats in the air for 20 minutes, and the infection spreads by people nearby sucking it in. = Cluster surveillance = One of the features of the measures for the new coronavirus in Japan is the strategy of cluster surveillance. Japan has deterred outbreaks through epidemiological surveys centered on cluster surveillance. In early February, Oshitani and Hiroshi Nishiura, a members of the Cluster Measures Team, found that 80% of patients did not infect others with the coronavirus, but certain patients infected many people, by analyzing the data of the first wave from China. The Expert Meeting set their eyes on that, they decided to prevent outbreaks by tracking infected people and testing those who were in close contact with them. 80% of these infected don't infect anyone with the new coronavirus, so we don't need to find all the infected. If we can find a cluster, we can control this disease to some extent. If the number of positives is small, it is possible to suppress the spread of infection by tracking the cluster, and it is possible to continue the infectious disease measures while maintaining a constant economic activity. When the infection rate is very low, the infection will not spread by testing only high-risk people. PCR tests cause false positives, so many tests at low infection rates can even cause false positives to outnumber true positives. They took that strategy with that in mind. Behind that was the fact that the medical resources in Japan were vulnerable. Unlike other Asian countries, Japan was not well prepared to test for infectious diseases because SARS did not land. The new coronavirus became a designated infectious disease, so those who tested positive were required to be hospitalized even for mild cases, and there were few sickbeds. However, they also thought that it was a big problem that the number of PCR tests did not increase in the rapid increase of the infected person, and they have gradually increased the number of PCR tests since mid-March. The strategy worked well until mid-March, and it succeeded in preventing the first wave from China, but the second wave via returnees from Europe and the US could not be stopped, and the outbreak occuared in April. That was revealed in May by a genomic molecular epidemiology survey of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). = Changing people's behavior = The outbreak occurred in April, and the government declared a \\"statement of emergency\\" and asked people to quarantine themselves. The Expert Meeting asked people to ‚Äúreduce contact between people by 80% more than usual‚Äù in order to reduce the rate of increase in the number of infected people and allow cluster surveillance again. They doubted the 80% goal was achieved, but there was fairly extensive voluntary national compliance. Japan's mild \\"lockdown\\" seemed to have a real lockdown effect. When the government lifted the state of emergency in May, they then proposed \\"new lifestyle\\" for people.  General overview  The 15th Meeting (29 May) = Taking lifting a state of emergency, they made an assessment at that point on their efforts. Japan achieved a certain amount of results in suppressing the increase in the number of infected people and reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries compared to Western countries. Four factors were cited: (1) the universal health insurance system, (2) high medical level, (3) public health centers in each region, (4) high public awareness of hygiene. In addition, it was evaluated that \\"early detection of the spread of two waves of infection from China and Europe\\" and \\"cluster countermeasures\\" were effective. Generally, the media and others call the spread of infection in April as the first wave in Japan. However, the Expert Meeting called the wave from China the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù and the wave from Europe and the US \\"the second wave.\\" In stopping the two waves, accurately catching the epidemic has helped prevent the rapid spread of infection. The increase in the cumulative number of people infected between February 18 and February 25 confirmed that. At that time, the number of cases did not increase significantly in Germany, France, and the UK, etc., but it is possible that it advanced unnoticed. The spread of the infection actually occurred in western countries, but it may have progressed beneath the surface. It is conceivable that it might have led to a subsequent outbreak. Cluster surveillance played an important role in capturing the spread of infection in Japan. Cluster surveillance using active epidemiological surveys, such as interviewing infected people, is also common abroad, but there is a big difference in the method between Japan and them. Japan has conducted two types of surveys: a \\"prospective contact tracing\\", which identifies close contacts with infected people starting with new cases, and \\"retrospective contact tracing\\", which identifies where new patients were infected and identifies close contacts together with them at their common source of infection. However, most countries have not carried out this \\"retroactive contact tracing\\" though some cases were confirmed in Taiwan. The Expert Meeting speculated that there might be a difference in their ultimate goals in the background. Other countries are aiming to contain this virus, but Japan is not aiming for it in the first place, and frequently announces that it is impossible. \\"Prospective contact tracking\\" is a basic strategy for cluster surveillance that is carried out when aiming for virus containment, and has a history of being used during SARS and Ebola. However, it was pointed out from the beginning in Japan that the containment of this new coronavirus is almost impossible. If only \\"prospective contact tracking\\" aimed at containment is performed, it is inevitable to overlook the spread of infection below the surface. It was fortunate that the public health centers in Japan have been conducting investigations of the source of infection along with the tracing close contacts with infected people from the beginning. The Expert Meeting said that they will continue to scrutinize why they were able to investigate the source of infection in Japan first, and then speculated that it might be due to the constant effort to find the source of tuberculosis. When the reporters pointed out that the PCR tests for close contacts was insufficient, the Expert Meeting said, \\"There is a misunderstanding about the PCR tests. Even if they develop, not all cases can be found. The sensitivity of the test kit to asymptomatic people is not very high. No one knows when they're going to get infected, so we'll have to test everyone every day to confirm. Is that the right choice? , We need to consider.\\" In response to the opinion that the low number of PCR tests delayed their response, the Expert Meeting said, \\"Even if close contact is missed to some extent, most of them do not infect anyone with the virus. Even if there are some misses, many chains will naturally disappear. By clarifying the locations of many clusters, we were able to identify areas where infection was likely to occur, such as \\"3C's,\\" and sent a message to avoid such an environment.\\" However, The Expert Meeting also admitted that the number of tests was not sufficient at the time when the number of cases increased in April, and called on the country and each prefecture to develop the system. The Expert Meeting gave a tentative assessment of the effect of the government's declaration of emergency on 7 April, but pointed out that the peak of the actual infection was around 1 April, before the declaration, and had already been on a downward trend due to a curfew announced by the Governor of Tokyo. The Expert Meeting showed the recognition that it is important to prevent the spread of infection and the severity of the patient by providing early diagnosis and early medical care for infected people. The Expert Meeting said the re-emergence of the spread of infection of latent cases could have already occurred in some areas of Japan, and that it is important to being cautious about and being on the watch for that while continuing socio-economic activity. The Expert Meeting listed three initiatives for that purpose: (1) enabling early diagnosis of infected people by rapid tests such as antigen tests, (2) elucidating initial symptoms and narrowing down the test targets, (3) conducting research to find signs of progression of a patient's condition from subclinical to moderate.  Criticism  The Expert Meeting and the Abe Cabinet have been exposed to harsh criticism by the Japanese media and their pundits. Under that influence, Japanese people also cast a stern eye toward the Abe Cabinet. According to a public‚Äêopinion poll by Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun in May, the cabinet approval rating has dropped to its lowest level since its inception. The Expert Meeting was also subject to criticism. Some people held them accountable for the delay in the measures, the lack of PCR tests, and other factors. In question-and-answer sessions at the Upper House Budget Committee, Omi, the deputy chairman, was criticized for the small number of PCR tests and was blamed by Tetsuro Fukuyama, secretary general of the Constitutional Democratic Party of JapanTY for stating that no one knew the actual total number of people infected. The Expert Meeting was blamed by opposition parties and the media for not fulfilling their responsibilities as scientists for not recording minutes. Wakita pointed out that they had send out as much information as possible through proposals and press conferences, and that it was up to the government to take minutes. Omi said that they had proposed to the government to take minutes. Not only in Japan but also abroad, especially in the US, UK and China, have criticized them. There has been a flood of criticism from both home and abroad about the Expert Meeting and the government's response to the Diamond Princess. The U.S. and Chinese media developed The Olympics Conspiracy Theory, claiming that the Abe Cabinet took part in the plot to make the number of infected people appear less than the actual number until just before the decision to postpone the Olympics. ABC-TV quoted a Japanese professor Koichi Nakano's contribution as a side note, and wondered, \\"Why did the number of infected people suddenly increase in Japan as soon as it was postponed?\\" That was later judged to be fake news by fact- checking in several media. The small number of PCR tests in Japan has been questioned worldwide. CNN, an American pay TV channel, cited interviews with medical personnel Kenji Shibuya and Masahiro Kami, as well as political scientist Koichi Nakano and Japanese Communist Party Rep. Tomoko Tamura, and pointed out that the number of infected people announced by the Japanese government is just the tip of the iceberg and that more tests will need to be actively conducted to accurately grasp the actual situation. The Communist Party's newspaper, Shimbun Akahata, said that Japan has too few tests compared to other countries, and that it is imperative to expand PCR tests. In Japan, there was even a conspiracy theory that the Expert Meeting had deliberately failed to carry out PCR tests in collusion with the Abe cabinet, and that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (to which the chair belongs) hindered the expansion of PCR testing in an attempt to monopolize the data. On the other hand, many infectious disease specialists and clinicians who were familiar with EBM complained about easy expansion of PCR tests through SNS. Regarding those criticisms, the Expert Meeting said that although the PCR test may produce false positives and false negatives, it is the only test method that can give a definitive diagnosis at the present time, and it should be carried out appropriately when necessary, but it also pointed out that it was not effective to test every person. The Expert Meeting argued that there were no outbreaks in Japan, so few people were missed because of the small number of tests. Deputy Chairman Omi said that Japan has conducted surveillance for pneumonia, so almost all cases of them undergo a CT scan, and most of those would do a PCR test, and that in some cases, those who died at home or died in the streets tested positive after their death, but their system has picked up the right numbers of deaths. Omi argued that testing a large number of asymptomatic people who were worrier would cause collapse of the medical care system. Kenji Shibuya, a senior adviser to Tedros Adhanom and a professor at King's College London in the UK, severely criticizes the Expert Meeting that Japan couldn't expand the PCR tests because of their old way of thinking about classifying \\"returnees\\" and \\"contacts.\\" Shibuya criticized the Expert Meeting as not independent of the government. Shibuya was concerned that Japan may have underestimated the number of people infected, as Japan had a low number of PCR tests and selected samples with a high probability of infection in interviews with CNN and the New York Times. Shibuya advocates that PCR tests should be carried out to all the people of the country. Shibuya is participating in a national movement that calls in the government to carry out a 100% PCR test for all citizens, which costs 54 trillion yen. Shibuya said he didn't think it would be valid for a nationwide school closure at the end of February. Using the data from the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shibuya said, \\"I can't say with 100% certainty, but I can see that there was an excess mortality caused by another infection , the new coronavirus, in February.\\" Shibuya said that the infection status of Japan, which can be read from the data released by the government and Tokyo, was insufficient, and lacked important informations on epidemiology. Shibuya criticized the timing of the state of emergency as being a week late. Shibuya predicted that Japan would have to lock down and lifting repeatedly, as the number of seriously ill patients and deaths would increase after June in Japan. Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, and an outside director of SBI Pharma Co., Ltd. and SBI Biotech Co., Ltd., complained that the new coronavirus measures should be reviewed from the beginning. Kami said, \\"The low number of infected people in Japan is due to the limited number of PCR tests. It's safe to say that there were about a million hidden corona patients.\\" He asserted that the reason why the number of tests did not increase was due to the fact that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, a research institute of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare controlled the tests. Kami concludes that Japan's unsuccessful measures against corona are due to the clinical neglect, research supremacy and confidentiality of Expert Meeting. He traced the roots of members' alma mater back to before WWII, and he accused them that they are an establishment type who inherited the DNA of the Japanese Imperial Army, and that what they were doing to patients was not a treatment but a human experimentation. He appealed that the only solution would be to renew the current system with personnel. Koichi Nakano, a member of the citizens' group \\"Civic Union calling for the Abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security System and The Restoration of Constitutionalism\\" and a professor at Sophia University, contributed an article to New York Times entitled \\"Japan Can't Handle the Coronavirus. Can It Host the Olympics?\\" In that article, he denounced the Japanese government as incapable of responding to the new coronavirus. Y≈çichi Masuzoe, a former Governor of Tokyo and a political commentator, criticized the prime minister, saying, \\"No one might call the person who entrusts the judgment to the Expert Meeting which made many mistakes, and the person who is a puppet of the medical association and the governors association to the prime minister of a country. Can't he hear the voices of the people?\\" Hiroshi Mikitani, Chairman and CEO of Rakuten, criticized the weakness of the PCR test system on Twitter, and then tried to launch a PCR test kit for corporations from a company funded by Rakuten. The kit was not approved for medical use and could not be used for definitive diagnosis. He was blamed by the public and announced that he would postpone the sale. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group CEO, proposed free distribution of PCR test kits for one million people, but he gave up mainly due to criticism from medical professionals. The objection to the plan was that the infection spread through the courier when sending the sample, and that it is difficult for non-medical specialists to push a cotton swab deep into a nose to collect a sample. In contrast, Alibaba Group co-founder and then-SoftBank Group director Jack Ma was being thanked for donating 500,000 test kits to the US and Russia. After that, Son provided an antibody test kit for medical institutions and the like free of charge.

Bl√ºmle was born on 30 January 1937 in L√∂rrach and, from 1972 to 2002, was the Professor of Mathematical Economics at the University of Freiburg and a leading German exponent of the theory of income distribution and external trade theory. He is the brother of the very well known Ernst-Bernd Bl√ºmle. In his research, he combines economic history and theory history. He argues that political economics as such should serve life; theoretical and historical thinking should be linked. During his studies, which he spent in Freiburg im Breisgau and in Freiburg im √úechtland, among other places, he joined the Catholic Student Associations, K.St.V. Germania-Hohentwiel and K.St.V. Carolingia-Friborg, in the Kartellverband. Gerold Bl√ºmle developed a business cycle model as a predator-prey relationship. In this model, there is a cyclical relationship between the investment ratio and the spread or variance of the profits, which is represented by Lotka-Volterra equations.

It is Robbins‚Äô directorial debut. Plot In 1987, a young boy named Ralph receives a VHS camcorder from his parents as a Christmas gift. Ralph quickly sets about filming his own explorations of the neighborhood, ersatz music videos with his best friend, and in particular recording late-night television to see what sort of programming comes on after he goes to bed. Unbeknownst to Ralph, the blank VHS he has chosen to use is, in fact, his parents' wedding video. The film is largely composed of sketches parodying 1980s late-night television, in particular infomercials, porn, and public access television. One particularly surreal talk show features a woman who theorizes that increasing use of VHS cameras will alter people's perception of reality, and thus reality itself. Throughout, snippets of Ralph's parents' wedding are shown, juxtaposed against vignettes Ralph captures documenting the slow deterioration of their marriage, including arguments and apparent infidelity on the part of Ralph's father. Intrigued by a true crime program about a local sorority house fire, Ralph and his best friend sneak away from home on New Year's Eve to investigate the remains, where they encounter the ghost of a girl killed in the blaze. Trying to escape the building, Ralph discovers an antique television set and plugs the camera into it, transporting him within the world of his own VHS, which has begun to deteriorate. After meeting with several individuals from the various programs he's recorded, Ralph encounters a younger version of his mother.

The practice dates back generations and is often a rite of passage for Black children.  History  Black youth in the United States have \\"always been warned\\" about dealing with authority figures safely and instructed by their parents or other caregivers on the dangers they face due to racism. Variations of the talk have been conducted in Black families for decades or generations; the practice \\"dates back to slavery and has lasted centuries\\". Utne Reader called the talk \\"a rite of passage\\" for Black children. Judy Belk, writing in the Los Angeles Times, called the talk \\"an unfair but necessary burden we carry in the Black community, one we reluctantly pass down\\" and \\"a painful ritual.\\" In 2020, during and after the George Floyd protests, some Black commentators called for white parents to have a similar talk with their children on how to behave when they witness racist behavior and how to be anti-racist.  Content  The conversation often focuses on how to de- escalate encounters with police especially given the high frequency of Black men being pulled over for minor, insignificant or non-existent issues, also referred to as driving while Black. Sometimes the talk addresses encounters with white supremacists or vigilantes. The \\"talk\\" has been described as an example of preparation for bias in racial-ethnic socialization and typically addresses specific advice in dealing with interactions with law enforcement. Brooks et al. (2016) described the type of advice for those confronted by law enforcement while driving: * Pulling over your vehicle right away * Keeping hands visible on the steering wheel and not making sudden moves * Not reaching for items in your wallet or glove compartment, without informing the law enforcement officer first * Being as polite as possible, using \\"Yes sir, officer\\" * Not arguing, even if you are right The perception of a need for these behaviours has been described as racialized legal cynicism. According to PBS, the talks usually include instructions such as: According to Vox, for Blacks in the United States, \\"a typical police stop turning into a violent encounter is a very real, terrifying possibility.\\"  Depiction  The New York Times made a short documentary in 2015 featuring the experiences of Black Americans in having this conversation with their children and their memories of their own parents' conversations with them. A 2016 episode of Black-ish featured three generations of a Black family watching television as a verdict in a police brutality case was announced; ABC rebroadcast it June 2, 2020, in response to the Floyd killing and protests. PBS created a two-hour documentary, The Talk: Race in America, in 2017. Procter & Gamble produced a commercial called \\"The Talk\\" in 2017. A 2018 episode of Grey's Anatomy included a Black couple having the talk with their son. In 2019, PBS station WFYI, the SALT Project, Trinity United Church of Christ and Christian Theological Seminary partnered to develop a short video for young Black men called \\"Get Home Safely: 10 Rules of Survival\\". On August 4, 2020, British TV channel Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring the experiences of Black Britons in having this conversation with their parents. Stars who contributed included Rochelle Humes, Tinie Tempah and Leigh-Anne Pinnock. A 2018 book for 4-to-8-year-olds, Something happened in our town,' recommended having the first talk prior to preschool and another when they start venturing independently into public space.

He was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War.  Early life and career  Charles L. Banks was born on July 30, 1914, in West Milford, New Jersey. He was raised in Newark and was appointed to the Virginia Military Institute upon graduating from high school. At VMI, he studied artillery and liberal arts, graduating 5th in his class in 1936. Banks was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps and was assigned to the 10th Marines at Parris Island, South Carolina. By 1939, his battery moved to San Diego, California and joined the 15th Marines. There, he met and married Elizabeth A. Moses, the daughter of Brigadier General Emile P. Moses. Banks then attended the U.S. Army's field artillery school at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Afterwards, he served as an instructor of the Aerial Observer Course at Marine Corps Base Quantico.  World War II  In January 1942, Captain Banks was assigned to the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, then headed by General Holland Smith. In August 1942, Smith and Banks both transferred to Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet. In October, Major Banks was appointed as the executive officer of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion. The 4th Marine Raider Battalion arrived at Espiritu Santo Island in March 1943, where it joined the three other raider battalions to form the 1st Marine Raider Regiment. Banks transferred to the 1st Marine Raider Battalion in April, replacing Lieutenant Colonel Samuel B. Griffith as the executive officer. The regiment moved to Guadalcanal in May, where the Marines prepared for the invasion of New Georgia. On the night of July 4, Banks and the other raiders made an amphibious assault at Rice Anchorage. On July 9, Banks organized and led a patrol and led it forward of the front lines at Enogai, aggressively engaging the Japanese. This action enabled his regimental commander, Colonel Harry B. Liversedge, to escape from an untenable position. On July 20, his battalion attacked Bairoko. After fierce fighting for seven hours, Banks reconnoitered a trail which allowed the wounded to be evacuated and supplies to be delivered. The battalion withdrew the next day and Banks later rode a surfboat across the enemy-held Bairoko Harbor to rescue three men who were adrift in the Kula Gulf. In August, the Marine Raiders withdrew from New Georgia and returned to Guadalcanal, where he contracted a tropical disease in September. In October, Major Banks took command of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion and later went to New Zealand with his battalion to go on liberty. In January 1944, Banks was awarded the Silver Star and his first Legion of Merit for his actions at New Georgia. In February 1944, the 1st Marine Raider Battalion was redesignated as the 4th Marine Regiment at Guadalcanal. Banks was later promoted to lieutenant colonel before returning to the United States in May. He was assigned to Headquarters, Fleet Marine Force Pacific in San Diego. In April 1945, Banks took command of 1st Battalion, 24th Marines, holding this position until the end of the war.  Korean War  After World War II, Banks was stationed at Camp Pendleton and then at the Boston Navy Yard. When the Korean War broke out, Lieutenant Colonel Banks was given command of the 1st Service Battalion, 1st Marine Division. Banks quickly reorganized his battalion and led his Marines in the amphibious assault at Inchon in mid-September 1950. He continued leading his battalion during the subsequent recapture of Seoul by the end of the month, and the landing at Wonsan in October. Banks' outstandingly led his battalion, supplying the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division along with several other regiments. For his service, he earned his second Legion of Merit. In November, Lieutenant Colonel Banks' battalion and the rest of the 1st Marine Division marched north and were in the Chosin Reservoir area by the end of the month. On the morning of November 29, a Chinese regiment from the 58th Division assaulted the supply dump area of Banks' battalion. Banks reacted quickly and deployed his Marines in a defensive perimeter, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and successfully repulsing the attack. A second and more determined enemy assault followed, in which the perimeter was penetrated and several oil dumps caught fire from mortar fire. Despite this, Lieutenant Colonel Banks led his Marines in repulsing this second attack. Banks then organized his remaining Marines and led them in inflicting over 50 percent casualties on the enemy regiment over the next week. For his actions during the Chosin Reservoir campaign, Banks was awarded the Navy Cross. In January 1951, Banks was appointed as the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, 1st Marine Division. He held this position until May when he returned to the United States. He was also promoted to colonel and awarded his third Legion of Merit for his service.  Later career and life  In the fall of 1954, Colonel Banks began attending the University of Utah where he studied law and commanded the NROTC. From November 1957 to January 1959, he served as the commanding officer of the 1st Marine Regiment. After completing his assignment, Banks retired as a brigadier general from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton. After retirement, Banks worked for the Kaiser Engineering Company in Oakland, California. He died on February 22, 1988.

The reason for this delay was most likely the fact that the concert was never carried live to TV, but, instead was edited from multiple recordings of the concert including the rehearsal and debut. Unlike the DVD version, the television broadcast was instead split into two distinct sections; separated by a question and answer segment with those who recollect memories of the history of the Party. This Q&A; was hosted by narrator Kim Jong-il Prize Peoples' Artist Pek Sung-ran (Korean: ÍπÄÏ†ïÏùºÏÉÅÍ≥ÑÍ¥ÄÏù∏ Ïù∏ÎØºÎ∞∞Ïö∞ Î∞±ÏäπÎûÄ) and was most likely held during the intermission period. Following this, the interviewees perform a song.

She became a 20th Century operatic singer often called either a coloratura or lyric soprano who had training in the Toronto Conservatory of Music and the American Conservancy of Music in Fontainebleau, France. She performed a few years in France and Italy in the earlier 1920s where she picked up the stage name, and then began a prolonged career touring in America soon with the National Music League, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, broadcasts on the NBC Radio Network, and other orchestras across the United States, often returning to Montana, before semi- retiring in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1940.

BiographyBorn and raised= Ruth Kellogg Waite, later known as either Maria or Marie Montana at times, was born January 23, 1893, in Wallace, Idaho, to John Kellogg Waite, age 34 born in New York, and Alice May Bunyard age 18 and born in California. More than a decade before Ruth was born, her father John/Jack was an athlete giving jumping and wrestling exhibitions, held records, and was a pugilist of some success, * who praised black boxer Peter Jackson and not John L. Sullivan, whom he had once boxed and lost to, it was later said. He had also suffered badly from a fight in Salt Lake City, so the story goes, against six policemen who clubbed him to insensibility and suffered a cracked skull. He had been arrested November 1880 though there is no mention of injuries* * and still went on to his career boxing and athletics. Married by 1890, the couple survived an avalanche that inundated the town of Burke, Idaho. Jack joined a sheriff department in Montana and later was appointed as a deputy to US Marshall William McDermott during his term 1894 - 1898. Jack then went prospecting and partnered with later Lt. Governor Archibald E. Spriggs for a copper mine, of which they were directors.* * Along the way Jack joined WoodmenLife Insurance company. The 1900 US Census has Ruth second oldest child after a son Eddie born 1891, and followed by son William born 1897, and daughter Grace born 1899; the family was living in Helena, capital of Montana. Another son, also named John Kellogg Waite, was born in 1901. At the time of Jack's death in 1902 the oldest child in the home was nine years old Ruth.* * Jack had been found shot in the right side of his head with a 44 Colt Revolver in his right hand still smoking. It was judged a self-inflicted wound from which he died 12 hours later. He was considered generous to a fault though he had a gambling problem both winning and losing large amounts of money through reputation vs facts of the details varied. He was also known to complain about pain in his head and had bouts of depression. That particular night he spent out all night with friends drinking; the death was also felt a temporary insanity by some of his friends. The community Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks held a funeral,* and the insurance settlement was done. The family moved to Lewistown in central Montana. Ruth Waite was related to the New England Foote family via Betsey Newton, daughter of Amasa Foote of Smyrna, New York. Betsy was Ruth's paternal grandmother who also died in 1902 as did her son, Ruth‚Äôs father. =Early performances= Waite developed a reputation as a singer. Her debut as a soloist was four years after the death of her father in a production of The Mikado in January 1906* * when she was just turned 13 years old. In May she participated in a fundraiser for St. Mary's School of Lewistown giving the recitation, performed in a pantomime skit, and singing, at the graduation ceremony* * and was at that year's town July 4 celebrations. In late 1907 she sang at the Bijou Theater in Lewistown, and the following spring was in a concert supporting role followed by returning to the Bijou in May. She sang again in the fall including Kate Vannah's Goodbye sweet day.* * another's performance of the song is at Goodbye, sweet day. In 1909 she won a piano in a newspaper subscription contest that ran several months for the district constituting Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad areas. Later in 1909 she sang in concerts in September and November, * The 1910 US Census has her in the household of Alice Waite with older brother Edward living in Lewistown. Alice was unemployed but Ruth's older brother was a bookkeeper and Waite herself was listed as a telephone operator. That year she was being called the \\"Lewistown songbird\\" in various performances in Lewistown, and performed on into the beginning of 1911. * She then attended a wedding followed by further community performances in the summer.* * After those six performances across 1910-11, in 1912 she attended a baby shower while still employed as a telephone operator. Visiting performers came that year and Waite was among those aiding one of their performances.* * Many of the Waite family including Ruth turned out for the town 1913 new year ball. Further local performances followed and now expanding into Great Falls with nine performances and plays.    * Her older brother Edward returned home from his work in China that summer. =Musical career=The Toronto Conservatory Now 20 years old, late in 1913 came the news that Waite was going to the Toronto Conservatory of Music, (later called the Royal Conservatory) and left in 1914. She was back to visit Lewistown in the summer,* * and joined in a community performance. Then she was back to the Conservatory. She gave a recital in Toronto the spring of 1915 accompanied by German pianist Viggo Kihl,* * She was back in the area in February 1916. It was said she finished her third year at the Conservatory though in fact it was just two years, and was talking about visiting her brother in China come June. She had graduated with the degree of \\"Licentiate of the Conservatory of Toronto of Music\\" (LCTM) in what was more often a four year program \\\\- and was their highest degree \\\\- and did some instructing at the Conservatory her last year there. She had to pass subjects in piano, harmony, counterpoint, history and rudiments of music, senior sight singing, learn and perform a variety of songs in six languages and styles. At her last recital in Toronto she presented Tschaikovsky's Jeanne d'Arc and Air Des Adieux, Berlioz's L'Absence, Wagner's Traume, Henry Purcell's Nymphs and Shepherds, Mozart‚Äôs \\"L‚ÄôAmero‚Äù from Il re pastore and Voi Che Sapete to positive reviews. She also sang with a Catholic boy's choir in Toronto with her voice described as ‚Äúspiritual, combined dramatic feeling‚Äù. And back in Lewiston before her trip to the Orient she gave a recital including traditional songs \\"Love will find the way\\", \\"Meeting of the Waters\\", Purcell's \\"Nymphs and Shepherds\\", Dashing White Sergeant set to music by Henry Rowley Bishop, O That 'Twere Possible by Arthur Somervell, and Herbert Brewer's Fairy Pipers that were well received at the Judith Theater with publicity in various towns.  * * In August she attended a function for Montana Governor Sam V. Stewart for which she gave an impromptu performance of Robin Adair and was called again \\"the Lewistown song bird\\". Far East In September 1916 Waite applied for a passport with destinations listed in the Orient of Hong Kong, Japan, Java, and Siam, leaving first on the SS Shiny≈ç Maru from San Francisco. The passport application said her overall trip was recreational and to visit her brother. She extended the passport in October 1916 and a second extension in October 1917 while in Shanghai, China, during the Republic of China period. Soon two brothers of hers were in China - her second brother had left in March in 1917. She returned in December 1917. America had officially entered World War I in April. It was later said she performed amidst this more than a year in the Orient. A \\"Miss Waite\\" is noted singing in a March fundraiser for the American Red Cross. Before Europe A little more than a year after returning from the Orient, she is singing an Ave Maria at the Young Women‚Äôs Catholic Patriotic Club in New York. The January 1920 US Census has Waite living in Manhattan listed as a music teacher and with her sister Grace who was studying music. Waite performed for the Temple Israel Community Center in Manhattan during the year as well. She performed at the Rialto Theatre in August. * * In November‚ÄìDecember she performed in New Orleans, Louisiana.* * In mid- December she was back in the New York area performing at the Branford Theatre of Newark, New Jersey. In February 1921 she performed at the Broadway-Strand theater of Detroit, Michigan,* followed by the same chain in St. Paul, Minnesota,* and back to Detroit with the same chain of theaters about mid- March where she did several shows with appearances there extended into April. Later she said she had gained a scholarship for attending the American Conservancy of Music in Fontainebleau, France, from the Conservatory in Toronto. In May 1921 Waite applied for a passport naming her residence as New York, and expected to travel for study in France, Italy, and the British Isles, leaving on the SS Paris June 23, 1921. She had an affidavit from her uncle Edward F. Waite, 4th district court judge of Minnesota and supplemental communications from Ruth to Edward for her birth certificate. She then performed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in early to mid-June. * * France and Italy She was at the first year of operation of the American Conservancy of Music in Fontainebleau, France, and back and forth to Italy; in 1940 the Conservatoire advertised she was a graduate. News began of her travels in September 1921* * though she had arrived in June. In October she was profiled in the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune and the Daily News, already noting she had studied there, described as \\"possesses a soprano voice of exceedingly fine quality\\", and was going off to Italy but had to delay in order to sing at the wedding of Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia October 9. There were 85 students who attended June 25 to September 25 and the school planned to grow to 100 the next year. Students were recommended by governors of 36 states in addition to recommendations of local communities; New York was the source of 21 of the 85 students. The school was run under the French Ministry of Beaux-Arts and the Municipality of Fontainebleau. First place awards for the first school season was awarded to 7 students including Waite, who was noted as recommended from Chicago. It is not clear what Waite did the winter of 1921-2. In July 1922 a movie was released, The Hardest Way, filmed in France featuring Fannie Ward which included Waite in a role - the movie was reviewed negatively though.* * She later says, \\"...I departed with my [savings].... The war has done sad things to the Italian national art. There are not to-day enough places for native singers, not that the opera houses in Russia and Austria and Germany are mostly still in darkness. The American girl has a desperate time even to get a hearing. ... The musical authorities over there expect the American aspirant to pay for a chance at a debut, but many Americans cannot afford to pay. ...the coldest winter I ever spent was in that home in Florence, with its stone floors and stucco walls and wee small china stoves into which I daily stuffed thirty good cents worth of wood to get a faint flicker of heat. ... After [a while] I just stayed in bed till noon, studying my Italian grammar and my Italian repertory, while the winds whistled about me and my courage supplied the warmth.... all too soon that [savings] had melted. My teacher said I was ready for my debut....\\" Her teacher was Ernestina Bruschini in Florence. By January 1923 news arrived back in Montana echoed in a few cities that she had arrived in Milan, Italy, and more publicity of her background with various details to note - she had already taken up the stage name of Marie Montana, and her father as a deputy Marshall had died, if not how.  The Italy tour was under the Benito Mussolini regime of Italian Fascism and later in life it was said by a family member that \\"non-Italian names were unpopular\\". Reports of her efforts in Milan were good but she anticipated coming home. * She later related an anecdote about her break through to the Italian stage: > \\"... one day I met a very honest and kind Italian who knew the situation and > gave me good advice. ‚ÄòMy dear, you‚Äôll have to wait long to get a hearing > when you cannot pay. But - at length - you‚Äôll get it. It will come this > way... some singer will be ill and if you can go on - in any part - without > a rehearsal perhaps - you‚Äôll make your bow....‚Äô At least after nearly three > years waiting, I heard that the Musetta in a very humbug‚Äôs little opera > company had taken suddenly ill... I didn't know the part of Musetta... but I > hurried to that manager... asked for an audition. ... I used Spanish Carmen > swagger and fire for Italian Musetta.... I forgot my American restraints. I > forgot everything but the terrible, urging anguish tugging at my heart which > said to me all the time ‚Äônow‚Äôs your chance!‚Äô... So I sang Musetta, with the > fire of my desperation. ... 'brava‚Äô he said.... ‚Äôbut you can never learn the > entire role in the short time left to the opening.‚Äô (she said) ... It won't > cost you a lira if I do not learn it, and if I don't you can hire somebody > else.‚Äô He agreed....\\" She had three days after the initial audition to try to learn the part or be paid nothing. The lead of the show required extra rehearsals so she actually had more time. She said: \\"The critics were kind.\\" * * The role of Musetta is in La boheme - and later she called this her big debut to the Italian stage, and is categorized as a lyric soprano role. Though she was approved of overall, the company was a financial disaster. In March she was profiled in Lewistown, and echoed in other states, having moved on from Milan, though not mentioning the death of her father as a suicide.   This is when it was reported she had performed in La boheme, was back at the Conservatory, and was to return to Milan for Rigoletto as Gilda the next season. She left Paris for Italy again in August for a tour.* * It repeated she had been in La Traviata, (which was a performance in Genoa,) La boheme, Rigoletto, and added she had performed in Manon. Recently in Paris she also done concerts at the Hotel Majestic, as it was called then, and a Fourth of July at the Cercle de l'Union interalli√©e and would return for performances with the Concerts Colonne, also in Monte Carlo, and then in Switzerland. In October 1923 she applied for a passport in Milan. It was typed up rather than in her own hand writing and includes some mistakes. A couple of years were shaved off her age and noted her father born in Wallace, Idaho, instead of New York. At some point she also visited Algiers. She was profiled in Montana again in spring 1924 - the new news was she was staying another season, had sent pictures, was now in the opera Les p√™cheurs de perles and looking to return to America in the summer,* * however she stayed on now in a new performance of La Scala again in Milan.* * She also heard of an awarding going on in America and made a wreathe for an osteopathic doctor which was brought by woman doctor to America. She said \\"After four years [in Europe] I finished a season at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples...\\" where she played for another season. She remained in Naples until June 1925. In spring 1925 coverage in Montana hailed her performance reception in France and Italy. A Montana veterinarian planned to visit her in Milan in April, but missed her. She was probably in Paris at the time near returning to America. Returned to America In August 1925 news in Montana was she had sailed on the French SS La Savoie for New York with the positive news of her performance - she registered her permanent address in Oakland, California.* * In September she performed on the first broadcast of the local Catholic radio station WLWL in New York. In October news appeared again in Montana summarizing her music career. In November came the additional news of a visit to Billings.* * Before that, she performed in Connecticut, New Jersey, and then was on radio WHAP as it was advertised in New York city in late December singing folk songs. January 13, 1926, she sang at New York Banks‚Äô Glee Club concert at Carnegie Hall* * and then with the American Orchestral Society concert January 31. In February Waite's god-mother and her husband returned to Montana after hearing her perform at another venue, and the Lewistown Woman‚Äôs Club was arranging a fete to receive Waite with news of a western tour about to start. A major profile in the newspapers including other performers, published in Utah and other states, spoke of her struggles in Italy. March 10, 1926, she again performed at Carnegie Hall, was scheduled for Tampa, Florida, in mid- March, then in Hackensack in late March,* * but was sick for that performance. She sang at the Unity Church in New Jersey in mid-April.* * She was in White Plains, New York, for the Westchester County Music Festival May 20‚Äì22, at which she sang five songs including some selections from Songs of India in German from Songs of the East by Granville Bantock, At the end of May she sang in a performance featuring women composers which was covered nationally.             * * In June this was followed by a small blurb of publicity echoed in many states.   * A profile was published in San Francisco where she was in August saying in part she had qualities of a coloratura soprano as long ago as her performances in Naples. It recalled the same background and added some of the roles she had played: debuted as Mimi, then Violetta in Genoa, then San Carlo company in Naples and lauded in Corriere about her performance as Gilda as a coloratura soprano, then Rome as Micaela where she won an ovation. Then she played Lucia again to complimentary coverage. In September she had performed in San Fernando. Then she went to Las Cruces, New Mexico, for the Department of Music at State College in Hadley Hall concert series. In early November she was in Casper, Wyoming, where she sang Deh, Vieni non Tarbot by Mozart, In the Silent Night by Rachmaninoff, Lass with the Delicate Air Michael Arne, Il Bacio by Luigi Arditi, and the Ave Maria by Bach, * adding Christ went up into the Hills by Richard Hageman, a folk song from Kentucky, a negro spiritual Lil David, Play on Your Harp, when she performed in Billings,  * then in Lewistown, Great Falls November 9, Dillon on the 10th, and on to Santa Rosa, California, on the 16th for a concert at which she switched in Crying of Water by Louis Campbell-Tipton for Lil David, Play on Your Harp,    * and a fundraiser November 18 at which she added When I was Seventeen, * * possibly the translation of a Swedish folksong or in the native tongue. Later in November she gave a performance in Shreveport, Louisiana, and in December she was in nearby Monroe where she was called a lyric soprano.* Following this tour it was announced a flower was named after her - a variety of Dahlia. In January, 1927, she performed in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at which she swapped in some other songs: O sleep why does thou leave me by Handel, Thomas Linley's The Lark Sings High in the Cornfield and Invitation au Voyage by Henri Duparc, renditions of Chanson du Papillon, Sur l'Eau , Modest Mussorgsky's \\"Little Star so Bright\\", Ungeduld by Schubert, and St√§ndchen by Richard Strauss - and was billed as a coloratura soprano. * * In March she performed in Tampa including Overture Anacr√©on by Cherubini, a song from the introduction of the 3rd act of Lohengrin by Wagner, the aria Me Voila Seule by Bizet, Adagio Pathetique by Benjamin Godard, and various folks songs.  She also sang at some clubs* * and at a hotel.* The review of the earlier performances was she was good but not great, and as a lyric soprano* * \\\\- while more positive review covered her at the hotel. She was scheduled back in Orlando on March 18, then quickly she was in a performance in New York at Town Hall where she sang German, Italian, French, and English songs and the aria from Bizet's The Pearl Fishers.* * There were mixed reviews of her performance. In May she attended and performed in the Central Kentucky Choral Society symphony which was broadcast on radio WHAS in which she sung \\"Siccome un di Caduto\\" from The Pearl Fishers. Later in May she sang with the Albany, New York, choir for their Mendelssohn concert at the Chancellor‚Äôs Hall. ‚ÄúWholly delightful was the Albany debut of Miss Marie Montana‚Ä¶ Here is an American girl who can challenge most of the finest sopranos in their prime. She has everything. Purity of tone, that the most accurate instrument could register, poetry of expression and a power that conjures thoughts of great operatic climaxes.‚Ä¶\\"* * National Music League In June Waite won an audition as soprano for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for an August concert managed by the National Music League,* * with an aria from Louis by Marc-Antoine Charpentier and in a vocal quartet performance on Giuseppe Verdi‚Äôs Rigoletto.* * Programs are available at * She was soon advertised under their management. That performance series was at the Lewisohn Stadium and broadcast over radio WJZ as it was then known in New York,* * which was widely re-echoed across the NBC radio network. The rest of the summer and fall is an unknown. The following December she sang at Carnegie Hall with the Cleveland Orchestra which included Israel by Ernest Bloch, La Procesion del Rocio by Joaqu√≠n Turina , La Damoisselle Elue by Debussy, and \\"The Golden General\\" by Rimksy-Korsakov.* * She also sang with the Women‚Äôs University Glee Club with Debussy's The Blessed Damozel. In February 1928 it was announced Waite was to be the prima donna in recently developed opera Hugh the Drover which was being produced by the British Embassy in Washington, DC.* * Afterwards she sang on radio WMAL as it was known then in Washington DC, news of which was also in other states.  * * In earlier-May she was at the 35th Annual May Festival at the University School of Music of Ann Arbor, Michigan.* * Then she joined with the 100plus voice Alamance Festival Chorus, half from Elon College, at the North Carolina Federation of Music conference held in Sanford, North Carolina, and at another concert at the college itself, where she joined in \\"Inflammatus\\" from Stabat Mater by Rossini and Italian Street Song by Victor Herbert, * * In July news was released she was on her way to visit her uncle Judge & Mrs. Edward F. Waite in Minnesota on her travels from New York to California for a performance at the Redlands Bowl, and stopping in Lewistown too. A profile of her was published in Montana and mentions some other recent performances like the May Festival in Ann Arbor and at the Chicago Symphony.* * She was soon in Billings where she sang some new songs: Qui la Voce Sua Soave by Vincenzo Bellini, local favorite No, No, John, Francis Hopkinson's My Day have been so wondrous Free, Believe me if all those Endearing Young Charms, Un bel d√¨ vedremo from Madama Butterfly by Puccini, Wir Wandelten by Brahms, Stornellata Marinara by Pietro Cimara, and negro spirituals Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen and Oh, Didn't it Rain,* * and was at the summer Lyceum at Cheney near Spokane. She performed in Seattle on radio KFOA in late July while visiting her mother who was then living there. She commented about her stage name: ‚ÄúIt is Italian and somehow they would listen longer to Maria Montana than to the American Ruth Waite. It was Maria in Italy, but when I found that I was being called Mariah at home I changed it to Marie. You see I am not really a relative of Bull Montana,\\" (referring to the then famous Italian-American professional wrestler and actor.) News was released in August of a 40 concert series of performances by Waite in California in the fall. She returned to the Redlands Bowl, in San Bernardino County, California, * She then arrived in Los Angeles received with several social functions. By mid-September she was in back Oakland at the Women's Club's kick off of a season of concerts.* * Later in September she sang at a Church in Lewistown, with a profile recalling how she had sung in weddings, funerals and movie theaters, while she was visiting her sister. Many details of her performances were repeated with an occasional additions and again being called a coloratura soprano.* * At the end of September she performed at a high school at Ventura, California, and over in Oakland. In October she performed at the Ebell of Los Angeles and a school, again being called a lyric and coloratura soprano, * * including many of the songs previously mentioned but adding The Last Rose of Summer, The Gospel Train, and Annie Laurie.   Later in October she performed at the Fontana Clubhouse in San Bernardino, and at the end of October was singing at the Mills College in Oakland.* * In mid-November she sang at the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Manhattan,* * and then in New Jersey for the Thursday Morning Club. Waite then returned to the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church for the next two Sundays at the beginning of December. She then returned to Altoona adding The Sandman German Folk song, Pierrot by Wintter Watts, \\"My Lover is a Fisherman\\", (from Songs of India as well) by Lily Strickland, At Parting by James Hotchkiss Rogers to the songs she performed.* * Waite returned to the Lutheran Holy Trinity Church and sang in mid-January 1929. A couple days later she was back on the National Concert Orchestra broadcasts to be echoed on the NBC radio network singing some of her known songs: Crying for Waters, Sandman, and The Lass with the Delicate Air.    In early February she sang at the Natural Science Auditorium in Iowa City, Iowa, performing many of her known songs,  and then at the Emery Auditorium in Cincinnati in later February adding many folk song arrangements and new songs: Waken, Lords and Ladies Gay, Moods , Tell Me Not of a Lovely Lass by Cecil Forsyth, Oh, that we two were Maying, Viking by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, So Sweet is She by Patty Stair, \\"Full Fathom Five\\" by Thomas Dunhill, \\"Wings of Night\\" and \\"Pierrot\\" by Watts, Parade of the Wooden Soldiers by Leon Jessel, A Franklyn's Dogge by Alexander Campbell Mackenzie, What from Vengeance by Gaetano Donizetti. A critic review her performance in Cincinnati said the writer ‚Äú...hereby proclaims the natural beauty of her voice, charm of platform manner and the technical equipment... as a ranking artist.... There is no inclination to explain the spell of enchantment that it casts.... not the slightest wavering from pitch and always there is excellent control.... In the essentially dramatic utterance she had full opportunity in the ‚ÄúOne Fine Day‚Äù aria... Songs old and new, classical, emotional and modern, and negro spirituals made up her regular program..... please an audience of considerable patrons who relished what they heard, applauded as friends and relatives are want to do....\\" Late in February she performed at the Mecca Temple in New York substituting for a sick soprano for the American Orchestra Society. She twice performed - the first with some ‚Äúconstricted upper tones‚Ä¶ but the audience recalled her again‚Ä¶ repeated the entire aria. These same upper tones were then much freer and her pitch less open to question.\\" In March she was back on NBC stations * * and substituted in a Baltimore performance as well where she sang the Louise aria from the opera of the same name by Giuseppe Verdi. Late in March she was in the Lindsborg, Kansas, Messiah Festival, (a festival that is still going on.) She went on to performances in Montana, and then in April was in Madison, Wisconsin, for a Maennerchor concert performing German, Austrian and Finnish folk songs and arrangements plus I Hear America Singing by Harvey Bartlett Gaul and being called a coloratura soprano.  A critic said she ‚Äúproved popular from the first number. The generous sprinkling of folk songs found in her two groups admirably fitted both the easy grace with which she sang them and the smooth sweet quality of her voice.... (with other songs) with Miss Montana‚Äôs voice displaying power in addition to the sweetness she had given her lighter songs.\\" Another said: ‚ÄúMarie Montana, soprano soloist, carried her part in a clear, fine, well-trained voice, easily audible above the men‚Äôs chorus. ‚Ä¶ Apparently, solo work with large choruses is Miss Montana‚Äôs forte. Because her voice is strong and clear rather than very sweet, Miss Montana‚Äôs work with the chorus was more enjoyable than her individual groups. Her sea selections were particularly good, however.‚Ä¶ particularly fine dramatic ability‚Ä¶ excellently sun with gayety, buoyancy, and convincing vocal dramatization.\\" Another recalled the show in an end-of-the-year review as \\"one of the best ever given\\". Meanwhile in later April she was in Pittsburg, Kansas, at the State Teacher‚Äôs College where she joined in their Messiah performance,  following which she briefly lost her voice for a time, before several performances again at the end of April and early May at a all-Kansas choir conference* * where she was sometimes billed as part of the ‚ÄúOratorio Quartet of New York‚Äù and sometimes as a soloist.  * She was still on National Music League‚Äôs list of performers in California and was profiled in Arizona. She was soon in the Apple Blossom Festival of Keene, New Hampshire, among singers for a concert held mid-May, and performed in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, where she was in June and then again in later July, * with a performance in-between in Massachusetts. There is a gap in mentions so far the earlier of the summer of 1929 - her next known performance was in mid- October in Zanesville, Ohio,* * still listed with the National Music League and coming to Arizona later in October where she was called a lyric coloratura soprano.  She opened with The Puritans by Bellini, sang Old English, modern Italian and German songs, ending with the aria from Hamlet; a critic said: ‚ÄúMiss Montana won the approval of the large audience by her graciousness of manner and clearness of tonal quality.‚Äù She gave three encores and, ‚Äú[in a Hamlet aria] she evinced a power and range unequaled in any of the other selections.\\" As the Wall Street Crash of 1929 began October 24 she continued her performances. Late in October she performed for teachers in nearby Albuquerque adding an aria from Amleto by Franco Faccio to her performance repertoire. In November she appeared in Staunton, Virginia, and then was in a Santa Clara, California, fundraiser towards the end of November, and at Van Buys Philharmonic auditorium ending up then in nearby Los Angeles,* * and days later took a plane to Oakland to visit her sister, but was back in Los Angeles for a reception for another soloist by the end of November. Early December she was up the west coast up to Vancouver There she performed 13 songs: \\"Aria Qui la voce\\" from Puritana by Bellini, \\"O No, John\\", Gods All Powerful by Handel, In the Silence of Night by Rachmaninoff, Little Star by Mussorgsky, Beautiful Art Thou by Herbert E. Hyde, Stornellata Marinara by Cimara, the aria of Ophelia from Hamlet by Faccio, Wings of Night by Wintter Watts, Boyhood by Garnett, Daffodills by Wohlfarth-Grille, The Peace Flower by Bantock, Midsummer by Amy Worth. For that performance a critic said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶with a voice of much substance, brilliant in quality, with fine carrying power and the ability to project her music wholeheartedly.‚Äù Not agreeing all songs were done well but ‚Äúthe Handel number delivered with seizing vocal power and dramatic instinct.\\" while another said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶very fine phrasing‚Ä¶ excellent examples of precision‚Ä¶a powerful voice of which she has excellent command at times, her high notes in the forte were rather forced and occasional low notes were not as clear as they might have been but the aforementioned numbers were on the whole thoroughly pleasing performances with beautiful clear tone in the softer passages and we felt that they were particularly suited to Miss Montana‚Äôs essentially dramatic style of interpretation.\\" The Great Depression in the United States was deepening but there was an announcement of a number of performances across the west coast: Phoenix and Albuquerque, Arizona, Boulder, Colorado, Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, Vancouver, Bellingham, and Cheney, Washington. But first she headed east with Cincinnati in December, and opening January 1930, in Danbury, Connecticut for a subscription concert, was in St. Louis by mid-February St Louis, * with a quick dash to Elon College, North Carolina, * and a birthday luncheon in Greensboro. Late in February she was in Staunton again.  A critic said: \\"‚Ä¶a most pleasing personality ‚Ä¶ possesses beauty and graciousness of manner‚Ä¶ beauty of tone, fresh, and pure in quality‚Ä¶ a voice of dramatic intensity, with marvelous breath control, making the sustained phrases most effective.‚Ä¶ The audience was so insistent that (the performers) were obliged to repeat (Ave Maria). The April 1930 US Census had \\"Marie Montana\\", under that name, as a border, employed as a singer, living in Manhattan. A week later she was performing in Cincinnati, * * and a social reception. * She was to visit Butte mid-June and a profile published there reviewed her performances. There was news she planned to appear in Hollywood movie and performances in the west. While there she performed and was recalled to the stage five times, with flowers given to her often.* * She attended many luncheons and dinners.  * * Later in June she performed in Wilmington, California, followed by San Pedro in early July, Austin, Texas, in September, Sacramento in October, and Oklahoma City. √ó California management and performances As the Great Depression deepened, in November she appeared in newspapers managed by Grace Rankin and L. E. Behymer. She played at the Woman‚Äôs Club House in Van Nuys* * with guests from area cities of the San Fernando Valley and beyond. Prolonged applause greeted her performance sections: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ an artist endowed with dramatic grace, magnificently rich voice, and the skill of perfect interpretation.‚Äù Flowers were presented and a reception held with her and Mrs. Fred A. Kellogg recently elected to state office. The last performance known was in December in Ames, Iowa By February 1931 the news was that she living in Van Nays and was then going to the opera with guest. Montana also began to be listed as a famous singers. A week later she performed in Santa Maria.* * She told the story of appearing in Naples for the San Carlo theater for Rigoletto substituting for sick prima donna. ‚ÄúIt takes the young artiste to get her bearings but earned an ovation for Gilda‚Äôs aria 'caro nome' with the orchestra rising to their feet as well.\\" She arrived from Los Angeles for the performance.* * The performance went well and she went to a reception afterwards.* In June she performed in San Francisco. Then the San Francisco Monday Musical Club hosted Montana for a recital at the Greek Theater at which she sang \\"Fuyez √† pr√©sent\\" by Philippe Gaubert. * * Amidst the summer she was booked for performances through NBC Artists Service for the 1931-2 season on the West Coast and radio programs carried back east as well.    * In October she returned to Vancouver * * A critic said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ endowed with an unusually fine voice, admirably disciplined, although at this time it cannot be said it was always sure in intonation‚Ä¶. In the matter of musicianship this singer is happily equipped, but it is to be regretted that she invested many of her songs with that innate vulgarity known as the ‚Äúdownward slur‚Äù‚Ä¶. Moreover, she did not always succeed in surrendering her personality in penetrating the underlying beauties of her music. The songs‚Ä¶ were rendered with genuine artistic taste and distinction.‚Ä¶ unfortunately, Debussy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMandoline‚Äù lacked the necessary rhythmic flow and delicacy of colors. Gaubert‚Äôs ‚ÄúAh Fuyez a Present‚Äù on the other hand proved much more effective in imagination.‚Ä¶ The aria from 'Louise,‚Äô which concluded the printed list, was more conspicuous for its vocal opulence than its interpretive insight.‚Äù* Another critic addressed who attended the performance much more than the performance itself.* Afterwards she scheduled to go to Medford, Oregon, and to the College of the Holy Names in Oakland to sing. She was back with the San Francisco Symphony later in November. That performance was called \\"a great triumph\\" by one critic who had come to the city.* * She was profiled noting some details - that mother was from San Francisco, and a grandfather was a \\"49er‚Äù coming to California for the gold rush. The critic here went on: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ won so outstanding a triumph‚Ä¶[from her October performance] that she was immediately reengaged as soloist for the popular concert ‚Ä¶ Nov 20‚Ä¶. (reviewing it) Alexander Fried, critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄôShe made her ‚Ä¶ debut a remarkably successful occasion. Fresh charm of voice and lyric sentiment warmly appearing were impressive in her singing‚Ä¶. Time and again recalled to the platform she responded to applause at last with a welcomed repetition of the ‚ÄòCarmen‚Äô song.‚Ä¶ similar praise‚Ä¶ by Marie Hicks Davidson‚Ä¶ (and) Marjory M. Fisher‚Ä¶.\\" In later November she was again on NBC radio out of San Francisco, * and there was a public posting of her responds to a fan letter.* In the deepest part of the Great Depression she was coming to Butte and Dillon Montana to visit and perform on her way back to east. * However she did not appear in public for a performance until later October in Madison, New Jersey, nearly a year later,* * and then again when she was spotted in the audience of another performance. New York Nearly four months after that she performed in January 1933 for a composers concert singing excerpts from Lazare Saminsky work The Plague \\"Gagliarda\\".* * and in April was back on NBC radio WJZ. Now in the shadow of the worst of the Great Depression, she had performed weekly from December 1932 to June 1933 for the New York Holy Trinity Lutheran Church again along with several other soloists.   * * A friend visited her in New York in December. As the Great Depression was slowly loosening its hold on America, for the 1933-4 season she was also part of Santa Barbara's season of performances though her specific appearance was not detailed. Mid-February, 1934, she was on NBC radio stations WEAF & WMAQ, and in March was in a Brooklyn club performance as part of a quartet singing Rubinstein.* * In mid-April she was again on NBC radio.* * A few days later she was in a Brooklyn choral society church concert. Montana and the West In May 1934 came the news that she was coming to visit and teach a ‚Äúmaster class‚Äù in Billings, Montana.* * She was in Hardin in late June, then Billings at the Fox Theatre again reviewing her musical career.* One performance was a fundraiser for the school.* * In Later June she was back in Lewistown. She was a guest and performed at the Congregational Church at the end of June in Hardin. She was invited to give a concert for Moose lodge group in July. Her appearances now framed as a tour of the state, and a concert in Great Falls in mid-July. Back in Lewistown she gave a talk on her life in Italy. Some details soon mentioned was that she was taught by Maria Brucschenem, Nadia Gontaruk, and the previously mentioned Esperanza Garrigue; and some 1500 people came to a Billings performance and fundraiser. A few days later she was a guest of the Lions club where she again gave a talk in Great Falls before her performance.* * She was feted at the Ladies Club meeting. and then did that concert for the Moose lodge in Bozeman* and then again Butte.

A critic said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ last Saturday evening‚Äôs concert by Marie Montana was possibly the finest of the lot. It was given, unfortunately, before one of the smallest houses of the season. Here is a young American singer over whom hovers the mantle of authentic greatness. That she is not ranked in the top- flight of today‚Äôs artists is more a lack of lucky incident than any readiness on her part. She has the temperament, she has depth, and above all she has a beautiful, golden voice with a peculiar varied tonal quality. At times her notes are clear and effortless as those of a bird; again her singing suggests ‚Äúthe horns of elf land, faintly blowing‚Ä¶.\\"* Maria attended her mother death in late June 1935 in Oakland.* * Maria returned to sing a duet at the Bach festival in Carmel. She had arrived in mid-July and gave the concert; a critic said: ‚ÄúAlive and responsive from the crown of her head to the tips of her toes, her voice soured thrillingly over the sonorous, full-bodied orchestral accompaniment, bespeaking her love and appreciation for this great music.\\"* * These performances were remembered as part of the first such Bach Festival.* * A few months later she performed for a store sponsored club concert. In May 1936 she was a judge in the South California Festival contest.* * Six months later she performed in Van Nays* and performed a couple weeks later in Los Angeles as part of a lineup of performances at the Trinity Auditorium.* In December she sang in another Oakland concert.

The community also held a meeting to hear a Bah√° º√≠ who was visiting from Alaska. As of 1943 she was known back in Lewistown as a vocal teacher in California and her past concerts in the Lewistown area. In June the Minneapolis Bah√° º√≠s held a public meeting. In September then member of the US National Spiritual Assembly Amelia Collins came to Minneapolis and met with community members. This was after a year of three race riots in America, and a national campaign was announced to take place across the final three months of the year to be on the theme of \\"race unity\\"* * a central form of the Bah√° º√≠ teaching of the oneness of humanity. Indeed the Minneapolis Bah√° º√≠s were part of this campaign when, in a couple weeks, they held its first a meeting of that campaign.* * Around the same time Jeynne Marie Stapleton pioneered to further the goals of the First Seven Year Plan, of raising a Bah√° º√≠ community in every state, from Minneapolis to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which succeeded. That year was part of a series of meetings that was held in Sioux Falls.* * The Minneapolis community held another meeting on race issues in a couple weeks and then a more general one at the Center in November. Across 1944 Montana does not otherwise appear in newspapers. The Bah√° º√≠ community she was part of did keep up a level of activity. Indeed in February her uncle Edward and another spoke as the local Bah√° º√≠s hosted its third race unity event of the campaign at their Center. A couple weeks later another public meeting was held broadening the theme to \\"world unity\\". Another community meeting bringing Bah√° º√≠s from Minneapolis and St. Paul together, amidst the general society antagonism between the cities, came in mid-April in a convention to elect delegates to the national convention. This was in fact a new development in the broader Bah√° º√≠ organization. Previously Bah√° º√≠ delegates represented their specific assembly community - now they were elected from the whole state's Bah√° º√≠ population. The interest in that year's national convention was high and many of the Minneapolis community went as it was the 100th anniversary of the founding of the religion. This national convention took place among the limitations and privations of World War II going on including limited boarding options in the Chicago area, and wavers and rationing that affected travel. Some 900 were planned on attending the convention from across America and some 1600 plus attended the final meeting at what was then called the Stevens Hotel as it was called then including attendees from Central and South America. The delegates and guests would get a specific printed program. A full text was indeed produced summarizing the first Bah√° º√≠ century. A radio program was part of the festivities and a print rendition of the program was made. Members of that year's national assembly elected included Horace Holley, Louis Gregory, Dorothy Beecher Baker, and Amelia Collins all of whom later were named as a Hand of the Cause of the religion, the highest appointed position available in the religion. In June a series of Bah√° º√≠ speakers began to come at the Center in Minneapolis. The first was Orcella Rexford. Rexford was listed as one of a few women who \\"single-handedly\\" established new Bah√° º√≠ communities by giving an extended series of public lectures on then-popular topics and then inviting people to attend a series of classes on the religion. Indeed she was the first to do so. She was soon followed by Chinese aviator and peace activist Hilda Yen in July, two more speakers in September,* * which were followed by community observances.* * In February 1945 the Bah√° º√≠s hosted a \\"color line\\" meeting with a panel with Jewish and Christian and Bah√° º√≠ speakers. In March the Bah√° º√≠ delegates elected their end of World War II Minnesota representatives to the national convention to elect the national assembly. They were Montana and Marie Tetu. Alas that year no national convention was gathered and instead members voted by mail* * and the same individuals were elected. In April the Bah√° º√≠s hosted a speaker's return to Minneapolis from her efforts in Latin America. World War II ended in Europe but continued in Asia until September. Between those events in June another Bah√° º√≠ came through who had gone to Colorado, then the community hosted a North Dakota visitor in October, and Montana and Mrs. Kenneth Klein were noted in the newspapers going to a regional Bah√°¬¥√≠ conference to be held in Sioux Falls.* * Another speaker this time from the local Urban League in November. Late in the period of service of the 1945-6 national spiritual assembly a member retired for reasons of health - Roy Wilhelm - resulting in a by-election that Montana would have participated in. This was the first time this had happened. The election resulted in adding Helen Elsie Austin to the membership. In February 1946 Montana was again elected as one of the delegates to the national Bah√° º√≠ convention. In March she went to New York for a Bah√° º√≠ Naw-R√∫z meeting to commemorate the new year, held on the 21st, possibly attending a conference on music while there as well, and then went to attend the national convention in April which was indeed held. This convention announced the beginning of a new plan, the Second Seven Year Plan, by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, with four goals: the wider spread awareness of the Faith in Latin America, the completion of the interior ornamentation of the House of Worship, raising the various some communities to the state of national organizations - for Canada to form its own, along with regional ones for Central and South America, and initiating a campaign of Bah√° º√≠s to reach Europe in the post-war period.* * Later should undertake her own travels to Europe. The members of the national assembly elected that year were, in order of the number of votes received, Elsie Austin, Philip Sprague, Horace Holley, Dorothy Baker, Amelia Collins, George Latimer, Edna True, Paul Haney, and William Kenneth Christian. Messages were received from Germany, where Bah√° º√≠s had been held in concentration camps, and care relief packages were being organized to be sent to Europe and the Philippines, and Bah√° º√≠ pioneers, who were expected to support themselves, began to volunteer. See Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Europe. In October Montana performed a song at a Bah√° º√≠ meeting in Minneapolis. Though the nature of the meeting was not reported in the Star Tribune she sang ‚ÄúHow beautiful upon the Mountains‚Äù by F. Flaxington Harker as part of a series of interracial meetings. In January 1947 the Bah√° º√≠s had a short show on local radio, and began to seek the legal recognition to perform legally recognized marriages.* * A Madison, Wisconsin, Bah√° º√≠ came to town to speak at the Center in February, and a pair of sisters came through on their way moving in Switzerland.* * In October another speaker came through amidst a regional meeting of Bah√° º√≠s, and another in November including another talk before a local church. One Minneapolis Bah√° º√≠ attended the Louhelen Bah√° º√≠ School in January 1948, while Montana herself went in July to give a talk at another institution - the Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School - and gave performances including songs from multiple countries, languages, and religious backgrounds announced as a lyric soprano.* * Upon her return in August she went with her uncle for a summer vacation in Canada. Meanwhile Ruth Moffett, another of those women who had success raising up Bah√° º√≠ communities, spoke in Minneapolis. The community advertised the observance of the Birth of Bah√°'u'll√°h, followed by a talk by a visiting Bah√° º√≠ held at the Nicollet Hotel. In 1949 the Bah√° º√≠s held their state convention in February, as well as a local observance of International Youth Day. They then advertised their new year observance with talks from various local leaders, and a youth speaker from India attending Dunwoody College of Technology gave a talk in mid-July. Later in July Montana, accompanied by Helen Frink, went on a tour to West Coast Bah√° º√≠ communities. A 1949 state guide book named Montana singer as a prominent singer. There was the November observance for Bah√°'u'll√°h, and another meeting for Bah√° º√≠ speakers including one back from Europe. =Most of the 1950s= In 1950 Bah√° º√≠s held their state convention in January, and there was a showing of color slides of Israel in February, and a visiting Bah√° º√≠ in March.* * In July the local community observed the holy day of the Martyrdom of the B√°b and the Birth of Bah√°'u'll√°h then observed in November, followed by Horace Holley came and spoke about the progress of the Wilmette House of Worship in November. In March 1951 the Bah√° º√≠s in Minneapolis observed their new year, and Montana was one of speakers for the May observance of the Bah√° º√≠ holy day of the Declaration of the B√°b. In about 1951She arrived in Canada in 1941, see p78, was then assigned to Winnipeg less than a year later, see p79, and been in Winnipeg for 10 years before leaving for Minneapolis: former Polish diplomat Ola Pawlowski left her position in Winnipeg and encountered Montana: ‚ÄúI took leave of the Polish community [ed- in Winnipeg] and the Bahais and took the bus to Minneapolis. I was the guest of Maria Montana, a very gracious lady who had at one time been an opera singer but at that time kept house for her old father and was a very active member of the Bah√° º√≠ community. At her home I met a lady who epitomized the range of backgrounds found among Bah√° º√≠s. This lady arrived in a long baby-blue Cadillac, swathed in silver fox furs, bedecked in diamonds and awhirl with flowers, lace and feathers. But that evening she gave an excellent talk on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The next day she gave me a ride to Chicago.‚Äù In early October a Bah√° º√≠ community talk was held, followed later October when Montana managed the Minneapolis Bah√° º√≠ community public meeting to observe UN Week at the Center. In December the Bah√° º√≠s held their state convention. In January 1952 Bah√° º√≠s observed World Religion Day, and in March Montana gave a talk for the Bah√° º√≠ community observance of Naw R√∫z at the Center. In July the community observed the Martyrdom of the B√°b, and joined in observing the launch of a holy year in October commemorating the centenary of Bah√°'u'll√°h's experience in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l which began the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and the observance of the Birth of Bah√°'u'll√°h in November. In January 1953 Bah√° º√≠s held World Religion Day, and in February Montana was a guest in Oakland, California, looking at presenting concert related to the Bah√° º√≠s. That year the House of Worship was finished,* * and the community held its observance of the Declaration of the B√°b and the Martyrdom, with a major conference held that year and launching a plan, the Ten Year Crusade, for the world wide spread of the religion. In October Florence Mayberry came to give a talk, followed by another traveling Bah√° º√≠ in November. In January 1954 Bah√° º√≠s held World Religion Day again,* * and in February Montana was one of the speakers for the Minneapolan Bah√° º√≠ community observance of National Brotherhood Week.* * The Bah√° º√≠s held their Naw R√∫z meeting in March, the Declaration of the Bab in May, the Martyrdom with a slideshow of developing Bah√° º√≠ sites in Haifa. In September the period of the introduction of the religion in America was noted with an event at the Center. In October Florence Mayberry returned for a talk at the Center.

In March came the New Year observance, followed by another giving a talk based on the Dawnbreakers text for the Declaration of the B√°b observance. A special mention came the same day of the razing of the Bah√° º√≠ Center in Tehran, Iran, and instance of the Persecution of Bah√° º√≠s. A Bah√° º√≠ wrote a letter to the editor afterwards speaking to the facts of the situation. The Martyrdom observance was then held in July, In later July a couple spoke at the Center about their recent trip to Turkey.

A Bah√° º√≠ came again from Latin America giving a talk about her experiences. A few days later another Bah√° º√≠ spoke on the anniversary of the religion reaching America. In October the Bah√° º√≠s added observing the anniversary of the founding of the UN at the Center, and the observance of the Birth of Bah√°'u'll√°h in November.

In January 1957 World Religion Day was observed and were part of a community wide observance campaign of Brotherhood Week. Naw R√∫z was observed, and the Declaration of the B√°b.

In later March Montana's uncle had had a stroke at the Athletic Club and didn't recover - he died late in April. In going through his papers she found a nearly finished letter she thought worth forwarding. A talk was offered in mid-April at the Bah√° º√≠ Center, and Bah√° º√≠s returned from an international conference in earlier May. In July the Bah√° º√≠ observed the Martyrdom of the B√°b, and news arrived of the death of one of the Bah√° º√≠s that had gone on to Switzerland.

According to the wording of the Constitutional Act, the Queen can also demand that Ministers be impeached and brought before the Court of Impeachment. However, in practice only Government has this right. The Court consists of up to 15 Supreme Court judges appointed on seniority, as well as 15 members appointed by the Folketing's parties from outside the Parliament. These members shall be appointed for a period of 6 years. The Court of Impeachment was established by the Danish Constitution in 1849. The Court of Impeachment differs from the ordinary courts (see Courts of Denmark) in its particular composition and in that indictments, unlike in ordinary criminal proceedings, aren't arisen by the Danish Prosecution Service but by the Folketing or the Monarch. The Court of Impeachment can only hear cases relating to a minister's tenure ‚Äì if charges are to be brought against a minister for other forms of crime, the indictment must be brought in the ordinary courts. While the Danish Constitution allows the Court of Impeachment to deal with such cases, it has never been used. In the interests of confidence in the party-political independence and impartiality of the judges of the Court of Impeachment, it may be problematic that the non-judicial judges of the Court of Impeachment are chosen by party-political politicians of the Danish Parliament. Historical experience shows that politically appointed members of the Court of Impeachment have tended to judge according to the party-card. Several members of the Court of Impeachment are former members of parliament. Since the Court of Impeachment was instituted in 1849, five cases have been brought before the Court, but only two Ministers have been found guilty. In 1910, the former Minister for the Interior , was ordered to pay a fine for negligence in his supervision of Den Sj√¶llandske Bondestands Sparekasse (The Zealand Farmers‚Äô Savings Bank) (the Alberti case). In 1995, the former Minister for Justice Erik Ninn-Hansen, was given a suspended sentence of four months imprisonment for having prevented Tamil refugees from bringing their families to Denmark (the Tamil Case).

He wrote a reader for German studies which was used for higher education in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria, until it was banned during the Kulturkampf. He published a hymnal, Cantate!, which was used by several Catholic dioceses and became a model for common hymnals. Some of his own hymns, including paraphrases of Latin hymns, are part of recent hymnals, both Catholic and Protestant, such as \\"Komm, Sch√∂pfer Geist, kehr bei uns ein\\" as a paraphrase of the 9th-century hymn for Pentecost, Veni Creator Spiritus.  Life  Born in Drolshagen, Bone was the eldest of six children. His parents, Math√§us Bone and his wife Elisabeth, n√©e Kramer, ran a small button factory, an inn and engaged in farming.Gertrud Wegener: Literarisches Leben in K√∂ln 1750‚Äì1850. vol. 2: 1815‚Äì1840 (= Beitr√§ge zur k√∂lnischen Geschichte, Sprache, Eigenart, vol. 78).

He studied philology, philosophy and theology at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universit√§t Bonn, graduating in 1835. He completed the exam for teaching (H√∂heres Lehramt) with distinction at age 21. From 1835, he was a teacher on probation at the royal Gymnasium in D√ºsseldorf (now the ). He received a permanent engagement at the Marzellengymnasium (now Dreik√∂nigsgymnasium) in Cologne from 1838. He also taught German at the H√∂here T√∂chterschule der Geschwister Schmitz, which was directed by Christine Schmitz, who later became his wife, and her sisters. In 1841, Bone was appointed Oberlehrer at the new (now Silverberg-Gymnasium), in Bedburg. Bone became director of the Gymnasium Petrinum in 1856.Joseph Kehrein: Biographisch-literarisches Lexikon der katholischen deutschen Dichter, Volks- und Jugendschriftsteller im 19. Jahrhundert. Woerl, Z√ºrich 1868, p. 31. In 1859, he was appointed director of the Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium in Mainz, initiated by Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler. He received the Order of Philip the Magnanimous for his pedagogic achievements in 1864. Due to the Kulturkampf, Bone was forced into premature retirement on 3 April 1873.Werner Pelz: Die Amtsenthebung von Heinrich Bone. Ein Beitrag zum Kulturkampf im Bistum Mainz. In: Archiv f√ºr mittelrheinische Kirchengeschichte, 1993, pp. 347‚Äì358. In 1876, his German reader Deutsches Lesebuch f√ºr h√∂here Lehranstalten was banned from use in schools in Hesse and Prussia. He moved to Wiesbaden in 1882, after his two sons died, teaching German again at the H√∂here T√∂chterschule. He returned to Mainz in 1890. When he became severely ill in 1892, he moved to Hattenheim, where he died on 10 June 1893.  Legacy  Correspondence = Bone had a large circle of friends, with whom he corresponded. Clerical leaders included Cardinal Melchior von Diepenbrock of Breslau, Cardinal Johannes von Geissel and Cardinal Philipp Krementz of Cologne, Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler of Mainz, Christoph Moufang, Bishop Paul Leopold Haffner of Mainz, Johann Anton Friedrich Baudri of Cologne, and Bishop Konrad Martin of Paderborn, who wrote 250 letters to Bone which are extant. Cultural personalities included Philipp Veit, a painter and gallerist with whom he founded a Christlicher Kunstverein (Christian Art Association), the painter Friedrich Overbeck, the musicians Felix Mendelssohn and Max Bruch, and the politician Carl Schurz, who remembered Bone in his memoirs. = Pedagogy = Bone achieved influence through works such as Deutsches Lesebuch f√ºr h√∂here Lehranstalten, which appeared in two volumes and 67 editions from 1840. It was also used in schools in Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria. Due to the Kulturkampf, it was banned from use in schools in Prussia and Hesse from 1876. = Hymns and hymnal = Title page of Cantate! Bone published the hymnal Cantate! (Sing!), a collection of 444 songs, which appeared between 1847 and 1879 in seven editions. It was the first Catholic hymnal used in multiple German-speaking dioceses. A book with melodies for the songs appeared in 1852. Bone published traditional Latin hymns as the basis for singing in church, and also translated medieval and Baroque texts into contemporary language, such as \\"Komm, Sch√∂pfer Geist, kehr bei uns ein\\" as a paraphrase of the 9th-century Veni Creator Spiritus, to make the return of traditional hymns to Catholic services possible. He also wrote new hymns. Some of his creations remain in recent hymnals. The common German hymnal Gotteslob of 1975 contained several songs from Bone's Cantate!, some with revised wording. Some were included in its second edition of 2013, and some also in the Protestant hymnal EG. In the following list, the GL number refers to the 2013 edition, with the former number in brackets: * GL 222 (112) \\"Herr, send herab uns deinen Sohn\\" for Advent, after Veni, veni, Emmanuel * GL 258 (158) \\"Lobpreiset all zu dieser Zeit\\" for New Year's Day, also EG 550 (West), first two stanzas * GL 329 (220) \\"Das ist der Tag, den Gott gemacht\\" for Easter, stanzas 1,2,5 * GL 351 (245) \\"Komm, Sch√∂pfer Geist, kehr bei uns ein\\" for Pentecost, after Veni Creator Spiritus * GL 142 (462) \\"Zu dir, o Gott, erheben wir\\", for the beginning of a service * GL 532 (584) \\"Christi Mutter stand mit Schmerzen\\", a paraphrase of the Stabat mater * GL 522 (587) \\"Maria aufgenommen ist\\" for Assumption of Mary * GL 526 (589) \\"\\", a paraphrase of \\"Omni die dic Mariae\\" The Te Deum paraphrase by Ignaz Franz, \\"Gro√üer Gott wir loben dich\\", became popular in the version of text and melody in Cantate!

He was \\"bred to the law\\": Sir Bartholomew Dillon, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, was his elder brother. This Sir Robert must not be confused with Bartholomew's grandson Sir Robert Dillon (died 1597), who became Chief Justice off the Common Pleas a year after his grand-uncle's death.Pollard p.135 The confusion is understandable since their careers overlapped and as Kenny points out the records of the King's Inns do not always make it clear which Robert Dillon is being referred to.Kenny p.65 He followed his father and brother into the legal professon and became Attorney General for Ireland in 1534.Balll p.206 In 1536-7 he accompanied Patrick Barnewall, the Solicitor General for Ireland, on a crucial diplomatic mission to England.Hart pp.33-34 One purpose of the mission was to prevent the Dissolution of the Monasteries from applying to Ireland. They were successful in the short run, but Dillon, like Barnewall, quickly dropped his opposition to the suppression of monastic houses and was duly rewarded. Dillon received St. Peter's Priory at Newton, near Trim, County Meath, which became the principal family seat, the former Carmelite Abbey at Athnecarne in County Westmeath, Pollard p.135 and the monastery of Kilkenny West. He served as seneschal of Kilkenny and Governor of Athlone.

His promotion was described as being a reward for his discretion and learning.Ball p.142 He was, however, at least sixty when he became Chiej Justice; Elrington Ball thought that he was probably nearer seventy. By 1575 complaints about his age and incapacity had reached the point where Elizabeth I was actively seeking a suitable replacement for him.Pollard p.135 Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, described Dillon as \\"much spent in years, decaayed in both sense and body\\".Ball p/142 He was accused of neglecting his official duties entirely: he rarely attended meetings of the Privy Council of Ireland, while he neglected his judicial duties entirely, and had effectively deputised his role as Chief Justice to the second justice.Crawford p.106 Sidney's ally Sir William Gerard, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, referred to Dillon as a \\"scarecrow\\", and lobbied strongly for his removal from office.Crawford pp.106-107 It seems however that no suitable replacement could be found as Dillon remained in office until his death in 1580, when, in Ball's view he may have been ninety years old.Ball p.139 He married Genet (or Elizabeth) Barnewall, daughter of Edward Barnewall of Criickstown and Elizabeth Plunket, daughter of Sir Thomas Plunket , Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and had seven children.

An Earth Day Network Ambassador can be a person, representing Earth Day Network, from a country or a person who travels to other countries to bring awareness to their cause or purpose through addressing the populations, public relations activities and organizing events to minimize Climate change, Environmental degradation, Global warming, Fossil fuels usage, Sea level rise and Environmental impact of the coal industry. Earth Day Network global advisory committee include personalities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco, Princess Lalla Hasna of Morocco, Alan Horn, Anil Kapoor, John Kerry, Anand Mahindra. Today the Earth Day Network is operated in 193 countries and has been celebrating Earth Day globally. Earth Day 2020 was organized as a three-day livestream as Earth Day Live due to COVID-19 pandemic. History History of Earth Day Network = Former United States Senator and environmentalist Gaylord Nelson was concerned about the environmental degradation in the United States after the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. The crisis that took place in the United States waters affected most of the sea creatures, birds and the sea itself. This inspired him to create public awareness about air and water pollution through the student anti-war protests. Senator Nelson produced the idea for a teach-in on universities to the national media, and convinced Pete McCloskey to be his co- chairperson. Later they enlisted Denis Hayes, an environmental advocate, to organize the campus discussions and events. They choose April 22 for the campaigns in order to increase the participation of students, as it was a weekday falling between Spring Break and Final Exams. Hayes formed a national staff of 85 to create events across the land. Their effort soon expanded to include a wide range of faith groups, organizations and others. They named it Earth Day, which immediately grabbed the attention of national media and people across the country. Civil society mobilization have increased with the climate crisis awareness across the globe today. People from around the world are demanding significant and quick action for climate change since they are disappointed with the international environmental lethargy and the lack of ambition in following the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. =Congress passed the Endangered Species Act= The first Earth Day was celebrated in 1970 with the support from Republicans and Democrats, business and labor leaders, farmers and urban dwellers, rich and poor. The U.S. Congress created the United States Environmental Protection Agency and passed environmental laws such as the National Environmental Education Act, the O.S.H Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. These laws have been able to protect and save the lives of men, women and children from disease and extinction of species. = Earth Day 1990 = In 1990, a group of environmental activists approached Denis Hayes requesting him to organize another major campaign for Earth Day once again. Earth Day 1990 campaign drew the global attention, gathering nearly 200 million people in 141 countries, lifting environmental issues globally. Earth Day 1990 was celebrated worldwide and it paved the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro. In September 1995, Senator Nelson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in recognition of his environmental work and for his role as the Earth Day founder. =Earth Day 2010= Earth Day 2010 was the 40th anniversary of the annual Earth Day. In 2010, the environmental community faced a great challenge to combat the cynicism of reticent politicians, well-funded oil lobbyists and disinterested public who denied climate change. Despite these challenges, Earth Day grew stronger and Earth Day Network re-established Earth Day. Since then, Earth Day Network has engaged many people from 193 countries every year into their environmental movements in protecting the planet. Celebrations included activities such as the Great Global CleanUp, Citizen Science, Advocacy, Education, and art. =Earth Day 2020= Earth Day 2020 celebrated its 50th Anniversary on April 22.

Put in place in July 2016 and announced to the public in December of the same year, the scheme aimed to replace the formerly manual system of calculating overpayments and issuing debt notices to welfare recipients with an automated data-matching system that compared Centrelink records with averaged income data from the Australian Taxation Office. The scheme has been the subject of considerable controversy, having been criticized by media, academics, advocacy groups and politicians due to allegations of false or incorrectly calculated debt notices being issued, concerns over impacts on the physical and mental health of debt notice recipients and questions around the lawfulness of the scheme. Robodebt has been the subject of an investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, two Senate committee inquiries and several legal challenges. On 29 May 2020, the Morrison Government announced that it would scrap the debt recovery scheme, with 470,000 wrongly-issued debts to be repaid in full. The total sum of the repayments is estimated to be . In June 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised in parliament for any hurt, harm or hardship cause by the scheme. Inception In 2011, the Gillard Government introduced an automated system to cross-check data between the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink, in order to \\"identify individuals who wrongly received welfare payments when their earnings made them ineligible\\". The plan was proposed by the Minister for Human Services Tanya Plibersek and assistant treasurer Bill Shorten, and sought to gain \\"an extra $71 million to the budget\\". Christian Porter Portrait, Minister for Social Services (September 2015 - December 2017) Measures to create budgetary savings by increasing the pursuit of outstanding debts and investigation of cases of fraud in the Australian welfare system were flagged by the Abbott Government in the 2015 Australian federal budget. Following the 2015 Liberal Party Leadership Spill and 2016 Australian federal election, the Turnbull government implemented an overhaul of the federal welfare budget in an effort to crack down on Centrelink overpayments believed to have occurred between 2010 and 2013 under the Gillard government. In the system established in 2011, Centrelink staff manually checked customer records against data provided by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), generating debt notices at an estimated rate of about 20,000 a year. In July 2016, the manual system was replaced with the Online Compliance Intervention, an automated data-matching technique with less human oversight, capable of identifying and issuing computer-generated debt notices to welfare recipients who had potentially been overpaid. Announced to the public in December 2016, by then- Minister for Social Services Christian Porter, this new automated debt recovery scheme ‚Äì given the colloquial name 'robodebt' by the media ‚Äì was estimated to be capable of issuing debt notices at a rate of 20,000 a week. =Debt recovery efforts= In early January 2017, six months after the commencement of automated debt recovery, it was announced that the scheme had issued 169,000 debt notices, and recovered . Based on these figures, it was suggested that a similar automated debt recovery system would be applied to the Aged Pension and Disability Pension, in order to potentially recover a further . The 2018 Australian federal budget indicated that the Robodebt data matching scheme would be extended into 2021, with the aim of recovering an additional from welfare recipients. Controversy and criticism Opponents of the Robodebt automated process say that errors in the system have led to welfare recipients paying nonexistent debts or debts that are larger than what they actually owe, whilst some welfare recipients have been required to make payments while contesting their debts. In some cases, the debts being pursued dated back further than the ATO requests that Australians retain their documentation. Particular criticism has focused on the burden of proof being moved from Centrelink needing to verify the information, to being on the individual to prove they did not owe the funds, with human interaction being very limited in the dispatch of the debt letters. Politicians from the Australian Greens, Australian Labor Party, Pauline Hanson's One Nation and Independent Andrew Wilkie, have criticized the scheme and it's automated debt calculation methods. The scheme has also been criticized by advocacy groups for people affected by poverty, disadvantage and inequality, including the Australian Council of Social Services and the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. =Allegations of misconduct= Allegations leveled against the scheme by the media, former and current welfare recipients, advocacy groups, politicians and relatives of welfare recipients include: * Welfare recipients committing suicide after receiving automated debt recovery notices for significant sums. * Debt notices issued to deceased people. * Issuing debt notices to disability pensioners.  Senate Inquiries First Senate committee inquiry= The Robodebt scheme was the subject of a Senate committee inquiry in 2017. The inquiry had a number of findings and made a number of recommendations, including: * \\"That a lack of procedural fairness is evident in every stage of the program, which should be put on hold until all procedural fairness flaws are addressed\\". * \\"That the Robodebt scheme disempowered people, causing emotional trauma, stress and shame\\". * \\"That the Department of Human Services has a fundamental conflict of interest ‚Äì the harder it is for people to navigate this system and prove their correct income data, the more money the department recoups\\". * \\"That the Department of Human Services should resume full responsibility for calculating verifiable debts (including manual checking) relating to income support overpayments, which are based on actual fortnightly earnings and not an assumed average; and provide those issued debt notices with the debt calculation data required to be assured any debts are correct\\". =Second Senate committee inquiry= The scheme was again the subject of a Senate committee inquiry, begun in 2019. Initially meant to report its findings in December 2019, this deadline has been extended twice, with the Senate committee due to deliver its report on 19 August 2020. During senate hearings in July 2020, former head of Services Australia Kathryn Campbell denied that the scheme had led to welfare recipients committing suicide after receiving debt notices, despite allegations from Centrelink staff and the family members of welfare recipients who took their own lives. Legal challenges In February 2019, Legal Aid Victoria announced a federal court challenge of the scheme's calculations used to estimate debt, stating that the calculations assumed that people are working regular, full-time hours when calculating income. In November 2019, the federal government agreed to orders by the Federal Court of Australia in Amato v the Commonwealth that the averaging process using ATO income data to calculate debts was unlawful, and announced that it would no longer raise debts without first gathering evidence ‚Äì such as payslips ‚Äì to prove a person had underreported their earnings to Centrelink. In September 2019 Gordon Legal announced their intention of filing a class action suit challenging the legal foundations of the 'robo-debt' system.  Demise  Stuart Robert, Minister for Government Services (May 2019 - ) On 29 May 2020, Stuart Robert, Minister for Government Services announced that the 'robo-debt' debt recovery scheme was to be scrapped by the Government, with 470,000 wrongly-issued debts to be repaid in full. The total sum of the repayments is estimated to be . On 31 May 2020, Attorney-General Christian Porter, who was Minister for Social Services when Robodebt was first implemented, and who had previously defended the scheme, conceded that the use of averaged income data to calculate welfare overpayments was unlawful, stating that there was \\"no lawful basis for it\\".  Aftermath  After weeks of criticism from the Opposition, in June 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised for any hurt, harm or hardship cause by the scheme. As of 31 July 2020, it was announced that had been had been repaid to more than 145,000 welfare recipients.

The formation crops out in the Czech capital, more specifically at Letn√° Hill, after which the formation is named. The type locality is located at Mal√° Strana, Hole≈°ovice district.K≈ô√≠≈æ & Steinov√°, 2009 The more than thick formation comprises a rhythmic alternation of sandstones (greywackes and subgreywackes), quartzites, intercalated with siltstones and shales deposited in marine flysch-like environments. Because of the excellent preservation, including gut remains, of a wide assemblage of early Paleozoic taxa in which trilobites dominate, the formation, which is lean in fossils in many areas but exceptionally rich in what has been interpreted as storm beds, has been designated a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte.  Description  Early Ordovician (470 Ma) Early Silurian (440 Ma) The Letn√° Formation was first formally defined in 1966 by Havl√≠ƒçek and Vanƒõk and crops out in the Prague Basin, a northeast‚Äìsouthwest trending minibasin stretching over between Rokycany in the southwest and √övaly in the northeast. The Prague Basin contains an Ordovician to Devonian succession in the larger Bohemian Massif.Mikul√°≈°, 1998b, p.143 The formation conformably overlies the Libe≈à Formation and is overlain by the Vinice Formation.Fatka et al., 2013, p.96 The Letn√° Formation is the thickest unit in the sedimentary sequence with a thickness of more than between Beroun and Prague.Mikul√°≈°, 1998a, p.5Fatka et al., 2013, p.97 The formation consists of a rhythmic alternation of sandstones (greywackes and subgreywackes), quartzites, intercalated with siltstones and shales with limestone lenses in the upper part of the succession, deposited in a shallow marine environment, representing a flysch deposition in the early Paleozoic. While in most of the layers fossils are absent, certain levels contain a rich assemblage of shallow marine fauna interpreted as storm-induced beds. The concentration of a wide variety of excellently conserved fossils of the Letn√° Formation has granted it the name of a Konservat-Lagerst√§tte, giving insight into the diversification of marine ecosytems.Noheljov√° et al., 2019, p.69 A rather diverse fauna composed of brachiopods, trilobites, echinoderms, conularids, and non-trilobite arthropods has been found in outcrops located between Zdice and Chrustenice. This area probably represented a rather shallow environment in the northwestern part of the basin. The fossils are usually fragmentary and preserved as internal or external moulds associated with angular claystone fragments within quartzose sandstones to siltstones. Accumulations of these fossil remains are commonly found in thick-bedded quartzose sandstones of light-grey and yellow or grey-brown color, which might have been deposited in areas sheltered from wave activity by sand bars. Five communities of marine fauna were identified in the formation. The rich brachiopod dominated Drabovia Community is associated with shallow water, well-sorted quartzose sandstones. The Bicuspina Community, which probably represents a slightly deeper environment, is typically found in the poorly sorted greywackes of the higher horizons of the Letn√° Formation. These two communities constitute the Drabovia-Aegiromena Fauna. In more proximal environments, this fauna is replaced by the trilobite-dominated Dalmanitina- Deanaspis Association, which contains Birmanites ingens and Selenopeltis buchi. The more distal, probably deeper parts of the basin are characterized by a poorly diversified assemblage of trilobites associated with rare graptolites. Lastly, trilobites of the so-called Cyclopygid Biofacies and brachiopods of the Paterula Association are typical for the deepest portions of the Prague Basin. Intertidal (Skolithos ichnofacies) and near-shore (Cruziana ichnofacies) environments are also evidenced by ichnofossils.Fatka et al., 2013, p.98 Fossilized gut remains have been observed in four of the about twenty trilobite species present in the Letn√° Formation: Birmanites ingens, Dalmanitina socialis, Deanaspis goldfussi and Selenopeltis buchi. These four trilobites belong to the Dalmanitina-Deanaspis Association, characterizing rather proximal and shallow environments of the Letn√° Formation. Most of the non-trilobite arthropods discovered in this formation, including forms with non-mineralized exoskeletons, are also found associated with D. goldfussi and/or D. socialis. This suggests that the development of conditions conducive to soft-tissue fossilization was not uncommon in the environment represented by the Dalmanitina-Deanaspis Association.Fatka et al., 2013, p.98  Fossil content  The following fossils were reported from the formation:Letn√° Formation at Fossilworks.org * Trilobites ** Actinopeltis completa ** Birmanites ingensFatka et al., 2013, p.99 ** Calymenella parvula ** Cekovia transfuga ** Colpocoryphe grandis ** Dalmanitina socialis ** Deanaspis goldfussi ** Eudolatites dubia ** Eccoptochile (Eccoptochile) clavigera ** Eccoptochile (Eccoptochiloides) tumescens ** Kloucekia phillipsi ** Pharostoma pulchrum ** Placoparia (Hawleia) grandis ** Plaesiacomia rara ** Platycoryphe bohemica ** Primaspis (Primaspis) primordialis ** Selenopeltis buchi ** Stenopareia panderi ** Vysocania moraveciPereira et al., 2017, p.466 ** Zeliszkella (Zeliszkella) hawlei ** Girvanopyge sp. ** Heterocyclopyge sp. ** Prionocheilus sp. * Non-trilobite arthropods ** Duslia insignis ** Quasicaris bohemica ** Furca bohemica ** Furca sp. ** Zonozoe drabowiensis * Crinoids ** Caleidocrinus multiramus * Lingulata ** Lingula deleta ** Orbiculoidea grandis ** Schizocrania incola ** Schizotreta sp. * Gastropods ** Asinomphalus antiqua ** Bucania draboviensis ** Bucanopsina calypso ** Bucanopsis comata ** Cyrtodiscus procer ** Holopea antiquata ** Tritonophon bohemica ** T. peeli * Paragastropoda ** Antispira praecox * Bivalves ** Astarte convergens ** Concavodonta ponderata ** Grammysia catilloides ** Leptodesma patricia ** Modiolopsis veterana ** Myoplusia bilunata ** Praenucula bohemica ** P. dispar ** Deceptrix sp. ** Palaeoneilo sp. * Crustaceans ** Nothozoe pollens * Ostracods ** Cerninella bohemica ** Crescentilla pugnax ** Cytheropsis testis ** Hastatellina sp. ** Trubinella latens * Rostroconchia ** Ribeiria apusoides * Blastoidea ** Mespilocystites bohemicus ** Anatifopsis sp. * Rhynchonellata ** Svobodaina ellipsoides ** Jezercia chrustenicensis ** Drabovinella draboviensis ** Hirnantia ulrichi ** Drabovia asperula ** D. fascicostata ** D. redux ** Chrustenopora sp. ** Onniella sp. ** Saukrodictya sp. * Craniata ** Petrocrania obsoleta * Strophomenata ** Aegiromena aquila ** Bicuspina cava ** B. multicostellata ** Rafinesquina occulata * Tergomya ** Barrandicellopsis extenuata ** Cytherina graegaria ** Dactylogonia blyskavensis ** Sinuitopsis neglecta * Tentaculita ** Conchicolites confertus * Edrioasteroidea ** Hemicystites bohemicus ** H. velatus * Eocrinoidea ** Ascocystites drabowiensis ** A. cf. micraster ** Echinosphaerites infaustus ** Macrocystella bohemica ** Cystidea obscondita ** Rhombifera bohemica * Stylophora ** Mitrocystites mitra * Soluta ** Dendrocystites sedgwicki * Scyphozoa ** Anaconularia anomala ** Archaeoconularia fecunda ** A. insignis ** Conularia rugulosa ** Exoconularia exquisita ** Metaconularia pyramidata ** Pseudoconularia grandissima ** P. nobilis * Merostomata ** Triopus draboviensis * Polychaeta ** Serpulites sp. * Machaeridia ** Plumulites folliculum * Algae ** Dendrocystis barrandei * Other ** Caryon bohemicus ** Chasmatoporella havliceki ** Versispira contraria  Gallery  Bicuspina multicostellata CRF.jpgBicuspina multicostellata Caleidocrinus multiramus CRF.jpgCaleidocrinus multiramus Duslia insignis 34234.JPGDuslia insignis Holopeidae - Holopea praestans.JPGHolopea praestans  See also  * Fezouata Formation * Folkeslunda Limestone * Soom Shale  References  Bibliography =    Further reading  * R.

Youth Born in Dublin and growing up in the suburb of Lucan, Clarke was on the books of famed academy side Home Farm as a boy. A teammate in those childhood years was future Ireland international Ronnie Whelan. In 1979, both Clarke and Whelan left for England with the latter joining Liverpool and Clarke heading to Leeds United. After failing to make the grade at Leeds he left England for West Germany in 1982. Germany His first contract in Germany was with Borussia Lippstadt, then playing in the Oberliga Westfalen, the third tier of German football and the highest tier in the region of Westphalia. After only a year in Lippstadt, Clarke signed for Hamm outfit Hammer SpVg, also in the Oberliga Westfalen. In 1984 he signed for Blau-Weiss 90 Berlin, then of the German second-tier 2. Bundesliga. He would spend six years with Blau-Wei√ü winning promotion to the Bundesliga in the 1985-86 season. The stay in the top-flight was brief, with Blau-Wei√ü finishing in last-place and suffering relegation back to the second-tier. Clarke remained with Berlin for another three seasons. In 1989 he was offered the chance to return to England to play with Blackburn Rovers but decided to stay in Germany, dropping a division to play for Tennis Borussia Berlin in the regional third tier. He helped them win the Oberliga Berlin in 1990-91 but lost out on promotion to 2.Bundesliga in the playoffs. He retired from professional football in 1992. Later years After hanging up his boots Clarke stayed in Germany, playing local football, including for Berlin side SV Ye≈üilyurt. He is now a golfer, and is currently the club pro at Kallin Golf Club in Berlin.

The books are frank about women's medical issues and Jinner's confidence in women to cope with medical treatment. She is the first woman known to have written almanacs and she and Hannah Woolley are considered the first women professional writers. Their writings show the freedoms that were available during the Commonwealth and the Restoration of the monarchy. Her almanacs provide an insight into female sexuality and related public discussion.

Background The Third Party was recorded in December 1988 over a period of two weeks at Montezuma Recording, Stockholm, Sweden. In contrast to the material written by Shear for his band Reckless Sleepers, the material that would be recorded for The Third Party was more folky and acoustic-based. Shear was initially uncertain whether or not to record or shelve the songs he had written in this style, but decided to record them after his longtime friend Marty Willson-Piper offered him the opportunity to record an album in Stockholm. Shear told Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune: \\"We recorded underground in an old castle, in two booths with a sliding glass door, so we were right next to each other the whole time. We did it all live basically, recording every day for a few hours and then we'd go eat some herring. It was a calm, fun way to do a record.\\" Speaking to Barbara Jaeger of The Record, Shear said of the album: \\"As a commercial consideration, I guess it was pretty suicidal to do a record like this. This is a record where, if you don't like the songs, you won't like the record. But I've never liked records that depend more on production than the songs.\\" Critical reception On its release, Billboard described the album as showing Shear going a \\"Dylanesque route\\". They noted: \\"Songs are tuneful and often moving, but subdued atmosphere and in-the-raw presentation will make this fine work a tough sell, especially among cautious programmers.\\" Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe noted the album's focus on \\"the song and Shear's singing\\". He felt the material was \\"first rate songwriting\\", but added \\"Shear often whines and bend syllables with a bit too much of a Dylanesque bite\\". Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered the \\"bare guitar-and-voice setting\\" to be a \\"mixed blessing\\": \\"Because it strips all artifice from the gentle choruses and stinging verses, it's a good thing. But because The Third Party is so spare, it exposes Shear's lack of vocal control and an unnerving tendency to lapse into early-Dylan mannerisms.\\" Anthony DeCurtis, writing for Rolling Stone, felt the material was sometimes \\"wordy\\" and Shear's vocals sometimes \\"wearying\\", but added he is \\"capable of coming up with telling melodies and memorable images\\". DeCurtis concluded that The Third Party \\"will not disappoint his cult following, even if it is unlikely to expand it.\\" Steve Kort√© of Trouser Press noted the album was an \\"interesting experiment\\" with \\"well-crafted songs\\", but added that \\"a certain monotony results from Shear's unmelodic singing style and the unvarying guitar arrangements\\". Stereo Review criticized The Third Party as \\"an album that recalls nothing so much as a mediocre Bob Dylan bootleg\\". In a retrospective review, Chris Woodstra of AllMusic described The Third Party as a \\"stark, bare-bones acoustic album\\" which \\"allow[s] Shear's songs to come to the forefront\\". He noted the \\"clever craftsmanship\\" and \\"back-to-basics approach\\" on the album, adding that \\"his clever wordplay and interesting turns of phrase [are] allowed the proper platform\\".

He was educated at Cliff House Preparatory School in Southbourne, went to Sherborne School (Dorset) and later attended the Royal Military College, from where he joined the 18th Bengal Lancers in 1916 as a subaltern officer. During the First World War, he served in the Fifth Cavalry Division in France and Belgium and in the Desert Mounted Corps in Palestine and Syria. Bullock was the official cinematographer for General Allenby's arrival in Aleppo. He was an athletic man of 6 feet, 2 inches who not only won boxing competitions at Sherborne School, but later also boxed for the Cavalry Corps. Hunting and photo expeditions led him along the upper Nile and to Kurdistan. After two years in hospital with injuries and various tropical diseases, he was decommissioned in 1923 and later that year \\"in search of health\\" went to Canada, where he met John Hornby with whom he undertook an expedition into and across Canada's Barren Lands.

Churchill had mixed English and American parentage. He was born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England, as the elder son of Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill. He attended Harrow School and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. After joining the British Army in 1895, he saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and by writing books about his campaigns. He began his political career as a member of the Conservative Party and was first elected as a Member of Parliament (MP), representing the Oldham constituency, on 24 October 1900. Dissatisfaction with Conservative government policy caused him to resign his party membership and join the Liberals in 1904. Childhood and schooling: 1874‚Äì1895 Blenheim Palace, Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace. Churchill was born at his family's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, on 30 November 1874, at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power. Direct descendants of the Dukes of Marlborough, his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy, and thus he was born into the country's governing elite. His paternal grandfather, John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the Conservative Party who served in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. His own father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had been elected Conservative MP for Woodstock in 1873. His mother, Jennie Churchill was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman.Anita Leslie. Jennie: The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill, 1969 The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the British Embassy in Paris in April 1874. The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt; according to the biographer Sebastian Haffner, the family were \\"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\\". Churchill, aged six, in 1881. John Spencer-Churchill was appointed Viceroy of Ireland in 1876, with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to Dublin, when the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. It was here that Jennie's second son, Jack, was born in 1880. There has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father. Throughout much of the 1880s, Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged. During this time she had many suitors. Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father. Referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \\"I loved her dearly‚Äîbut at a distance\\". His relationship with Jack was warm. In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, Elizabeth Everest. Churchill nicknamed her \\"Woomany\\", and later wrote that \\"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived\\". Aged seven, he began boarding at St. George's School in Ascot, Berkshire; he hated it, did poorly academically, and regularly misbehaved. Visits home were to Connaught Place in London, where his parents had settled, while they also took him on his first foreign holiday, to Gastein in Austria-Hungary. As a result of poor health, in September 1884 he moved to Brunswick School in Hove; there, his academic performance improved but he continued to misbehave. He narrowly passed the entrance exam which allowed him to begin studies at the elite Harrow School in April 1888. There, his academics remained high‚Äîhe excelled particularly in history‚Äîbut teachers complained that he was unpunctual and careless. He wrote poetry and letters which were published in the school magazine, Harrovian, and won a fencing competition. His father insisted that he be prepared for a career in the military, and so Churchill's last three years at Harrow were spent in the army form. He performed poorly in most of his exams. On a holiday to Bournemouth in January 1893, Churchill fell and was knocked unconscious for three days. In March he took a job at a cram school in Lexham Gardens, South Kensington, before holidaying in Switzerland and Italy that summer. After two unsuccessful attempts to gain admittance to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, he succeeded on his third attempt. There, he was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry, starting his education in September 1893. In August 1894 he and his brother holidayed in Belgium, and he spent free time in London, joining protests at the closing of the Empire Theatre, which he had frequented. His Sandhurst education lasted for 15 months; he graduated in December 1894. Shortly after Churchill finished at Sandhurst, in January 1895, his father died; this led Churchill to adopt the belief that members of his family inevitably died young. Cuba, India, and Sudan: 1895‚Äì1899 Churchill in the military dress uniform of the Fourth Queen's Own Hussars at Aldershot in 1895. In February 1895, Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars regiment of the British Army, based at Aldershot. In July, he rushed to Crouch Hill, North London to sit with Everest as she lay dying, subsequently organising her funeral. Churchill was eager to witness military action and used his mother's influence to try to get himself posted to a war zone. In the autumn of 1895, he and Reginald Barnes traveled to Cuba to observe its war of independence; they joined Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters and were caught up in several skirmishes. He also spent time in New York City, staying with the wealthy politician Bourke Cockran, who profoundly influenced the young Churchill. Churchill admired the United States, writing to his brother that it was \\"a very great country\\" and telling his mother \\"what an extraordinary people the Americans are!\\" With the Hussars, Churchill arrived in Bombay, British India, in October 1896. They were soon transferred to Bangalore, where he shared a bungalow with Barnes. Describing India as a \\"godless land of snobs and bores\\", Churchill remained there for 19 months, during the course of which he made three visits to Calcutta, expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier, and two visits back to Britain. Believing himself poorly educated, he began a project of self-education, reading the work of Plato, Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, and Henry Hallam. Most influential for him were Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Winwood Reade's The Martyrdom of Man, and the writings of Thomas Babington Macaulay. Interested in British parliamentary affairs, in one letter he declared himself \\"a Liberal in all but name\\", but added that he could never endorse the Liberal Party's support for Irish home rule. Instead, he allied himself to the Tory democracy wing of the Conservative Party, and on a visit home gave his first public speech for the Conservative's Primrose League in Bath. Reflecting a mix of reformist and conservative perspectives, he supported the promotion of secular, non- denominational education while opposing women's suffrage, referring to the Suffragettes as \\"a ridiculous movement\\". A depiction of the Battle of Omdurman in 1898; in the battle, Churchill took part in a cavalry charge. Churchill decided to join Bindon Blood's Malakand Field Force in its campaign against Mohmand rebels in the Swat Valley of Northwest India. Blood agreed on the condition that Churchill be assigned as a journalist; to ensure this, he gained accreditation from The Pioneer and The Daily Telegraph, for whom he wrote regular updates. In letters to family, he described how both sides in the conflict slaughtered each other's wounded, although he omitted any reference to such actions by British troops in his published reports. He remained with the British troops for six weeks before returning to Bangalore in October 1897. There, he wrote his first book, The Story of the Malakand Field Force, which was published by Longman to largely positive reviews. He also wrote his only work of fiction, Savrola, a political adventure story set in an imagined Balkan kingdom. It was serialised in Macmillan's Magazine between May‚ÄìDecember 1899 before appearing in book form. While in Bangalore in the first half of 1898, Churchill explored the possibility of joining Herbert Kitchener's military campaign in the Sudan. Kitchener was initially reluctant, claiming that Churchill was simply seeking publicity and medals. After spending time in Calcutta, Meerut, and Peshawar, Churchill sailed back to England from Bombay in June. There, he used his contacts‚Äîincluding a visit to the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury at 10 Downing Street‚Äîto get himself assigned to Kitchener's campaign. He agreed that he would write a column describing the events for The Morning Post. Arriving in Egypt, he joined the 21st Lancers at Cairo before they headed south along the River Nile to take part in the Battle of Omdurman against the army of Sudanese leader Abdallahi ibn Muhammad. Churchill was critical of Kitchener's actions during the war, particularly the latter's unmerciful treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of Muhammad Ahmad's tomb in Omdurman. Following the battle, Churchill gave skin from his chest for a graft for an injured officer. Back in England by October, Churchill wrote an account of the campaign, published as The River War in November 1899. Politics and South Africa: 1899‚Äì1901 Churchill in 1900 around the time of his first election to Parliament. Seeking a parliamentary career, Churchill pursued political contacts and gave addresses at three Conservative Party meetings. At this point he courted Pamela Plowden; although a relationship did not ensue, they remained lifelong friends. In December he returned to India for three months, largely to indulge his love of the game polo. While in Calcutta, he stayed in the home of Viceroy George Nathaniel Curzon. On the journey home, he spent two weeks in Cairo, where he was introduced to the Khedive Abbas II, before arriving in England in April. He refocused his attention on politics, addressing further Conservative meetings and networking at events such as a Rothschild's dinner party. He was selected as one of the two Conservative parliamentary candidates at the June 1899 by- election in Oldham, Lancashire. While campaigning in Oldham, Churchill referred to himself as \\"a Conservative and a Tory Democrat\\". Although the Oldham seats had previously been held by the Conservatives, the election was a narrow Liberal victory. Anticipating the outbreak of the Second Boer War between Britain and the Boer Republics, Churchill sailed from Southampton to South Africa as a journalist writing for the Daily Mail and Morning Post. From Cape Town, in October he travelled to the conflict zone near Ladysmith, then besieged by Boer troops, before spending time at Estcourt and then heading for Colenso. After his train was derailed by Boer artillery shelling, he was captured as a prisoner of war and interned in a Boer POW camp in Pretoria. In December, Churchill escaped the prison over the latrine wall. Churchill stowed aboard a freight train and later hid within a mine, shielded by the sympathetic English mine owner. Wanted by the Boer authorities, he again hid aboard a freight train and travelled to safety in Portuguese East Africa. Sailing to Durban, Churchill found that his escape had attracted much publicity in Britain. In January 1900 he was appointed a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse regiment, joining Redvers Buller's fight to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria. In his writings during the campaign, he chastised British hatred for the Boer, calling for them to be treated with \\"generosity and tolerance\\" and urging a \\"speedy peace\\"; after the war he called for the British to be magnanimous in victory. He was among the first British troops into Ladysmith and Pretoria. He and his cousin, the Duke of Marlborough, were able to get ahead of the rest of the troops in Pretoria, where they demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards. After the victory in Pretoria, he returned to Cape Town and sailed for Britain in July. In May, while he had still been in South Africa, his Morning Post despatches had been published as London to Ladysmith via Pretoria, which sold well. Arriving in Southampton in July 1900, Churchill rented a flat in London's Mayfair, using it as his base for the next six years. He stood again as one of the Conservative candidates at Oldham in the October 1900 general election, securing a narrow victory to become an MP at age 25. In the same month, he published Ian Hamilton's March, a book about his South African experiences, which became the focus of a lecture tour in November through Britain, America and Canada. MPs were unpaid and the tour was a financial necessity. In America, Churchill met Mark Twain, President McKinley and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt; he did not get on well with Roosevelt. In spring 1901 he gave more lectures in Paris, Madrid and Gibraltar. Conservative MP: 1901‚Äì1904 A painting of the young Churchill by Edwin Arthur Ward. In February 1901, Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread press coverage. He associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans, although he was critical of the Conservative government on various issues. He condemned the British execution of a Boer military commandant, and voiced concerns about the levels of public expenditure; in response, Prime Minister Arthur Balfour asked him to join a parliamentary select committee on the topic. He opposed increases to army funding, suggesting that any additional military expenditure should go to the navy. This upset the Conservative front bench but gained support from Liberals. He increasingly socialised with senior Liberals, particularly Liberal Imperialists like H. H. Asquith. In this context, he later wrote, he \\"drifted steadily to the left\\" of British parliamentary politics. He privately considered \\"the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party\\", or alternately a \\"Central Party\\" to unite the Conservatives and Liberals. Churchill in 1904. By 1903, Churchill was increasingly dissatisfied with the Conservatives, in part due to their promotion of economic protectionism, but also because he had attracted the animosity of many party members and was likely aware that this might have prevented him gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government. The Liberal Party was then attracting growing support, and so his defection in 1904 may have also have been influenced by personal ambition. In a 1903 letter, he referred to himself as an \\"English Liberal ... I hate the Tory party, their men, their words and their methods\\". In the House of Commons, he increasingly voted with the Liberal opposition against the government. In February 1903, Churchill was among 18 Conservative MPs who voted against the government's increase in military expenditure. He backed the Liberal vote of censure against the use of Chinese indentured labourers in South Africa, and in favour of a Liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions. His April 1904 parliamentary speech upholding the rights of trade unions was described by the pro-Conservative Daily Mail as \\"Radicalism of the reddest type\\". In May 1903, Joseph Chamberlain, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, called for the introduction of tariffs on goods imported into the British Empire from outside; Churchill became a leading Conservative voice against such economic protectionism. Describing himself as a \\"sober admirer\\" of \\"the principles of Free Trade\\", in July he was a founding member of the anti-protectionist Free Food League. In October, Balfour's government sided with Chamberlain and announced protectionist legislation. Churchill's outspoken criticism of Balfour's government and imperial protectionism, coupled with a letter of support he sent to a Liberal candidate in Ludlow, angered many Conservatives. In December 1903, the Oldham Conservative Association informed him that it would not support his candidature in the next general election. In March 1904, Balfour and the Conservative front bench walked out of the House of Commons during one of his speeches. In May he expressed opposition to the government's proposed Aliens Bill, which was designed to curb Jewish migration into Britain. He stated that the bill would \\"appeal to insular prejudice against foreigners, to racial prejudice against Jews, and to labour prejudice against competition\\" and expressed himself in favour of \\"the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained\\". On 31 May 1904, he crossed the floor, defecting from the Conservatives to sit as a member of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons.

Since 1994 he is a tenured researcher at the Astrophysics Division (AIM) of the Commissariat √† l'√ânergie Atomique et aux √ânergies Alternatives (CEA-Saclay), currently at the level of Director of Research. He directed for 10 years the \\"Cosmology and Evolution of Galaxies\\" laboratory at AIM/CEA-Saclay. He has also served in various administrative position including as scientific advisor to the European Space Agency for the selection of its future space missions (Astronomy Working Group) and member of the evaluation committee on space research and exploration for the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in France.  Biography  David Elbaz's grandparents moved to France from Morocco in the beginning of the 20th century. He was born and raised in the Paris m√©tro area. Despite the fact that his early high school years were rather difficult (he had to repeat twice a school year) in the end he did very well academically and he was admitted in the well known √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Physique (ENSPG) in Grenoble, obtaining his undergraduate degree as an Engineer in 1990. He continued and completed his PhD in Astrophysics in 1994 at the Universit√© Joseph Fourier, also in Grenoble, with a thesis entitled \\"Origine du fer dans le milieu intra-amas et distribution du gaz X dans les amas de galaxies\\". His supervisors were James Lequeux et Monique Arnaud. In 2005 he was also awarded his habilitation from the University of Paris XI. In addition to 14 postdoctoral researchers, Elbaz has supervised 7 PhD students two of which received awards for their dissertations (H. Aussel 1999 and C. Schreiber 2015). Since 2005 he has been also been teaching the \\"Galaxy Evolution\\" course in the Master program \\"Recherche Astronomie, Astrophysique et Ing√©nierie Spatiale de Paris\\".  Research areas  Elbaz has made widely appreciated contributions to a number of areas in observational extragalactic astrophysics using mostly space infrared and submillimeter observations, as is evident by his Google Scholar record and the fact that he has been repeatedly recognized as ISI Highly Cited researcher by Clarivate Analytics. In 2001, relying on new data from the Infrared Space Observatory together with Ranga Chary produced a suite of galaxy spectral energy distribution templates which along with the current knowledge of the galaxy redshift distribution were able to interpret the cosmic infrared background as being produced to at least 70% level from dust enshrouded star formation in luminous infrared galaxies, (which has received ~1300 citations). The advent of the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2003 enabled extremely deep observations in mid-infrared. Elbaz and his collaborations analysing observations from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, demonstrated that the star formation rate of individual galaxies increases due to environmental effects up to a critical galaxy density at redshift one, above which it decreases again, suggesting that galaxy evolution is not independent from structure formation at larger scales in the universe (which has received ~1400 citations). Five years later, using deep far infrared observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, he led a study which revealed that most galaxies across cosmic time form stars in two main modes: one placing them in the so called \\"main sequence\\", where their star formation rate correlates tightly with their stellar mass, and one where the galaxies are more compact and form stars more efficiently departing from this correlation (which has received ~1100 citations). More recently, using observations from ALMA his group discovered a dominant population of optically invisible massive galaxies in the early Universe, which also attracted substantial attention from the scientific community.  Awards  * Chr√©tien Award of the American Astronomical Society (2000) *Prix Jaff√© from the Foundation of the Institut de France (2017) * Member of the Academia Europaea (2019)  Administration and service  Elbaz has been contributing in a number of leadership and service positions for the international astrophysics community, including: * Managing Editor of Astronomy & Astrophysics Journal, 2018 - present * Member of the ESA SPICA Science Team, 2018-present * Member of the Euclid France steering committee, 2013-present * Member of the ESA Astronomy Working Group, 2015-2018 * President of the International Space Advisory Board for the SPICA satellite for JAXA, 2015-2016  Public outreach  Elbaz is very active in public outreach activities which have been extremely popular and has been interviewed regularly on various topics of modern astrophysics from most major media in France, including \\"Le Monde\\", \\"France Culture\\", \\"Sciences et Avenir\\", \\"France Inter\\", etc. Among those his presentations \\"Is the Universe an illusion?\\" (in french \\"L‚ÄôUnivers est-il une illusion\\") and \\"Do we live in a black hole?\\" (in french \\"Habiton-nous dans un trou noire\\") have been viewed over 1.1million times and nearly 500,000 times respectively while the most recent on \\"In search of the killer of galaxies\\" (in french \\"A la recherche du tueur de galaxies\\") which was presented at the Conf√©rence Cyclope in February 2020 has already surpassed 90,000 views. Elbaz has also been writing the scenario and participating in shows which involve science and art. In particular over the past decade he has designed three shows: * \\"La t√™te dans les √©toiles\\" (with the neurobiologist Alain Destexhe and the magician Marc Feld) * \\"Magicosmologie\\" (with Marc Feld) * \\"Jonglerie Astrale\\" (with the juggler Vincent de Laven√®re) which haven been presented in various theatres in France.  Publications  Elbaz has published extensively in various areas of extragalactic observational astrophysics. According to Google Scholar his nearly 300 scientific refereed papers have received over 40,000 citations, with a corresponding h-index of more than 100. He has also been recognised for several years, more recently in 2019, as an ISI Highly Cited researcher by Clarivate Analytics. Elbaz has also authored three books.

He spent his childhood in the village Kraisk, where he studied at the village school till 1999. His father was engaged in entrepreneurial activities, his mother worked as a drawing teacher at school. He graduated from secondary school in a gymnasium with focus on German ‚Ññ 73 of the city of Minsk. He graduated from Russian State Academy of Intellectual Property (RSAIP) with the specialty ‚Äì Law. He studied in Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz with the specialty of an economist. He broke up his studies in Germany due to beginning of active business in Libya. = Business = The first major business-project of Dengov was creation of a musical band \\"Arbat\\", which was successfully implemented and sold to producer center of Maxim Fadeev \\"Monolit\\". In 2008‚Äì2011 he founded the Libyan-Belarusian joint venture \\"Almamar-Almetali\\", which was engaged in construction and design of sports buildings and facilities for the state Libyan corporation LIDCO. In 2011, he participated in construction of the infrastructure for the Africa Cup of Nations in Libya, which in the end was canceled due to the events of the Arab Spring. In 2017, he established Russian-Libyan Trading House, which sells various products in Libya (oil equipment, cereal crops, aircraft, medical equipment, construction materials, electric cables, etc.). chairman of the board RLTH. He currently does business in several countries in the Middle East, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia. He is Advisor to the President of Indonesia's largest energy corporation MedcoEnergi for Libya. At the same time, he is Advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of the Philippines on cooperation with the CIS countries. = Activities on settlement in Libya = In March 2015, on the initiative of Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for the Middle East M. L. Bogdanov, Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation A. S. Delimkhanov, a Contact Group was established Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation for Libya. The purpose of the structure is to facilitate the implementation of the Russian foreign policy through making contacts with various socio-political groups in Libya, analysis of the situation in the country, implementation of some initiatives, and identification of trends and solutions to the Libyan crisis. Lev Dengov was appointed as Head of the Contact Group. A prerequisite for creation of this structure was the appeal of the leader of the Libyan National Army Khalifa Haftar on establishing cooperation with the Russian authorities. From the beginning of his working as the Head of the Contact Group, Dengov managed to establish a dialogue with representatives of all parties to the conflict in Libya: with representatives of the Government of the National Accord in Tripoli, with representatives of the authorities of the eastern part of the country. In addition, he negotiated with the representatives of Misurata, Tobruk, Benghazi, southern Libya, also the Barca region. Contact Group under leadership of Dengov prepared recommendations for the State Duma, the Federation Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the head of the Chechen Republic, contributed to the conduct of the foreign policy, definition of practical policies in the field of counterterrorism, illegal migration, as well as development of bilateral cooperation. The main objective of the work of Contact Group was to create conditions for an inclusive dialogue with the participation of all political forces, regions, as well as the tribes of Libya to ensure the possibilities of settlement through the political process. Contact Group has been actively working with the media with the purpose of informing about the Russian policy in Libya, as well as resisting attempts to distort the actions of the Russian Federation in relation to Libya. The Group also contributed to safeguarding the interests of all parties to the conflict. As a result, equal representation of Libya in Russia was ensured. Since August 2017, the interests of Libya in the Russian Federation have been represented by Mustafa Abu Sayd, an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Libya, Charg√© d'Affaires of Libya. Contact Group was also involved in the liberation of Russian citizens detained in Libya. To achieve the goals in the period from 2015 to 2017 with the assistance of Contact Group, a number of visits of the opposing parties of Russia were carried out, as well as visits of Russian representatives to Libya. In 2015, Khalifa Haftar addressed Dengov with a request for assistance in negotiating with the representatives of the Russian Federation to build relations. As a result, the first visit of representatives of Khalifa Haftar to Grozny was organized, which took place on the May 14 and 15, 2015. The members of the delegation were Bassima Boashi, the first adviser to the general, and Khalid Haftar, the son of the general, as well as other official representatives. In May of the same year, the representatives of Barki addressed Contact Group, and a visit to the leadership of the Obeida tribe from Cyrenaica to Moscow was organized, who were seeking support from Russia in finding options for resolving the internal structure of Libya. In October 2016, at the instruction of the Russian Foreign Minister, Dengov was sent to Tripoli as a special envoy of the Government of the Russian Federation for the first official negotiations with the representatives of the Government of the National Accord that came to power to establish first contacts between the Russian Federation and Libya, as well as to free the remaining citizens. Starting from October 3, Dengov conducted negotiations with the Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya, Fayez Sarraj, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council, Abdurahman Sewehli, the First Deputy Prime Minister Musa al- Koni, the Head of the Investigative Committee under the Prosecutor-General's Office, As- Sadiq As-Sur, and members of the government. As a result of negotiations, in the same month it was possible to return the remaining citizens detained on the tanker \\"Mechanic Chebotarev\\", as well as to meet with Russian sailors from the tanker \\"Temeteron\\". In December 2016, a visit of Agila Saleh, speaker of the House of Representatives of Libya, elected and sitting in Tobruk-based Parliament took place. Within the framework of this visit, meetings were held with S.V. Lavrov, Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation V.V. Volodin, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs L.V. Slutsky, and also deputy A.S. Delimkhanov. By that time, it was possible to agree on the resumption of inter-parliamentary contacts, also to exchange viewpoints on the dynamics of the Libyan conflict. In January 2017, Dengov visited Misrata, where his meetings with the representatives of Al-Bunyan Al- Marsus were held, also the heads of militant groups under control of the Government of National Accord and conducting military operations against IS forces. At the meeting, special attention was paid to the issue of fighting IS in the city of Sirte. In April 2017, representatives of Al-Bunyan Al-Marsus, who are subordinated to the Government of the National Accord, visited Moscow. The delegation was led by Field Commander Mohamed Khalil Abubaker Issa. Within the framework of the visit, meetings were held with M. L. Bogdanov, with the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs L. E. Slutsky, Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council I. M. Umakhanov, and representatives of the Federal National Guard Troops Service. An exchange of views on the development of the situation in Libya was held with a focus on efforts under the aegis of the United Nations to help advancement of the process of national reconciliation in this country. The Libyan side acknowledged a gratitude to Russia for a balanced line in the context of the settlement in Libya, aimed at rapprochement of the positions of various Libyan parties on key issues of the intra-Libyan agenda. On August 2, with the assistance of Contact Group, the Charge d'Affaires of Libya to the Russian Federation began his work at the Embassy in Moscow. In September 2017, Dengov, in charge of Contact Group, arranged a visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the National Accord Ahmed Maytyg to Russia. His visit began with a trip to Grozny and continued in Moscow. Among the issues discussed, the topic of the release of the remaining captured Russian sailors was included. Based on the results of the meetings, an agreement was reached on organizing a working visit of representatives of the Government of the National Consent and continuing the course on development of Russian-Libyan relations. As part of the visit, Ahmed Maytyg held a press conference on the site of the Valdai Discussion Club. On September 14, 2017, a meeting was held with Brigadier General of the Libyan Army Ahmed Al-Mismari in Moscow; during the meeting, Russia's position on the need to maintain contacts with all parties to the conflict was emphasized. In mid-October of the same year, a visit was held by the Libyan delegation led by Deputy Minister of Transport Hisham Abdullah Abu Shkevat. Meetings were held with the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation; roadmap timeline for development of Russian-Libyan economic relations were signed. This visit was organized by a representative of Contact Group from Russian-Libyan Trade House. On September 23, 2017, Money was delegated by the leadership of the Russian Federation for conduct of negotiations in Tripoli. He arrived in Libya on September 24 and within two months met with key officials, including Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeq, Libyan Defense Minister El Mahdi Al Barghathi, Minister of Justice Mohamed Abdulwahid Abdulhamid, and the Head of Security of the Prime Minister Hashim Beshir, representative of the Investigative Committee Rashid Al-Rugbani, Attorney General of Libya, public lawyer Mohamed Abdulwahab, as well as representatives of the tribes of southern Libya (Tubu, Tuareg, sons of Suleiman, Warfalla, Gaddaf) and the leadership of the cities of Ubari, Ghat, Murzuk, Sabha, Gdamez and others. The strategy and prospects for the development of Russian-Libyan relations, the fate of the Russian prisoners, as well as the course and results of the Tunis process were discussed. It was concluded that Tripoli and the south of Libya are disposed to cooperation with Russian and are ready for contacts and exchanges of delegations. As a result of Dengov's mediation, the heads of large tribes, Tubu and Tuareg, who inhabit the southern Libyan city of Ubari, met on November 5 with the Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj to resolve political difficulties arising as a result of the non-recognition of the results of the previously held elections in the Libyan city of Ubari. Tense political situation developed in connection with non-recognition by Tripoli of the results of the election of Governor in the Libyan city of Ubari. Under tense relations between the tribes, the non- recognition of the legitimately elected leader of the city-enclave ‚Äì Ahmed Al- Murtada Abu Seyf ‚Äì could have serious domestic political consequences for the region, where many Libyan tribes live, including large Tubu and Tuareg tribes. The participation of the Russian representative in the political process was highly appreciated by both representatives of the south and representatives of the NTC. The first made an appeal to the Libyan media, highly mentioning the role of Russia in the process of internal settlement. As a result of the meetings, a conclusion has been made that the south of Libya is extremely inclined to the idea of cooperation in matters of migration, security, combating terrorism, humanitarian cooperation, as well as conflict resolution. On December 1‚Äì3, 2017, Dengov took part in the Mediterranean Dialogues Conference, on the sidelines of which a number of meetings were held with officials from Italy, Libya, as well as with the UN Special Representative for Libya Gassan Salam√©. On December 11‚Äì13, he participated in organizing the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Libya, Mohammed Taher Siala, who paid an official visit to Moscow by invitation of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Dengov participated in the negotiations of the Ministers, and also spoke in the framework of the session organized at the site of the \\"Valdai Club\\" ‚Äì \\"Libyan Settlement: Russian Diplomacy 2.0.‚Äù. In 2018, he organized the panel session ‚ÄúLibya‚Äôs Reintegration into the International Economy: Opportunities for Cooperation‚Äù at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Besides Dengov, the Special Presidential Representative for the Middle East and Africa and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, and Libyan Foreign Minister Taher Siyala took part in it. The session was moderated by State Duma deputy, foreign affairs columnist Yevgeny Primakov. = Liberation of Russian and Belarusian citizens in Libya = In September 2015, on behalf of the Special Presidential Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for the Middle East, Deputy Foreign Minister M. L. Bogdanov, a process was organized of release of Russian sailors detained at the coasts of Libya on the ship \\"Mechanic Chebotarev\\" on charges in oil smuggling. As a result of negotiations organized with the Prime Minister of the New General National Congress of Libya Khalifa Al-Ghawil, two citizens and the crew members of the detained tanker Mikhail Chebotarev were returned to Russia. In January 2016, they succeeded to release the remaining seven sailors, who, flew to Moscow with Khalifa Al-Ghawil. Within the framework of the visit of the Prime Minister, meetings were organized with S.V. Lavrov and M. L. Bogdanov. However, in March 2016, the negotiation process for release of the remaining detained citizens was interrupted as a result of the formation of the UN-supported Government of National Accord led by Fayez Sarraj. In October 2016, Dengov held negotiations with Sarraj, Chairman of the Supreme State Council Abdurahman Sewehli, First Deputy Prime Minister Musa al-Koni, head of the Investigative Committee under the Attorney General, As-Sadyk As- Sur, members of the government. As a result of negotiations, in the same month it was possible to return the remaining citizens detained on the tanker \\"Mechanic Chebotarev\\", as well as to meet with Russian sailors from the tanker \\"Temeteron\\". In March 2017, the Russian cargo ship \\"Merle\\" with seven Russian citizens on board was detained in the coastal waters of Libya. The issue of their release rested on Contact Group. In April, it was discussed with the delegation of the Government of National Accord, who arrived in Moscow on a visit. It was led by field commander Mohamed Khalil Abubaker Issa. As a result of the meetings and negotiations held in April 2017, thanks to the work of the Contact Group and the Head of the Chechen Republic, the visit of the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for the Middle East and African countries to Tripoli M.L. Bogdanov to Tripoli was organized, in the framework of which it was managed to release five citizens from the ship \\"Merle\\". Later, in May 2017, the two remaining citizens were released. Since September 2017, Dengov has also been engaged in the release of citizens of Belarus. In February 2018, after long negotiations with the participation of Dengov, it was possible to achieve the release of Belarusian citizen Vyacheslav Kachura in Libya, who had been detained there for six and a half years. Kachura arrived in Libya in June 2011 within a group of international experts from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. In August 2011, they were detained by the revolutionaries, they were charged with cooperation with the regime of ex-President of Libya Muammar Gaddafi. Later, some of the detainees were released, but until the last moment nothing was known about Kachura. In 2018, with the participation of Dengov, two citizens of Belarus, Inna Babush and Sergei Zdota, were released in Libya. They worked there as doctors, but at the end of the contracts, the Libyan authorities did not let them leave the country.

Biography √âliane Vogel-Polsky was born in Ghent on 5 July 1926, one of two daughters. Her parents were Russian Jews who had immigrated to Belgium after the end of the First World War. She attended the Lyc√©e √âmile Jacqmain but her education was interrupted by the Second World War. The anti- Jewish regulations introduced by the German forces of occupation obliged Vogel-Polsky to finish school under a false name with the Benedictine sisters in Li√®ge. Vogel-Polsky enrolled at Saint-Louis University, Brussels for a preparatory law degree in 1944. On 7 July 1950 she graduated with a doctorate in law at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles; she was called to the bar the same year. During her doctorate she first met Marie-Th√©r√®se Cuvelliez and Odette De Wynter. In 1952 with Cuvelliez she became the first woman to win the Janson Prize. In 1958 Vogel-Polsky attended a license in social and international law. She got her special license in social law in 1963 followed by the next grade in 1965. Vogel-Polsky was a strong feminist and in 1966 she supported the strike at FN Herstal and she began feminist studies in 1968. She taught four courses on Belgian labour, social security, international social law and comparative social law and in European social law in 1975. In 1969 she joined the Faculty of Law at the ULB and became a professor in 1991. Though she was best known for her defense of women's rights Vogel-Polsky was a labour law expert and article 119 of the Treaty of Rome is nicknamed Eliane's article. She was also the lawyer in the Defrenne v Sabena (No 2) case about age discrimination. In 1992 she was awarded an honourary doctorate from the University of Lleida in Catalonia for her teaching career. Vogel-Polsky married lawyer Andr√© Albert Vogel and they had 3 children: Jean, Laurent and Alain. They had a company but Vogel-Polsky found it frustrating that she was often sidelined as a woman. Aged 90, she died in Brussels on 13 December 2015.

Work  According to his surviving writing, ibn Wahb was author of works entitled KitƒÅb al-·∏§ujja, KitƒÅb al-ƒ™·∏çƒÅ·∏•, KitƒÅb al-Ta øabbud and KitƒÅb AsrƒÅr al-·∏≤ur æƒÅn. It appears that these are lost (and not mentioned by other sources). However, ibn Wahb's KitƒÅb al-BurhƒÅn fƒ´ wuj≈´h al-bayƒÅn, also known as Naqd al-nathr (, Book on Prose Criticism), survives; it is a study of Arabic style, rhetoric, and the art of the secretary composed from a Shƒ´ øƒ´ perspective, and attempts to deploy Greek, Mu øtazilƒ´ and ImƒÅmƒ´ ideas in examining Arabic writing. This work was in the early twentieth century misattributed to ibn Wahb's contemporary Qudama ibn Ja'far, until a more complete manuscript was discovered in the Chester Beatty Collection by  øAlƒ´ ·∏§asan  øAbd al-QƒÅdir, showing the correct attribution. = Editions = *  æAb≈´  æal-Faraj QudƒÅmahÃ≤ bin Ja ªfar  æal-KƒÅtib  æal-BagÔ∏†hÔ∏°dƒÅdƒ´ [misattributed], KitƒÅb naqd  æal-natÔ∏†hÔ∏°r, ed. by ·π¨aha ·∏§usayn wa-  ªAbd  ºal-·∏§amƒ´d  ºal- ªAbbƒÅdƒ´ (B≈´lƒÅq:  ºal-Ma·π≠ba ªah  ºal- ºAmƒ´rƒ´yah, 1941). * al- BurhƒÅn fƒÅ wuj≈´h al-bayƒÅn, ed. by A·∏•mad Ma·π≠l≈´b and Khadƒ´ja al-·∏§adƒ´thƒ´ (Baghdad: Ma·π≠ba øat al- øƒ´nƒ´, 1967). * al-BurhƒÅn fƒÅ wuj≈´h al-bayƒÅn, ed. by ·∏§ifnƒ´ Mu·∏•ammad Sharaf (Cairo, 1969).

Biography He was the second son of Lord Basil Hamilton (son of William Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton) by his wife Mary, granddaughter and heiress of Sir David Dunbar, 1st Baronet, of Baldoon. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 he commanded a troop of horse under Thomas Forster and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Preston. He was sentenced to death in 1716, but reprieved through the influence of his uncle Lord Orkney. His estates were forfeited, but successfully claimed by his mother, and the forfeiture was reversed in 1733. In 1734 he unsuccessfully stood as the Duke of Buccleuch's candidate for Dumfries Burghs. He advised against another Jacobite uprising in 1739. In 1741 he was returned to Parliament for Kirkcudbright, but died the following year.

Views of the Iwo Eleru skull (right): side, front, top, bottom The Iwo Eleru skull is an archaeological find that was discovered in an excavation site called Iwo Eleru in Nigeria.Don Brothwell and Thurstan Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Jun., 1971), pp. 221-227.Katerina Harvati, Chris Stringer, Rainer Gr√ºn, Maxime Aubert, Philip Allsworth-Jones and Caleb Adebayo Folorunso, 'The Later Stone Age Calvaria from Iwo Eleru, Nigeria: Morphology and Chronology', PLoS One. 2011; 6(9): e24024. Discovery The Iwo Eleru site is a large rock shelter in western Nigeria. The skull was found in 1965 by Thurstan Shaw and his team among over half a million Later Stone Age artefacts at the site.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 221. It was found as part of a skeleton that was buried with a thin covering of soil. The skeleton was excavated and encased in plaster, and the skull was separated from the rest of the body. Date On the basis of charcoal remains that were found surrounding the skeleton, it was initially dated 9250 BC ¬± 200. However, in a 2011 study conducted by Katerina Harvati, Chris Stringer and others, the dating of the remains was revised: with the help of uranium‚Äìthorium dating, a time span of 11.7‚Äì16.3 ka was suggested.Harvati et al, 'The Later Stone Age Calvaria from Iwo Eleru, Nigeria: Morphology and Chronology', p. 5. Description The cranial vault is relatively long and low, and the frontal bone shows moderate recession. The brow ridges are moderately developed for a male and there is no pronounced nasal root. What remains of the nasal area suggest that the nasal bridge was relatively flat, and the evidence from X-rays points to little frontal sinus development.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 222. The upper face is missing except for a small collection of fragments. Parts of the maxillary-molar region have been identified (including the infraorbital foramen) and, based on what survives, it is unlikely that the upper face was large.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 223. The mandible is well developed and has a masculine appearance, although there is no pronounced chin. Apart from two lower premolars, the teeth are not attached to the jaws and it is uncertain where the surviving teeth were originally placed. All the anterior teeth show noticeable attrition and most of the crown has been eroded by wear. Based on the evidence of tooth wear, the age of Iwo Eleru man has been estimated as over 30 years.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 224. What remains of the rest of the skeleton are generally crushed fragments of large bones.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', pp. 224‚Äì225. The shafts of the humeri appear robust and the cortical bone is moderately thick. The shafts of the radius and femur are also robust.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 225. The existing remains suggest he was of medium height and build, and was no taller than approximately 165cm.Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 226. Analysis Don Brothwell and Thurstan Shaw said in 1971 that the sloping frontal vault was more pronounced in Iwo Eleru man than in both later Neolithic and recent sub- Saharan skull samples. However, they also found that the occipital structure, nasal root and the frontal bone of the skull \\"would qualify for identification as that of a proto-West African negro\\".Brothwell and Shaw, 'A Late Upper Pleistocene Proto-West African Negro from Nigeria', p. 227. In 1974 Chris Stringer said that there were surprising similarities between the crania of the much older Solo Man and Omo II with that of Iwo Eleru.C. B. Stringer, 'Population Relationships of Later Pleistocene Hominids: A Multivariate Study of Available Crania', Journal of Archaeological Science (1974), 1, p. 329. The 2011 study found that \\"Iwo Eleru possesses neurocranial morphology intermediate in shape between archaic hominins (Neanderthals and Homo erectus) and modern humans\\".Harvati et al, 'The Later Stone Age Calvaria from Iwo Eleru, Nigeria: Morphology and Chronology', p. 6. The authors of the study asserted that the dating of Iwo Eleru man to the late Pleistocene \\"implies that the transition to anatomical modernity in Africa was more complicated than previously thought, with late survival of ‚Äúarchaic‚Äù features and possibly deep population substructure in Africa during this time\\". It has been argued that Iwo Eleru man was an archaic hybrid or part of a relict archaic Homo population.Christopher M. Stojanowski, 'Iwo Eleru's place among Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene populations of North and East Africa', Journal of Human Evolution, 75 (2014), p. 86.Michael F. Hammer, August E.

Stewart and C. B. Stringer, 'Human Evolution Out of Africa: The Role of Refugia and Climate Change', Science 225, 1317 (2012), p. 1320. In 2014 Christopher Stojanowski of Arizona State University summarised the three dominant explanations for Iwo Eleru man's atypical cranial shape: the first, that Iwo Eleru was a hybrid with archaic African populations; the second, that Iwo Eleru man was a member of a relict archaic population that was replaced by more modern humans upon the onset of the Holocene era; and the third, that Iwo Eleru man was part of a population that diverged from the rest of North Africa's populations during a time of acute aridness in the Sahara desert that made it impassable until the arrival of the African humid period.Stojanowski, 'Iwo Eleru's place among Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene populations of North and East Africa', p. 87. In 2014 Peter J. Waddell of Massey University argued that Iwo Eleru man descended from a lineage 200‚Äì400 kya and whose extinction may have been caused by humans. Waddell also said: \\"Such a long apparently distinct lineage that terminated in West Africa perhaps 12kya, with no obvious sign of living descendants, suggests that the Iwo Eleru lineage quite probably represents a distinct species of near modern human. As such, the species name Homo iwoelerueensis suggests itself\\".Peter J.

It was the first aircraft engine produced by , often abbreviated to Gasuden, and the first production engine produced in Japan. It was produced in large numbers to power training and light aircraft before and during the Pacific War. Design and development The early development of aircraft in Japan was fully dependent on engines from abroad, although many of these designs were license built by Japanese companies. Gasuden was no exception, building Le Rhone rotaries in the early 1920s. However, by 1926, the company had gained enough experience to develop its own first engine. Taking inspiration from the Armstrong Siddeley Mongoose, the company developed a seven-cylinder star-shaped radial made of alloy and using an integral impellor-based carburettor. The prototype was first run in 1927 and was the first indigenous design to achieve production in Japan. The resulting engine was a single row radial with seven cylinders of bore and stroke . Running on 80 Octane fuel, the engine was rated at sea level at . The engine had no compressor, although some later models were fitted with a single speed mechanical supercharger to boost performance. Initially, the engine was first known as the , but was later better known as the as the range of engines produced by the company increased. Production ran from 1928 to 1944. Large numbers were delivered, primarily for training and other light aircraft. Amongst the more numerous were the Yokosuka K2Y2 Type 3, a derivative of the Avro 504N which was produced from 1929 to 1940, and the Yokosuka K4Y1 seaplane produced between 1933 and 1940, mainly by Watanabe. In May 1939, Hitachi acquired Tokyo Gas and Electric Company, merging the aeronautical part of the business with Hitachi Aircraft. The engine was rebranded Hitachi.

Life  He was born in the family of Artur- Arnold Frenkiel and his wife Bronis≈Çawa. His mother brought him up as a lone parent after his father fell victim to the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919. In 1937 he completed his schooling at Krak√≥w's Henryk Sienkiewicz Gimnazjum and entered the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in the city. His lecturers included W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarocki, Kazimierz Sichulski, Xawery Dunikowski and Eugeniusz Eibisch. During the summer vacation of 1939 he set off on an art tour of Paris, by way of Berlin where he stopped off to see the exhibition of Degenerate art put on by the Nazi Party. Then in Paris he encountered the work of Mo√Øse Kisling, Jan Wac≈Çaw Zawadowski, Efraim Mandelbaum, Artur Nacht- Samborski, and in particular Georges Rouault, whose work impressed him greatly. He made his way back to Krak√≥w in August 1939 where his fianc√©, Anna Leonora Neuman was still living. After several months of German occupation they resolved to flee over the border into Hungary, but failed. On the advice of his lecturer, Eibisch, they relocated to Lw√≥w. There Stanis≈Çaw Frenkiel was arrested by the NKVD for refusing to accept Soviet citizenship and was deported to a camp in Suhobesodnoye near Nizhny Novgorod. Meanwhile, in 1941 his mother had died in Zakliczyn, Southern Poland. He survived the privations of the camp partly due to his sketching the guards in their uniforms. At the end of that year an amnesty enabled him to leave the labour camp and he made his way to Tomsk, having heard that his fianc√© Anna, had been deported to Yakuts on the Sea of Okhotsk. There he found out she had been taken south and he managed to get to Almaty. Thanks to the Union of Kazakh Artists he obtained work as portrait painter to the local political cadre. Not ceasing from his search for Anna he discovered she was now in Fergana in Uzbekistan. Having arrived there, he came across her by chance in a street as she queued for bread. Together again, they were next deported to Khirgistan where they succumbed to typhus. Having recovered they married in 1942 in the large village of Kurshab. He managed to join general Anders' Polish forces being mobilised at that time in Soviet Russia and crossed the Caspian Sea from Turkmenbasi into Iran. His new wife was meanwhile marching behind the troops with the civilian deportees and they met up again in Tehran. From there in 1943 he was moved to Iraq and the Palestinian Mandate where he underwent officer training. In preparation for the Italian campaign, he was sent to Egypt. Owing to Stalin's opposition the operation was called off and he remained in Egypt until the end of World War II. At war's end he was able to travel to Beirut where his wife had gained a place to study medicine at the American University of Beirut. He took up a place to study Fine Art at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts in November 1945 and completed the course two years later. He developed his own style drawing on local colour and street life and began exhibiting there while participating in the intellectual life of the Polish √©migr√© community, co-founding two reviews, Pion and Dziurka od klucza. In 1947 the British authorities announced that Poles would have to leave the Lebanon and choose either to return to Poland or to go to the United Kingdom. He decided on the latter and joined the British Amy in Egypt. Arriving in Britain, he was posted to a camp in Staffordshire. In January 1948 he was joined there by his wife and Beirut-born baby son, followed by demobilisation from the army. He began his British career with further studies at the Sir John Cass College of Art. On completion he became an art master at the London Jesuit-run Wimbledon College and later Gipsy Hill College. He next gained a lectureship in art at the University of London. After a post-graduate degree in the History of Art from the Courtauld Institute of Art he rose to be head of Art at the Institute of Education and finally Reader in Art at UCL. His prolific artistic output, including printmaking, continued alongside his academic work and free-lance writing and art criticism in the Polish language √©migr√© press.Stanis≈Çaw Frenkiel. ‚ÄûKo≈ºuchy w chmurach i inne eseje o sztuce‚Äù , (Selected Essays on Art History), UMK, published by Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ (in Polish) He exhibited widely in the UK and abroad, beginning at the trend-setting Grabowski Gallery in Chelsea, for whom he also wrote exhibition notes for other artists. This was a posthumous tribute to the gallery owner's younger son, a jewellery designer, sculptor and painter. Frenkiel was to comment later when the gallery closed, that it did so \\"for sadness\\". He was a founding member in 1957 of the Association of Polish Artists in Great Britain. In 1994 Krakow Academy of Fine Arts conferred on Frenkiel the distinction of Doctor honoris causa.

The group consists of Troels Holdt and Lars Malm, who had been friends for more than 10 years before starting the group. The group's name is a portmanteau of the Danish words nord and str√∏m, meaning north-energy. According to Holdt and Malm, the name was chosen with the idea that electronic music comes from the northern sky, and that electricity creates life.  History  Though Nordstr√∏m produces electronic pop, Malm and Holdt's friendship and collaboration were sparked by the Hank Williams classic \\"There's A Tear In My Beer\\". Both artists share a love for country classics, though the genre's influence on their music is not obvious. Malm and Holdt say that they draw inspiration for their songs from everyday life. Before forming Nordstr√∏m, Malm and Holdt played in a number of smaller bands. Though they managed to tour the Balkans, they eventually dropped their other projects in favor of Nordstr√∏m. Nordstr√∏m debuted in 2006 with their single \\"Berlin,\\" which was released by EMI. \\"Berlin\\" was chosen as P3's inevitable song of the week and was the radio station's most played song in 2006. The song received a gold certificate in August 2006, and, by April 2008, had sold approx. 12,000 copies. The single was a precursor to the album Dagdr√∏mmer, which was released in August 2006. The album also received a gold certificate after selling 15,000 copies. Nordstr√∏m has played concerts at a variety of Danish music festivals, including: the Spot Festival in Aarhus, Vega, Roskilde Festival, and the Pl√¶nen festival at Tivoli. In 2009, the duo collaborated with Lise Cabble to write and produce the song \\"Big Bang Baby\\", which was performed by Claus Christensen at the 2009 Dansk Melodi Grand Prix. Performing under the name Fenger//Nordstr√∏m, the duo collaborated with S√∏s Fenger to produce the album \\"Gnister\\" in 2015.

It was first published in 1965 by Atheneum, New York.  Plot summary  The untimely death of Franny Nicolet leaves behind her grieving husband, Theodore, and their two children. A minister, living in Myron, New England, Nicolet struggles on with the overwhelming tasks of raising his children and caring for his parishioners. When Clem Vail reports the distressed abscondment of his wife, Rooney, Nicolet drives off in search of her, and in hopes of ascertaining why she has fled her husband. His pursuit of her, however, opens up an opportunity for a local journalist, Will Poteat, to spread the malicious rumour that the parishioner and her pastor are engaged in a secret affair. Nicolet's journey will take him down several avenues of self-discovery. The minister meets with his distant and disinterested father, Roy, with whom he haltingly attempts to ignite some form of familial relationship. The attempt proves to be a failure, though not a personal one, as ultimately the son will forgive the father, although the relationship remains dormant. Nicolet eventually finds Rooney, who has cloistered herself away in a retreat house in Muscadine, owned and operated by Lillian Flagg, a faith-healer and Christian mystic. Flagg's overtures to Nicolet on the topics of prayer and forgiveness prove to be a catalyst for change in the young minister's outlook, prompting a greater understanding about the inherent joy that lies beneath grief and suffering. Running alongside the narrative of Nicolet's pursuit of Rooney is the tragic story of Irma Reinwasser. Having survived a Nazi concentration camp, Irma has found some semblance of ordinary life working as Nicolet's housekeeper. Her unguarded conversation with Poteat unwittingly opens the door for the newspaper man to spread the rumours regarding her employer's supposed affair among his parishioners ‚Äì an outcome over which she has very little control and yet feels a great sense of culpability. Her life reaches its terrible conclusion in the novel as, wracked by uncontrollable guilt, she falls victim to a misfiring prank perpetrated by some boys who attend Nicolet's church. Despite their good intentions, their actions lead to a fire, by which Irma is tragically consumed.  Characters  * Theodore Nicolet: Nicolet is beset by grief and confusion at the passing of his wife, haunted by the lifelong absence of his father, and dazed by the pace of his existence, which is taken up by the dual tasks of raising his children and caring for his parishioners. Beneath this distracted sadness, however, there is a joy that emerges in flashes of ordinary life, and in his sense of humor. Nicolet's confusion extends even to his motives over his pursuit of Rooney, and, although he is not guilty of engaging in an affair with her, he remains uncertain as to whether his desire to find her arises out of a godly sense of his duty as a minister, or out of a need for romantic connection. * Rooney Vail: greatly aggrieved by her affair with Will Poteat, the vivacious Rooney Vail blindly flees her husband and her town in search of some sort of resolution. She finds it at the retreat house of Lillian Flagg, where she has a revelation regarding the meaning of forgiveness * Will Poteat: a local journalist, Poteat bears the responsibility for much of the tragedy and much of the reconciliation in the story. It is his engagement in an affair with Rooney Vail that leads to her flight from her husband, and, paradoxically, to journeys of self-discovery and personal reconciliation for herself and for Nicolet. His fallacious suggestion in the local newspaper that both individuals are involved in some sort of sexual indiscretion, however, also indirectly leads to the tragic death of Irma Reinwasser, a Holocaust survivor. * Lillian Flagg: borne out of Buechner's encounter with the faith-healer Agnes Sanford, Lillian Flagg is a charismatic and mysterious figure, who encourages both Rooney and Nicolet in their journeys towards forgiveness, reconciliation, and an increased relationship with God through the medium of prayer. Indeed, Sanford appears to have had a great effect upon Buechner. In his second autobiographical work, Now and Then (1983) he describes her as 'rather short and on the plump side with a breezy matter-of-factness about her', with 'the air of a college dean or a successful business-woman'.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 61-2. . He further adds that 'she seemed completely without pretensions', and that 'after no more than a few minutes' conversation with her, I felt as sure as you can ever be in such matters that if there was such a thing as the Real Article in her line of work, then that was what she was.'Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 61-2. . * Irma Reinwasser: unaware of Poteat's malicious motivations, Reinwasser is overcome with grief at the thought that she might have contributed to the dissemination of a false rumor concerning her employer and Rooney. Haunted by her appalling experiences in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, Irma is endowed with a dark sense of humor, and suffers a tragic end. Critic Dale Brown writes of her that ‚ÄòIrma‚Äôs story is the darkest of any of Buechner‚Äôs characters to this point in his career‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 112. . OCLC 255278233. Themes Written in the years following Buechner's ordination to the ministry, The Final Beast explores many of the themes that became central to the author's future work. It is a meditation on grief, grace, death, faith lived out in the midst of the ordinary, and the search for identity. Critic Dale Brown suggests that Buechner simultaneously expresses ‚Äòa belief that the world is a dark place‚Äô, while also finding ‚Äòbeyond human inadequacy [‚Ä¶] faith, grace, and absurd joy‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 142. . OCLC 255278233. He further argues that the novel is ‚Äòa studied attempt to suggest the presence of grace in a tawdry world‚Äô, and manifests the desire of its author ‚Äòto jar readers and listeners into a consideration of spiritual possibilities‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 142. . OCLC 255278233. In Now and Then Buechner offers the following summary of its central theme, writing that 'the part of the Christian experience' that he 'tried to make real', was element he found 'conspicuously absent' in other Christian books: 'the experience of salvation as grace, as the now-and- thenness and here-and-thereness of the New Being.'Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 60. . As with Buechner's first three novels, A Long Day‚Äôs Dying, The Seasons' Difference, and The Return of Ansel Gibbs, much of the novel is concerned with the thought-life of its characters. Unlike these novels, however, Buechner's preoccupations in The Final Beast are less concerned with modernist presuppositions ‚Äì despite the returning themes of grief, loss, and ennui, the presence of futility is less prevalent, although, as Buechner himself writes: ‚Äòdoubt and darkness have their say along with faith and hope‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 59-60. .  Context of the novel‚Äôs composition  In Now and Then Buechner recalls the context out of which he wrote his fourth novel. The author had been teaching theology at the Phillips Exeter Academy since September 1958, and took a sabbatical in Vermont during the 1963‚Äì64 school year. He describes 'sitting on the living-room couch trying to get on with' his next novel when he received a phone call from a friend: > The president had been shot, she said. He was in a hospital in Dallas. He > was not expected to last out the day. No one who lived through that time can > ever forget it, of course, or those few days that followed it when the world > stood still, and everybody remembers just where they were and what they were > doing when the news came through.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a > memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 58. . By the time the sabbatical drew to an end in September 1964 Buechner had finished the novel, naming it The Final Beast, a phrase taken from the final line in a poem by Stephen Crane, 'God Lay Dead in Heaven'. Elsewhere in Now and Then, Buechner describes his trepidation regarding the publication of this, his first novel since entering into the ministry, and of those who would enter into the novel expecting 'a sermon with illustrations in the form of character and dialogue'. Concerning his own writing process, the author writes that novels begin as 'a lump in the throat': > I don't start with some theological axe to grind, but with a deep, wordless > feeling for some aspect of my own experience that has moved me. Then, out of > the shadows, a handful of characters starts to emerge, then various possible > relationships between them, then a setting maybe, and lastly, out of those > relationships, the semblance at least of a plot. Like any other serious > novelist, I try to be as true as I can to life as I have known it.Buechner, > Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: > HarperCollins. p. 59. . Critical reception Buechner's first novel as an ordained minister, The Final Beast was received with a certain guardedness by a number of critics. As Dale Brown writes, ‚Äòthe news of the ordination was on the streets, and the weight of this outburst of dubiety has pushed against Buechner‚Äôs literary reputation since‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 113. . OCLC 255278233. Writing in Christianity and Crisis, Amos Wilder suggested that the novel constituted ‚Äòa good test case of whether a modern artist can make traditional Christian language palatable or effective to a general audience today‚Äô.Amos Wilder, ‚ÄòStrategies of the Christian Artist‚Äô, Christianity and Crisis, May 3, 1965 Julian Moynahan, in his review published in Book Week, concluded that ‚ÄòThe Final Beast lodges itself at midpoint between the priest‚Äôs and the writer‚Äôs way of looking at things‚Äô.Julian Moynahan, ‚ÄòWriting on Cloth can be Tricky‚Äô, Book Week, February 14, 1965, 6 In an article written for The Spectator, John Davenport argued that the theological centre of the novel is located largely in its common worldview; ‚ÄòMr. Buechner is no puritan‚Äô he insists: ‚ÄòHe makes us aware that everything has to be paid for and that an awareness of truth is more desirable than a febrile search for 'happiness.'‚Äô.John Davenport, ‚ÄòBuechner‚Äôs Fourth‚Äô, Spectator, June 11, 1965, 763 Many critics noted the altered style of Buechner's fourth novel over and against his previous three. Dale Brown writes that the new Buechnerian style was ‚Äòfreer‚Äô, and characterised by ‚Äòsimplicity‚Äô and ‚Äòan instinct for humor‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 112. . OCLC 255278233. Writing for Punch, critic Venetia Pollock argued that ‚ÄòThe writing is excellent and the handling crisp‚Äô.Venetia Pollock, ‚ÄòNew Novels‚Äô, Punch, June 30, 1965, 976 Critics such as Katherine Jackson and Arthur Mizener concluded that Buechner had handled and paired his characters, style, and theme with skill. The latter wrote in the New York Times that the novel evoked ‚Äòthe beauty and laughter underlying the filth and boredom of this world‚Äô,Arthur Mizener, ‚ÄòDancing with Angels and a Gay God‚Äô, NYT Book Review, January 24, 1965, 5 to which the former, in a review published in Harper‚Äôs, added the final word that: > This is a story that skates with daring skill and exuberant speed over the > thin ice of potential blasphemy, sentimentality, and violence to emerge > finally on the firm, smooth surface of honest faith and uproarious > laughter.Katherine Jackson, Harper‚Äôs, March 1965, 159-60 References Category:1965 novels ","title":"The Final Beast"},{"id":"64121490","text":"John Fox was an English priest in the 16th Century.'Bishop Richard Fox of Winchester: Architect of the Tudor Age' Drees, C.J. p153: Jefferson, North Carolina; McFarland & Co; 2014 Foxwas educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Flooke-Fyrmin He held the living at Wroughton, Wiltshire.

The most common side effects include leukopenia, lymphopenia, fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, increased creatinine, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased glucose, thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, decreased albumin, constipation, dyspnea, decreased sodium, increased aspartate aminotransferase, vomiting, cough, decreased magnesium and diarrhea. Lurbinectedin is a synthetic tetrahydropyrrolo [4, 3, 2-de]quinolin-8(1H)-one alkaloid analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Lurbinectedin covalently binds to residues lying in the minor groove of DNA, which may result in delayed progression through S phase, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and cell death. Lurbinectedin was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020. Structure Lurbinectedin is structurally similar to trabectedin, although the tetrahydroisoquinoline present in trabectedin is replaced with a tetrahydro Œ≤-carboline which enables lurbinectedin to exhibit increased antitumor activity compared with trabectedin. Biosynthesis Lurbinectedin a marine agent isolated from the sea squirt species Ecteinascidia turbinata. Synthetic production is necessary because very small amounts can be obtained from sea organisms. For example, one ton (1000 kg) of sea squirts are required to produce one gram of trabectedin, which is analogue of lurbinectedin. Complex synthesis of lurbinectedin starts from small, common starting materials that require twenty-six individual steps to produce the drug with overall yield of 1.6%.Total synthesis of marine antitumor agents trabectedin and lurbinectedin  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190219111659.htmA Scalable Total Synthesis of the Antitumor Agents Et‚Äê743 and Lurbinectedin  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201900035 Mechanism of action According to PharmaMar,PharmaMar presentation of Lurbinectedin's Mechanism of Action Lurbinectedin Mechanisim of Action  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8daELhxAXcQ lurbinectedin inhibits the active transcription of the encoding genes. This has two consequences. On one hand, it promotes tumor cell death, and on the other it normalizes tumor microenvironment. Active transcription is the process by which there are specific signal where information contained in the DNA sequence is transferred to an RNA molecule. This activity depends on the activity of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. Lurbinectedin inhibits transcription through a very precise mechanism. Firstly, lurbinectedin binds to specific DNA sequences. It is at these precise spots that slides down the DNA to produce RNA polymerase II that is blocked and degraded by lurbinectedin. Lurbinectedin also has important role in tumor microenvironment. The tumor cells act upon macrophages to avoid them from behaving like an activator of the immune system. Literally, macrophages work in any tumor's favor. Macrophages can contribute to tumor growth and progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion, fostering tumor angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune cells. Attracted to oxygen-starved (hypoxic) and necrotic tumor cells they promote chronic inflammation. So, not only that macrophages inhibit immune system avoiding the destruction of tumor cells, but they also create tumor tissue that allows tumor growth. However, macrophages associated with tumors are cells that are addicted to the transcription process. Lurbinectedin acts specifically on the macrophages associated with tumors in two ways: firstly, by inhibiting the transcription of macrophages that leads to cell death and secondly, inhibiting the production of tumor growth factors. In this way, lurbinectedin normalizes the tumor microenvironment.  History  Lurbinectedin was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2020. Efficacy was demonstrated in the PM1183-B-005-14 trial (Study B-005; NCT02454972), a multicenter open- label, multi-cohort study enrolling 105 participants with metastatic SCLC who had disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Participants received lurbinectedin 3.2 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial was conducted at 26 sites in the United States, Great Britain, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Czech Republic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for lurbinectedin priority review and orphan drug designations and granted the approval of Zepzelca to Pharma Mar S.A.  Research Clinical Trials= Lurbinectedin can be used as monotherapy in the treatment of SCLC. Lurbinectedin monotherapy demonstrated the following clinical results in relapsed extensive stage SCLC: :* For sensitive disease (chemotherapy-free interval of ‚â• 90 days) overall response rate (ORR) was 46.6% with 79.3% disease control rate and median overall survival (OS) being increased to 15.2 months. :* For resistant disease (chemotherapy-free interval of < 90 days) overall response rate (ORR) was 21.3% with 46.8% disease control rate and 5.1 months median overall survival (OS). Lurbinectedin is also being investigated in combination with doxorubicin as second-line therapy in a randomized Phase III trial. While overall survival in this trial is not yet known, response rates at second line were :* 91.7% in sensitive disease with median progression-free survival of 5.8 months, and :* 33.3% in resistant disease with median progression-free of 3.5 months. Lurbinectedin is available in the U.S. under Expanded Access Program (EAP).

He was the state's highest-ranking military official in the 1870s, and was put in charge of the state militia whose main purpose was to protect African-American voters. African-Americans were 58.9% of the population of South Carolina in 1870. He was reportedly murdered by Democrats in the run-up to the 1876 South Carolina gubernatorial election. Biography Joseph Crews was a white businessman. In his trade he did business with African-American customers and partners. After the American Civil War, as racist attitudes hardened, he was referred to as a \\"Negro trader\\" and \\"accused of Union sympathies\\". According to Benjamin Ginsberg, he was a \\"highly visible scalawag\\" with support from the Federal occupying authorities. Crews served in the South Carolina 48th General Assembly in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1868 to 1870 as a Republican. During the 1870 South Carolina gubernatorial election, he was a county election commissioner in Laurens County, South Carolina, and in that capacity had ordered all ballot boxes to be set up in the county seat. This disadvantaged rural voters, but enabled him and the state militia to oversee the election process and to protect black voters. Armed whites attacked the largely black militia and disarmed them; some were wounded, others murdered. \\"Like companies of Confederate cavalry\\", \\"heavily armed whites\\" pushed away black voters‚Äîuntil Federal troops came from twenty miles away, with Crews, and took control of the ballot boxes. As Northern support for Reconstruction waned in 1871, Crews and similarly positioned public officials lost the support they needed to maintain order and protect blacks from southern whites determined to take back political control. For example, an 1872 congressional report written in what today would be considered shockingly racist language describes him as having distributed guns and ammunition to African-Americans; he was reported as \\"'Joe Crews', the great agitator of strife between the two races, who, in that very canvass [the 1870 elections], harangued the negroes from the stump, inciting them against the whites and their property\\". He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives during the 51st South Carolina General Assembly from 1874 until his death in 1875.South Carolina During the Late 1800s-1865-1900-Members of the 51st South Carolina General Assembly-1874 to 1876 Assassination According to a letter sent to President Ulysses S. Grant by L. Coss Carpenter, an Internal Revenue Service collector in South Carolina, Crews was shot by armed men three miles from the Laurens County courthouse on the morning of September 8, 1875. He was traveling in a buggy and was ambushed while crossing a creek. He was wounded by five pellets from a shotgun blast, one of the pellets piercing his spine and causing him to be paralyzed. He died at midnight September 13. According to Carpenter, he was the leading Republican politician in the county, and without him it would have been very difficult to prevent \\"ascendancy\\" of the area's Democrat Party. Crews was a \\"special deputy\\" for the IRS, but Carpenter felt assured that it was not his work for the IRS but his political activity that led to his murder. George Washington Shell (later a U.S. Representative for South Carolina) and his son Walter Shell were arrested and charged with the murder. George Washington Shell's brother had been murdered in 1868, and in the weeks prior to Crews' murder, a man named Albert Parks confessed to that murder and implicated Joe Crews and others. G. W. and Walter Shell were acquitted of Crews' murder after a half hour of deliberation in June 1876. In August 1876, Francis McGann was arrested and confessed to taking $200 from Republicans Cullen Lark and John Hamilton for the murder. Lark and Hamilton were quickly released due to lack of evidence. The Laurensville Herald, edited by Thomas Crews, Joe's brother and a Democrat, wrote that there was \\"some trick in the matter. In the first place the prisoner [McGann] was allowed to 'escape.'\\" The News and Courier suspected that McGann's admission was a plot to convict Cullen Lark and cited as evidence that the Crews family was providing McGann's meals.

Similar to what happened with nearby Valley Plaza, after opening, additional department stores and retail strips opened on the edges of the Broadway center, and during the 1960s the merchants' association of the various owners marketed its retail properties collectively as the Panorama City Shopping Center. In 1964 it claimed to be the first center with four major department stores.

A large stainless sculpture by artist Sebastian Trovato was added, portraying intertwining rings. In 1986, the Panorama Mall ranked 40th out of the 61 regional shopping malls in Los Angeles and Orange Counties with more than $68 million in annual sales. Business was improving, according to the manager of the Broadway, but the Los Angeles Times characterized retail in the area as \\"awaiting revival\\". In the late 1990s, Walmart opened in the building vacated by the Broadway after that chain's merger into Federated Department Stores and then Macy's.

The initiative has attracted some prominent supporters, including Peter Singer, a well-known philosopher, and Vijay Mahajan, an Indian social entrepreneur. The JAM trinity in India has incorporated two out of the three features from FAB, A digital identity and a bank account for every individual.  Premise  The concept was conceived during a dinner conversation between Chowdhry and Mahajan. Mahajan, who is a well-known leader of microfinance in India, has argued that a single deposit of a $100 at the time of birth is perfectly feasible and that the cost for the scheme would be much lower than already existing welfare programs in many developing countries It is argued that by giving a bank account and one-time deposit, there is an incentive for families (particularly in more remote areas) to register the birth of their child. Further, the ownership of an account would encourage the family to increase their knowledge and access to the formal banking system while also encouraging banks to increase their reach to traditionally more financially excluded groups and geographies of a country. The $100 could stay in the child‚Äôs account until the child reaches adolescence, therefore ensuring that parents do not make withdrawals. Using biometric identification could further reduce the possibility of fraud. While critics of FAB have pointed out that FAB may actually incentivise people to have more children, Chowdhry argues that it could encourage parents to increase the survivability of their children into adolescence, thus incentivising a reduction in the number of children families decide to have, as there is research to suggest that survivability reduces the number of planned births.  Role of technology  The role of technology is viewed as essential by proponents of FAB since it will help reduce costs and build an electronic delivery channel and electronic backbone for both financial and other transfers. One of the barriers to fostering financial inclusion for the poor is cost as the traditional solution of a bank branch is simply not going to work to reach everyone. Technology, however, can help make reaching the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù more affordable. Further, proponents would argue that information management and correspondence banking could allow for the realization of cost benefits from economies of scale of large volumes of new accounts. With an initial cash transfer of $100, the initial deposit could go far towards making the program an economically viable proposition by generating the demand to reach large volumes. That is, banks or telecom companies that may think it is not cost effective for small transactions can recover costs, when there are a large number of these accounts‚Äîsuch volumes would support the business case and cover the fixed costs.  Program funding  According to Chowdhry, each country will contribute one-fiftieth of one percent of their GDP towards creating FAB accounts . However, the sources of finance for financing the initial payment are vast and varied from country to country. While some countries may already have large enough welfare budgets and reasonably low birth rates, others could fund the program via foreign aid or donations from diaspora. Assuming that more well-off families will not claim FAB accounts would probably bring down the cost in some countries.  FAB and Center for Financial Inclusion  The Center for Financial Inclusion at ACCION International began hosting FAB in September 2010. They have engaged many experts and organizations to examine the implementation and to identify countries for FAB pilots. The Founders of FAB include Bhagwan Chowdhry, Vijay Mahajan and Francisco Gil D√≠az, a former finance minister of Mexico.  In popular culture  Chowdhry made a cameo appearance in the TV show, Entourage, where he explained the concept of FAB to Vincent‚Äôs then girlfriend Sophia Lear.

He is best known for his role as Walther Hewel in the 2004 film Der Untergang and as Robert Mohr in the 2005 film Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage.  Life  Alexander Held in school was a solo singer of the Regensburger Domspatzen and a talented soccer player, part of the soccer club TSV 1860 M√ºnchen, who won youth championships five times. He finished his acting training at the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts in Munich. Then Held began at the Munich Kammerspiele. Further engagements at the Staatsschauspiel Hannover, the Freien Volksb√ºhne Berlin, the Theater Basel, and the Salzburg Festival followed. In 1993, Held was cast by director Klaus Emmerich in Morlock for the first time for a television film. Since then he has appeared in numerous well-known cinema and TV productions, including Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, Marc Rothemund's Sophie Scholl - The Last Days, and Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall. Likely also because of his distinctive voice, the ability to give his characters a double- faced face that quietly exudes a dangerous unpredictability, and his accurate, sharp pronunciation, Held embodied Nazi officials several times, as in Downfall. His most famous role is that of Gestapo officer Robert Mohr, who conducted the interrogations of Sophie Scholl. In Before the Fall, however, he was also seen as a Nazi opponent. In the Sat.1 series Der Bulle von T√∂lz with Ottfried Fischer, he worked many times as an SPD Bundestag member, who mostly has to look after his opponents in the \\"Bavarian Unity Party\\". In 2007, he starred alongside Iris Berben as the greedy villain Heinrich von Strahlberg in the two-part TV film Afrika, mon amour. In 2008, he was the opponent of Brandner Kaspar, Alois Kugler, in the film of the same name, directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. In 2009, he embodied the politically tactical abbot Kuno in the Margarethe von Trottas film Vision alongside Barbara Sukowa, Heino Ferch, and Hannah Herzsprung, and in the same year, he was seen in S√∂nke Wortmann's Pope Joan as the Frankish Emperor Lothar I. In 2010, he played the figure of the Attorney General Dr. Sasse alongside Ulrich Tukur in Dieter Wedel's two- part TV film Gier. Since 2010, he starred in the crime series Stralsund as the head commissioner Karl Hidde. Since 2014, he embodied the lead role of head commissioner Ludwig Schaller in the crime series M√ºnchen Mord, who angers his boss with his unconventional methods, but solves his cases. His father was the actor Jos√© Held, who died in 1974. From December 2005, he was married to German actress Patricia Gr√§fin Fugger von Babenhausen (1961‚Äì2014).

The shooting occurred when at least 14 officers of a Southeast Regional Fugitive Taskforce from at least seven different agencies, led by U.S. Marshals, forcibly entered the apartment of Robinson's girlfriend to serve a warrant for his arrest. The officers were heavily armed, including with submachine guns. The warrant was being served on behalf of the Gwinnett County police and the Atlanta Police Department, and authorities said they had sought his arrest after he fired a gun at police or pointed a gun at police during a previous encounter. The case was highlighted as an example of alleged excessive force by law enforcement officers, systemic racism in law enforcement, a lack of knowledge in police who interact with people who have a mental illness, a lack of transparency and accountability surrounding the actions of police officers, and a lack of use of body cameras by police and U.S. Marshals when serving arrest warrants. Background Jamarion Robinson had been a biology student at Clark Atlanta University (CAU), and had been a running back on the football teams of CAU and Tuskegee University, but he had paused his education several years prior to the incident. According to his mother, he was in the process of transferring to Tuskegee University and had texted her two days before the shooting to tell her he had just enrolled there for what would be his final semester. He had no criminal record other than a series of misdemeanor traffic violations in the previous two years. His family said they believe the police were seeking him due to mistaking him for someone else. Police showed a photo of the man they were seeking to his grandmother, and she said \\"That's not my grandson.\\"  Incident  U.S. Marshals traveled to the apartment in order to arrest Robinson. His mother had called the police to try to get them to help him get mental health assistance, as a few weeks prior he had poured gasoline on the floor beneath his bed and in front of his mother's bedroom. When she called, they also had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. He had allegedly pointed a gun at officers before fleeing when he was confronted at the apartment complex of a friend. (Contains bystander video recording. Alternative archive http://archive.today/Qdrv0) His mother had told police about his recent diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, but they did not bring any mental health practitioners with them for the raid. Robinson was staying with his girlfriend at the time of the incident, and lived with his mother in Lawrenceville. Officers claimed they had opened fire after Robinson refused to exit his girlfriend's apartment and was seen with a gun in his hand. Warning shots and the continued gunfire was filmed by a resident standing near the apartment on their cellphone. According to the video recording, the shooting continued for nearly three minutes. According to an investigator hired by the family, the evidence showed that after killing Robinson, police handcuffed his hands behind his back, dragged his body down the stairs from the second floor to the living room on the lower level, and threw a flash-bang grenade into the area after the shooting in an apparent attempt to confuse the investigation of the scene. The body was also found to be wearing an oxygen rebreathing mask when recovered by the medical examiner. The family said that a pathologist found that Robinson had been shot several times through the palms of both hands. The medical report on Robinson's body listed 76 bullet wounds, 59 of which were identified as entry wounds and the other 17 as exit wounds. None of the officers were injured in the incident. None of the police officers involved in the shooting wore body cameras.  Investigation  Bullets recovered at the scene included 9 mm and .40 caliber H&K; submachine gun bullets and .40 caliber Glock ammunition. Two of the 9 mm bullets were later recovered at the scene by the family's investigator, who found them embedded deep into the floor at the top of the stairwell and said they appeared to have been fired directly downwards into Robinson or the floor (although this was on the second floor, above where the police were standing when the shooting began). On the day after the shooting, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) released a statement saying Robinson had been repeatedly ordered to put down a weapon before the shooting began. A handgun was later recovered at the scene that the GBI said was \\"believed to be associated with Robinson\\", and it was reported that officers who had been involved in the shooting said Robinson fired at them three times, but that the handgun was actually damaged and was not operable.  Lack of body camera use  The ACLU highlighted the case as an illustration of how police officers, and particularly U.S. Marshals, were often not wearing body cameras, and strongly advocated that they start using them under more circumstances. District Attorney Paul Howard agreed, saying \\"If we had body cams, a lot of the issues that have been raised about that case would go away.\\" It was reported that U.S. Marshals were never wearing body cameras, even when serving arrest warrants. Some of the officers involved in the raid were from the East Point Police, who ordinarily had vehicles outfitted with dash cameras, but in this instance new vehicles were used that did not have cameras installed.  Legal action  In January 2018, Robinson's family filed a lawsuit against the officers involved in the shooting, alleging that Robinson had not posed any immediate threat to the officers or others at the time of the shooting and that the officers violated Robinson's civil rights. The suit claimed the officers had \\"conspired among and between themselves to unreasonably stop, seize, shoot and injure Jamarion Robinson in violation of his Constitutional rights, to destroy and fabricate evidence, to complete false, inaccurate and misleading reports, and to make false statements to superior officers in order to conceal their wrongdoing.\\" In addition to officers of the U.S. Marshals Service, those named in the suit were officers from the police or fire departments of Atlanta, Clayton County, East Point, Fayette County and Fulton County. Paul Howard, the District Attorney of Fulton County, tried to investigate the shooting, but the U.S. Marshals Service did not cooperate with his investigation. On December 28, 2018, he filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice for failing to provide information about the case in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. He said that federal authorities had prevented his prosecutors from interviewing the officers who were involved in the shooting and had refused to turn over any documents relating to the case. According to his lawsuit filing, more than 90 rounds of ammunition had been fired into or within the apartment. In January 2019, after the Department of Justice raised procedural objections, Howard withdrew subpoenas to interview some of the officers involved in the shooting, which he said was in a \\"spirit of cooperation\\" with the agency. In June 2020, Robinson's family said they had lost confidence in Howard's investigation. Robinson's mother said \\"Paul Howard has failed my family and has not tried to indict the officers who murdered my son even though he's been promising me he's going to take action for nearly four years. ... I do not believe him at all!\\"  Protest action  Robinson's death was highlighted by activists during the \\"National Day of Outrage\\" on October 28, 2019, along with the deaths of Atatiana Jefferson, Kendrick Johnson, Nicholas Thomas, and Jimmy Atchison. Members of the New Black Panther Party organized and marched in honor of African-American individuals shot and killed by police in recent years. Students at the Atlanta University Center used the hashtag #AUCShutItDown to voice support of Robinson's family and draw attention to his death. The case was also highlighted during nationwide protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020. One of the officers involved in the shooting was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and property damage in June 2020 in an incident involving the tasing of two students as they sat in their car during a protest held around Atlanta University Center during the George Floyd‚Äìrelated protests. This officer had also been involved in other previous cases of alleged excessive force, including the shooting death of an unarmed shop customer in the mid-1990s that resulted in a settlement of $1.4 million paid by the city and the shooting of another unarmed man in 2012.

History  The Balik Probinsya program was originally proposed by Senator Bong Go who touted the program as a platform to give a \\"fresh start\\" to people after the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing a series of programs to help develop the quality of life in the rural areas, in effect decongesting the densely populated areas of the country such as Metro Manila by encouraging people to move to the countryside once COVID-19-related quarantine measures imposed across the country are lifted. Go has proposed if Metro Manila had a lower population density, the government would be better equipped in dealing with future health emergencies. President Rodrigo Duterte issued Executive Order (EO) No. 114 on May 6 which took effect immediately institutionalizing the Balik Probinsya program. An inter-agency council was also established to formulate the framework of the program within 30 days. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea was appointed to lead the council. The implementation of the program was suspended on June 11, to give more focus on aiding non-Metro Manila residents get back to their home provinces and cities under the separate Hatid Tulong program.  Council  President Duterte's executive order, created the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa Council which is tasked to create a framework for national government's implementation of the Balik Probinsya program. The composition of the council as follows: *Chairperson: Executive Secretary *Vice Chairperson: Socioeconomic Planning Secretary *Other members: **Secretaries of Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, Budget and Management, Environment and Natural Resources, Education, Human Settlements and Urban Development, Finance, Health, Information and Communications Technology, Interior and Local Government, Labor and Employment, Public Works and Highways, Social Welfare and Development, Trade and Industry, Tourism, Transportation **Chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education **Director General of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority **Head of Cooperative Development Authority **Head of Mindanao Development Authority  Program  Balik Probinsya enrollees at a processing center in Quezon City. The National Housing Authority (NHA) says that around 10,000 people has expressed interest to avail of the program within the first two or three days the Balik Probinsya program was launched on May 6. Among the top ten provinces the applicants wanted to move to are Camarines Sur, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar. The NHA has pledged to provide available houses to beneficiaries of the program and their voter registration would be adjust accordingly by the Commission on Elections. Controversies The Gabriela Women's Party has criticized the Balik Probinsya program saying they have warned President Duterte on the implementation of the program in early May 2020 saying it could create a \\"wave\\" of new COVID-19 cases amidst the pandemic situation citing two alleged Balik Probinsya beneficiaries in Leyte testing positive for the disease. They also believe the program as proof of the government's preference for temporary relief for problems over long-term solutions and the program will bring more socioeconomic problems in the countryside. However the Department of Interior and Local Government belied Gabriela's claim saying that the two Leyte cases involved beneficiaries of a separate program, Hatid Probinsya which aims to help non-residents stranded in Metro Manila to return to their home provinces and insists that the Balik Probinsya program is a long-term solution which seeks to provide a platform for low-income families in urban areas to move to their home provinces while implementing relevant livelihood and infrastructure programs in the rural areas of the country.

Education  Jeffries graduated from Columbia College in 1972 and University of Michigan Law School in 1974.  Career  After receiving his law degree, Jeffries began his career as a lawyer in the Southfield, Michigan, law firm of Keywell & Rosenfeld. He then served as a principal in the leveraged buyout of Key International Inc., a metal recycling and automotive equipment manufacturing business. = General Atlantic = Jeffries met Philip Aarons, who was chairing the New York City Public Development Corporation at that time and the two worked on housing developments in Staten Island. The two joined General Atlantic and ran its real estate division. Throughout the 1980s, he and Aarons constructed subsidized low-income housing in Manhattan and Brooklyn. In April 1990, the American Broadcasting Company decided to sell two full blocks on the East Side of Broadway between Sixty-Eighth and Sixty-Ninth Streets. However, it was also a time of recession and it was difficult to get financing for almost any construction. A syndicate led by William Zeckendorf Jr. and Martin J. Raynes fell apart because they were unable to secure funding, and the latter was driven to bankruptcy in 1991 after the real estate downturn. Jeffries then stepped in to take over the project, but his superiors at General Atlantic thought the deal was infeasible. As a result, Jeffries and Aarons departed General Atlantic and were given the right to proceed with their transaction from the company. Jeffries and Aarons, joined by Philip Lovett, started their own real estate firm, Millennium Partners, in 1990. = Millennium Partners = Millennium won the backing of Goldman Sachs and American Broadcasting Company offered them a $13 million reduction in the $105 million purchase price for the land. Eager to keep the deal alive, Jeffries came up with $1 million of his own money to secure the agreement. However, further challenges lies ahead in securing the remaining $81 million in a credit-scarce market. Jeffries came up with a novel way of financing the project by developing a mixed-used, urban entertainment, retail, office, and residential complex and pre-selling different segment of the building to various owners, both individuals and corporations. The use of the building would also be differentiated by having two separate entrances for commercial and residential uses. By 1991, he secured financial commitments from Sony (whose space later was sold to Loews Theater), LA Fitness, Gap Inc.,United States Postal Service, as well as J.P. Morgan & Co. as future tenants of Millennium Tower. Their initial success has allowed them to develop two other buildings in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, One Lincoln Square and the Grand Millennium. The announcement of Millennium Tower brought controversies over its density, height, and design, that Brendan Gill described the 'immense structure' as 'grossly over-scaled' and objected to the 'exceptionally busy' mix of uses. Those protests later helped set new zoning laws in the district. The Millennium Tower was, nevertheless, a commercial success that attracted celebrity tenants such as Howard Stern, Liam Neeson, Jon Bon Jovi, and Regis Philbin, earned over a quarter billion dollars and inspired other real estate developers to follow suit. According to Michael Gross, author of House of Outrageous Fortune, the children of real estate developer William Zeckendorf later used Jeffries' pioneering formula in developing 15 Central Park West as their family was investors in the Millennium Tower as well. Jeffries later partnered with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to replicate similar real estate projects that combine condominiums and hotels in mixed-used complexes in other cities, totaling $2 billion in investment. Among the cities is San Francisco, where he developed the Millennium Tower, controversial for its sinking foundations and tilting problems, and Four Seasons Hotel, San Francisco. In addition to the under construction Winthrop Center, he has helped develop Millennium Tower, Millennium Place, and owned the historic Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston. In Miami, he spearheaded the development of the Four Seasons Hotel Miami, which was the tallest building in the city from 2003 to 2017. In Washington, DC, he helped the development of The Ritz-Carlton, Washington, D.C. as well as The Ritz-Carlton, Georgetown. Through Millenium Partners, he owns the Hotel St. Moritz, which he developed into The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park, as well as condominiums and led to a turnaround of its status, attracting prominent tenants such as Jean-Marie Messier, Sidney Kimmel, Larry Ellison, and Mitchell Rales. Jeffries' condo in the building, purchased in 2002, was the highest-priced in the New York real estate market when it was sold in 2012.  Philanthropy  In 2018, Jeffries and his wife, Lisa, committed $33 million to the University of Michigan Law School, which is the largest donation the school has received. His total contribution to University of Michigan is $40 million, including $5 million for a new campus building renamed Jeffries Hall in his honor, and $2.5 million for the law school's 1L Summer Funding Program. In March 2020, he donated $25 million to the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, which is the largest single donation in the system's 105-year history. The money will be used to help advance cancer research and treatment.  Personal life  Outside his business career, he is most known for being the former husband of Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the daughter of actress Rita Hayworth and Prince Aly Khan, son of Aga Khan III. The couple had been active in organizations promoting research in Alzheimer's disease. They married in 1989 and their reception attracted a high-profile crowd include UN Secretary General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, Senators Chris Dodd and Larry Pressler, author Jerzy Kosi≈Ñski, songwriter Ahmet Ertegun, and Donald Trump. The couple divorced in 1993, citing abandonment.

Responding to multiple 911 calls from Korchinski-Paquet, her mother, and her brother, for a domestic disturbance involving punches, thrown bottles, and knives, police attended her apartment. Subsequent to the arrival of police, Korchinski-Paquet fell to the ground 24 storeys below, and died at the scene. Her family accused the Toronto Police Service of having played a role in her death, which led to a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) investigation. The SIU announced in late August it had cleared all police officers of wrongdoing and found no evidence of police involvement in her death. Korchinski-Paquet's death inspired a number of protests in Canada against police involvement in her death and other issues of anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism. These protests occurred at the same time as the George Floyd protests.  Background  Five years prior to the incident, Korchinski-Paquet was diagnosed with epilepsy and mental health concerns that had sometimes resulted in calls to the police for assistance.  Incident  Around 5:15 pm, Korchinski-Paquet's mother called police to their 24th story apartment in High Park North after a domestic conflict. Her mother wanted officers to take Korchinski-Paquet to CAMH, in an effort to deescalate the situation so it would not become unsafe. Six officers attended the scene. However, officers were confused as to whether epilepsy was a justifiable reasoning for taking her into custody under the Mental Health Act. In a call to 911 by Korchinski-Paquet herself, she claimed that both her mother and brother had been drinking since 10am that morning. torontosun.com/news/crime/no-charges-for-police-in-regis-korchinski-paquet- death-siu/wcm/a86a398a-58e9-469b-989e-08d0a52e62df/amp/ The Toronto Police Service's Chief at the time, Mark Saunders, clarified that the call was for an assault, stating that three separate people had called in and that knives were being drawn at the scene, limiting the responding teams that could be sent to assist the situation. When police arrived at the apartment, they were met by Korchinski-Paquet, her mother, Claudette Beals-Clayton, and brother, Reece Korchinski-Beals, in the hallway and exchanged a few words with the officers as they walked down the hall. Shortly after, Korchinski-Paquet told officers she needed to use the bathroom and was followed into the apartment by multiple officers, who would not allow entry by other family members. Korchinski-Paquet proceeded to walk out onto the 24th-floor balcony and prevented officers from joining her by holding the door closed. She began to scale the balcony in an attempt to cross to the adjacent balcony, which was blocked off by netting. She lost her balance on the railing and fell to her death. One officer congruently knocked on the neighbour's door to attend to the second balcony, only to find it was blocked off by netting. He looked down and noticed Korchinski-Paquet's body on the ground, immediately calling for an ambulance. Korchinski-Paquet's mother was then heard telling a neighbour that her daughter jumped. Korchinski-Paquet was pronounced dead at the scene.  Investigation  An investigation was conducted by the Special Investigations Unit. On June 1, investigators announced that they had conducted interviews with six officers and four civilian witnesses and obtained video surveillance footage from the apartment complex. On June 3, the Toronto Sun reported that Korchinski-Paquet blockaded the balcony door before falling to her death, citing unnamed sources. In response to the Sun reporting an apparent leak by police sources, the family of Korchinski-Paquet cancelled their scheduled police interviews with the Special Investigations Unit. On August 26, the SIU cleared all officers of wrongdoing. Findings in the SIU report declared no indication of \\"overt racism\\", and that \\"There were allegations in the wake of Miss Korchinski-Paquet's death that she was pushed off the balcony by police...\\" further adding \\"The evidence establishes that this did not occur.\\" The family, unhappy with the result of the investigation, are continuing their own private investigation.  Aftermath  Protest in Toronto on May 30, 2020 Shortly after Korchinski-Paquet's death, her mother Beals-Clayton was recorded in a video stating that responding officers had shoved her daughter off the apartment balcony. Her cousin claimed that it was not possible that she decided to take her own life, stating \\"Exactly, my cousin‚Äôs not jumping. She‚Äôs a Christian woman, she‚Äôs not doing suicide, that ain‚Äôt what we do, we don‚Äôt do that, we ain‚Äôt killing ourselves, that‚Äôs number one, 100 per cent.\\" The Toronto Police Services Board announced that they agree that \\"everyone wants and deserves answers\\" and that the investigation into the matter \\"as expeditiously as possible\\". The head of the union representing Toronto police stated that everyone should withhold judgement until all facts and evidence are available. A protest organized by the group Not Another Black Life occurred on May 30. Thousands of people gathered to protest Korchinski- Paquet's death and other issues of anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism. Police officers estimated the protest was attended by 3,500 to 4,000 people at the Toronto rally, with a few hundred at a separate rally in Halifax. Due to the size of the crowd, many protesters were unable to maintain of physical distance, which had been mandated by the province in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A further protest in Toronto occurred on June 5. The rallies took place at the same time as rallies, protests and riots in the United States and elsewhere in reaction to the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

He held various appointments at the royal court from 1750 to 1760 In 1750 he was second in command of the frigate Docquen, then acting in a cadet training role.In 1751 he took part in Captain Hooglant's diplomatic expedition to Morocco, where he was placed in charge of the expedition's trading ships. While on land at the newly established trading station he was arrested (with other military and civil staff) and held by the Moroccans and released only on 3 June 1753 after completion of the treaty in May 1753. Returning to Denmark on the frigate Christiansborg he received the king's expression of his satisfaction with Lieutenant Kaas' behaviour during his two years' captivity and the rank-skipping promotion to captain.He was certainly promoted to the rank of captain in 1755. One reference records he was promoted in 1753 to captain-lieutenant immediately on release from captivity. In 1754 he sailed again to Morocco as captain of the trading ship Fridericus Quartus. *As Captain-Lieutenant from 1753, and as Captain from 1755, he took part in several more voyages with ships-of-the-line to the Mediterranean before 1760 in one of which he carried the diplomat Lucas who was to be Danish consul at Morocco. On return to Denmark his ship, Slesvig, was quarantined for eight days but Kaas, as captain, was permitted ashore. *1758 Commander.He was captain of the frigate M√∏en in a convoy to the Mediterranen, and on return received instructions from the Treasury about a new mission in Tunis which he undertook with two frigates under his command. On his return in November 1758 he ran the frigates into Frederiksv√¶rn as their winter quarters and then travelled on to Copenhagen to deliver his report on the Barbary States From this time he was in great demand as commander of various ships-of-the-line in the active squadrons, commanding the ship-of-the-line Oldenborg in Danish home waters in 1759 and 1762. *1766 Commodore. From this year he held positions in the (Danish) Admiralty and Commissariat College, rising in seniority (as with his naval rank) to 1775 to first deputy and royal representative. His position lasted until his retirement in 1781 *1768 Rear Admiral. In 1769 Denmark equipped a major expediton to Algeria and placed Rear Admiral Kaas, with his extensive knowledge and reputation in that area, in command. The task force sailed in May 1770, but when negotiations failed, proved unsuitable for forcing the issue - the ships-of-the-line had too great a draught, the bomb ships were poorly equipped. and the crews were severely weakened by typhoid and dysentery. Replaced in command by Rear Admiral Hooglantsee Danish wikipedia :da:Simon Hooglant, Kaas returned to Denmark demanding an investigation and court martial into the failed expedition. This concluded that Kaas and several other senior figures held some degree of blame and, although nobody was found culpable when the enquiry was halted by the government, two officers (including J. H. E. Bernstorff) retired early and Kaas lost his seat as a deputy in the admiralty. For Kaas, this loss was reversed in 1772 on promotion to vice admiral.Other excuses were also found.Reasons cited for the failure included a strong east wind, lack of manpower because of sickness in the fleet, the bomb vessels were unable to operate properly and the Algiers fortress was much stronger than expected. *1772 Vice Admiral. Apart from command of a squadron in the Baltic in 1773, the remainder of Kaas' career was spent on administration ashore as leader of the admiralty *1775 Admiral Honours * In 1768 he became a Ridder of Dannebrog * In 1790 he was awarded the Order of the Elephant. Retirement and death Kaas spent much of his retirement from 1781 peacefully on his estate, Fraugdegaard near Odense on the island of Funen.

He also played Other Scott in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Bobby Beckonridge in Degrassi: The Next Generation.  Career  Lewis graduated from the National Theatre School of Canada. One of his earliest roles was in a guest starring role as Teddy Jones Jr., a ranch hand who kills his father's murderers, on Murdoch Mysteries in 2009, but his biggest roles came in mid-2010 when he had a small role as Other Scott in the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and played Bobby Beckonridge in the tenth season of Degrassi: The Next Generation; in July 2010 he said that they were the biggest roles of his career up to that point. Interviewed at the time, he said that before getting the part of Bobby in Degrassi he had auditioned for the Canadian rite-of-passage show several times without success, and that he had not been invited to the first round of auditions for Bobby because they had been looking for a younger actor, getting the chance to audition when they didn't find anyone. Bobby is an abusive boyfriend with some personal baggage, and Lewis said that co-star Annie Clark, who played Bobby's girlfriend Fiona, was the key to helping him perform this, saying: \\"Annie is the sweetest girl, and we got along really really well from the very beginning which really helps, especially when you‚Äôre dealing with such sensitive subject matter. You feel that you trust the other person, and you can really go there.\\" In Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Lewis played Other Scott, the boyfriend of Scott Pilgrim's roommate Wallace Wells. Jeff Bayer's The Scorecard Review review of the film gave the cast of the film 10/10, noting that \\"Scott's bandmates are even better. Alison Pill, who you may remember from Milk and Ben Lewis as the other Scott, steal every moment they are on screen. It's just an amazing cast of characters that support this film\\". During the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World 10th anniversary livestream, Lewis tweeted that \\"[Scott Pilgrim] profoundly changed my life. [Edgar Wright] seeing fit to include me in this cast was an honour & the greatest vote of confidence a young actor could've asked for.\\" Lewis then had television roles in Designated Survivor, The Handmaid's Tale, Chasing Life and Suits. In 2018 he joined the DC Comics superhero television show Arrow in its seventh season as the recurring character William Clayton, and became a main character for the eighth and final season. Lewis' William is an adult version of the Arrow's son, portrayed as a child by Jack Moore, who appears in a future timeline. The 2040 scenes with Lewis were flash-forwards in the seventh season; as Lewis had a bigger role in the eighth season, it was speculated that the 2040 setting may be more important in this season. In 2019 he finished filming a role in the upcoming movie The High Note. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lewis joined Cameo to raise money for charities. He has also written and directed short films, including Apart from Everything and Zero Recognition, and wrote for the web series This Week Had Me Like.  Personal life  Lewis is openly gay, and came out to his parents when he was seventeen.

Lee had been attending as Aubrey Plaza's friend. Lewis and Lee began a long-distance relationship between Los Angeles and Toronto. They have a dog called Todd. Lewis has publicly criticized the Marvel Cinematic Universe for not casting LGBT+ actors; in a 2019 interview with Attitude he said \\"How many fucking Avengers are there at this point, and not one gay actor in the bunch\\" ‚Äì Attitude noted that Lewis overlooked Tessa Thompson, a queer actress who plays the bisexual Avenger Valkyrie, in his comments. In the same interview, Lewis praised the Arrow producers for \\"[giving] more out actors [...] a platform to succeed\\". His Arrow character was made gay after Lewis specifically requested they write it into the show. In relation to Lewis' character coming out, magazine Out also lamented that the DC Extended Universe only had one queer character.

Career In 2006, von B√ºlow published the book Building Transnational Networks: Civil Society and the Politics of Trade in the Americas. In Building Transnational Networks, von B√ºlow studies the growing prominence of civil society organizations and nongovernmental organizations in trade policy debates in the Americas, particularly in challenging free trade agreements. She uses these debates to conduct a network analysis on civil society organizations in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and the United States, to understand how these organizations decide to build both domestic and international ties. Von B√ºlow is concerned not just with the relationship between organizations, but with the relationship between those organizations and their environments. She also studies the implications of these relationships for the networks of trade between countries, and shows how international ties between civil society organizations often arise from the domestic politics of their country. For Building Transnational Networks, von B√ºlow won the 2012 Luciano Tomassini Latin American International Relations Book Award, which is presented each year by the Latin American Studies Association to \\"the author(s) of an outstanding book on Latin American foreign policies and international relations\\". Together with Federico M. Rossi, von B√ºlow edited the 2017 book Social Movement Dynamics: New Perspectives on Theory and Research from Latin America.

The home's original occupant was Albert Grunsfeld, a German Jewish merchant for whom Albuquerque's oldest Jewish congregation, Congregation Albert, is named. The Baca family sold the house in 1900, and after two changes of ownership, it ended up in the hands of Pilar Vigil in 1904. Her son Antonio Vigil lived there from 1922 to 1961 and the Vigil family continued to own the property at least into the 1970s. At some point the building was converted to commercial use. with It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1976 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The house is a one-story, flat-roofed building constructed from terrones, large adobe bricks, with outer walls thick. The architecture is based on the traditional Territorial Style, but utilizes more modern features like milled lumber, large windows, and wrought iron grillwork, which were becoming increasingly available at the time in New Mexico. The house has an off-center entrance door opening into a hallway with three rooms to the south and a double row of rooms on the north.

He plays piano and historical keyboards, including harpsichord, organ and fortepiano. He is a founder and current director of Bourbon Baroque.  Early life and education  Clark was born in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was a choir boy before he began taking piano lessons at the age of 7. He continued to study the piano during his attendance of Louisville Collegiate School. As highschool freshman, he was deeply influenced by singing with the Louisville Bach Society. Performing in several highschool musical productions was another defining influence. He enrolled in the Kentucky Center Governor's School for the Arts Vocal Music program in 2000. In 2001 Clark started to explore ways of using his art to give back to the community, by asking his recital audience to donate for charity. He applied to Oberlin College Conservatory of Music as a voice major, and was accepted after focusing on the harpsichord as his main instrument and received his Bachelor of Music degree in music education. During his time at Oberlin he envisioned to return to Louisville to start a professional baroque group, but first continued his studies in Montreal at the McGill University with and earned his Master of Music degree in harpsichord performance.  Career  In 2007, Clark co-founded the early music and historically informed performance ensemble Bourbon Baroque with violinist and professor of French Nicolas Fortin, who he had met at McGill. Together with Fortin, Clark was artistic director for Bourbon Baroque. Their biggest productions together included Don Quichotte auf der Hochzeit des Comacho by Telemann with Kentucky Opera in 2008, Handel's Alcina in 2010, Rameau's Les Sauvages from Les Indes galantes with Squallis Puppeteers in 2012, and Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 2015. Clark moved to New York City in 2015, where he explored directing musical theatre. Fortin and Clark continued working together at Bourbon Baroque till Fortin's tragic death in the Fall of 2016. Shortly after, Clark briefly returned to Louisville for Handel's complete Messiah, an annual performance he and Fortin had established in 2013 as a Louisville holiday tradition. Clark called the Messiah a wonderful piece and a universal message of love and hope that would be therapy for him and people that were touched by Nicolas Fortin. In June 2017, Clark was joined by violinist Alice Culin-Ellison as Bourbon Baroque's co-artistic director, and moved back to Louisville. Clark was musical director and pianist for the 2017 production of Lucas Hnath's play The Christians in Naples, Florida. In the summer of 2017 he played the organ on a studio recording of choral works by Antonio Juanas. The 2018 collaboration between Bourbon Baroque and Louisville Ballet for a Mozart themed ballet production had Clark performing on fortepiano. Also in 2018, Clark was music director for the Commonwealth Theatre production of the musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. In 2019 Clark was music director for the musicals Cabaret directed by Seth Lieber, and Pippin, directed by Remy Sisk. Clark was music director of the 2020 production of La Cage aux Folles directed by Michael J. Drury. During the covid-19 pandemic in spring of 2020 Clark performed in a weekly variety show named #governmedaddy Cabaret.  Awards and recognition  Clark is the recipient of the 2017 Young Alumni Achievement Award and a Kentucky Governor's School for the Arts spring 2017 Toyota Alumni Fund Grant, which he used to apprentice with harpsichord builder Yves Beaupr√©.

Background In March 1967, Siaka Stevens won a plurality of parliamentary seats in a campaign against the Sierra Leone People‚Äôs Party (SLPP). Before taking office however, Stevens was arrested by Brigadier General David Lansana who demanded that tribal representatives be elected as well. The NRC eventually ousted Lansana and placed the government under permanent military. The coup overthrew the council and restored Sierra Leone to parliamentary rule under Prime Minister Stevens. The coup The coup plotters were soldiers in the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces who were dissatisfied with their low wages and poor conditions. They were part of the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM), who were led by Brigadier John Amadu Bangura, who served as Chief of the Defence Staff following the coup. Bangura took issue with the government collapsing after a series of coups that followed the hotly contested elections of March 1967. The sergeants first formed in the town of Darn and then moved to the capital of Freetown. The ACRM imprisoned senior NRC members and arrested all high-ranking officers in the army and the police. Bangura, briefly served as head of state from 18 April to 22 April 1968. At least 12 people were killed as a result of the coup. On his last day in office, he gave the post of Prime Minister to Siaka Stevens after his predecessor Sir Henry Lightfoot Boston had declared the All People's Congress the winners of the election. At the same time, the Constitution of Sierra Leone was restored. After Steven's declared a one-party state, Bangura staged another military coup, this time it was unsuccessful. Bangura was later executed for treason. His cousin Tinga Seisay later became an acitve opponent of the Stevens government and a pro-democracy activist. It is largely seen as an example of a coup failing to accomplish its stated objectives by empowering a later autocratic government.https://asq.africa.ufl.edu/files/Miller-V12Is2.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwj4otWE0drpAhUOm- AKHe5xD6o4ChAWMAV6BAgHEAE&usg;=AOvVaw0x6kEbDLnms_TUnmZDhtw0 See also *List of coups and coup attempts *List of coups and coup attempts by country *1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'√©tat References Category:History of Sierra Leone Category:Politics of Sierra Leone Category:Military history of Sierra Leone Category:1968 in Sierra Leone Category:Conflicts in 1968 Category:1960s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts ","title":"Sergeants' Coup (Sierra Leone)"},{"id":"64122333","text":"List of Ambassadors *Roi Rosenblit 2018 - *Paul Hirschson 2015 - 2018 *Eliahu Ben-Tura 2011 - 2015 *Gideon Behar 2006 - 2011 *Daniel Pinhasi 2004 - 2006 *Shlomo Avital 2003 - 2004 *Shlomo Morgan 2000 - 2002 *Doron Mordechai Grossman 1997 - 2000 *Arie Avidor 1995 - 1997 *Menachem Carmon 1972 - 1973 *Eytan Ruppin 1967 - 1969 *Hanan Aynor 1964 - 1967 *Victor Eliachar 1962 - 1964 References * Senegal Israel ","title":"List of ambassadors of Israel to Senegal"},{"id":"64122336","text":"Cyrus I (died 396) was the bishop of Edessa.

The boogaloo movement, whose adherents are often referred to as boogaloo boys or boogaloo bois, is a loosely organized far- right, anti-government, and extremist political movement in the United States. The movement has also been described as a militia. Boogaloo adherents say they are preparing for, or seek to incite, a second American Civil War, which they call the boogaloo. Boogaloo has been used on the fringe imageboard website 4chan since 2012, but it did not come to widespread attention until late 2019. Adherents use boogaloo, including variations so as to avoid social media crackdowns, to refer to violent uprisings against the federal government or left-wing political opponents, often anticipated to follow government confiscation of firearms. The movement consists of pro-gun, anti-government groups. The specific ideology of each group varies and views on topics such as race differ widely. Some are white supremacist or neo-Nazi groups who believe that the impending unrest will be a race war. There are also groups that condemn racism and white supremacy, although attempts by some individual elements of the movement to support anti-racist groups and movements such as Black Lives Matter have been met with wariness and skepticism as researchers are unsure if they are genuine or meant to obscure the movement's actual objectives. The boogaloo movement primarily organizes online and participants have appeared at in-person events including anti-lockdown protests and the George Floyd protests. Heavily armed, boogaloo members are often identified by their attire of Hawaiian shirts and military fatigues. Since 2019, at least 31 people affiliated with the boogaloo movement have been charged with crimes, including the killings of two security and law enforcement officers, a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and incidents related to the George Floyd protests. In mid-2020, several companies acted to limit the movement's activities and visibility on their social media and chat platforms.  Overview  Naming and identity = alt=Black and white version of the American flag, with the stars replaced by an image of an igloo and the eight stripe replaced with a red tropical print stripe. The term boogaloo alludes to the 1984 cult sequel film Breakin' 2:Electric Boogaloo. Following the film's release, the phrase \\"2: Electric Boogaloo\\" became a verbal template appended to a topic as a signal of pejorative parody. The boogaloo movement adopted its identity based on the anticipation of a second American Civil War, popularly known as \\"Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo\\" among adherents. Participants in the boogaloo movement also use other similar-sounding derivations of the word, including boog, boojahideen, big igloo, blue igloo, and big luau to avoid crackdowns and automated content flags imposed by social media sites to limit or ban boogaloo-related content. Intensified efforts by social media companies to restrict boogaloo content have caused adherents to use terms even further detached from the original word such as spicy to refer to the movement. The boogaloo movement has created logos and other imagery incorporating igloo snow huts and Hawaiian prints based on these derivations. Adherents of the boogaloo sometimes carry black-and-white versions of the American flag, with a middle stripe replaced with a stripe of red tropical print and the stars replaced with an igloo. The stripes sometimes list the names of people who have been killed by law enforcement, including Eric Garner, Vicki Weaver, Robert LaVoy Finicum, Breonna Taylor, and Duncan Lemp. Adherents attend protests heavily armed and wearing tactical gear, and sometimes identify themselves by wearing Hawaiian shirts along with military fatigues. The boogaloo movement has also used other imagery popular among the far-right such as the Pepe the Frog meme. = Beliefs and structure = Groups in the boogaloo movement are far-right, anti-government, and pro-gun. The movement has also been described as a militia, and Lois Beckett, writing for The Guardian, has compared it to the right-wing anti-government militia and patriot movements of the 1990s and 2000s, stating that \\"supporters see the current federal government as illegitimate, while remaining deeply patriotic. They revere the constitution and see themselves as the true descendants of America's founding fathers. In their view, current US lawmakers are the equivalent of occupying British forces during the revolutionary war. Among the 'boogaloo' merchandise for sale online are images of George Washington armed with a modern, AR-15-style rifle\\". Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the Center on Extremism of the Anti- Defamation League (ADL), has identified the boogaloo movement's contempt for law enforcement as the element that most strongly distinguishes them from other militia groups. Support for \\"unfettered gun rights\\" and \\"fierce opposition to most or all gun control\\" are central to the boogaloo movement, and adherents use the term boogaloo to refer to violent insurrection against the federal government or left-wing political opponents, often anticipated to follow government confiscation of firearms. Some boogaloo groups are white supremacist or neo-Nazi and specifically believe that the boogaloo will be a race war. Some boogaloo groups have condemned racism. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has said that \\"few of [the boogaloo movement's] adherents are interested in aligning with Black Lives Matter or antifascist protesters against police brutality\\". According to The Guardian, \\"there's real disagreement, even among experts who monitor extremist groups, about whether the 'boogaloo' movement as a whole should be described as 'white supremacist'\\" and that analysts from the ADL and Middlebury's Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism (CTEC) have argued that \\"a significant number of 'boogaloo' supporters are genuinely not white supremacist\\". The researchers have described the movement as having two wings: \\"one advocating for race war and one obsessed with societal breakdown and rebellion against the government\\". However, \\"other experts say that lip service from some 'boogaloo' supporters about wanting to be a multi-racial movement should not be taken seriously\\". According to Joan Donovan, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, \\"[w]e're equivocating for the sake of an imagined audience. The idea that you would dismantle the US government at this stage is to undo the protections that have been granted to black people, queer people, disabled people, to stop foreign policy related to immigration. There are always racialized and eugenic sub- themes in these groups. That's what war is, at its base. It's about who should live. I don't think you can get away from the ways in which the rhetoric supports a white supremacist ideology, once you start talking about the kinds of policies or strategies they think need to be implemented\\". While boogaloo groups are often described as a part of a larger boogaloo movement, J. J. MacNab, a George Washington University fellow researching anti-government extremist groups, has said that she does not agree with this characterization: \\"since the majority of participants were radicalized elsewhere prior to donning a Hawaiian shirt‚Äîeither in anti-government militant groups such as the Three Percenters or the militias, or in white supremacy groups‚Äîthe Boogaloo shouldn't be considered an independent movement at this time\\". Speaking to the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism on July 16, 2020, MacNab testified that the boogaloo movement \\"isn't really a movement. It's a dress code, it's a way of talking, it's jargon. The people who belong to it came from other extremist groups, usually on Facebook. They might have been militia, they might have been a white supremacy [group]. They picked it up somewhere and they donned that Hawaiian shirt, and yet they're treated as a separate movement, and the problem is you're ignoring the underlying areas that they came from\\". Bellingcat and the SPLC have also stated that other groups with their own distinct identities have adopted the boogaloo meme, including militias, groups comprising the patriot movement, and the Proud Boys. Members of boogaloo groups typically believe in accelerationism and support any action that will speed impending civil war and eventually the collapse of society. According to The Economist, boogaloo group members have supported to this end the \\"spreading of disinformation and conspiracy theories, attacks on infrastructure (such as that on New York's 311 line) and lone-wolf terrorism\\". Some participants in the movement claim that the group and its ideology are nothing more than online jokes, but law enforcement and researchers maintain that people connected to the groups have been implicated in plans to commit real violence. The Tech Transparency Project has observed that while public posts on boogaloo Facebook pages tend to be satirical, members of private boogaloo groups \\"exchang[e] detailed information and tactics on how to organize and execute a revolt against American authorities\\". Some of the private groups ban the sharing of memes to keep conversation focused on serious topics. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) has also commented on the mix of serious and joking content, writing that \\"this ambiguity is a key feature of the problem: Like a virus hiding from the immune system, the use of comical-meme language permits the network to organize violence secretly behind a mirage of inside jokes and plausible deniability\\". The boogaloo movement has attracted some active-duty members of the military and veterans. While the number of active and former military members is believed to be small when compared to the overall size of the movement, extremism researcher Kathleen Belew has stated that their participation \\"is not a problem we should take lightly\\" due to the threat that they could \\"dramatically escalate the impact of fringe activism, pass on explosives expertise, [or share] urban warfare expertise\\". Following the filing of terrorism charges against three Nevada men with ties to the Department of Defense (DoD), the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) stated in a June 2020 report: \\"Racially motivated violent extremist (RMVE) movements that subscribe to boogaloo have engaged in conceptual discussions about recruiting military or former military members for their perceived knowledge of combat training.... NCIS cannot discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\\" , four men who have been arrested and found to have ties to the boogaloo movement, including the alleged perpetrator of the May and June 2020 killings of two security and law enforcement officers in California, have been veterans or active military servicemen.  Political beliefs  Groups in the boogaloo movement are described by researchers and journalists as far-right. Some groups have also been variously described as being alt- right, libertarian, or right-libertarian. According to Alex Newhouse, a digital researcher at Middlebury's CTEC, \\"the way we know the 'boogaloo' movement is a far-right movement is because they draw a line directly from Waco and Ruby Ridge. They hold up things like the McVeigh bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the armed response to Ruby Ridge as heroic moments in American history\\", which they view as citizens standing up to government oppression. Newhouse also identified the choice by adherents of the movement to provide armed protection to private businesses during anti- lockdown protests and George Floyd protests as evidence that the movement is rightwing, saying that leftists would not be likely to do the same as they are more likely to view large corporations as an integral component of capitalist exploitation. According to Newhouse, this emphasis on the importance of private property is part of what makes the boogaloo movement \\"very much an extreme right libertarian ideology\\". The groups and individuals often self- identify as libertarian, although a few individuals have also described themselves as adherents of other ideologies, including anarcho-capitalism and minarchism. There are also \\"a few apparent anarchists\\", including some self- identified anarchists. Pitcavage described the anarchists who have adopted \\"'boogaloo' rhetoric\\" as generally being right-wing anarcho-capitalists, not left-wing anarchists. MacNab has stated that \\"most boogaloo members are libertarian anarchists who hate cops\\". The SPLC notes that \\"a look at the movement's origins and its online communities make it clear that its politics are much more complicated than straightforward libertarianism\\". The Daily Beast reported in October 2020 that the varying ideologies of groups within the movement cause confusion about its overall ideology, and that some adherents intentionally obfuscate the movement's ideology in order to attract more followers. In June 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tweeted in reply to a Politico article about the boogaloo movement that an intelligence bulletin released by the agency \\"does NOT identify the Boogaloo movement as left-wing OR right-wing\\" and stated that \\"they are simply violent extremists from both ends of the ideological spectrum\\". The Guardian refuted the DHS' description of the movement, saying that experts on extremism concur that the boogaloo movement is right-wing. Daryl Johnson, a former DHS analyst, told The Guardian that he believed the DHS' claim that the boogaloo movement was not right-wing was \\"playing politics\\". Johnson further stated that the boogaloo movement is \\"an ultra-nationalist primarily white movement of people who belong to the militias. Could there be somebody that has different sympathies that's part of it? Sure. It's predominantly rightwing\\".  History  Emergence = Memes referring to the \\"boogaloo\\", a violent uprising or civil war, developed simultaneously among anti-government and white supremacist online communities in the early 2010s. According to the SPLC, both types of communities regularly used the term to refer to racist violence or a race war. Researchers at Bellingcat and the Middlebury's CTEC both traced the origins of the boogaloo meme and the later movement based around it in part to the fringe imageboard website 4chan, where the meme was often accompanied by references to \\"racewar\\" and \\"dotr\\" (day of the rope, a neo-Nazi reference to a fantasy involving murdering what the posters view to be \\"race traitors\\"). On /k/, 4chan's board devoted to discussing weapons, the term was found in posts tracing at least back to 2012. According to Bellingcat researchers, users of /k/ overlap with those of the political discussion board /pol/, where \\"militant white nationalism\\" is the \\"default ideological position\\". Although the researchers do not consider the /k/ board to be white nationalist, and the community actively discourages political discussion, they note racist content is commonplace. CTEC researchers attribute the growth of the movement to the /k/ board, but write that the meme itself also \\"grew organically on the racist board /pol/, due to significant user overlap between the two communities\\". The boogaloo meme migrated to other online communities and the SPLC wrote that boogaloo was a \\"well-established meme in some of the most violently racist spaces on the internet\\" by 2015. They traced usage of the meme back to 2013 on the now-defunct Iron March website, a fascist and neo-Nazi web forum known as the birthplace of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi terrorist organization. Boogaloo adherents participating in a \\"Blue Igloo\\" event in Raleigh, North Carolina in May 2020 Extremism researchers took notice of the word boogaloo being used in the context of the boogaloo movement in 2019, when they observed it being used among fringe groups including militias, gun rights movements, and white supremacist groups. Megan Squire, a computer science professor and online extremism researcher at Elon University, observed the term begin to be used among white supremacists on the Telegram messaging app in the summer of 2019, where they used it to describe a race war. Researchers at the NCRI found that use of the term boogaloo increased by 50% on Facebook and Twitter in the last months of 2019 and into early 2020. They attribute surges in popularity to a viral incident in November 2019 where a military veteran posted content mentioning the boogaloo on Instagram during a standoff with police and to the December 2019 impeachment of Donald Trump. The boogaloo movement experienced a further surge in popularity following the lockdowns that were implemented to try to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and the Tech Transparency Project observed that the boogaloo groups appeared to be encouraged by President Trump's tweets about \\"liberating\\" states under lockdown. The Tech Transparency Project found that 60% of boogaloo Facebook groups had emerged following the pandemic lockdowns, during which time they amassed tens of thousands of followers. A May 2020 Bellingcat report identified Facebook as a particularly important platform for the movement, and in May and April 2020, Bellingcat and the NCRI both estimated the movement to have tens of thousands of adherents. A Facebook spokesperson said that Facebook and Instagram had changed their policies as of May 1 to \\"prohibit the use of ['boogaloo' and related] terms when accompanied by statements and images depicting armed violence\\".  Shooting of Duncan Lemp  On March 12, 2020, Duncan Lemp, a boogaloo Facebook group leader, was fatally shot by police in a no-knock raid of his home in Potomac, Maryland. Police had obtained a no-knock search warrant based on a tip that Lemp was violating a restriction from possessing firearms, although Lemp's family has said they were unaware that he was under any such restriction. Lemp's family has also asserted that he was asleep when he was killed by police. Some far-right groups have theorized that Lemp was killed by police for his anti-government beliefs and his position in the boogaloo movement. J. J. MacNab, a fellow of the George Washington University extremism program, has described Lemp as a \\"martyr\\" of the boogaloo movement and warned that the increase in anti-police sentiment among boogaloo group members following his death may lead to violence against the police in the \\"foreseeable future\\". Some adherents of the boogaloo movement use phrases including \\"we are Duncan Lemp\\" and \\"his name was Duncan Lemp\\", which The New York Times has said they \\"repeat... like mantras\\". Adherents of the boogaloo have posted to Lemp's girlfriend's Instagram account promising to someday avenge his death. = Offline activities = Demonstrators at the 2020 VCDL Lobby Day in Richmond, Virginia on January 20, 2020 Adherents of the boogaloo movement have been observed at pro-gun rights demonstrations, protests against COVID-19 lockdowns, and the George Floyd protests which began in May 2020 and continued through the year. Believers in the movement can also appear unexpectedly at events and protests initiated by others with apparently different affiliations. In January 2020, members of boogaloo groups attended the 2020 VCDL Lobby Day, a gun rights rally organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency for the day of the rally in response to intelligence that indicated there was \\"a threat of an armed militia groups storming our capital\\". Under half of the 50,000 attendees predicted by organizers actually appeared at the demonstration and the event ended peacefully. The rally, which is an annual event, was particularly contentious in 2020 due to a number of gun control bills that were progressing through the Virginia legislature following the 2019 mass shooting in Virginia Beach. These included allowances for localities to ban firearms from venues and functions, red flag legislation that would allow law enforcement to confiscate weapons from those considered a risk to themselves or others, a law that would require background checks to buy or transfer a firearm, and a law that would impose a limit on the number of handguns that could be purchased in a month. Adherents of the movement were also observed attending the anti-lockdown protests that began in mid-April throughout the United States, including in Washington, Tennessee, and New Hampshire. They viewed the lockdowns and related restrictions, which were imposed by state and local governments to try to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, as governmental overreach and some described them as \\"tyranny\\". Some members of boogaloo groups offered armed protection to businesses who wished to reopen in defiance of state shutdown orders.  George Floyd protests  Some members of boogaloo groups attended the protests that occurred across the United States beginning in May 2020 in response to the killing of George Floyd. According to Vice, although the boogaloo groups tried to position themselves as allies of the Black Lives Matter movement, they generally avoided addressing police brutality in the United States as a racial issue. Extremism researcher Robert Futrell spoke of the varied motivations of the adherents of the boogaloo movement who attended the protests, saying: \\"Some folks who identify as Boogaloo Bois share anti- police sentiments. Some are acting as self-appointed security, vowing to protect businesses from protesters. Some say they're monitoring the protests. Some are white supremacists trying to antagonize protesters\\". Posts in some online boogaloo groups called for their members to loot police stations and set fire to government buildings while some encouraged actions emulating the \\"rooftop Koreans\\", a reference to Korean store owners who shot at looters from roofs during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. There were a number of criminal incidents related to boogaloo adherents attending the George Floyd protests as well as a series of killings of law enforcement officers believed to have been committed by two men associated with the boogaloo movement who used the protests as a distraction to commit their attacks. = Online activities = Groups belonging to the boogaloo movement organize on mainstream online platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, in chat rooms on Discord and Telegram, and on more obscure platforms such as 4chan. Online extremism researcher Megan Squire observed references to the boogaloo in white supremacist Telegram chat rooms in the summer of 2019, before the movement began to become popular on gun forums in September of the same year. Vice has also noted the boogaloo meme was popular on the TikTok video sharing application, where the #Boogaloo hashtag had over two million views , although many posters are not believed to be serious adherents of the movement. Social media companies have taken steps to limit boogaloo content and groups on their platforms. However, Squire observed in mid-June 2020 that despite Facebook's policy and enforcement changes to remove and demote boogaloo-related content, membership among boogaloo groups on the platform as well as on Discord and Reddit had remained steady or increased.  Criminality and violence  Since 2019, at least 31 people affiliated with the boogaloo movement have been arrested and five deaths have been publicly linked to boogaloo rhetoric. Some of the charges against people affiliated with the movement include murder, conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, possession of unregistered firearms, making a terroristic threat against a peace officer, inciting a riot, aggravated breach of peace, and drugs charges. = Killings of police and security officers in California = United States Air Force sergeant Steven Carrillo and accomplice Robert Justus were charged with the June 6, 2020 murder of a Santa Cruz County deputy and the May 29 murder of a Federal Protective Service officer in Oakland. At the time of the attacks, Carrillo was an active-duty member of an elite Air Force unit tasked with guarding American military personnel at unsecure foreign airfields. Carrillo wrote \\"Boog\\" and the phrases \\"I became unreasonable\\" (a popular meme among boogaloo groups) and \\"Stop the duopoly\\" in his own blood on the hood of a vehicle he hijacked. A patch with a boogaloo symbol and a ballistic vest bearing the boogaloo symbol of an American flag with an igloo instead of stars were also found in the white van allegedly used in the murders. Authorities linked the crimes to the boogaloo movement and said the men used recent demonstrations against racial injustice as a cover to attack law enforcement. The FBI agent in charge of the investigation said in a news conference that the alleged perpetrators did not appear to intend to join the protests, saying: \\"They came to Oakland to kill cops\\". Authorities have not yet determined a motive behind the shootings. = Plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer = On October 8, 2020, a federal indictment against six men associated with the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based militia group, was unsealed. The indictment charges the men with plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and violently overthrow the state government. The FBI became aware of the scheme in early 2020 after communications among the far-right group were discovered, and via an undercover agent who met with more than a dozen individuals at a meeting in Dublin, Ohio. Another seven men were charged with state crimes in relation to the plot. Authorities reportedly found links between some of the suspects arrested with the broader boogaloo movement. According to an affidavit filed as a part of the state investigation, the seven men who were charged at a state level had been engaging in firearms training and tactical drills to \\"prepare for the 'boogaloo'\\". The leader of the group was known online as \\"Boogaloo Bunyan\\". An NBC News investigation into the suspects' social media profiles found a swift online radicalization following Whitmer's implementation of a statewide lockdown as part of an effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan. = Other incidents = On November 23, 2019, a police officer approached the Mahopac, New York, home of Alex Booth, a 28-year-old Afghanistan War veteran, to investigate an accusation of domestic violence. When Booth refused to come out, police set up a cordon around his home. Booth began streaming the events on his gun-themed Instagram account, where he used the username \\"Whiskey Warrior 556\\". Booth, who was wearing body armor and armed with a knife, believed police had arrived to confiscate a 30-round magazine under his state's red flag laws. During the standoff, Booth began livestreaming on Instagram, referencing the boogaloo and posting memes. Booth gained over 100,000 followers during the incident, some of whom urged him not to surrender to law enforcement. One follower with a large following of his own encouraged others to travel to the town and \\"shoot traitors\\". Booth's own posts became increasingly threatening, but he surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff. Booth was arrested on charges related to the domestic violence accusation. The county sheriff's office denied Booth's claims that the arrest was related to weapons and reported that officers had found no firearms or magazines in the home. The event was later identified as the cause of a large spike in boogaloo-related comments on the 4chan /pol/ board as well as on other boogaloo sites and right-wing militia social media pages, where followers had organized during the incident to disrupt police by bombarding them with phone calls and posted incitements of violence. A Facebook user, who was later identified as Aaron Swenson, was arrested on April 11, 2020 in Texas after streaming a live video on Facebook in which he stated he was driving around looking for police officers to ambush. He was apprehended after a high- speed police chase and found to be wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying loaded firearms and ammunition. Swenson had shared boogaloo memes on his Facebook page and other adherents of the movement watched and commented during his live stream. Swenson had also posted a photo to Facebook the day after the shooting of Duncan Lemp in which he wore a Hawaiian shirt and combat vest and used the hashtag \\"#HisNameWasDuncan\\". Swenson pled not guilty to charges of attempted murder. Molotov cocktails allegedly carried by Boogaloo movement individuals in Nevada, 2020 Three men who identified themselves as members of the boogaloo movement were arrested on May 30, 2020 on terrorism charges in Las Vegas, Nevada. The men, who had been plotting since April to bomb an electrical substation, had decided instead to focus on the protests that were happening throughout the country in response to the killing of George Floyd. At an anti-lockdown protest in Las Vegas several days earlier, they had told a confidential informant that they intended to try to incite violence and kick off a riot at a George Floyd protest. They were arrested when they were found filling canisters with gasoline and creating Molotov cocktails on their way to such a protest on May 30, and each was charged with the federal crimes of conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive and possession of unregistered firearms. They were also accused in state court of felony conspiracy, terrorism, and possession of explosives. The men have pleaded not guilty to the state and federal charges. Each of the three men had ties to the military: one was a Navy veteran, one was an Army reservist, and one was an Air Force veteran. Two men were arrested in Richland County, South Carolina on June 5, 2020 for attempting to incite a riot at a George Floyd protest. Law enforcement believe the men are affiliated with the boogaloo movement. Both men were wearing Hawaiian shirts when they were arrested; one also had boogaloo patches and a flag; the other had two pistols and two long guns. On June 13, 2020 the Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Texas announced they had arrested a personal trainer with ties to the boogaloo movement. The man was arrested on steroids-related drug charges and in a search of his home law enforcement agents found steroids and firearms. The man had previously posted on social media about using \\"guerrilla warfare\\" against members of the National Guard deployed at the George Floyd protests, committing violence against looters and \\"hunting Antifa\\". An armed Black Lives Matter protester named Garrett Foster was shot and killed in an altercation with a motorist on July 25, 2020 in Austin, Texas. Foster reportedly identified with the boogaloo movement and had expressed anti-racist, libertarian, and anti-police views in his Facebook posts. The Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota announced on September 4, 2020 that they had filed terrorism charges against two men who they alleged had attempted to offer their services as \\"mercenaries\\" to an undercover FBI agent they believed to be a senior member of Hamas. The men had also allegedly discussed attacking various targets, including police, white supremacists, government officials and monuments, and members of the media. The Daily Beast observed in an article published on October 9, 2020 that four state and federal operations to arrest a total of sixteen individuals associated with the boogaloo movement had transpired over the previous seven days, including the arrests of the men involved in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer. They noted the uptick in arrests could be attributed to increased law enforcement attention on the movement, but that it could also be explained by increased criminal activity by boogaloo-affiliated people and groups.  Reactions  Law enforcement and government = Federal law enforcement agencies and supporting organizations have issued statements warning of the possibility of violence related to the boogaloo movement. In April 2020, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) published a Threat Awareness Message about the movement and the potential danger it posed to law enforcement and government. A May 29, 2020 memo published by the DHS warned law enforcement of an extremist white supremacist Telegram channel encouraging its members to commit acts of violence and inciting them to \\"start the 'boogaloo'\\". Following the filing of terrorism charges against three Nevada men who had allegedly planned to incite a riot at George Floyd protests, the NCIS published a report on June 4 warning that boogaloo adherents had discussed recruiting former or active- duty military servicemen and they could not \\"discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\\" On June 15, 2020, the Trump administration issued a warning to law enforcement and public safety organizations that adherents of the boogaloo movement might target Washington, D.C. The National Capital Region Threat Intelligence Consortium, a fusion center that aids the DHS and other federal national security and law enforcement groups, wrote, \\"the District [of Columbia] is likely an attractive target for violent adherents of the boogaloo ideology due to the significant presence of US law enforcement entities, and the wide range of First Amendment-Protected events hosted here\\". The report also warned that adherents may live in D.C. or may be prepared to travel long distances to D.C. \\"to incite civil unrest or conduct violence encouraged in online forums associated with the movement\\". On June 19, the DHS published an intelligence report that drew a similar conclusion and stated that \\"domestic terrorists advocating for the boogaloo very likely will take advantage of any regional or national situation involving heightened fear and tensions to promote their violent extremist ideology and call supporters to action\\". On June 26, 2020, Attorney General William Barr announced in a memo that he had created a Department of Justice task force to investigate \\"anti-government extremists\\" who had disrupted protests and attacked members of law enforcement, specifically identifying the boogaloo movement and \\"Antifa\\" as targets of the task force's investigation. The task force is led by attorneys Craig Carpenito and Erin Nealy Cox. = Social media platforms = On May 1, 2020, Facebook amended its policy on violence and incitement to prohibit boogaloo and similar terms \\"when used with images or statements depicting armed violence\\". On June 5, 2020, Facebook told Reuters that it would make it harder to find groups associated with the boogaloo movement by no longer recommending such groups to members of similar associations. Facebook also told The Verge that it would be demoting boogaloo-related content in search results. On June 30, 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed a network of 220 boogaloo groups and 95 Instagram accounts as well as over 400 other groups that hosted similar content. Writing for CNBC, journalist Salvador Rodriguez observed that the removals occurred amidst a Facebook boycott in which companies including Coca- Cola, Starbucks, and Volkswagen announced they would no longer advertise on the platform due to \\"the hate speech and misinformation that persists on Facebook\\". Paid advertisements for body armor and other products using boogaloo keywords ran on Facebook and Instagram for several months prior to the removals. TikTok hides hashtags related to the boogaloo movement, and their content policies prohibit videos containing firearms outside of a few exceptions, such as when used in a fictional context or when \\"used in a safe and controlled environment such as a shooting range\\". On July 2, 2020, a BBC reporter was still able to find many boogaloo-related TikTok posts by users who had employed various methods to avoid detection by moderators on the platform. A Twitter spokesperson said that Twitter views boogaloo content as free expression and does not ban accounts solely for their use of the term, but that they had banned numerous accounts that used the term for violating other policies, such as trying to circumvent a previous ban. In a June 24, 2020 article on Vice, Tess Owen wrote that some of the most active boogaloo communities were on Discord, a chat program popular among online gamers. Following the publication of the article, which included screenshots of a Discord server where members of the military were sharing their expertise, Discord shut down the server and deleted the accounts of its members, determining they had violated Discord policy against \\"threatening and encouraging violence\\". With 2,258 users, it was believed to be the largest boogaloo community on Discord. The community created and migrated to a subreddit after their removal from Discord, but Reddit banned the subreddit shortly afterward.

Life  Born in Wernigerode, Hirschfeld received his first violin lessons at the music school from the age of 5. At the age of 9 he began composing. From 1982 to 1987 he studied composition with Udo Zimmermann and Wilfried Kr√§tzschmar and violin with Christian Redder at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden. Until 1989 he was master student of Udo Zimmermann. Other important mentors were Paul-Heinz Dittrich, Gret Palucca, the dancer and the painter G√ºnter Firit. From 1987 to 1994 Hirschfeld taught at the Dresden Academy of Music and the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin. He also worked at the ACMP Foundation in New York and at the Rheinsberg Music Academy. Besides being a composer, he appeared in the 90s as a dancer and performance artist as well as a pianist and . Hirschfeld's compositional oeuvre includes incidental music, ballets, symphonies, choral music, chamber music, solo works and songs as well as tango and jazz cycles. In 1991 his chamber opera Bianca was premiered at the Salzburg Festival. In 2005 his work Wandlungen V - Doppelkonzert f√ºr Violine, Violoncello und Orchester was premiered at the Magdeburg Cathedral for the award of the to former Federal President of Germany Richard von Weizs√§cker. His musical language can be attributed to New Music, but cannot be assigned to a particular school, since his personal style combines a wide variety of influences. In many works, strongly motoric elements and culminating drama are contrasted with a distinct internalization and singing and gestural-dancing. Hirschfeld also performs as a violinist, primarily with Baroque music (among others with the Albert/Hirschfeld Duo with the guitarist Sebastian Albert) and contemporary music  Awards * Carl Maria von Weber Prize of the city of Dresden (1984) * Mendelssohn Scholarship of the Ministry of Culture of the GDR (1987/88) * G√∂ttinger Gitarrenpreis (2000) * Carl von Ossietzky Kompositionspreis (2015)  Literature  * Hirschfeld, Caspar Ren√©.

Early life and education Kernan was born in 1933 to Annie Connor and Frederick Kernan in Glasnevin. She was the second of four children including Denis, Gerard, and Una. Kernan was educated in the Dominican College on Eccles St, because they had a class in physics. She went on to study physics at University College Dublin graduating with first-class honours in 1952. Kernan was the only woman in the class. After graduation Kernan went on to complete her PhD in physics in her alma mater in 1957. Kernan worked there as a lecturer for four years. She also worked in the University of Rochester. Kernan won a post-doctoral scholarship at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. Her next role was at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Finally in 1967, she joined the Department of Physics at the University of California, Riverside. She went on to become chair of the physics department, vice chancellor for research and dean of the graduate division. In each case Kernan was the first woman in all these roles. Career In 1983, Kernan worked with Professor Carlo Rubbia and Dr Simon van der Meer. She led the US team on the CERN international Nobel-prize winning experiment to discover the two sub-atomic particles, W and Z bosons. Kernan was invited to the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm. Kernan was part of the team that went on to discover the top quark in 1995. She had been working as part of the DZero experiment at the Tevatron collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago since 1986. Kernan was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was a supporter of women in STEM.

The company first started selling Wildroot Hair Tonic in 1911. In the 1920s, the tonic was primarily marketed to women, with advertisements warning that bobbed hair and tight hats would cause baldness, unless they used the Wildroot product. Wildroot started marketing the product to men in the 1930s. In 1937, the company was scolded by the Federal Trade Commission for claiming that Wildroot Hair Tonic keeps the scalp \\"healthy\\", \\"penetrates\\" the sebaceous glands, cleans up dandruff \\"completely\\", and that the results were \\"guaranteed\\". The company's original tonic was alcohol-based, which became more scarce during World War II. In the early 40s, chemist Emanuel Gundlach invented a new alcohol-free formula. At first, Gundlach presented the Wildroot executives with a cream that came in a tube, but they rejected that formulation. Adding more water to the mix, the company bottled the product, and the new Wildroot Cream-Oil was a success. The product's main ingredient was lanolin, also known as wool grease, which is a wax secreted by the sebaceous glands of domestic sheep. Wildroot Cream-Oil was first sold in 1943. In the 1950s, the product was associated with the greaser subculture, teenage boys who slicked their hair down into a ducktail style. In 1951, the Wildroot Hair Tonic Company set up the Wildroot Foundation (now the Western New York Foundation), which provides funds for local organizations in Buffalo. The Wildroot company was sold to Colgate-Palmolive in 1959 for $10.5 million dollars. A \\"Wildroot Hair Groom\\" is still being marketed today by the Oakhurst Company. Promotion At the height of the product's popularity, the company advertised extensively in print, radio and television, claiming that Wildroot Cream-Oil is \\"again and again the choice of men who put good grooming first.\\" In print ads, the company encouraged consumers to try \\"the Famous Finger Nail Test\\": \\"Scratch your head and see if you find dryness or loose, ugly dandruff. If so, you need the new Wildroot Cream-Oil formula.\\" The company's commercial jingle, Wildroot Charlie, suggested: : Get Wildroot Cream Oil, Charlie; : It keeps your hair in trim. : You see, it‚Äôs nonalcoholic, Charlie; : It‚Äôs made with soothin‚Äô lanolin... Wildroot's many radio sponsorships included The Adventures of Sam Spade (1946-50). When Sam Spade star Howard Duff and creator Dashiell Hammett were listed in the anti-Communist tract Red Channels, Wildroot was unhappy with the names being associated with the show. Sam Spade was removed from the air in 1950, and replaced with a more Wildroot-friendly title, Charlie Wild, Private Detective, which ran from September 1950 to July 1951. Other radio sponsorships included The Woody Herman Show (1945‚Äì46), The King Cole Trio (1946‚Äì48), The FBI in Peace and War (1951‚Äì52), The Shadow (1952‚Äì53) and Twenty Questions (1952‚Äì53). Television sponsorships included The Adventures of Robin Hood (1956). In the 1950s, Al Capp's comic strip hero Fearless Fosdick (a spoof of Dick Tracy) endorsed Wildroot Cream-Oil in a popular series of print advertisements, presented in comic strip form. In the ads, Fosdick battled his nemesis Anyface, a murderous scoundrel who could mold his pliable face into any form of disguise. Fosdick always recognized the villain, however, because of his telltale dandruff. At the end of the ad, Fosdick encouraged readers to \\"Get Wildroot Cream-Oil, Charlie!\\" The character was also featured on promotional tin signs displayed at barber shops.

She has previously been a Hauser Visiting Leader at Harvard Kennedy School Center for Public Leadership and assistant clinical professor position at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Chen was the founding director of the nonprofit organisation Doctors for America.  Early life and education  Chen is from the San Francisco Bay Area. She studied biology at Yale University. When she arrived at Yale, Chen played violin and piano, but she picked up several more extra curricular activities, including Russian and Chinese calligraphy, during the course of her undergraduate studies. She lived in Morse College. She was a student at Yale when she first became involved with campaigning, taking part in a protest on New Haven Green to stand against land mines. She moved to the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University for her medical degree, and graduated in 2005. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Chen volunteered as a caseworker for the American Red Cross. For the following six months she helped to lead the largest service center in Manhattan. Chen was an internal medicine resident at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Here she served as director of the UCLA residency program in Malawi.  Research and career  In the leadup to the 2008 United States presidential election Chen signed an open letter from Doctors for Obama calling for reform of the United states healthcare system. After the election of Barack Obama, the doctors regrouped and renamed themselves Doctors for America. The campaigning transcended Chen's personal and professional life, and she became an advocate for engaging members of the academic community in policy issues. Chen is an advocate for healthcare equity and has worked to ensure access to high-quality, affordable healthcare for all in the United States. In 2011 Chen became the executive of Doctors for America, and led the organisation for six years. Doctors for America is a nonprofit who mobilise physicians and medical students to improve the health of people in the United States. In this capacity she was at the forefront of policy changes, such as the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. She called for mass shootings to be treated as a public health issue. In 2017 Chen was appointed a Hauser Leader at the Center for Public Leadership, John F. Kennedy School of Government. During her position Chen studied the epidemic of loneliness, which was thought to impact almost half of American adults, as well as the health impacts of global warming. She also studied how public health policy changed in the post-Obama administration world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chen called for people who were isolating to remember to set aside time everyday to check-in with their friends and families, and to use their time in lockdown to find ways to help others. In an interview with CBC News, Chen said that the social isolation \\"can spiral into depression or anxiety, and this can have serious ramifications on a person's physical and mental health\\". Writing with her husband and fellow physician, Vivek Murthy, in The Atlantic, Chen argued that the lingering damage of breaking up communities would be more difficult to measure than the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the economy. She was appointed to Kishan Putta's coronavirus disease advisory board, which looked to advise the council member on how to handle the COVID-19 pandemic.  Personal life  As of 2015, Chen is married to Vivek Murthy, M.D., a former Surgeon General of the United States. They have a son and a daughter.

In 1947, it identified a \\"prevailing theme throughout‚Äìthat democratic leadership was close to non- existent and Communist leadership at the forefront of political shaping.\\" Members Christian Herter (here on Time cover dated 17 August 1953) was a prominent Republican politician of the 1940s and 1950s Committee members came not only from the House Foreign Affairs Committee but also geographically and politically diverse members: Staff members included: History Representative Frances P. Bolton visited the Middle East as part of the committee's tour of Europe On July 29, 1947, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution 296 that created a Select Committee on Foreign Aid, comprising 19 members. On August 28, 1947, the committee and staff sailed to Europe. The group comprised 17 representatives, ten consultants, and two secretaries. In London, they met with UK Minister of Food John Strachey. During the voyage, they received briefings. They visited every European nation except Albania, Russia, and Yugoslavia. Additionally, non- committee members Frances P. Bolton and Chester E. Merrow visited the Middle East (then \\"Near East\\"), while Walter H. Judd traveled to China, Japan, and Korea. In October 1947, the Herter Committee came back home \\"with a healthy and wholehearted respect for Europe's Reds.\\" Representative Thomas A. Jenkins (R-OH) called activity by Communist Yugoslavia at Trieste \\"terrorism.\\" Representative James P. Richards (D-SC) said that the committee saw Communist leaders in Italy, France, and England who were \\"tough, hard, fanatical, well- financed and clever\\"; he called it a \\"great tragedy\\" that Europeans were unaware of the degree of American aid to date. European progress was moving slowly; the committee noted that Finnish farmers were feeding cattle with \\"a mixture of fish and wood pulp.\\" The committee noted concern about Communist guerrillas in the Greek Civil War (1946-1949) and the rise of the Italian Communist Party under Palmiro Togliatti. At that point, the committee planned to recommend aid but at $12 Billion (not $19 Billion) as a loan (not a gift) with an American entity to oversee not only distribution but advantages for the United States on imports like rubber, tin, and manganese. On Thursday, November 13, 1947, the Herter Committee released seven reports to Congress (published next day by newspapers). While their reports addressed more immediate aid at that moment, they indicated the direction of their stance on the Marshall Plan. (Also, President Truman was to address Congress the following Monday to urge support for the Marshall Plan. ) Herter focused on the threat of \\"Communist-controlled labor unions.\\" Bolton linked the growing Cold War front in Europe with America's long-term security. John Davis Lodge saw the plan as a tool to support America's \\"democratic system and its moral and spiritual values.\\" The seven reports covered: The reports included grave concerns about the spread of Communism in Europe by former WWII ally the USSR, particularly Italy (as of November 1947): > The upward trend in the cost of living, wages and Government deficits > continued unabated during two years of Communist participation in the > Government. This was due (a) to lack of political strength and to technical > incompetence of the Government, and (b) to deliberate sabotage on the part > of the Communists to create chaotic conditions which they hoped would make > the rise of a totalitarian regime inevitable. Since the expulsion of the > Communists, the Government has adopted a strong program for the > stabilization of the including improvements in the tax-collection system, > control over speculation, and more effective control over Government > expenditures. Frank Lindsay, who served in the OSS (1944-1945) served as a consultant to the Herter Committee (1947-1948, after which he was stationed in Paris for the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, and then worked for the newly formed United States Central Intelligence Agency or CIA (1949-1953). Later, he helped set up the European side of the Marshall Plan and helped fellow OSS officer Frank Wisner establish the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), a covert operation wing of the CIA. LegacyMarshall Plan= 1948 label for Marshall Plan aid packages See Marshall Plan On March 13, 1948, the Marshall Plan passed both the United States Senate (71:19) and House (333:78). On April 1, 1948, the plan went to joint conference committee; on April 2, 1948, it passed both the House and Senate. On April 3, 1948, US President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law. In 1951 the Marshall Plan was largely replaced by the Mutual Security Act. The resulting European Recovery Program (ERP) transferred more $12 billion (more than $128 billion as of 2020) to Western European economies and operated for four years. ERP goals included: rebuilding war-torn regions, removing trade barriers, modernizing industry, improving European prosperity, and preventing the spread of Communism. The ERP required a reduction of interstate barriers, a dropping of many regulations; it encouraged an increase in productivity, as well as the adoption of modern business procedures. Economists Bradford DeLong and Barry Eichengreen deemed the Marshall Plan \\"History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program,\\" stating: > It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by > financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, > or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan > did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western > Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed > European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II > \\"mixed economies\\" with more \\"market\\" and less \\"controls\\" in the mix. =Nixon= For Richard Nixon (here in 1946 congressional campaign flyer), as a result of experience on the Herter Committee, \\"foreign policy was the chief focus on my concern in public life.\\" Nixon's name appears only once and only in a list of committee members. On May 15, 2008, the journalist Daniel Schorr recalled: > He [Nixon] was a member of the House led by Chris Herter. And they made a > tour of Europe to see how the Marshall Plan was working. Among places they > came to were Holland where I was living, and they had a press conference, > and I met them, but I must admit to you, at that time I was paying attention > to Herter. Nixon was not a very big name at that point. In his 1960 memoir Six Crises, Nixon does not mention what he learned from his trip to Europe with the Herter Committee, nor again does he in the 1978 RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon. In his 1980 memoir The Real War, Nixon recalled: > In a more fundamental sense, however, this book's origins go back more than > thirty years, to my early days as a Congressman in the period immediately > following World War II. It was then that I toured war-devastated Europe as a > member of the Herter Committee, as we sought to chart what America's role > should be in helping its recovery. From then on, foreign policy was the > chief focus on my concern in public life. In his 1982 book Leaders, he mentions meeting Italian Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi during his Herter Committee trip. Nixon recalled: > Italy's most important elections since the ware were less than a year away. > Its Communist party was the largest and most heavily financed outside the > Soviet bloc.... Italian aristocrats were making their plans to flee the > country if the Communists came to power. The elections would be a crucial > turning point. We knew it. De Gasperi knew it. The Soviets knew it. On July 13, 1973, during an exit interview, Herbert G. Klein, Executive Branch Communications Director for Nixon, said: > ...[Nixon] impressed me deeply by his ability to observe things almost as a > newsman as he went through the various countries. I can recall him telling > me that he made ita point of going to the minimun nunber of official > functions and trying to spend his time out talking to the people or > observing things in the countryside. One of the things I remember most was > that he brought back a picture of himself from either Greece or Turkey (I > believe it was Greece) standing by a stucco wall with a hammer and sickle > painted on the back of it.... In 1948... in those days in California, you > could run on both tickets, so that you could seek the Democratic nomination > by cross-filing, as well as the Republican. He [Nixon] cross-filed. Because > of the intensity of the activity with the Marshall Plan which emerged from > the Herter Committee, with what he was doing on the House Un-American > Activities Committee and on the Labor Committee and some things he was doing > for the district.... The big district issue was the Whittier Narrows dam. In 2007, Klein recalled: > ...We'd go out and have a cup of coffee, and he would talk to me first about > the Hiss matter, and then he went with the Herter Committee, and he would > come back and tell me about what he'd seen and what he learned there, and > recalled Turkey aid when he went to Greece. I remember one of the things he > was talking to me about was when we went to Greece and it was the episode > with Tito on the other side, and that he decided the embassy parties were > fine, but he would rather be out in the countryside.

The suburb is centred around the intersection of Lincoln Road and Hoon hay Road, two arterial routes which form part of State Highway 75 and feed into the Christchurch Southern Motorway which runs to the north of the suburb. ≈åpƒÅwaho / Heathcote River flows through the suburb, acting as a boundary for Hillmorton's residential development on one side and the Canterbury Agricultural Park, a purpose-built complex designed to host the annual Canterbury A&P; Show, on the other. It is the location of a number of schools, including Hillmorton High School, Rowley Avenue School and Spreydon School. History Hillmorton takes its name from Hill Morton Farm, the property of John Twigger, who settled in the area in 1863. Land from the subdivision of this farm was advertised for sale in a local newspaper in 1879 as being \\"part of Twigger's property known as Hillmorton\\". At the same time as Twigger settled the area, 1863 also saw the opening of the Sunnyside Hospital, Christchurch's first mental asylum. The buildings were constructed in a gothic style by architect John Campbell, and represented a shift in the approach to mental illness in the region. Where previously those with mental illnesses were held at Lyttelton Gaol,Blake-Palmer, Geoffrey. 1966. 'Hospitals, Mental', In A. H. McLintock, ed., An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. (Accessed 19 August 2007) the hospital was founded on the principles of moral management, providing a more supportive environment for patients. Commitment to this approach varied throughout the hospital's existence, until it was closed in 1999 due to replacement by the neighbouring Hillmorton Hospital. The final buildings of the former Sunnyside Hospital were demolished in April 2007 to make way for additional housing, a move which was met with protest due to the architectural and cultural significance of the structures. Hillmorton Hospital continues to act as a dedicated mental health facility for the city from nearby to the original Sunnyside location. In 1933, Hillmorton was also chosen as the site for a Carmelite monastery to be established as the order's first New Zealand presence. The monastery was originally founded in a pre-existing homestead in June 1933, with the first wing not being completed until four years later. This was followed by the addition of a subsequent wing in 1950, since which point the monastery has maintained their presence in the heart of Hillmorton.

Masalin studied at the Art Society of Finland's Drawing School in Helsinki between 1892 and 1898. Her work was included in national exhibitions by Finnish artists between 1898 and 1905. She worked as a teacher and illustrator. Her best-known paintings were for schools, depicting wild and garden plants and sometimes animals. These paintings show the plants on a black background, as in a school blackboard, and were designed by John Lind√©n, the husband of her cousin. They were published by the Otava company. It is likely that her sister Hedvig made the engravings needed for printing these illustrations. This type of wall illustration was widely used in schools in Finland from the late 19th to the mid-20th century and was an important educational tool. Masalin also painted portraits and landscapes.
