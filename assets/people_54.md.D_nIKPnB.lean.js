The sole member of the class, the submarine was launched on 19 June 1931 at Kobe by Kawasaki. A single Yokosuka E6Y floatplane was carried. A catapult was fitted in 1938 but the capability to operate the aircraft was removed two years later and the boat was reconfigured as an attack submarine. By that time, I-5 had already seen wartime service. In 1937, submarine served in the Second Sino-Japanese War as part of the Third Fleet patrolling the coasts of China, a role that the vessel reprised off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. The submarine subsequently supported the Dutch East Indies campaign and was then transferred to the Indian Ocean, where the boat sank a merchant vessel. After successfully supporting the Aleutian Islands campaign, the submarine was re-equipped as a transport to supply distant Japanese garrisons in 1943. The vessel, equipped with a Daihatsu-class landing craft, ran supplies as far afield as New Britain. I-5 went missing in 1944 and is believed to have been sunk by US Navy destroyer escort near the Mariana Islands with no survivors on 19 July. Design and development During the period following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy saw the potential of aircraft carrying submarines, with investigations noted as early as 1924, when an American report stated, \\"special investigations are now in place at the Oppama (Yokosuka) Aviation Corps about airplane carrying submarines\\". These concepts culminated in a requirement for a submarine larger than existing cruiser submarines and capable of launching a single reconnaissance floatplane. In response, the Junsen 1 Mod. was developed based on the . The submarine was similar in dimensions to the predecessors but had a larger displacement, surfaced and submerged. Length was , beam and draught . Power was provided by two diesel engines which drove two shafts when running on the surface up to a maximum speed of . These also charged the batteries that powered the vessel underwater. When submerged, power was provided by electric motors that provided and enabled a maximum speed of . of fuel oil was carried which gave an endurance of at on the surface. Submerged, the boat could travel for at . The submarine had a diving depth of . The complement was 93, including officers. In addition, the submarine's large size meant that it could operate as a flagship. The main armament was similar to the preceding Junsen 1 submarines, consisting of six internal torpedo tubes, all in the bow. Twenty torpedoes could be carried. At about the same time as the boat was entering service, the Japanese Navy introduced a new standard torpedo for submarines, the Type 89, which entered service in 1931. The torpedo delivered a warhead of over a range of at . It remained in service until the early days of World War II until being replaced by the Type 95, which could carry a larger warhead further at a higher speed, being capable of propelling of explosives over a range of at up to . The deck was fitted with one mount for a single 40 calibre 11th Year Type gun, which could fire a shell at a rate of five rounds per minute. For anti-aircraft defence, a single machine gun was mounted on the conning tower. A single Yokosuka E6Y observation floatplane was carried disassembled in two watertight retractable containers aft of the conning tower, one each port and starboard. The wings were stored in one container, the fuselage and floats in the other. To operate the aircraft, the submarine was required to stop, the containers deployed, the components assembled and the seaplane launched into the sea from which it would then take-off. During training, this proved a lengthy exercise during which the submarine was vulnerable to attack. Later, the deck was fitted with a catapult to increase the range of the aircraft and reduce the time of exposure, but this extended the time for launch required as the assembled aircraft had to be mounted on the catapult. Construction and career I-5 was laid down on 30 October 1929 at Kawasaki Dockyard Co. in Kobe, launched on 19 June 1931, and commissioned on 31 July 1932. The vessel entered service and was attached to Yokosuka Naval District, undergoing training and trials until 1933 when a catapult was fitted during refit. Similarly, between February and July 1936, the deck gun was temporarily replaced with a Type 89 dual purpose gun. At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the submarine was attached to the Third Fleet (China Theatre Fleet) based at Hong Kong alongside the submarine tender and a fleet of cruiser submarines. The fleet was tasked with patrolling and blockading the central and southern Chinese coasts. Between 21 and 23 August, the submarine was in the East China Sea, providing distant cover for two battle fleets built around the battlecruisers and , and the battleships and that ferried troops from Japan to China. In 1940, the submarine was withdrawn from service and refitted. The commissioning of more modern submarine aircraft carriers, the Type A and Type B, meant that the less advanced installation on I-5 was deemed superfluous. Therefore, during the refit, the provision to operate an aircraft was removed and an aft deck gun fitted in its place. At the same time, a single Type 96 anti-aircraft gun was fitted to an extended bridge. The submarine re-entered service as an attack submarine. On 16 November 1941, the submarine departed as part of the 2nd Submarine Squadron led by Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu in , alongside and . The boat arrived off the coast of Hawaii to take up a position west of Oahu and was tasked with patrolling the area and attacking any US Navy ships that attempted to sortie in response to the Japanese action. On 7 December, the submarine moved to patrol north of Molokai, shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The boat then remained on station during the attack. After a brief interlude on 9 January 1942 joining other vessels of the Japanese Navy to hunt for the aircraft carrier , the submarine returned to the Japanese mainland. Following a refit in Yokosuka between 2 and 11 February, the submarine then departed to support the Dutch East Indies campaign, arriving at Staring-baai in Sulawesi on 23 February. On 25 February, while patrolling west of Timor, the submarine was observed by a Mitsubishi C5M reconnaissance aircraft which was being escorted by a flight of nine Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Thinking that they had spotted an enemy vessel, the fighters attacked the submarine, inflicting minor damage and injuring three officers. After repairs, the submarine was sent to the Indian Ocean to disrupt shipping and support the Indian Ocean raid. On 5 April, the ship sank the United States merchant ship . On 5 June, I-5 was transferred to the Aleutian Islands campaign and joined the force, led by Admiral Boshir≈ç Hosogaya, that landed the Japanese Northern Army on Attu Island. However, an increasingly challenging logistical situation meant that on 16 November 1942, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ordered that submarines be made available as transports. Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, who was commander of the 6th Fleet and thus responsible for submarine operations, responded by ordering the conversion of thirteen submarines as transports. The submarines operated a vital service, transferring supplies and people. I-5 was one of the submarines converted and reassigned, and a Daihatsu-class landing craft was fitted on 17 March 1943 to enable the faster transfer of personnel and resources in what were termed \\"ant carrying transport\\" operations. Nine days after, the submarine started the first of nine supply runs between Lae and Rabaul. Later, the submarine was relocated to supply the garrison in the Aleutian Islands. In between, the submarine also undertook other missions, such as rescuing pilots of Mitsubishi G4M bombers shot down by US forces on 14 and 15 May. In June 1944, the Japanese became aware that their forces in the Mariana Islands would be subject to attack and formed a submarine picket, including I-5, east of the Islands. The submarine was subsequently sent on a supply run to Pohnpei between 5 and 9 July, and then sailed to Truk from whence the boat departed on 16 July. On 19 July, the US Navy destroyer escort identified a sonar contact east of Guam. Hedgehog bombs were fired and a destroyed submarine reported. The victim is believed to be I-5. There were no survivors. The submarine was removed from the Navy List on 10 September 1944.

Adopting a modernist style, she painted scenes of rural life in her childhood province and portraits of peasant women. Although she exhibited in Paris in the late 1920s, her most important paintings date from the 1930s. She was largely forgotten until her work was presented in 2019 at Lisbon's Calouste Gulbenkian Museum. Biography Born in Lisbon on 13 May 1899, Sara Sancha Afonso spent her childhood in a modest home in Viana do Castelo in the north-west of Portugal where she attended the Col√©gio de Nossa Senhora de Monserrate. On returning to Lisbon with her parents in 1915, she studied at the Fine Arts School under Columbano Pinheiro, graduating in 1922. In 1924, she spent eight months in Paris attending lectures at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. She was particularly impressed by a exhibition of works by Matisse, as can be seen from her 1924 paintings As Meninas and Anemones in Lisbon's Museu do Chiado. She participated in the SNBA's Autumn Exhibitions in 1925 and 1926 while working as an illustrator of children's books and for the press. Above all, she devoted her time to embroidery and knitting. After a well-received solo exhibition at the Salon Bobonne in 1928, she returned to Paris where she earned a living sewing clothes. She returned to Lisbon in 1929, where over the next few years she presented works in several collective exhibitions, receiving reasonably positive reviews. In September 1933, she returned to her father's village in the Minho region where she was inspired by scenes reminiscent of her childhood years. She is remembered in particular for her works from this period which depict peasant girls, cattle and green hills as well as women nursing or working in the fields. On 31 March 1934, she married the painter Jos√© de Almada Negreiros with whom she had two children. After continuing painting scenes from Minho in the early years of her marriage, she spent most of her time raising a family. In the late 1950s, she returned to book illustration.

Matheny immediately moved into the starting lineup for the Golden Bears, averaging 7.5 points per game and running the offense from the point guard position. At the close of the year, he was named first-team all-conference in recognition of his play, the only sophomore so honored.

In 1952‚Äì53, Matheny averaged 11.9 points per game and was again honored as an all-conference pick. The following season, he raised his scoring average to 13.5 points per game and was named a third-team All-American by Look Magazine.

It links portions of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that are otherwise separated by the Mandai Lake Road. The bridge will allow animals, but not people, to cross from one part of the reserve to the other. Prior to the bridge's construction, animals such as mouse deer, civets, shrew-faced squirrels and Sunda pangolins were cut off from others of their own species by Mandai Lake Road. The bridge is intended to allow individuals living on either side of the bridge to breed with each other and increase genetic diversity. According to authorities, roadkill was not the direct reason for constructing the bridge. However, several animals including a Sunda pangolin, a leopard cat, a sambar deer, a wild boar and several Sunda colugos had been found dead on or near the road in the two years prior to the completion of the bridge, and it is hoped that the bridge will reduce such incidents. History The bridge spans over Mandai Lake Road. The bridge was completed on 6 December 2019 after 2 1/2 years of construction. Trees have been planted on the bridge to replicate a forest environment for animals to use as a crossing although it will take 5 to 10 years for the canopy to mature. The trees planted are of varying heights in order to better replicate a forest environment. The bridge does not actually go into the Central Catchment Nature Reserve but connects two buffer zones which have been established adjacent to the reserve. The buffer zones help ensure that the reserve itself is not impacted by the structure. The bridge is part of a long-term project to develop the area in an environmentally friendly way. The long-term project will include reforestation of the area, as part of a 10-year Mandai Ecological Reforestation Plan. The project will also add a new bird park and a rainforest park to the area, which already contains the Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari and the River Safari attractions.

Although first launched in arcades, the game has been re- released through download services for various consoles. The title has gained a cult following since its initial release.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. ZuPaPa! is a platform game reminiscent of Bubble Bobble and Snow Bros., where players assume the role of star-like creatures ZuPaPa (P1) and ZuPiPi (P2) through various stages, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further.Zupapa arcade flyer (SNK, EU) Each player can throw small creatures called Zooks at enemies until each one is completely covered and turns into a star bomb, which defeats any enemy that comes into contact with it. The more Zooks are thrown against an enemy, the larger the attack range becomes. Defeated enemies may drop an items or power- ups such as speed increasers and bonus points. Players have to complete every level within a specific period of time before exceeding an invisible timer. If the players do not manage to eliminate all the enemies in time, an angry alarm clock ringing loudly and a devil creature appears. Getting hit by enemy fire or if the devil manages to touch ZuPaPa or ZuPiPi before all enemies are eliminated will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the characters' firepower and speed to their original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  ZuPaPa! was developed by Face and was first showcased to the public at the 1994 AOU Show, in addition to being previewed through various publications, however the game was never released until SNK published it in September 2001. The title has since received a re-release by Hamster Corporation in recent years on digital distribution platforms such as the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.  Reception  IGN regarded ZuPaPa! to be a \\"cult title\\". Chris Moyse of Destructoid praised the sprite work but noted the gameplay to be \\"anachronistic\\".

She is a former member of women in physics promotion of International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) from 2000 to 2008.  Education  Rao earned her Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1977 and Master of Science degree in physics from Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai with distinction in 1979. She worked on Neutrino Oscillations during her Masters. She received her doctoral degree entitled B-L violation in grand unified theories from Stony Brook University, US under the supervision of Robert Shrock in 1983.  Research career  Rao did her PhD in high energy physics, particularly in the sub-field of grand unified theories. After her postdocs at Fermilab and at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, she joined the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar in 1987. But she made a crucial decision to shift her field of research to theoretical condensed matter physics from high energy physics, when she found that her achievements were belittled, and her work and papers referred to her husband Ashoke Sen working on the same field. This decision was not so easy for her, since a lot of her training in high energy physics and contacts abroad would no longer be useful and she would have to start all over again. She is currently a condensed matter systems Professor at the Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) and have been there since 1995. She has been working in the area of electronic transport in quantum wires, quantum dots and in the field of correlated mesoscopic physics in low dimensions. She also worked as an Associate scientist at International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), a centre of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste.  Women in science promotion  Rao has always been vocal about the detrimental biases faced by women academic scholars. Rao's scientific contributions were undervalued with innuendos that her husband, also a famous scientist in the same field, wrote her papers for her. She has involved in the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) working group women in physics which has been working to increase the representation of women in physics, particularly at higher and decisionmaking levels of from its inception in 2000 until 2008. She wrote articles focusing on the topic of getting girls interested in a career in science or engineering and interested in reaching the top of their profession, the hurdles they will have to face, and the ways to improve their chances of making it to the top of respective fields.  Fellowships and awards  Rao has been awarded as Fellow of National Academy of Sciences, India in 2001 and Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2017 for her contributions in the theoretical condensed matter physics.

It has a radiometric age of 1653¬±16 Ma, corresponding to the Statherian period. History of investigation The unit was first defined by Kelley and Northrop in 1975.Kelley and Northrop 1975 It has also been referred to as the Cibola granite. Grambling et al. 2016, pp.170-171 Geology The pluton lies in the southern Sandia Mountains, with Sandia granite to the northwest and Seven Springs shear zone to the south. The pluton may include three compositionally distinct phases: a fine-grained, peraluminous, two-mica leucogranite with a radiometric age of 1632¬±45 Ma, a medium-grained equigranular monzogranite with a radiometric age of 1659¬±13 Ma, and a generally coarse-grained monzogranite with no reported age. The gneiss is locally mylonitic with a strong gneissic metamorphic fabric defined by alignment of micas. A typical modal composition is 35% quartz, 30% plagioclase, and 20% potassium feldspar, 7% muscovite, 6% biotite, 1% opaques, and 1% trace minerals. The trace minerals are actinolite, chlorite, epidote, andalusite, sphene, zircon, rutile, apatite, tourmaline, and limonite. The feldspar component becomes more alkalic close to the Sandia granite, with potassium feldspar and sillimanite coexisting only close to the contact. The pluton contains xenoliths of quartzite, lithic arenite, amphibolite, and phyllitic schist that contain andalusite, kyanite, sillimanite, fibrolite, and retrograde chlorite. This suggests a metamorphic grade similar to the aureole of the nearby Manzanita pluton. The pluton is interpreted as having been emplaced during caldera volcanism associated with the Mazatzal orogeny.Grambling et al. 2016 FootnotesReferences * * Category:Precambrian formations of New Mexico Category:Paleoproterozoic magmatism Category:Proterozoic North America ","title":"Cibola gneiss"},{"id":"64088871","text":"Wicked Jazz Sounds is a Dutch music collective and event organizer located in Amsterdam founded in 2002.

History  Charles Wilfrid Newton was born on 11 December 1928 in South Africa, and was educated at schools in Johannesburg and the University of the Witwatersrand. Starting out as an accountant in industry, he became group managing director, and subsequently the chief executive of Turner & Newall. = Hong Kong and MTR = In 1983, he left Turner & Newall to join the Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) as chairman and chief executive. The MTR was founded in 1975 as a government owned statutory corporation to build and operate a mass transit system for the then British colony. The MTR had just opened its first railway line connecting Hong Kong Island to Kowloon in 1979. Newton led the building of a new line on Hong Kong island itself ‚Äì the Island line, which connected the Western district to Chai Wan. In May 1985, Newton presided over the opening ceremony of the line at Tai Koo, with a plaque unveiled by Governor of Hong Kong Sir Edward Youde. Following this, a second harbour tunnel to carry increased numbers of passenger traffic opened in 1989. Thanks to high ridership and property development including shopping malls and development built over railway depots (such as Telford Gardens) - the MTR was being run without government subsidy. Newton also chaired the Hong Kong Futures Exchange from 1986‚Äì89, as well as becoming a non executive director of HSBC. = London and London Regional Transport = In 1989, Newton was invited to be become chairman and chief executive of London Regional Transport, and chairman of London Underground. Newton‚Äôs major project was the implementation of the Jubilee Line Extension ‚Äì the first major extension to the Underground in 20 years. Experts from Hong Kong including MTR architect Roland Paoletti were recruited to progress the multi billion pound project ‚Äì which eventually opened in 1999. Newton also worked on the upgrade and modernisation of London Underground, branding the Tube network ‚Äúan appalling shambles‚Äù at a seminar on the future of London in 1991, noting that ‚ÄúThe infrastructure has been neglected for 30 years‚Äù. However the recession in the early 1990s cut ticket revenue, which was exacerbated by stop-go investment and Treasury budget cuts by around 30 per cent between 1993 and 1996 ‚Äì making it difficult to progress the upgrade programme. By March 1993, Newton authorised managers to blame deteriorating services and cancellations on broken Government pledges. Newton himself appeared on television after the November 1993 Budget and criticised the funding of London Regional Transport. Due to retire at 65, Newton was unable to step down as Chairman of London Transport in 1994 as the Treasury vetoed his chosen replacement.

The open frame fuselage supported the three gas- producers and main rotor mast, with a small single-seat cockpit in the nose, which was originally open, but later enclosed. Development McDonnell had been interested in the flying-crane concept from just after the war, investigating rotors driven directly by ramjets and compressed air tip jets on the McDonnell XH-20 Little Henry, the cancelled McDonnell 79 Big Henry and the McDonnell XV-1 high-speed compound helicopter. The expected advantages included: (1) inherent angle of attack stability; (2) increased inherent pitch and roll damping; (3) greatly improved dynamic helicopter stability; (4) ability to start and stop in high winds; (5) no need for tracking and no dampers required; (6) no possibility of mechanical instability or ground resonance; (7) very low vibration; (8) low maintenance due to absence of highly loaded bearings, reduction gears, shafting, and anti-torque rotor; and (9) automatic rotor speed control. McDonnell started development of a private- venture flying crane helicopter in December 1956, progressing rapidly with a mock-up in January 1957 and the first of two prototypes flying on 13 November 1957, piloted by John R. Noll. The airframe of the Model 120 was very simple, comprising a welded steel-tube open structure, with the three-bladed main- rotor mast and gas-producers attached without covering. Rotor drive was by compressed air rotor-tip jets, fed by three gas power AiResearch GTC 85-135 gas-producers. The Model 120 was only ever intended to carry loads under-slung or attached directly to cargo hooks on the underside of the top fuselage beam, including specialised pods. Although aimed at the US Army the Model 120 was also evaluated by the US Navy at the Naval Air Test Center (NATC), NAS Patuxent River, in September 1959. The Model 120 experienced powerplant problems initially, but demonstrated an excellent load to weight ratio of 1.5:1, but despite the proven performance no orders were forthcoming and cancellation of the project in February 1960 signalled the end of McDonnell's helicopter aspirations.

Biography Born Neil Burgess Junior on 2 August 1918 to Roy Neil Burgess and Lucia L. Payne of Melrose, Massachusetts. He started working for GE in the 1930s. Burgess earned a Masters in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939. In 1943 he married Evelyn Ruth Lent (1922-2000) and they had five children: Cynthia, Mark Neil, Susan, Nancy, and Wendy.

J79 General Electric J79 The J79 and the F-104 were developed concurrently. The J79 was the first engine to exceed Mach 2, Burgess and Neumann solved the problems of rapid acceleration without compressor stall while maintaining reliability and lower fuel consumption over a wide speed range. They reduced compressor stalls by developing the J79's revolutionary \\"variable stator\\" that fine-tunes air compression at the engine inlet. The variable stator worked so well that engineers did not believe that engine test cell performance readings. The J79 started test runs in June 1954 and flew on the F-104 maiden flight on 17 February 1956. The first J79 allowed the F-104 to achieve Mach 1.1 in full power and Mach 2.2 with afterburner.

Hall Pleasants, 1873-1957, M.D., art historian and genealogist who researched and wrote about people of Maryland and especially Baltimore. Most notably he wrote scholarly articles and books about painters and silversmiths in Maryland, and early American artists such as the African-American portrait artist Joshua Johnson and landscape painter Francis Guy which led to exhibitions and more scholarship about these artists.  Biography  Jacob Hall Pleasants was born September 12, 1873 near Towson, Maryland. Richard Hall Pleasants and Elizabeth Moale (Poultney) Pleasants were his parents. In 1899 Pleasants received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University. He practiced medicine in Baltimore, and taught medical diagnosis at Johns Hopkins from 1900 to 1935. He had a slight case of tuberculosis and the study of this disease did become a focus for him. He was a member of the Maryland Tuberculosis Sanatorium Commission. He left that role in 1921. Outside of medicine, he was also a scholar of local history, and fine arts. During his life he served as a trustee for the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Gilmor Country School, Johns Hopkins University, the Peabody Institute, the Peale Museum, and the corresponding secretary and the vice president of the Maryland Historical Society over the course of 23 years, starting in 1898. He also served as the president of the Supervisors of City Charities in Baltimore from 1904 to 1921. In 1924 Pleasants started working with the Frick Art Reference Library and helped the Library research and identify paintings to photograph in and around Baltimore. Pleasants was an important contact for the Library and provided them with information on thousands of Maryland paintings and miniatures. over the course of 33 years. In 1902, J. Hall Pleasants and Delia Tudor Wilmer, daughter of Skipwith Wilmer, were married. They had three children together.

It has a radiometric age of 1453¬±12 Ma, corresponding to the Calymmian period. Description Sandia Granite with xenolith The Sandia granite is prominently exposed along the east flank of the Rio Grande rift, with almost of exposure at Sandia Crest. It extends from Placitas to Tijeras Canyon. Its radiometric age is 1453¬±12 Ma. The pluton is a single body with significant heterogeneities. The primary phase is monzogranite with a secondary phase of granodiorite. It is notable for the presence of local outcrops of orbicular granite. Both major phases contain diorite inclusions that are interpreted as co-mingled melts. Exposures are typically gray to pink, medium-to-coarse grained, monzogranite. Aplite and pegmatite dikes crosscut by quartz veins are common. The average modal composition is 28% quartz, 25% potassium feldspar, 38% plagioclase, 8% biotite, and 1% accessory minerals, including magnetite, titanite, zircon, hornblende, apatite, and muscovite. There are three generations of deformation preserved in the contact aureole that indicate regional deformation. Microstructure and foliation in the aureole indicate east-west compression and north-south extension during and shortly after pluton emplacement, but the pluton interior is undeformed. Pluton emplacement involving heating to ~650¬∞C at pressures of 2-3 kbars, corresponding to a depth of 7-10 km. The pluton is interpreted as having been emplaced syntectonically at middle crustal depth during the Picuris orogeny.

History Typical octagonal base of an Archives miniature, 1977 Orc from Archive's 25 mm Middle Earth line, showing typical stretched octagonal base with clipped corners One of the first fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) to be published after the appearance of Dungeons & Dragons in 1974 was White Bear and Red Moon, a fantasy RPG set in the world of Glorantha, created by Chaosium of Oakland, California in 1975. Chaosium searched for a company that could produce metal miniatures specific to Glorantha, and found Archive Miniatures in nearby Burlingame, run by head sculptor Neville Stocken and his wife Barbara,. Chaosium granted their first license to Archive to create 25 mm Gloranthan miniatures. In his 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '70s, Shannon Appelcline noted that \\"Soon some of the counters from White Bear and Red Moon such as the darkness witch Cragspider and the centaur Ironhoof were represented in lead. Some of Archive's existing miniatures also got incorporated into the Gloranthan series, so that Stocken would have more licensed miniatures to sell immediately. Most notably, Archive's existing 'Pumpkinhead' figure became the infamous Gloranthan Jack O'Bear.\\" Archive soon released other licensed lines, including miniatures for J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, Chaosium's Runequest, TSR's D&D;, Lucasfilm's Star Wars, and Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone. Although the market quickly became flooded with metal miniatures from other American and British companies, those from Archive remained distinctive for their unique \\"stretched octagonal\\" bases, formed when the corners of the rectangular bases were clipped off. In 1978, Archive also tried to move into the RPG market with a science fiction RPG called Star Rovers. Game designer David A. Hargrave, best known for creating the quirky fantasy RPG world known as Arduin, and who owned a games store in nearby Concord, announced he was working on a new game, likely Star Rovers. Hargrave was the lead developer for only a few months, until Archive's Neville Stocken took over, but Shannon Appelcline believes that \\"Hargrave's contributions still can be found in the final product, Star Rovers Module 1 (1981). Because of its wacky and gonzo nature, some have called it 'Arduin in Space.' Unfortunately, it also proved to be Archive's one and only roleplaying release.\\" By 1981, Archive had moved to San Mateo, and were advertising a \\"Monster-of-the-Month Club\\" in the pages of Dragon. In 1982, the company went out of business. Their miniatures lines were taken over by R*kiiv of Berkeley, California, which continued to produce Archive miniatures until it also went out of business in 1987. Center Stage Miniatures occasionally re-released some Archive miniatures until its demise in 2015. Reception In the April‚ÄìMay 1978 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #6), John Norris was impressed by Archive's Middle Earth line, saying, \\"The monsters are ideal for a DM using figures, and the Middle Earth range is a source of fine, if rather large, personality figures. The hobbits and the dwarf will fit in fairly well with the Heritage/Asgard size of figure, and I recommend the former in particular to anyone using Heritage hobbits as rank and file.\\" Archive Miniatures were often featured in the pages of Dragon in its first few years. * In the April 1977 edition (Issue #6), four Archive miniatures from the D&D; line ‚Äî two blink dogs, a rust monster and an owl bear ‚Äî were included in the photographic essay \\"From the Fantasy Forge\\". The accompanying text was complimentary: \\"All three castings are well done and detailed, and would make good additions to anyone's monster table.\\" * In the August 1979 edition (Issue 28), Phil Neuscheler had a problem with many of Archive's miniatures, saying, \\"Fantasy Figures are generally good, but are often afflicted by stubbed hands that appear leprous.\\" He did compliment certain lines, saying, \\"Archive is especially excellent for the following: Griffons, Centaurs, and Pegasus.\\" * Archive's miniatures made regular appearances in Dragons \\"Fantasy Forge\\" column, including September 1977/Issue #9 (11 miniatures from their Star Wars line), October 1977/Issue 10, February 1978/Issue 12, and June 1978/Issue 15.

In 1900-1908, she was a central agent () of the comrades of Germany (Social Democratic Party). Baader was one of the founders of the first trade union organization for women in Germany.  Early life  Ottilie Baader was born on 30 May 1847 in Raake (today Rak√≥w, Poland). She was the oldest daughter of four children in the family. Her mother died in 1855 and she was raised by her father. She attended school in Frankfurt/Oder for four years. Nevertheless, Baader managed to get a relatively good education, as her father gave her evening lessons at home. At the age of 13, Baader moved with her family to Berlin and was employed at a factory working for 12 hours a day as a manual worker, later a seamstress. In 1879, Baader gave her first speech in a gathering of shift workers that made the breakthrough in public. Under the impression of Karl Marx's Das Kapital and Bebel's Woman Under Socialism, she came to social democracy and joined Lina Morgenstern's middle-class workers' association. The association offered free courses in reading, writing and German.  Activism  In 1885, Ottilie Baader was one of the founders of the \\"Association of Berlin Mantle Sewers\\", the first trade union organization for women in Germany; for this activity, she received her first sentence in prison, which she fortunately avoided after Friedrich III issued a general amnesty on his accession to the throne in 1888. In early 1890s, Baader left work at Sternberg cuff and collar factory in Berlin and started to work from home as she had to care for her disabled father. Living with her father, Baader established her own independence and identity through participation in socialist politics. Through socialism, she found the means of self-assertion against gender and class inequalities. In 1891, Baader was a member of the board of the workers' education school, opened on the initiative of Wilhelm Liebknecht. The same year Baader was elected as one of the delegates of the Berlin Social Democrats to the 2nd International Workers‚Äô Congress in Brussels, where together with other women she imposed a resolution on equal rights of men and women in the Social Democratic parties. Baader actively participated in agitation tours of the Social Democratic Party. From 1892 to 1894, she performed in 75 meetings, including meeting in other cities such as in Wroclaw, Stralsund, Dresden, Potsdam, Cottbus and Spremberg. In 1896 she made six agitation tours in Elbingen, K√∂nigsberg, Memel and Danzig. According to the Prussian Laws of Association women were not allowed to be members of political organizations until 1908, but the Social Democratic Party circumvented it through a structure of contact persons or agents (Vertrauenspersonen) and agitation committees (Agitationskommissionen). In September 1900, Baader was chosen as the central agent of the comrades (Zentralvertrauensperson) in Germany. She held this position in Social Democratic Party of Germany voluntary for four years and later the party paid her salary. On this position, Baader was leading the socialist women's movement in Germany. As a central agent of the women's movement, she had a strong influence on local agents. In 1908, women were allowed to join the Social Democratic Party and the system of female agents had become superfluous. Baader joined the party as its member and stayed in the Social Democratic Women's Office until its dissolution in 1917. In 1921, Baader published her autobiography Ein Steiniger Weg in which she told how she had become a socialist and what her accomplishments in the movement were. Her book became one of the dozens of German working-class life narratives that appeared during the growth of socialism from the early 1890s through the 1920s. Ottilie Baader died on 24 July 1925 in Berlin and was buried in the Gerichtsstrasse cemetery.  Works  1921 ‚Äì Ein Steiniger Weg.

She ran an estate in Kent and she compiled a \\"Book of Receits\\" listing a wide range of medicines to treat maladies from headache to plague. Life Brockman was born in or before 1600. Her parents were Dorothy (born Grimsdiche) and Simon Bunce of Linstead. Nothing else is known until 28 May 1616 when she married Sir William Brockman of Newington Manor and went to live at his estates in Kent. Her husband also owned Cheriton and Beachborough Manor which had been bought by his grandfather. She is known because of her writing. In 1638 she began her A book of receits. On pages she set out the recipe for making medicines to treat what we call now a thin cough, a chesty cough, ringworm, headache and backache. Her handwriting was italic and it can be seen that later additions were made because of the different inks. The medicines did not appear to just for her family but for all the workers on her estate. The ailments can be quite small but a later addition includes a medicine for plague. As the civil war progresses her husband takes the sides of the King. He was arrested in 1642 and in 1643 she wrote a petition, like many wives did, for the release of her husband. Correspondence indicates that she and William operated as a team and she had financial freedom to spend their money. Her husband was released in 1645. In 1648 he was involved in the siege of Maidstone and he was imprisoned again and another petition was sent. During all of this letters were sent showing that she was empowered to pay taxes and deal with the estates. William died in 1654 and her son James inherited the estate, but Ann was clearly involved. She was given an allowance of 130 pounds a year. She died on 29 November 1660 and was buried in Newington. Private life She and her husband had five children, Martha, Anne, James, Helen, and Margery, who lived to be adults. Their first child died aged four and a sepulchre was created for Henry at the local church.

The band was established around 1840 by Robert Thompson Crawshay, the son of Cyfarthfa Ironworks owner William Crawshay II. It was funded and organised by Crawshay, who sourced instruments from Vienna and recruited players from around the United Kingdom. Ralph Livsey joined as bandmaster in 1848, and was succeeded by his son George when he died in 1863. During this time, the band played various shows at the Crawshay's Cyfarthfa Castle estate and around Merthyr, from weddings to flower shows. They entered Enderby Jackson's 1860 contest at The Crystal Palace and won the second day's event. The band continued until the early 20th century, when it was taken over by the council as the Cyfarthfa and Merthyr Municipal Band. HistoryFounding= While most brass bands were formed as representations of local workers or councils, the Cyfarthfa band was originally formed as a private band for Robert Thompson Crawshay, the son of Cyfarthfa Ironworks owner William Crawshay II. It is generally believed to have been established in 1844, but a March 1840 invoice from instrument maker Charles Pace shows the purchase of three bugles, suggesting that the band was already being assembled. Trevor Herbert later dated the band's establishment to 1838, as mentioned in an obituary of R. T. Crawshay: as such, it is considered one of the first brass bands. The instruments obtained by Pace were expensive and imported from Vienna making them of a much higher quality than the British instruments made for the local market. Most players were believed to have loaned their instruments from Crawshay, paying him a rate of 5 shillings per month. As its founder, Crawshay appears to have had full control over the band. Letters dating from the 1860s show that he was administering it through his personal secretary William Jones: he gave his own money to repair band instruments and sent his correspondence through Jones. Instead of sourcing players from his ironworks, Crawshay sought out those who had already achieved some amount of fame. The composer G. C. Bawden played trombone within the band, as well as being a cellist and the future conductor of the Cyfarthfa String Band. William England, an orchestral cornet player from Yorkshire, played soprano. =Under Ralph Livsey= George Livsey, bandmaster from 1863 In 1848, Ralph Livsey joined the band as its bandmaster: he had previously been the solo keyed bugle player for the band that accompanied Wombwell's Travelling Circus and Menagerie. His thirteen-year-old son George Livsey joined the band at the same time as a keyed bugle player, later playing the cornet. During this period, the band immersed itself in the music of the European mainland, playing pieces by Louis-Antoine Jullien, Gioachino Rossini, and Giacomo Meyerbeer among others. A photograph taken in the 1850s shows a band of twenty-one players: three keyed bugles, four cornets, two tenor horns, four trombones, one euphonium, one ophicleide, two valved basses, two unidentified brass instruments, a side drum, and a bass drum. During this time, the sole ophicleidist was Mr. Coleman, who later emigrated to America. In 1858, the Staffordshire ophicleidist Samuel Hughes joined the band, described by Crawshay in a letter as being \\"famous\\" and a \\"great addition\\" to the band. It is assumed that Hughes was paid by Crawshay to play, due to the focus on getting him to join the band. Hughes was succeeded by John Walker, a Yorkshireman who had played in travelling shows, but by 1860 he was playing euphonium. In 1860, the band took part in Enderby Jackson's contest at The Crystal Palace, believed to be its first competitive pursuit. The band played in both the National and Sydenham contest, coming third in the former. After playing the required set of quadrilles composed by Jackson, and an arrangement of the overture to Verdi's opera Nabucco, the band won the latter contest. Crawshay was elevated as a cultural figure, however he had little knowledge of music and was effectively deaf from 1859. =Under George Livsey= The wedding of Henrietta Louise Crawshay in 1871, where the band played music. In June 1863, Ralph Livsey died and was immediately succeeded as bandmaster by his son George Livsey. He began working with German-educated French musician George D'Artney to prepare scores for the band, and housed him within Cyfarthfa Castle. Despite D'Artney's apparent drinking problem, they successfully compiled a repertoire of handwritten, eclectic music, featuring transcriptions of symphonies by the greatest European composers. This maintained its connection to the European-style of band which his father and Crawshay had created. D'Artney later moved to San Francisco, and a leaving concert was dedicated to him in December 1874. Alongside the rare contest, the band played at various family and public events. In 1871, the band played at the wedding of Henrietta Louise Crawshay to Captain W. C. Ralston at Cyfarthfa Castle. The band often played in the wagon shed of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, which had been converted into a ballroom when the Crawshays sought to entertain. They also occasionally performed at flower and agricultural shows, including the 1872 Merthyr Flower Show, where they played a series of marches and classical pieces, and multiple shows of the Glamorganshire Horticultural Society. In 1888, the Cyfarthfa band replaced the Band of the Grenadier Guards at the Trades Exhibition in Cardiff; regulations had been put into place that prohibited bands from playing outside of their local region. The band appeared to maintain its roster of roughly twenty players in its later years: a photo from the late 1890s shows twenty-four players: five cornets with piston valves, three trombones, and thirteen instruments with four rotary valves each. A photo taken of the band in 1905 shows a band of twenty players: four cornets with piston valves, three trombones, eleven rotary-valved instruments and two flugelhorns. This is believed to be the last known picture of George Livsey leading the band. In 1902, with the Cyfarthfa Ironworks being taken over by Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, the band was no longer supported by its industrial namesake. It was, however, permitted to keep the music, instruments and uniform, and make use of the band-room. The band ceased to exist just before World War I, and the instruments were taken over by the council as the Cyfarthfa and Merthyr Municipal Band. Under that name, it was conducted by J. J. Harvey. He had previously served as bandmaster for the 7th Queen's Own Hussars. Legacy The museum at Cyfarthfa Castle holds several instruments known to have belonged to the band, engraved with either \\"W. T. Crawshay, Esq.\\" or \\"Cyfarthfa Band\\". Other instruments at the museum believed to have been used by the band, have not yet been identified in photographs.

The print is a satire on the Spanish nobility's obsession with ancestry and genealogical trees, and suggests that foolishness rather than nobility is hereditary. In particular, some have suggested that the print is aimed at the infamous politician Manuel Godoy, the prince of peace, who justified his rapid climb through the Spanish establishment by claiming descent from the Gothic kings of Spain. The use of a donkey to satirize the aristocracy was used on several of the Los Caprichos prints. It is one of only two prints in Los Caprichos that was made purely by aquatint, without the use of etching.

HistoryThe brewery= Until 1688, the property was owned by brewer Jens Bj√∏rnsen, later being bought by Berndt Jensen who owned it from 1717-1738. In a fire insurance policy from 1838, it is described as a two-storey half-timbered building, 10 bays wide towards the street and with gate and wall dormer. A 10-bay, two storey half- timbered side wing, with shed roof extended from the rear side of the building. The two buildings were connected by a 1.9 m wide, half-timbered staircase building. A free-standing, 8-bay, two-storey outbuilding with a shed roof and a water pump were also located in the courtyard. Court baker Jochum Lentz (1690-1740) and his wife Marie Sophie Jensdatter (1689-1729) acquired the property in 1738. After Lentz' death in 1740, the property was sold to Christen Larsen D√∏strup, a brewer and distiller, who shortly thereafter sold it to the Copenhagen Brewers' Guild. =Terchel Hansen Leye's house and workshop= Gedde's district map The property was acquired by master cooper Terchel Hansen Leye (1703-1760) in 1745. He undertook a comprehensive renovation of the complex. In a fire insurance policy from 1747, it is described as a 7-bay, two storey brick building with wall dormer. The roof was clad with glazed tiles and topped by a gilded Weather vane. The facade was decorated with stone portals around the gate and polasters topped by sandstone capitals. =Hans Caspersen= The property was in 1782 acquired by anchor smith Hans Caspersen. He heightened the building with three floors in 1782-83. =Later history= In 1797, Caspersen sold the property to master ship builder J√∏rgen Hansen Koch (1745-1801) and his wife Anne Cathrine Volkersen (1758-1809). Their son was the later architect and court master builder J√∏rgen Hansen Koch (1787-1860). The actor Mikael Wiehe (1820-1864) was a resident in the building in 1843-1844 and the actor Emil Poulsen (1842-1911) in 1869-71. The actor Olaf Poulsen (1849-1923) lived on the third floor in 1869-71. Architecture The fanlight and keystone The building is seven bays wide. The facade is decorated with pilasters. The gate is topped by a fanlight and the keystone features a relief of a seashell.

History The Paper launched in July 2014 as an offshoot of the Shanghai United Media Group publication '. It received a large amount of initial funding, speculated to be anywhere from USD 16 million to 64 million. Of this, RMB 100 million (approximately $) was provided by the government through the Cyberspace Administration of China. The Paper was founded as an attempt to capture the readership of mobile internet users as revenue from mainstream physical papers across China saw major declines in the early 2010s. In May 2016, The Paper launched Sixth Tone, an English-language sister publication. Reporting The Paper was given greater leeway in its reporting that other comparable organizations in China, where the government heavily censors and controls media. In allowing relative autonomy, the government aims to foster a media organization popular with younger online users that will still follow the political line of the Communist Party of China. The Paper has focused in particular on investigative reporting. The day of its founding, it published a piece on judicial misconduct in Anhui province, prompting the Anhui High People's Court to reopen an investigation into the case.

The German Cigar Workers' Union was founded in 1848, but was subsequently banned. Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche formed the General German Cigar Workers' Association in Leipzig in 1865, and within two years it had 6,500 members, making it one of the largest unions of the day. It was linked closely with the General German Workers' Association (ADAV), whose leader wished to establish dictatorial powers. Fritzsche and the majority of the union rejected this, but a minority split away, in order to remain with the ADAV.Graham Ford, \\"Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 327-328. In 1872, the two unions merged, to form the \\"German Tobacco Workers' Union\\", again under the leadership of Fritzsche. It was banned by the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878, but Fritzsche maintained an underground organisation through the magazine, Der Wanderer, and its successor, Der Tabakarbeiter. On 22 November 1882, the union was re- established, at a meeting in Bremen, as a \\"Travel Support Association\\". From 1889, it could operate legally once more, renaming itself again as the \\"German Tobacco Workers' Union\\", and it grew to have 14,538 members by 1890. In 1912, the small Union of Cigar Sorters and Box Gluers in Germany merged in. It affiliated to the General German Trade Union Confederation and grew steadily. By 1928, its membership was 75,501, which meant it was no longer one of the larger German unions. The union was banned by the Nazis in 1933. After World War II, tobacco workers were represented as part of the Food, Beverages and Catering Union.

When players cut the hallways apart, they were to fold the walls upwards on either side of the hall, resulting in a three-dimensional U-shaped structure sized for 25 mm metal miniatures that was supposed to look like a hallway floor with walls on either side. Publication history Wee Warriors was founded by Pete and Judith Kerestan in 1975 to take advantage of the popularity of TSR's new fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons by producing accessories for the game. The Endless Dungeon was one of their first products.

Early life and prewar service  A Belarusian, Dmitry Gavrilovich Sukhovarov was born to a peasant family on 12 June 1904 in the village of Zhakovka, Mogilev Governorate. After completing six years of schooling, he became an apprentice in a tailor's shop in 1920 before working as a carpenter with a bridge building detachment and as a miner in Yuzovka in the Donbass. Conscripted into the Red Army in November 1926, he was sent to the 33rd Rifle Division of the Belorussian Military District, graduating from the school of its 97th Rifle Regiment at Chausy in 1927. With the 97th, Sukhovarov served as a squad leader and assistant platoon commander, company starshina, and acting platoon commander in the 97th Rifle Regiment. Transferred to the 99th Regiment of the division, he continued his service as a platoon commander at the regimental school and chief of the one-year officer cadet detachment. During this period, Sukhovarov completed seven grades of night school. After graduating from the Kiev Infantry School in 1931, Sukhovarov returned to the 99th as a company commander and served as acting regimental chief of staff before holding that position with an airborne battalion. He completed a correspondence course offered by the Military- Political Academy in 1933 and the Armored Commanders' Improvement Course at the Military Academy of Mechanization and Motorization (VAMM) in 1935. Appointed chief of staff of the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 16th Mechanized Brigade (later the 104th Separate Tank Battalion of the 22nd Light Tank Brigade) of the district in February 1936, Sukhovarov participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland. He became commander of the 107th Separate Tank Battalion of the 22nd Brigade in March 1940. Two months later, the brigade was relocated to the Baltic Special Military District, where in March 1941 Sukhovarov became commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 45th Tank Regiment of the 23rd Tank Division.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Sukhovarov fought with the division in the border battles on the Northwestern Front. In September 1941 he became a battalion commander with the 9th Reserve Tank Regiment, and later that month succeeded to command of the regiment.

From April he served as deputy chief of the Armored Department of the army for combat use of tanks. In July he transferred to serve as deputy chief of the Armored Department of the 64th Army, and on 15 August became deputy commander of the 56th Tank Brigade, with which he fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. The brigade was converted into the 33rd Guards Tank Brigade in February 1943, and Sukhovarov departed for the Academic Improvement Course for Officers at the Military Academy of Armored and Mechanized Forces (the renamed VAMM). Following his completion of the course later that year, Sukhovarov received his first independent command, the 53rd Tank Regiment of the 69th Mechanized Brigade, in July. He led the regiment in the Battle of the Dnieper and the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive, receiving the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 10 January 1944 for his leadership; promotion to colonel followed on 26 February. Between 11 and 23 January he was acting commander of the 59th Separate Guards Tank Regiment, then returned to the 53rd, which he led in the Proskurov‚ÄìChernovitsy Offensive. Sukhovarov was acting commander of the 69th Mechanized Brigade between 5 and 18 March, and was hospitalized for a serious illness in late March. After recovering, Sukhovarov was appointed commander of the 51st Guards Tank Brigade of the 6th Guards Tank Corps on 25 September. The corps joined the 1st Ukrainian Front on 28 October and fought in the Sandomierz‚ÄìSilesian Offensive and the Lower Silesian Offensive from January 1945. In April, Sukhovarov was sent to the Moscow Armored Training Center, thence to the Soviet Far East to command the 204th Tank Brigade of the Maritime Group of Forces of the Far Eastern Front on 19 June. He led the brigade in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Sukhovarov served in the Primorsky Military District as commander of the 72nd Tank Regiment and the 77th Heavy Tank/Self-Propelled Gun Regiment, and as deputy commander of the 7th Guards Mechanized Division. He ended his career as deputy commander of the 10th Mechanized Division from October 1953, being transferred to the reserve in July 1956. Sukhovarov lived in Kurgan, where he worked as director of a driving school and head of the office of the passenger car fleet until his retirement in 1965. Sukhovarov died on 4 March 1982.

He represented the Australian national team between 1983 and 1985, making 16 international appearances. At club level, he played in the National Soccer League for St George Saints and APIA Leichhardt. Early life Terry Greedy was born in Lismore, New South Wales, where he played in local junior soccer for Eastwood United and trained as a schoolteacher. Club career After completing his teacher training in 1978, Greedy was able to move to the Sydney area to pursue a soccer career. Over the next four years, he played semi-professionally in the New South Wales State League for Bankstown and Melita Eagles. Melita coach Attila Abonyi recommended Greedy to his former club St George Saints, where Abonyi's friend and former teammate Frank Arok was coach. Greedy subsequently signed for St George and became a top-flight player in the National Soccer League (NSL) at the age of 27. He played in the NSL for St George from 1982 to 1986, winning the league in 1983, and for APIA Leichhardt in 1988.

After winning the Oceania qualifying group, Australia faced Scotland in a two-legged play-off to qualify for the finals, but lost 2‚Äì0 on aggregate. According to Greedy, he chose to retire from the national team after these matches on a point of principle following a dispute over money between the players and the national federation.

He made 16 full international appearances and ‚Äì including unofficial matches against club teams ‚Äì played for Australia 36 times in total.

She designed a number of iconic buildings in Hungary, Austria and America.  Early life and education  Eszter P√©csi was born Eszter Poll√°k on March 8, 1898 in Kecskem√©t to M√≥r Poll√°k, a flour merchant, and Sarolta Sz√°nt√≥ (nee Sch√§fer). She was one of seven children and money was tight. The family changed its name to P√©cs in 1900. Two of P√©csi's sisters, Vilma and Margit, became doctors, a third, Berta, became a teacher. A brother, Ill√©s, graduated in engineering in 1913. P√©csi attended the Royal College of Technology in Charlottenburg, Berlin, between 1915 and 1919. In 1918, the Hungarian government passed laws enabling women to study at universities, so in 1919 P√©csi returned to Hungary to complete her education at Reƒùa Teknikuniversitato palatino J√≥zsef (Budapest University of Technology and Economics). She graduated on 8 March 1920, her twenty second birthday, the first Hungarian woman to qualify as an architect. P√©csi was one of the first four women to study at the university, alongside Marianne Sternberg-V√°rnay, mechanical engineer Villma M√°hrer and Irma Simonyi-Haj√≥s.  Early career  After graduation, P√©csi worked for a decade in the Guth and Gergely architectural engineering offices in Budapest, being promoted to senior designer after a few years at the company. Her work during this time included designing the articulated reinforced concrete arches of the Alfr√©d Haj√≥s Swimming Pool in Margitsziget. It was the first indoor swimming pool in Hungary and the largest in Europe at the time, covered by five reinforced concrete beams with a span of 31 meters and an internal height of 14 meters. The pool was the brainchild of Alfr√©d Haj√≥s, a Hungarian architect and Olympic swimmer who described it as \\"The large hall, bridged by huge reinforced concrete arches, has an extremely impressive effect on the viewer, these arches span the wide space without any intermediate supports.\\" P√©csi also worked on the foundation of the central (turbine lake) turbine in B√°nhida during these years.  Marriage and partnership  On 3 December 1922 P√©csi married modernist architect J√≥zsef Fischer, and had two sons, Gy√∂rgy and J√°nos, who both grew up to become architects. The couple were both members of the Congres Internationaux d‚ÄôArchitecture Moderne (CIAM), which played a key role in the expansion of modernist architecture. From 1931-1948 the couple ran an architectural firm together. During this period, P√©csi designed and engineered significant floating reinforced concrete slabs and tower foundations, as well as higher- than-usual steel frame structures, working as a structural engineer with many of the period‚Äôs leading Hungarian architects, including Fishcher and Farkas Moln√°r. Her work, with original structural solutions, included the Fiumei √∫t emergency hospital, and the K√∫tv√∂lgyi √∫t hospital, the first high-rise high- rise buildings in Budapest. She also worked on several modern houses. During World War II, Hungary was part of the Axis powers. P√©csi's husband was conscripted into but eventually deserted the army in 1944, when Germany invaded Hungary. The couple's home was used to shelter fugitives, which endangered the family, as did Fischer's desertion. After the war, P√©csi inspected the bomb-damaged buildings in the capital and directed the reinforcement work on the cracked roof of the National Theater. Hungarian businesses were nationalised in 1948, and from 1949 she was an employee of the Design Office of the Ministry of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering (KGMTI) and then chief structural engineer. She worked on the rail manufacturer M√ÅVAG's forging workshop (ensuring continuous operation without any factory closures). She designed a special foundation around and above the obsolete timber-framed hall in the plant, so that old parts could be demolished. She also wrote several articles.  Politics and the Hungarian Revolution  P√©csi and her husband were both members of the Magyarorsz√°gi Szoci√°ldemokrata P√°rt the Social Democratic Party of Hungary. Fischer was chosen as a candidate for the party in the 1939 general election, and was chairman of the architects‚Äô group within the party. The party was suppressed under Soviet rule. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a nationwide revolution against the Hungarian People's Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956. P√©csi became a commissioner, involved in the uprising. During the revolution, her home became a meeting place for Social Democratic politicians. Her husband J√≥zsef Fischer was elected to the leadership of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary when it revived during the revolution. On 3 November, Fischer was appointed as state minister in the coalition government as the party‚Äôs nominee. The next day, the Soviets invaded Hungary and the revolution was crushed within a week. Fischer went into hiding for a time. In 1957, as part of the reprisals and clamp down by the Soviet authorities, P√©csi was dismissed from her job because of her involvement in the revolution.  Life outside Hungary  In 1957, P√©csi left Hungary without her husband and lived in Vienna for two years, where she worked for the Krapfenbauer architectural firm and designed the structural plans for the city's first downtown multi-storey car park near the Vienna Opera House. Her husband was dismissed from his job in 1959 and made an application to emigrate and join her, but this was denied for seven years. P√©csi then moved to New York, where one of her sons had settled. She joined the architectural company Farkas & Barron as a structural engineer, then worked with Marcel Breuer the Hungarian architect-designer, and a leader in the Bauhaus movement. P√©csi later became a Fellow of SOM (Skidmore, Owings and Merrill), one of America‚Äôs leading architectural firms, and was part of the team which drew up structural plans for the city‚Äôs tallest reinforced concrete frame building at the time, the Hotel Americana, later known as the Sheraton. She also designed the structural plans for high rise buildings at Columbia University. Her husband was finally able to join her in 1964, having had to wait over seven years for a passport to be granted. In 1965, P√©csi was awarded the ‚ÄúBest Structural Engineer of the Year‚Äù award for the special foundations method she invented which allowed high-rise buildings to be built on the banks of the Hudson River. Between 1959 and 1970 she also lectured at New York University. In 1970 P√©csi became paralysed following due to a severe stroke. Nursed by her husband, she died on 4 May 1975 in New York City. Her ashes were taken back to Hungary and placed in Budapest's Farkasr√©ti Cemetery. Her granddaughter Zsuzsanna Szab√≥n√© Fischer also became a structural engineer. P√©csiFischer SztIstv√°nPark16  Commemoration  A plaque was placed on her birthplace in Kecskem√©t in 2000 and on the wall of the couple's house in Szent Istv√°n Park in Budapest in 2001. A room was named after P√©csi at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, on the 100th anniversary of her graduation with an engineering degree.

Based on themes taken from the then-newly published Dungeons & Dragons, Labyrinthine was the first \\"dungeon crawler\\" board game to use a totally modular board that was reconfigured for each game. Cover of first edition, 1977 Cover of second printing Description Labyrinthine is a two-player game that was designed by Pete and Judy Kerestan. The cover art was created by Brad Schenck using his pseudonym \\"Morno\\". The first printing published by Wee Warriors featured a orange cover. A second printing used the same artwork on a yellow cover but used a more professional title font and added the words \\"Wee Warriors\\". The game comes as a four-page rulebook that also includes: * 15 paper sheets of room and hallway tiles * a paper sheet of counters (heroes, guards, monsters, doors, and panels) Game historian Marco Arnaudo noted the game's reliance on the tropes of the then-new role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, particularly the dungeon maze and the Tolkienesque character races (elves, dwarves, and hobbits). Arnaudo also noted obvious similarities to the game Citadel, published by Fantasy Games Unlimited the previous year, where a group of heroes enters the castle of an evil wizard to recover a stolen artifact. But while Citadel used a map composed of six large tiles pre-printed with rooms and hallways, Labyrinthine took the concept a step further by using dozens of smaller tiles to create rooms and hallways, thereby becoming \\"the first fully modular dungeon-crawl game.\\" Arnaudo credits Labyrinthine as an important stepping stone to more advanced \\"dungeon crawlers\\" such as The Sorcerer's Cave (1978) and The Mystic Wood (1980), which both use terrain tiles to create the board. Setting A group of adventurers must enter the dungeon of an Evil Wizard in order to rescue a princess. Set-up The room and hallway tiles and the counters must be cut apart. Since they are only printed on paper, the rulebook suggests that all of these should be glued to cardstock to make them sturdier and easier to pick up. Using all of the available room and hallway tiles, the player taking the part of the Evil Wizard sets up the dungeon in any configuration, then places doors and shifting panels to allow entry to the rooms. The Princess counter is placed face-up in the final room. The monsters are placed facedown in rooms, one monster per room. Guards are placed facedown in hallways. There is also a \\"Dummy Guard\\" counter that is also placed facedown in a hallway. Gameplay Hero Phase # Movement: Each character can move up to their rated speed, usually 3. If the character can \\"see\\" a guard down the hallway, the guard's counter is flipped faceup. ## Open door/panel: If a character is adjacent to a panel or door, it can attempt to open it on the roll of a six-sided die compared to their ability. If a monster is in the room that has just been opened, the counter is flipped faceup. # Magic: Some characters have a spell they can employ. For example an Elf can turn invisible for 5 turns per game, and a Magic User can cast three fireballs per game. # Melee: ## The Heroes can attack any monster or guard to which they are adjacent. ## The monsters and guards are given an opportunity to counterattack any Hero adjecent to them. Evil Wizard Phase # Move one guard or the Dummy Guard in any hallway # Move any Guard so that it can \\"see\\" a Hero. # Alarm Bell: The Evil Wizard player rolls a six-sided die for each guard beside a door. # Move Guards: If the player rolled a 6 for any guard beside a door, the guard hears the Heroes and moves towards them. # Melee ## The monsters and guards can attack any Hero adjacent to them ## The Heroes can counterattack =Combat resolution= Each counter has a defensive rating from A to D, and a numerical attack rating from 1-7. Before rolling dice, the attacker consults the Combat Resolution Table and cross-references the Defensive Rating of the target against the attack value of the attacker, resulting in a value ranging from 4 to 12. The attacker must equal or exceed this number using two six- sided dice. The rules do not specify how much damage is done by each hit. =Rescuing the princess= Once the Heroes reach the Princess, she becomes a member of the party, which then must retrace its steps to the entrance. Victory conditions If the Heroes successfully escape from the dungeon with the Princess, the Heroes win. If the Evil Wizard's monsters and guards succeed in killing all of the Heroes, or kill the Princess after she joins the Heroes, then the Evil Wizard wins. Reception In the April‚ÄìMay 1978 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #6), Don Turnbull thought Labyrinthine was inferior to its predecessory Citadel on all counts, saying, \\"The Presentation is inferior to that of Citadel: the rules are less detailed and less well presented than those of Citadel: the game components are qualitatively inferior to those of Citadel: the game is less interesting in play than is Citadel.\\" In a 2016 retrospective look at the game, Marco Arnaudo noted that Labyrinthine was another step in the evolution of the dungeon-crawl board game, saying that it \\"adds more detail compared to Citadel\\" although it is still \\"clearly based on Dungeons & Dragons and Chainmail.\\" However, he called the necessity of building an entire dungeon \\"a logistical problem. The map is too large, and therefore takes too long to set up. During set up, the other player has nothing to do.\\" He also noted that once the dungeon was set up, the Hero player could easily and instantly see the shortest path to the Princess. Arnaudo concluded that despite its place in the evolution of dungeon-crawler board games, playing Labyrinthine was laborious, and called the game \\"very uninteresting to play... Dry, monotonous, and repetitive.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1977 Category:Fantasy Games Unlimited games ","title":"Labyrinthine (board game)"},{"id":"64090300","text":"Trina Merry (born 1980). is an American multimedia artist that uses the human body as a brush or a surface. She is best known for her trompe l‚Äôoeil street art performances that camouflage human canvases into their environments as well as her op art ‚Äúhuman sculpture‚Äù installations. Merry is recognized as one of the top body painters in the world . Additionally, Merry‚Äôs work highlights societal issues such as gender identity & equality, body image, and American consumerism.  Early Life and Education  Merry was born in Seattle, WA and moved to San Jose, CA when she was 12 . She graduated from Azusa Pacific University in Los Angeles, CA in 2002 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in film . Initially planning to pursue a career in film, she interned for Mel Gibson and worked in films and TV in the Art Department . In 2005, Merry was struck by lightning and developed a sensitivity to electricity. In an effort to heal, she moved to Yosemite. During that period, Merry had the opportunity to attend a Dresden Dolls concert, a band whom she helped sign while working for Yamaha‚Äôs Artist Relations Department . The Dolls were touring with the Australian band, The Red Paintings, who incorporated live body paintings during their performances. Amanda Palmer convinced Merry to get body painted . Merry describes that night as ‚Äúa transformational experience‚Äù, and her passion for bodypainting was born. Merry moved back to San Jose, CA and began experimenting, blending models into graffiti in Clarion Alley, creating installations for the SubZERO Festival in the SoFA District, and bodypainting for her gallery exhibitions. In 2011 Merry relocated to New Orleans to apprentice under world-renowned body painter, Craig Tracy (as seen on Skin Wars). During her apprenticeship, Merry and Tracy collaborated on several notable pieces. This includes a ‚ÄúVisit Las Vegas‚Äù advertisement, commissioned by the City of Las Vegas, that appeared as a double page spread in the 2012 Sport Illustrated: Swimsuit Edition. In 2013, Merry was invited to participate in the Watermill Center Summer Program, a laboratory for the arts founded by Robert Wilson in Southampton. Excited at the opportunity to grow within the unique environment the Watermill Center offered and learn from with performance artists Marina Abramovic and Robert Athey, Merry created multiple living body art installations, including four displayed during the Watermill‚Äôs Center 20th anniversary benefit, ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Heaven‚Äù . Additionally, Merry studied visionary art with Alex and Allyson Grey at the Omega Institute in 2017 . This contemporary art movement focuses on the expression of psychedelic experiences, and according to Alex Grey, ‚Äúthe artist's mission is to make the soul perceptible‚Äù . Due to the shamanistic roots of ancient body paintings, Merry pursued the training in order to connect visionary art with body painting‚Äôs rich cultural history.  Career  Early Works = In 2009, Merry exhibited with the Guerilla Girls at SOMArts . This created an early impression on Merry‚Äôs future feminist works. Merry‚Äôs mixed media painting ‚ÄúImperial Wartime Jellyfish‚Äù featured Geishas trapped inside a nuclear fallout jellyfish with the ‚Äúhear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil‚Äù gestures. Surrounding them were multiple red glitter bombs falling from the sky . After completing ‚ÄúTelevision Totem Pole‚Äù for the 2010 SubZERO Festival, Merry continued to explore and focus her artistic talents on body painting . As she dedicated herself to the mastering of bodypainting, Merry‚Äôs art career led to her creating installation art, performance art, and fine art photography. While living in San Francisco, Merry was inspired to begin her ‚ÄúGraffitti Camouflage‚Äù performance art series in Clarion Alley. For her body paint performance art, Merry blended live models into the city‚Äôs graffiti and mural walls. Graffiti Camouflage piqued the interests of thousands online, and it became Merry's first project to go viral. Merry had many other early successes with installation and performance art. Her performance art ‚ÄúDrool‚Äù was featured at SOMArt‚Äôs annual ‚Äú100 Performances in the Hole‚Äù event in 2014 . Commercial successes were also achieved in Merry‚Äôs early art career. While Merry did live body painting for Iggy Pop and The Stooges, James Williamson was so impressed by her work that he commissioned her to create album covers for the band .  Human Motorcycle Project (2012-2014)  For the 2012 International Motorcycle Show, Merry created human sculptures of a sports bike, dirt bike, and a cruiser. Real life Supercross rider Erin Bates was the rider on each human-bike, wearing a painted on outfit for each composition . Merry told the Huffington Post, ‚ÄúEveryone has seen the pictures of scantily clad women next to motorbikes and cars and it can look a bit trashy. I wanted to take the idea of a beautiful woman and the motorbike and turn it on its head by making the bike from the bodies of the models. Nothing like this has ever been done before.\\" The project landed Merry four gold awards at the 2013 American Advertising Awards (Addy‚Äôs) including best in show . Additionally, Ripley‚Äôs Believe It Or Not! highlighted the project for special distinction . = Street Art Photography & Happenings = Urban Camouflage (2014-Current)  After moving to New York City, Merry was inspired to do live body paintings in the streets of the bustling city. Continuing her signature camouflage style, Merry blended models into the city skyline and popular city scenes. The goal of ‚ÄúUrban Camouflage‚Äù was to connect with the city and explore its gender dynamics. In an interview with BuzzFeed in 2014, Merry remarked, ‚Äú New York is such an aggressive, violent city-characteristics we usually associate with masculinity- when in fact there are way more women living here than men...I think many women move here hoping to live Sex and the City lives, when the reality is most women have to ditch their fancy designer heels on the subway for more practical sneakers.‚Äù  Lost in Wonder (2014)  As a way to explore tourism‚Äôs effects on monumental locations, Merry created live body paint art at each of the New Seven Wonders of the World . Merry traveled to sites such as the Pyramids of Giza, Machu Picchu, and the Great Wall of China to camouflage models into these historical sites . Merry explained to A Plus that, ‚Äúat major tourist sites like these, there are masses of visual consumers ‚Äòtaking‚Äô from this environment without really appreciating the space or the history and culture of the people who made these structures. Artists are culture makers so I couldn‚Äôt approach this trip the same way ‚Äî We 'made' a picture and gave energy back to these places.‚Äù The completed series, subsequently titled \\"Lost in Wonder\\", reminds others to stop, look, and truly appreciate the wonder that can be found all over.  San Francisco: Visions from the Fog (2015)  Across the city of San Francisco, Merry painted nude models into their natural surroundings. Her models recreated gestures from famous works of art such as Matisse‚Äôs ‚ÄúDance‚Äù in front of the San Francisco Painted Ladies and Frida Kahlo‚Äôs ‚ÄúTwo Fridas‚Äù in front of Lombardi Street. In an interview with Refinery29, Merry said the following about the series: ‚ÄúIt is a female body-positive series that examines various stages of womanhood, including a baby, two pregnant women, and an older former Vogue model. The works also question censorship in the contemporary American media.\\"  Sweet Land of Liberty (2016)  In 2016, Merry traveled to Washington D.C to create eight trompe l‚Äôoeil street art performances in front of national landmarks such as the White House, Supreme Court, and Lincoln Memorial . Merry describes how she incorporated strong, feminist tones within each piece: ‚ÄúI went with the most iconic sites of power. I was looking to dynamically contrast masculine versus feminine, and power versus freedom.‚Äù When asked about the series‚Äôs significance amidst the election of Donald Trump, Merry stated that, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to be discussing freedom and power right now in light of the election, and especially in regards to the female body...so I feel like this series of work is more important than ever right now.‚Äù = Photography = Astrology Series (2015)  Captivated by how astrology influenced art across different times and cultures, Merry created her ‚ÄúAstrology‚Äù series as a way to examine astrology‚Äôs current impact on the world. Each photograph in the series captures a human sculpture that Merry created for each of the twelve astrological signs. Ultimately, the series attempts to serve as an anthropological research project for Merry. Although Merry does not believe in astrology, she created the series to examine astrology‚Äôs significance in pop culture and why people still use it to explain their world .  Happy Daze (2016)  Merry collaborated with Beverly Hills fashion designer Lauren Moshi to create a human sculpture of Moshi‚Äôs popular ‚ÄúHappy Daze‚Äù design. According to Moshi, ‚ÄúThe Happy Daze design was inspired by our love of the 60s and 70s, as well as icons of that era that are known to put a smile on peoples faces.‚Äù . Similar to Merry‚Äôs other human sculptures, models were painted and arranged to give the illusion of the Happy Daze design. Merry‚Äôs final artwork is a relief-style rendition of the design that incorporates both three dimensional and two dimensional elements.  Lust of Currency (2017-Current)  In an effort to critique the art market, Merry reinterpreted over 20 of the most expensive art pieces in the world.. The body paint photography series incorporates models blended into backdrops of some of the world‚Äôs most influential and expensive artworks. ‚ÄúLust of Currency‚Äù was created to question how society values art, and each piece was named after the original artwork‚Äôs most recent selling price . Additionally, the series questions how modern society experiences art on technological devices. While creating the series, the source images Merry pulled from the internet were oftentimes pixelated, cropped, miscolored, or flipped. Merry still printed the images as-is and camouflaged people into them in order to discuss the viewers‚Äô experience . Mid-Series, Da Vinci‚Äôs ‚ÄúSalvador Mundi‚Äù resold for $450.3 million, so Merry changed the name of her artwork . = Live Stream Performances = \\"Living Election Map\\" (2016)  In 2016, New York Magazine live streamed Merry body painting models with the outline of all 50 US states during the presidential elections . As states' electoral votes rolled in, Merry would body paint each respective state in either red for a republic majority state or blue for a democratic majority. During the magazine‚Äôs Facebook live stream, Merry‚Äôs performance gained over 4.5 million views, over 3,800 views, and over 1,000 shares .  Happy Little Trees (2017-Current)  Bob Ross serves as inspiration for Merry across her ‚ÄúHappy Little Trees‚Äù series. Merry will oftentimes paint-a-long to Ross‚Äôs The Joy of Painting at in-person events or during broadcast live streams . While recreating Ross‚Äôs painted landscapes, Merry substitutes the oil paints and cotton canvases for body paints and nude human bodies  & Then I Smoked Two More (2018)  In an effort to promote cannabis awareness, Merry and Lauren Moshi collaborated again to create a pop-art inspired body art piece. On the celebrated cannabis holiday 4/20, Merry live streamed herself camouflaging models into a set of joint-smoking lips designed by Moshi . One of the model‚Äôs extended legs was even turned into the rolled joint. The artwork‚Äôs title is a homage to the song ‚ÄúSmoke Two Joints‚Äù by The Toyes. = Installation Art = Collaborations with Theresa Because (2013-2014)  In collaboration with multimedia artist Theresa Because, Merry completed several body paint performance art projects such as ‚ÄúObjectified‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Human Temple‚Äù and ‚ÄúSexpartite and Nuance‚Äù . Merry‚Äôs ‚ÄúObjectified‚Äù series highlights themes of materialism and consumerism, and the project was featured across several galleries, museums, and art spaces including the ESMoA and the San Jose Convention Center .  San Jose Museum of Art (2014)  Merry created temporary installations & performances at the San Jose Museum of Art including a collaboration with Andy Goldsworthy for their ‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù exhibition.  Body Dysmorphia on Pink (2018)  Merry explored themes of body dysmorphia and humans‚Äô relations with food with the video performance, ‚ÄúBody Dysmorphia on Pink‚Äù. The performing woman, fully nude and painted entirely pink, was offered a buffet of food options. As the model applied paint to her body with the food, the performance asks the audience to observe how certain foods are treated and perceived by the young actress. ‚ÄúBody dysmorphia on Pink‚Äù ultimately questions how society ‚Äúwears‚Äù food and why foods are thought of as either good or bad .  Objectified 2.0 (2019)  In 2019, Merry revisited her ‚ÄúObjectified‚Äù series with a reboot. The performance art series features body painting models posing and interacting within common living spaces. The series questions society‚Äôs relationship with their living spaces and materialism as well as the objectification of women in the modern world. Merry explains the following in her artistic statement: ‚ÄúDo the living spaces that surround us own us or do we own them? My Objectified series poses these questions and allows viewers to come up with answers by creating a conversation within the self.‚Äù Performances from the series were featured at The Untitled Space gallery in New York City . = Video Art = Drool (2014)  At WORKS San Jose, Merry debuted a live performance of ‚ÄúDrool‚Äù while recording the overhead shorts her body painted models made. From above, Merry‚Äôs models shape shifted into a sculptural skull and then danced with umbrellas. The piece was inspired by the surrealism of Salvador Dali and the musical talents of Tom Waits . Additionally, the still shot of the human sculpture skull was used as the cover art for James Williamson and Carolyn Wonderland remastered single ‚ÄúOpen Up and Bleed\\" .  Reflections 2.0 (2018)  At the NARS Foundation Spring Open Studios, Merry collaborated with five body-positive influencers for a special body paint performance. The tableau vivant installation confronts the audience with themes of feminism and the new definition of freedom within an evolving society. Each influencer served as a silent actor as they quietly moved around the propped-filled scene in full body paint.  Shrouds of our Sisters (2018)  The ‚ÄúShroud of our Sisters‚Äù video highlights the toxic relationship between women and envy. Merry, acting as a shaman, uses performers and body paint to metaphorically excommunicate the jealousy out of women. The performance ultimately emphasizes the importance of self acceptance.  Glass on Painted Bodies (2019)  ‚ÄúGlass on Painted Bodies‚Äù, a contemporary art performance filmed by Merry, conceptualizes the relationship between body and identity. In the performance, bodypainted women tug at their skin and press their painted bodies against glass in an effort to appreciate how their body alters its shape.  Pink Petal Lipstick (2020)  Merry‚Äôs performance ‚ÄúPink Petal Lipstick‚Äù explores how the lack of ingredient transparency can affect women‚Äôs health. In response to a 2010 FDA study about lead contamination in lipsticks, Merry paints her entire face with a tube of hot pink lipstick.  Objectified: Black Couch (2019)  As part of her Objectified series reboot, Merry‚Äôs performance art ‚ÄúObjectified: Black Couch‚Äù questions materialism and female objectification in society. Bodypainted female performers pose with and even become furniture and home accessories as they surround a black, velvet couch.  Objectified: Purple Couch (2019)  ‚ÄúObjectified: Purple Couch‚Äù is another recorded performance that‚Äôs part of her most recent Objectified series. As models silently interact with props and a purple couch, Merry‚Äôs bodypainted performers continue to explore the themes of consumerism, materialism, and objectification.  Objectified: Pink Couch (2019)  In ‚ÄúObjectified: Pink Couch‚Äù, Merry records another living space come to life. Four performers conceptualize the relationship between possessions, female objectification, and identity as they pose in a room dominated by a bright, pink couch.  Objectified: Red Couch (2019)  In a room with whitewashed brick walls, a red velvet couch, and a grey fur rug, nude performers strut in bright body paint and various props. As they interact with the living space, the audience must question whether they are living in the room or becoming part of it.  Objectified: Cream Chair (2019)  In this tableau vivant performance art, bodypainted performers silently move and strike poses in a room centered around a cream colored chair. The audience questions the role of possessions and women as the performers become human vases, lamps, candle holders, and cake stands.  Objectified: Black Chairs (2019)  With two, domineering chairs taking center stage of a room, Merry‚Äôs performance art continues to explore the topic of materialism and objectification. As the nude, body painted performers bring life into the room and the props they hold, the audience must question if they are giving their possessions a life of their own.

Properties  Diphenylcarbazone is an orange solid that dissolves well in Ethanol, Chloroform and Benzene and is almost insoluable in water. It forms a purple complex compound with Hg(II) ions. Likewise, other metal ions, such as Cr(III) ions form colored complexes with Diphenylcarbazone. Diphenylcarbazone can be produced from Diphenylcarbazide via oxidation. Certain commercial products of diphenylcarbazone are a mixture with Diphenylcarbazide, which also forms colored complex compounds with certain metal ions.  Uses  Diphenylcarbazone is used as an indicator for endpoint determination in mercurimetry: If a Sodium chloride solution is titrated with Mercury(II) nitrate solution, undissociated Mercury(II) chloride is formed. If the end point is exceeded, then the color complex forms with diphenylcarbazone. This method is used in water analysis to determine chloride. If you add a certain amount of mercury(II) nitrate solution in excess to a chloride solution, you can determine the color intensity of the complex photometricallyphotometrically and thus deduce the chloride content.

Others have argued it shows a young Cosimo I de' Medici after his victory at the 1537 Battle of Montemurlo, based on a note in a historic inventory.

It grew rapidly between 1865 and 1872 from its modest beginnings as a small printing press, adopting modern technology and improved marketing, and engaging in innovative print ventures. The Press began to decline after 1890, when Nawal Kishore's successor was unable to keep up his legacy. The Nawal Kishore Press published books in Urdu, Arabic, Persian, and Hindi on a variety of subjects, including: religion, ethics, literature, medicine, and history. History upright=0.8 Munshi Nawal Kishore was associated with the Agra- based Koh-i-Noor Press from 1853 to 1857, and briefly served as an assistant editor and editor of Koh-i-Noor, a Koh-i-Noor Press magazine owned by Munshi Harsukh Roy. When he was 22, Nawal Kishore moved to Lucknow to found his own business. On 23 November 1858, he opened a small printing press with official approval from Robert Montgomery, then Chief Commissioner of Oudh. From 1865 to 1872, the Nawal Kishore Press grew quickly, adopting modern technology, implementing better marketing practices, and undertaking innovative print ventures. Nawal Kishore's successor was unable to keep up his legacy, and the Press began to decline after 1890. When Nawal Kishore died in 1895, his adopted son, (1872‚Äì1926), took over management of the publishing house. Following Prag Narayan's death, the company passed to his son, Bishan Narayan (1898‚Äì1931). Soon afterwards, Bishan Narayan left the Press to his own two sons, Munshi Ram Kumar Bhargav (1915‚Äì1971) and Munshi Tej Kumar Bhargav (1919‚Äì1987). In 1950, following a rift between the brothers, the firm was divided into two separate book publishers, renamed the Ram Kumar Book Depot and the Tej Kumar Book Depot. Publications The Nawal Kishore Press played an instrumental role in promoting literature. It contributed to the preservation and dissemination of Islamic religious texts, Unani medicine, works on Indo-Muslim historiography, and the traditional Persian and Urdu qissa and dastan narrative forms. The Press also published, and produced translations of, Sanskrit texts, and promoted the Puranas (Hindu religious texts) in Hindi and Urdu. Through its newspaper Avadh Akhbar, initially published weekly, the Nawal Kishore Press also contributed to Urdu journalism. In 1877, Avadh Akhbar became the first daily Urdu-language newspaper in northern India. The paper became popular, and achieved commercial success through efficient editing and professional management techniques. The Press also published other newspapers and journals. Over almost a century, the Nawal Kishore Press published some 12,000 titles.

History The Society of Dublin Painters was founded in 1920 by Paul and Grace Henry, Mary Swanzy, Letitia Marion Hamilton, Jack B. Yeats, and Harry Clarke. As the original meeting notes have been lost, there is some uncertainty as to which artists were there at the inaugural meeting. Along with these potential founding members, Clare Marsh, E.M. O‚ÄôRourke Dickey, and James Sleator were featured in the first exhibition. The Society held its first exhibition at its premises at 7 St Stephen's Green on 5 August 1920, which ran until 1 September and attracted good reviews. Yeats, Marsh, and Paul Henry were all signatories to the lease of this premises. The group sought to bring modernism to Ireland, and provide a freer, less academic space for artistic expression and experimentation less focused on accuracy and realism. Its foundation was seen as providing an alternative public exhibition space to the more conservative Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), which did not favour exhibiting Irish modern art. At its 1923 exhibition, Mary Swanzy exhibited one of her earliest cubist paintings, Decoration. The membership always had a large proportion of women. The Society held annual exhibitions and one-person shows at its premises on St Stephen's Green. Unlike the RHA, the Society did not mandate a particular style of painting for inclusion in its exhibitions, with the only limitation on the number of paintings an artist could submit. The members were free to submit paintings to other exhibitions such as the RHA, The White Stag Group and Irish Exhibition of Living Art. Membership was limited, with just 10 members initially, rising to 12 in 1932, and 18 in 1934 owing to limited exhibition and studio space. By 1943, the Society was being overtaken by exhibitions like the Irish Exhibition of Living Art and was no longer seen as the premier outlet for avant-garde Irish art. After a decline in membership, the Society ceased to exist by the early 1960s.

NMNAT3 is the third of three protein isoforms of nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) found in humans. As with the other NMNATs, NMNAT3 is an enzyme that catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis. NMNAT3 levels are highest in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and erythrocytes. NMNAT3 is localized in mitochondria or cytoplasm, depending upon the cell type. Knockdown of NMNAT3 gene expression in cell culture strongly reduces mitochondrial function. NMNAT3 is essential for maintaining NAD in red blood cells. The catechin epigallocatechin gallate found in tea can activate NMNAT3 by more than 40%. As of 2017 mutations in the NMNAT3 gene have not been associated with any known disease.

He was exported to the United States where he had modest success as a racehorse but became a very successful and influential breeding stallion. Background Australian was a chestnut horse with no white markings, standing 15.3 hands high in maturity bred in England by W. E. Duncombe. William Ernest Duncombe, later to become 1st Earl of Feversham was a member of a family which owned a long-established stud at Helmsley in Yorkshire. As a foal, he was acquired by Alexander Keene Richards of Scott County, Kentucky and was exported to the United States. The colt was initially given the name Millington. He was from the third crop of foals sired by West Australian who won the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby, St Leger and the Ascot Gold Cup in 1853 and has been retrospectively recognised as the first Triple Crown winner. West Australian was regarded by contemporary experts as one of the best British horses of the nineteenth century.. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a sire of winners in England and France and, through his son Solon was largely responsible for the survival of the Godolphin Arabian sire- line in Europe.Craig, Dennis, Breeding Racehorses from Cluster Mares, J A Allen, London, 1964 Australian's dam Emilia, who was imported to the United States along with her son, became the female-line ancestor of many other major winners including Tanya, Ben Ali, Rhine Maiden and Broomspun. Her line continues to have an impact as her direct descendants include the influential broodmares Gaily, Hasili and Mariah's Storm. Racing career1861: three- year-old season= In April 1861 at New Orleans, racing under his original name, Millington, Australian made a successful racecourse debut when he defeated Regret, Tom Ready, Uncle True and Ninette to win the Doswell Stakes. In May and June he contested four races at Louisville Racecourse starting with a fifth place finish behind the Lillie Ward in the Asscociation Stakes and then coming home third behind the same filly in the Galt House Stakes. He subsequently ran second to Lillie Ward in another Association Stakes before finishing second to Kansas in the Citizen's Stakes. After a three month break Millington returned at Lexington, Kentucky on 23 September for the Produce Stakes which, like many races at the time, was scheduled for a series of heats, with the prize going to the first horse to win twice. He won one of the first three heats, but in the final run-off he ran third behind John Morgan and Myrtle. Four days later at the same track he defeated John Morgan and Myrtle to win another Produce Stakes. =1862: four-year-old season= Following the outbreak of the American Civil War Richards, who supported the Confederacy moved to Louisiana and sold off many of his Kentucky-based stock including Millington who was bought by Robert A. Alexander of Woodford County and renamed Australian. On his only race for his new owner he contested an event in heats in which he finished fourth and fifth in the first two heats before running third behind John Morgan and Ella D. in the decider. Stud career At the end of racing career Australian was retired to become a breeding stallion and spent most of his stud career at Alexander's Woodburn Stud. He sired the winners of 410 races and was runner-up to Lexington for the title of Leading sire in North America on six occasions between 1871 and 1877. His offspring included: *Maudina, foaled 1864, dam of Cloverbrook. *Abd El Kader, foaled 1865. Sire of Algerine. *Maggie B B, foaled 1867, dam of Iroquois, Harold and Panique (Belmont Stakes) and the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners. *Joe Daniels, foaled 1869, Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes, Saratoga Cup *Springbok, foaled 1870, Belmont Stakes, Saratoga Cup *Attila, foaled 1871, Travers Stakes.

It is a structure closed by four arms, with a crenellated entrance accompanied by a tower. In the center, there is an internal courtyard with a circular fountain. Inside the castle rises the small church of Sant'Andrea apostolo in Castel di Decima. The building occupies a part of an early medieval fortification that stood at the tenth mile of the Via Laurentina, the Roman road which led to Lavinium (now Pratica di Mare).  History  On a hill to the south east, the excavations conducted since 1971 have found a vast necropolis of the 8th - 7th century BC, attributable to an urban center identified as Politorium or Tellena, then probably fortified a second time by the Romans as part of the defensive system that surrounded the city in 4th century BC.See A. Bedini, Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica, II supplement, 1994. The first document that mentions a castrum pontis Decimi dates back to 1081 and confirms its possession by the monastery of St. Paul. It then passed to the monastery of St. Alexius, in emphyteusis to the Frangipanes, and to the monastery of St. Sabbas. In the 16th century it was owned by the hospital of Santo Spirito and in the 18th century it belonged to Cardinal Ludovico Maria Torriggiani, Secretary of State of Pope Clement XIII, who rebuilt it in its present form in 1768.  The fortified complex  The tower of Perna. The fortified complex of the former castle included the casale of Perna (with an ancient tower), the mill of Malpasso and the tower of Decima.See RomaNatura website, Castello di Decima e Torre di Perna. When the defensive need ceased, the early medieval fortifications were generally transformed into farmhouses (casali) during the Renaissance. = Tower or casale of Perna = The construction of the tower dates back to the 11th century, but its existence is attested only from the beginning of the 16th century,The information is taken from the boards located outside the building and from the website RomaNatura, Castello di Decima e Torre di Perna. when the documents mention it as a \\"castle\\". The transformation in its present form dates back to this period, when the original height was probably reduced and buttresses were added. The first floor of the interior is supported by cross vaults. Near the former entrance door, which opened on the first floor, fragments of medieval decoration are walled up. The tower or castle was owned by the Muti family (documents dated 1512 and 1518). In 1560 the archbishop of Amalfi Massimo Massimi sold it to the cardinal Federico Cesi and in 1660 it was owned by Pompeo Colonna, prince of Gallicano. In 1704 it belonged to the Conti family and in 1711 to the Colonna family. In 1734 it was sold to the Torrigiani family, who joined it to the estate of the castle of Decima, together which the neighboring estates of Fossola, Morrone, Pernuzza, Pinzarone and Campobufalaro, for a total area of almost 2,500 hectares.See Catasto Alessandrino Near the tower rises a chapel, already existing in the 17th century, showing a simple fa√ßade with angular pilasters and tuff doorposts. On 2 July 1977 the estate, which became a municipal property and was left uncultivated, was occupied: a farm was created, which is still active today with the name of Cooperative Agricoltura nuova. The tower of Perna currently is the seat of the Decima-Malafede Nature Reserve; the WWF has set up a visitor center nearby.

It took place outdoors in parks, in primarily underserved neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area, and all over the state of California, with 400 to 700 children per show. It lasted for 25 years, from 1975 to 2002. HistoryBackground= Make*A*Circus began as a project of the Inter-Action theater program in London created by community educator Edward David Berman in 1968. There actor Peter Frankham collaborated with visual artist Liz Leyh on her concept of ‚Äúestate‚Äù children improvising a parade and circus-like performance. Using props and costumes from the company and settings in their neighborhood, children improvised characters and acts. Each performance was different. In 1974, Frankham moved to San Francisco and, after a period of busking on the streets, received funding through the San Francisco Arts Commission‚Äôs Neighborhood Arts Program to create art in the city‚Äôs communities. In 1975, the Neighborhood Arts Program became one of the first entities utilizing the Federal Carter-era Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to offer employment to artists. Frankham received a monthly stipend. His vision was to recreate the idea of a ‚Äúcircus with a purpose‚Äù that specifically targeted underprivileged children. The first circus was presented in 1975. Rehearsals were held at The Farm. In 1976, Frankham was asked to take over an unused non-profit corporation, and both Make*A*Circus and the Talespinners, a theater company that included and performed for senior citizens, became part of Feedback Productions. Make*A*Circus was collectively run. Frankham and a core of artists made all thematic, organizational and artistic decisions collaboratively. Members shared non-performance responsibilities, and met in planning sessions, evaluative meetings and a study group. A Day at the Circus A Make*A*Circus day began with the company arriving in the morning and setting up bleachers, circus ring, mats, a backdrop and sideshow booths. At the same time, neighborhood groups arrived with the children they served. Teen apprentices painted children's faces and ran games in the sideshow. The youth were affiliated with the San Francisco Summer Youth program, now the Mayor‚Äôs Youth Employment and Education Program. From 1975 to 1983, a parade was announced at noon, and children took a short walk around the neighborhood, convincing performers, placed along the pre- planned route, to join the show. At 1:00 pm, the single ring circus show began. It included jugglers, clowns, and acrobats, as well as skills such as stilts, slack-rope, fire-eating, balancing, trapeze, and unicycling. Clown performances functioned as a narrative through-line until, beginning in 1980, all acts were included in the narrative. The show was accompanied by a live brass band. Many of the performers and band members were professionals who were also concurrently involved with other arts organizations and projects of this time including the Pickle Family Circus, and the San Francisco Mime Troupe. At 2:00 pm, the children were invited to choose the circus skill workshop of their choice. Workshops were offered in all the skills the children had just seen. The workshops lasted for 30 minutes, and included ten to 30 children. At 3:00 pm, the second show was announced. This show starred the children and was accompanied by the band. Children performed as clowns, acrobats, jugglers, slack-rope walkers, stilt-walkers, animals, musicians, and more. Adult performers added support.

History and etymologyMeaning= The M√§nner subculture finds its origins in the Southern Netherlands, and is generally used to describe a person or group of people whose views support a serene, laid-back and usually liberally-orientated lifestyle. The word derives from the plural form of the German word \\"Mann\\", which translated to English means 'man'. The term gained popularity in the early 2000s and since has become a part of the basic vocabulary of teenagers in most parts of the Southern Netherlands, especially in the province Limburg. Commonly used synonyms for M√§nner, when used to refer to a person, include, but are not limited to: \\"Chiller\\", \\"Pik\\", \\"Chef\\", \\"Jong\\", ‚ÄùJoete‚Äù, \\"Chimi\\" and \\"Wiekser\\". =Characteristics and lifestyle= Even though the literal translation would suggest that M√§nner refers to a solely male-subculture, people from all genders can become part of and participate in the common activities that are associated with the M√§nner subculture. This is due to the fact that the liberal point of view usually associated with M√§nner subculture implies the individual freedom for one to choose and act like the gender he or she prefers, thus making it paradoxical to hypothetically exclude people based on their gender type. Futhermore, the word M√§nner can be used to describe both a single person who is part of the subculture, making it a singularis pro plurali style figure, and a group of people that are part of the subculture. The M√§nner lifestyle commonly implies a calm, happy and down to earth approach to life, which for example affiliates attendance to alternative music- festivals as well as listening to alternative music, free artistic expression, responsible usage of drugs, watching so called 'Stoner Movies' and adult cartoons, chilling, and the general urge to avoid being in stressful situations.

Evidence for the positive effects of gametophytic selection on the sporophyte generation has been observed in several flowering plant species, but there are is still some debate as to the biological significance of gametophytic selection.  Non-random success of pollen tubes  Pollen competition hypothesis = The competitive ability of pollen grains (microgapmetophytes) is rooted in the expression of their haploid genomes. The haploid genes are expressed immediately after pollen development and during pollen germination and pollen-tube growth. About 60% of genes expressed in the sporophyte are also expressed in the microgametophyte. This expression influences the ability of pollen tubes to compete during growth. When pollen competition occurs, the competitive ability is determined by differences between tube growth rate or the time it takes for germination to occur. Pollen completion is increased when pollen is not limiting and when pollen is in abundance relative to the number of ovules present in the ovary, but this does not guarantee pollen competition. = Non-random success of pollen = Studies on corn have observed a non-random success of pollen grains possessing different alleles resulting in ratios that differ than those expected by Mendel's Law of Segregation of Genes (certation). Pollen from a heterozygous sporophyte should exhibit an equal distribution of gametes inherited by offspring. Evidence of higher fertilization frequencies by pollen carrying one allele resulted in differences from expected random mating ratios.  Offspring quality  Evidence suggests that gametophytic selection may influence the fitness of seedlings in the next sporophytic generation. Studies on specific species have observed improvement of offspring quality suggesting that the rate of pollen- tube growth in the style is positively correlated with the rate of seedling growth in the next generation. In experiments, Dianthus chinensis demonstrated that when pollen tubes had to grow a longer distance through the style the offspring had increased vigor and competitive ability.[2] Pollen competition is also one of the primary drivers for cryptic self-incompatibility favoring outcrossed pollen for fertilization. = Reduced inbreeding depression = Faster pollen tube growth rate in Dalechampia scandens results in reduced inbreeding depression in mixed-mating systems due to intense pollen competition after self-pollination. Gametophytic selection was apparently responsible for increased seed mass and radicle growth in selfed seedlings. = Sex ratios = Experiments on Rumex hastatulus demonstrated that sex ratios differences were not induced by environmental or biotic variables, but that pollen competition did result in skewed sex ratios. = Seedless tracheophytes vs. angiosperms = Current hypotheses suggest that gametophytic selection in early seedless land plants would have seen negative repercussions due to the limitations imposed by environmental selection on independent gametophytes, like those of bryophytes and ferns. Polyploidy may have been a mechanism that avoided these repercussions in modern ferns. Flowering plants may have seen benefits from gametophytic selection occurring during pollen- tube growth in the style. It has been proposed that gametophytic selection contributed to the radiation of flowering plants with closed carpels and more efficient pollen transfer by insects enhancing selective pressure on microgametophytes.  Alternative hypotheses to pollen competition  The biological importance of gametophytic selection continues to be a subject of discussion. Suggestions have been made that the significance of the heritable ability of the genes passed on from haploid gametes may not significant and that differences in the number of pollen grains on the stigma or the distance pollen tubes travel through the style may have promoted differences in seed provisioning that resulted in differences in seedling growth instead of heritable genetic differences resulting from pollen competition.

Biography He was born in Moundsville, Virginia, and received an M.D. from the medical school of the University of Maryland. He settled in Clarksburg, Virginia, where he was postmaster for four years. In 1836, he settled in New Orleans, where he founded the Academy of Sciences, and for some years edited The New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal. His many experiments upon the condition of the human body immediately after death resulted in valuable discoveries in contractibility, calorification, and capillary circulation. His researches on animal heat, in health, in disease, and after death, which have been published in various medical journals, disclosed the fact that post-mortem calorification after death from fever, cholera, sunstroke, etc., rises in some cases much higher than its antecedent maximum during the progress of the trouble. In 1845 Dowler began a series of experiments in comparative physiology on the alligator of Louisiana, which led him to conclude that, after decapitation, the head and, especially, the trunk afford evidences of possessing the faculties of sensation and motion for hours, and that the headless trunk, deprived of all the senses but that of feeling, still retains the powers of perception and volition, and may act with intelligence in avoiding an irritant. As the result of those discoveries, he held that the functions and structure of the nervous system constitute a unity inconsistent with the assumption of four distinct and separate sets of nerves, and a corresponding four-fold set of functions. He was a fellow and founder of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen, a permanent member of the American Medical Association, and founded the New Orleans Academy of Sciences. He is the author of a Tableau of the Yellow Fever of 1853 (1854).

She holds an adjunct position at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Her research considers depression, suicide and bullying.  Early life and education  Brunstein-Klomek studied behavioural sciences at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. She moved to Bar-Ilan University for her graduate studies, where she completed both a master's degree and doctorate in clinical psychology. Her doctoral research was supervised by Israel Orbach and considered the self-representation of suicidal adolescents. Brunstein-Klomek was a research fellow in the laboratory of Madelyn Gould in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. There she was trained by Laura Mufson in interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents. She worked with the medical psychologist Barbara Stanley on psychosocial treatments for adolescent Americans with depression.  Research and career  After completing her postdoctoral training, Brunstein-Klomek returned to Israel, where she joined the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. She has shown that frequent exposure to bullying can increase a young person's risk of suicidal ideation and depression. She has described cyberbullying as a major public health problem, and proposed that school students should be taught both resilience and how to conduct themselves. She has argued that all members of society can play a role in bullying prevention, and that adults and parents in particular can be transformative for victimised children. Brunstein-Klomek has used interpersonal psychotherapy to support adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and specific learning differences. Since 2015 Brunstein-Klomek has been involved with the Israel National Suicide Prevention plan, through which she has worked on programmes for Palestinian and Israeli people. The programme has helped teachers, parents and counsellors have conversations with school students. Brunstein-Klomek has investigated the impact of internet use in people diagnosed with eating disorders. As part of this work, Brunstein-Klomek showed that despite people with eating disorders accessing pro-ana websites, it is possible to redirect them to useful websites which can help. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brunstein-Klomek became concerned about the provision of mental health services to at-risk groups. Writing in The Lancet, Brunstein-Klomek called for suicide prevention to be integrated into the global response to the pandemic. She argued that during and after the extended periods of mandatory social isolation at-risk populations may be at a greater risk of suicidal ideology. = Academic service = Brunstrin Klomek is assistant editor of the Archives of Suicide Research, as well as on the editorial boards of the Journal of Youth and Adolescence and Lancet Psychiatry.

She was the first female poet in the Catalan language. Considered the first modern poet in the Catalan language and the first modern translator, she is linked to the Renaixen√ßa in Mallorca. She wrote poems such as \\":ca:Espigues en flor\\" (1926), \\"El retorn\\" (1934), and \\"Lluneta del pag√®s\\" (1952), as well as works in prose, such as Viatge a Orient (1907) and Entre el record i l'enyoran√ßa (1955). Salv√† was described as \\"a poet who disguised herself as a translator\\" to find meaning in the male poetry of her time. Her translations were popular, and still are, in particular her 1917 version of Fr√©d√©ric Mistral's Mireia (1859). Early life Plaque on the house in which Salv√† was born, on Carrer d'en Morei. Salv√† was born on 4 November 1869 in Palma, the capital of the Balearic island of Mallorca. Her mother died when she was only a few months old; Maria and brother Antoni (b. 1868) were given to relatives in Llucmajor, while the eldest brother Francesc (b. 1867) was kept by their father and raised in Palma. Since a young age, Salv√† had a keen interest in poetry and language. In the memoir Between Memory and Longing she wrote: \\"My fondness for verse and songwriting could almost be said to be innate in me. My wet nurse, nicknamed Flauta, used to say that when I weaned, I already knew a string of songs\\". At the age of six she met her father in Palma and was educated at the :ca:Col¬∑legi de la Puresa. She began writing poems in Catalan at the age of 14 or 15; in these autobiographical poems, she shows an awareness of the exceptional nature with which she would have to experience writing in her youth and the first maturity of being a woman. At the age of sixteen she returned to Llucmajor, where she alternated between living at la Posada de la Llapassa (on Carrer Rei Jaume I in the town of Llucmajor) and at the la Llapassa estate. In Palma, however, her career grew through her father's acquaintances; she met with the intellectuals of the Renaixen√ßa in Mallorca and writers of Romantic poetry, including , and, above all, the Costa i Llobera and Ferr√† families, who would impact her literary career. became her mentor. Career In 1893 she became well-known in Catalan magazines and continued to write until the publication of her first collection, Poesies, in 1910. At this time, Salv√† was introduced to the government through a young Josep Carner and her name was shared in publications about the new century. Salv√† also began writing in prose ‚Äì notably a diary about her trip to the Holy Land in 1907 with Costa i Llobera ‚Äì and translating. She then became invariably linked to poet Fr√©d√©ric Mistral thanks to her translations of the his works, especially Mireia (1917); these also made her the first literary translator of the modern era. She then expanded her translations into French and Italian. With this work, she was integrated into the Catalan literary corpus, along with figures like Francis Jammes, Alessandro Manzoni and Giovanni Pascoli. In 1918, she received tribute in Palma from other Mallorcan writers and, presided over by Joan Alcover, joined with poets from other Catalan-speaking countries. In the 1920s, she found her most mature lyrical voice, a post-symbolist style like that of . Salv√†'s poetry is linked to a contemplation of the nature of her native landscape. Overcoming Franco's Catalan censorship, the publishing house began to print her complete works in 1948. Salv√† became a reference for the new generations who visited Llucmajor in the 1940s and '50s. In addition to Josep Carner, who considered her an extraordinary poetess and fought to share her work, her most intimate personal and literary interlocutor was \\"in whom she had full, unlimited confidence\\". Style S'Espigolera. Monument to Maria Ant√≤nia Salv√† in the plaza of the :ca:Convent de Sant Bonaventura in Llucmajor. Other writers describe her style as having a tidy sensibility. said that \\"it has been said that it cannot be by chance that the highest figure of the Mallorcan school [of language] is a woman. The taste for the reasons, for the tidy address, for the minor and delicate tone, united to the longing and inconcrete sensibility, is usually considered as a feminine quality. And this quality, typical of the school, substantially defines the poetry of Na Maria Antonia\\"; Carner said that her writing has \\"angelic tidiness, intimate complacency of everything in its place, with every emotion having a fitting and appropriate music. Maria Ant√≤nia brings us closer or more sensitized to that identification with beauty: splendor ordinis (the splendor of order) Traspua cel. her joy and her resentment and gives her voice a kind of caress and makes her spontaneity, nourished by select visions, occur in grace, and her stanzas, as the people would say, seem untouched\\". spoke about Salv√†'s style in terms of its subject and identity, saying that \\"it has no aesthetic ideology or intellectual pretensions. It is a poetry of the daily anecdote that links with ruralism, which has been a constant in Catalan literature since the Renaissance\\". =Catalan exceptionalism= In 1935, Salv√† presided over the Jocs Florals de Mallorca and gave a speech in which she defended Catalan identity and language; and in June 1936 she was one of the signatories of the . Several years later in 1939 she briefly spoke in support of Francoism because of its religiosity. Death Salv√† died at her childhood estate in Llucmajor on 29 January 1958 at the age of 88. Literary work Her work focuses especially on the landscape, but in the autobiographical poems she shows the awareness that her writing will be conditioned by the fact that she is a woman. By 1893, progress had already been made in the condition of women. At the beginning of the industrial era, education was revalued and the work of women as educators of children was recognized. The role of the mother is dignified but at the same time she is placed in a dependent position, conceptualizing her as a loving being whose task is to love and sacrifice for her husband and family. The writers themselves accept this domestic role, they accept the fact that their writing will always occupy a secondary position in the face of household chores. With these restrictions, the environment admits the woman poet. Catalan writers seek consideration among the Catalan patricians of the Renaissance and often defend themselves this model of blessed and sweet woman (Maria Josepa Massan√©s, despite having been key in defending the intellectual emancipation of women, limits the benefits of female education in domesticity and pejoratively describes those who leave home for the pen in the exercise of their independence (profile embodied in the writer Aurore Dupin, known as George Sand) in her poem A la literata Agna Valldaura, Vict√≤ria Penya and Joaquima Santa Maria are also of this opinion, sharing it meant accepting the cultural circle formed mostly by educated and conservative Catholics, although it often meant the suffocation of the work itself. urged women to thank God for the ability to create poetry and not to seek personal vanity or to act in the public sphere, since their place is home where they will have \\"the warmth of love that in the family finds [the woman].

History Underground construction likely began with cave dwelling pre-historic humans who wanted to expand their home. All ancient civilizations practiced some form of underground construction with some also branching into rock-cut architecture. In early urban centers underground spaces served as burial places, provided protection against invaders, and enabled early public utilities. The first known use of gunpowder in underground construction occurred in France in 1681. The invention of dynamite and steam and compressed air powered drills in the 18th century revolutionized the industry. The 19th century saw innovations in shield tunneling techniques which made underground construction in soil safer. As nations urbanized the extent of underground urban construction increased significantly with improved sewers, public water systems, subways, and underground commercial spaces all being required by expanding cities. In the late 20th and early 21st century advances in automation and geotechnical engineering have allowed the ambition and scale of underground construction projects to increase. Safety and Regulation Underground construction has a number of unique risks and challenges but shares a lot with traditional construction and mining. Underground construction workers often work under reduced light condition, in dangerous spaces, and are at a high risk of exposure to contaminants, fire, and explosions. In the United States OSHA first adopted unique regulations for underground construction in 1971. OSHA regulates underground construction by companies and federal agencies but does not regulate underground construction activities associated with mining. Underground construction is one of the most dangerous industries in the world but is becoming safer, especially as the most dangerous jobs are automated. Tunnel construction Cut-and-cover construction of the Paris M√©tro in France Tunnels are the most common man-made subterranea. They have been constructed by various means since prehistory. Military construction Historically a wide variety of fortifications were either underground or partially below grade. Modern underground military facilities (primarily designed to resist aerial attack) emerged during the second world war and pre- war period. During the later years of WWII Nazi Germany moved much of its military industry underground. The Nazis used prisoners of war and slave labor to build their underground structures and large numbers perished during construction. The Cold War brought about two new underground structures, the nuclear powers built missile silos and all world powers built leadership protection bunkers in response. Examples of the latter include the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Metro-2, and the Underground City (Beijing).

The letter was leaked on Twitter by Brazilian deputy Paulo Eduardo Martins, and sparked the Twitter trend and hashtag #VivaTaiwan.  Letter  On 13 May 2020, the Chinese embassy in Bras√≠lia sent a letter to the members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the National Congress of Brazil. The letter termed Tsai Ing-wen as the \\"local leader\\" of Taiwan, and asked the Chamber of Deputies to \\"educate\\" its members on the Taiwan issue in accordance with Brazil's commitment to the One-China policy. It also asked the members to refrain from taking part in Tsai's swearing-in ceremony as the President of Taiwan after her victory in the 2020 elections, sending congratulatory messages to Taiwanese authorities or maintaining official contacts with them.

It belongs to the Bougainvillidae family. It can be confused with Rathkea octopunctata, but differs from it in four bundles of tentacles of the outer circle. Distribution This hydromedusae relates to —Åircumpolar Arctic-boreal species. It is found in the seas of the Arctic basin (Barents sea, Kara sea, Bering sea), in north Atlantic, in the North Pacific. In the White sea this jellyfish is ubiquitous, but more numerous in shallow water lips. Polypoid generation in the White sea practically is poorly investigated  Morphology  The bell is transparent and has a spherical shape. Its size is 4-8 mm (maximum 9.5 mm) in adult jellyfish. Recently appeared jellyfish are 1-2 mm. Tentacles are arranged in groups. Four extended bases on the edge of the bell carry 11-22 tentacles. One black eye is located at the base of each tentacle. Common expanded bases of tentacles are brownish. Manubrium is brown with reddish tinge, darker in males and whitish in females after forming eggs and planulas on it. Short and wide oral proboscis carries a mouth with four bundles of oral tentacles. They are short, dichotomically branched and end with a group of stinging cells. Mouth leads to a bulky stomach, cross-shaped in cross-section. It can open the entire width of the stomach or almost completely close. Gonads are formed on the oral proboscis. Polyps carry filamentous tentacles.  Feeding  This jellyfish feed on various planktonic crustaceans: Cirripedia nauplii, adult Copepods Oithona similis and Microsetella norvegica, larval stages of Copepods Pseudocalanus minutus and other crustaceans.  Reproduction  Gestation of eggs by females is timed to the warming up period of surface layers of the sea, when the temperature rises to 10-15¬∞C. By the end of June eggs turn into ciliated planula larvae, which start an independent life in the water column. At this time jellyfish stop eating, the walls of their stomachs are thinning, and their tentacles stick together and hang motionless. Planula settle and form bottom colonies. Jellyfish exhibits both asexual and sexual reproduction by budding during hydroid stage and releasing gametes in medusae stages.  Behaviour  Most of the time jellyfish hangs in the water column or it is carried over by tidal currents near the surface of the sea. Tentacles are spread out and form a wide cone. Periods of rest alternate with periods of activity when jellyfish with spiral twisted tentacles swim from place to place. Planktonic crustaceans encounter stinging cells on tentacles of the outer circle of the jellyfish. Then jellyfish bends the edge of the bell and passes the victim to the inner circle of tentacles, after which it opens its mouth and, smoothly moving the victim in the cluster of tentacles of the inner circle, swallows the prey.  Ecology  Jellyfish are found regularly in May and June. In sunny quiet days they are numerous at the very surface of the sea. In cloudy or windy days, jellyfish are usually not visible. Seen to be preyed on by Aequorea and other medusivorous hydromedusae.

On the Swiss computers Smaky, games like Bong, Ping, or Mur were released. In 1988, , the Smaky's mascot, appeared in a game for the first time, in Blupi at Home. = 1990s = A screenshot of GLTron). Many Swiss games were released during the 1990s. As micro-computers became affordable in Switzerland and programming had been taught for years in schools, more and more games were created. Some are still known today because of their open source licences, e.g. The Last Eichhof (1993) or GLTron (1999), the latter being still regularly updated. Games appeared in various regions of Switzerland. At EPFL and then on external servers, some employees created and maintained a multi- user dungeon game situated in the Middle Earth, . GATE, a game similar to The Legend of Zelda was released on Apple IIGS and Macintosh, in 1991. The same year, Supaplex, similar to Boulder Dash, was released for Amiga and DOS computers. Traps 'n' Treasures, a role-playing video game, was released in 1993 on Amiga. Most of the games created by Daniel Roux for Epsitec, a Swiss company producing the Smaky computers, were released between 1988 and 2003. Eleven of them displayed the brand mascot, a yellow character named . Some of these games were educational (e.g. Blupi at Home, Fun with Blupi), others were real-time simulation games (e.g. Planet Blupi) or platform games (e.g. Speedy Eggbert). Games were created first for Smaky, but were later adapted for DOS and Windows, and sometimes translated (in English, Korean, Hebrew, etc.). More than 100.000 copies of the Windows version of Speedy Eggbert were distributed in North America. In 1997, a Tennis game was played remotely between EPFL and UNIGE with virtual reality devices and movement recognition, using telecommunications. = 2000s = In 2001, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health released Catch the Sperm, a video game aimed at promoting prevention against HIV. The same year, Epsitec released an educational programming game offering to program a robot and solve tasks thanks to a lookalike C++ programming language. In 2008, the Swiss game company GIANTS Software released Farming Simulator. The original game would be followed by yearly by a series of sequels. Between 2008 and 2009, Pro Helvetia, the Swiss national foundation aimed at subsiding culture, mapped the existing Swiss game industry and evaluated that there was a potential for development. They launched in 2010 a program called Game Culture in order to help the development of video games in Switzerland. The program lasted 3 years, with a budget of 1.5 million CHF. = 2010s = The number of Swiss games released in the 2010s increased significantly thanks to mobile platforms (iOS and Android), digital distribution service Steam for computers, and more accessible game engines available to create games. At the same time, state subventions kept growing. Many Swiss games are released every year. After Farming Simulator, another studio launched a series of simulator games.

She received her diploma from the School of Training of Native Doctors (STOVIA or School tot Opleiding van Indische Artsen) in 1922. She went on to specialize in obstetrics and gynaecology and is considered the first Indonesian doctor to specialize in this field. She also established a midwifery school in Bukittinggi.  Biography  Marie Thomas was born on 17 February 1896 in Likupang, which is located in the region of Minahasa in North Sulawesi.Hesselink (2017). Her parents were Adriaan Thomas and Nicolina Maramis. Her father had a career in the military, which required the family to constantly move to different locations in Indonesia. This, however, allowed Thomas to attend various schools from Sulawesi to Java.Benmetan (2018). STOVIA did not initially accept women, but the policy changed due in part to the efforts of Aletta Jacobs (the first female physician in the Netherlands). When Jacobs visited Indonesia (or the Dutch East Indies at the time) in 1911, she pressed the issue with then Governor-General A.W.F. Idenburg.Hesselink (2011), p. 218. After women were allowed to enroll, a further hurdle existed where they could not be employed by Civil Medical Service (Burgerlijke geneeskundige dienst) and therefore had to pay for their studies at STOVIA. In this case, it was Aletta's sister, Charlotte Jacobs (the first female to obtain a degree in pharmacology in the Netherlands), who helped establish a foundation to raise funds for female students attending STOVIA.Hesselink (2011), p. 219. The foundation was established on 1 September 1912 with the help of Marie van Zeggelen and Elisabeth van Deventer.Benmetan (2018).Budi Mulia Hospital. The foundation that they formed was the Society to Form a Study Fund for Training Female Native Doctors (SOVIA or Vereeniging tot Vorming van een Studiefonds voor Opleiding van Vrouwelijke Inlandsche Artsen).Hesselink (2011), p. 219.Hesselink (2017).Aryono (Historia). Thomas entered STOVIA in September 1912 and was supported by the SOVIA foundation. At the time of her enrollment, Maria was the only female student among around 200 male students. It was not until two years later did the school accept a second female student by the name of Anna Warouw who was also from the region of Minahasa.Hesselink (2011), p. 220. Marie Thomas completed her studies at STOVIA in 1922 and was acknowledged as the first female graduate of STOVIA.De Sumatra Post (1922). She then started her medical practice at the main hospital in Batavia (now Jakarta) called Centrale Burgerlijke Ziekeninrichting (CBZ) (now Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital).Atria (2007).Benmetan (2018). She would subsequently work in Medan, Manado, and back to Batavia at Budi Kemuliaan Hospital, a hospital established by the SOVIA foundation.Budi Mulia Hospital.Atria (2007). Thomas at one point became an assistant to Nicolaas Boerma, a Dutch physician who specialized in obstetrics.Hesselink (2017).University of Groningen (2017), p. 15. She was one of the first doctors to deal with birth control and intrauterine devices.Hesselink (2017). Thomas married Mohammad Joesoef who was also a physician on 16 March 1929. They subsequently moved to Padang in West Sumatra where Mohammad came from. In Padang, she took a position in the Public Health Service (DVG or Dienst der Volksgezondheid). They returned to Batavia after a few years in Padang. In Batavia, Thomas became involved with the Minahasa Unity party (Persatuan Minahasa) whose members included Sam Ratulangi. Thomas and her husband eventually returned to West Sumatra, this time settling in Fort de Kock (now Bukittinggi). In 1950, she founded a midwifery school in Bukittinggi, which was the first in Sumatra and the second in Indonesia.Hesselink (2017).

Biography  Valentine Henriette Prax was born in B√¥ne (now Annaba). Her father was French of Catalan origin and Vice- Consul of Spain and Portugal in B√¥ne, and of a Marseilles mother of Sicilian origin. She grew up in French Algeria, North Africa, where she studied art at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Algiers (School of Fine Arts) in Algiers. She fulfilled her long-held dream to travel to France when she moved to Paris in 1919. When she rented the tiny \\"glass cage\\" of her studio in 35 Rue Rousselet, she said she became \\"the captive bird for fifty francs per month.\\" She was alone, timid and poor, but she was in Paris. There, she met Ossip Zadkine, a sculptor of Russian origin, who introduced her to the close-knit world of their avant-garde Montparnasse neighborhood. They married in the summer of 1920. In that same year, Prax made her first solo exhibition at a Paris gallery in April. As she began gaining recognition among Parisian art lovers, the Galerie Berthe Weill devoted an exhibition to her in January 1924. The young couple's fortunes rose. In 1928 the couple bought a studio house in Paris and in September 1934 they acquired a dilapidated country house that could accommodate 4 studios in southwestern France, in Les Arques. For inspiration, Prax turned to typical village life there, exploring \\"rural peasant life in a raw expressionistic manner.\\" In 1937, she was invited to participate in the prestigious Paris exhibition. = War years = With the advent of World War II, normal life ceased. According to Prax: ‚ÄúAs soon as the German troops arrived in Paris, I felt that our entire way of life was threatened, and also our feelings and thoughts.\\" Her husband, Zadkine, who was half-Jewish, fled to the United States for safety while Prax chose to remain in France to protect the couple's art and property. She objected to the Nazi occupation of her country, especially as they threatened to confiscate her homes in Paris and Les Arques as 'Jewish property.' She managed to save her husband's bronze sculptures by putting them in basements of neighbors along their street during the Nazi Occupation of Paris, but she destroyed his paintings \\"rather than see them scattered by the Nazi regime.\\" She kept only a few select pieces in secret. Sequestered in her country house, Prax was poor and hungry, and turned to painting for solace. When, in 1942, she received word that Zadkine had decided not return to her, the style of her paintings changed, becoming more cubist. She moved more to mythology, turning to her Algerian memories. Although despondent, she confessed later, \\"this period of the war was the best for my artistic production.\\" In 1945, she received a telegram from her husband: \\"I'm ill, miserable and penniless. Are you happy for me to return?\\" She assented but when he arrived in France, he was in terrible health and, like her, penniless. (He died on 25 November 1967.) = Post-war exhibitions = With life returning to normal in France, Prax saw her professional recognition and income grow.

The Ice Maidens were also the largest team to ski across the continent. The 1,704km expedition began on 20 November 2017 and finished on 20 January 2018, lasting 62 days. Description Starting at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, they skied up the Leverett Glacier following the South Pole Traverse route to the Scott-Amundsen South Pole Station, arriving on 17 December 2017. They then skied to Hercules Inlet on the edge of the Ronne Ice Shelf. The team received two planned resupplies en route ‚Äì at the South Pole and at Thiel Mountains. On average they skied for 10 hours per day, reaching a maximum daily distance of 43km while pulling a sledge weighing 80kg and experiencing temperatures as low as -40C. 250 women from the British Army applied for the expedition which was open to anybody that was female and medically fit to deploy. They conducted two years of training and team selection in the United Kingdom and Norway and practised crevasse rescue techniques in Switzerland before departing for the Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions base in Punta Arenas, Chile in October 2017. The final team of six included four women from the Regular Army (UK) and two members of the Army Reserve (United Kingdom) and was led by Major Nics Wetherill MBE, RAMC. Major Nics Wetherill received a MBE in the 2019 New Year Honours. Major Wetherill was inspired to organise the expedition after reading about British polar explorer Felicity Aston MBE's solo crossing of Antarctica in 2012, and chose to follow the same route. The primary aim of the Ice Maiden expedition was to inspire women to take up a challenge and discover what they're capable of and the Ice Maidens have since inspired a team of British female fire fighters, the Antarctic Fire Angels, to undertake a crossing of Antarctica in 2023. The Ice Maiden team took part in medical research studies with University of Edinburgh and the University of Minnesota, feeding into a NASA study researching the psychological impact of teams operating on Mars. The Edinburgh University physiological study compared the reaction of the female body undertaking extreme endurance in extreme environments, with the male physiological reaction. They found that, unlike the men, the women lost fat but no muscle mass. Dr Rob Gifford of Edinburgh University said: ‚ÄúOur findings contain some potentially myth-busting data on the impact of extreme physical activity on women. We have shown that with appropriate training and preparation, many of the previously reported negative health effects can be avoided.\\" The Countess of Wessex was the expedition's Royal patron and General Tim Radford CB DSO OBE was the military patron. Then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said of the Ice Maidens: \\"I want to congratulate the heroic Ice Maidens on their formidable and trailblazing trek across Antarctica. They are an inspiration to us all and are role models to young people across the country\\".

It is now in the city's Galleria dell'Accademia. It was previously attributed to Andrea del Sarto, but Carlo Gamba suggested its reattribution as an early work by Pontormo, supported by Bernard Berenson and now unanimously held among art critics. Its dating is based on other works from 1514 such as Andrea del Sarto's Birth of the Virgin in the Chiostro dei Voti. A sketch of two women by Pontormo now in Munich (14042r, cfr.

The school building was completed in August 2016 and the official opening was on 9 September 2016. The school has received a number of awards for its innovative provision of educational facilities in this remote Arctic community. Design and construction Tuugaalik High School was designed by Parkin Architects Ltd and constructed by Accutech Engineering Inc and AGE Engineering. Construction of the 32,582 ft2 building was completed in August 2016 at a cost of $26 million. =Design= Schools in the Canadian Arctic are designed not only to accommodate the education of children but also to play a role as public spaces and cultural resources within the community. The design of Tuugaalik High School was influenced by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) guidelines that encompass respect, being open and welcoming, community service, consensus building, resourcefulness and caring for the environment. From the start, the design process was informed by dialogue with members of the community and local officials, and design proposals were presented to them for community approval and consensus. The agreed design provided a large community gathering space known as a 'Kiva', common in Nunavut schools, providing a welcoming space where elders could be invited to come and share their traditional knowledge with the students. As well as standard classrooms, the design included a science room, library, gymnasium and weightlifting room, plus specialist rooms to provide for practical subjects such as woodworking, carving, welding, engine repair, sewing, cooking and fur preparation. The facilities also included on-site daycare and a special needs washroom. The building design used bold colours representing the Arctic springtime and incorporated natural light, bringing a positive atmosphere within the school, aiming to reduce truancy by creating an environment that students would be excited to attend. =Construction= In spring 2015, the site was prepared by blasting the exposed rock of the hillside. Building materials were shipped by barge during summer 2015 and the building was erected and enclosed before the winter. The structural design elevated the building envelope above ground level to protect the permafrost and to prevent snow from drifting around the building facades, a technique common in Arctic construction. Work continued on the building interior through the winter, and the exterior was completed in spring and summer 2016, ready for the autumn term. Operation Naujaat had a population of 1082 in 2016 and the school enrolled 152 students for the 2016‚Äì7 academic year. The school year runs from mid-August through to the beginning of June, with vacations at Christmas and Easter, plus a week off in February for teacher professional development. An increase in attendance levels has been reported since the school opened, and attendance for 2016‚Äì7 was 71.8%, which is above the average for Kivalliq high schools for that year. In addition to the curriculum, the school also aims to arrange a number of day- long land trips by Ski-Doo and qamutiik towards the end of May each year. These are built into the curriculum for grades 7‚Äì9 and enable students and teachers to work together in a different environment. In addition, the school engages with traditional activities, celebrating heritage and culture days, serving traditional dishes, inviting elders as guests into the school and organising an elder tea. The school has worked to build a cultural exchange with Laidlaw School in Winnipeg; after initial contact in 2019, there were plans to proceed in spring 2020, but COVID-19 has disrupted this. All schools in Nunavut were closed from 17 April 2020 to the end of the school year because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

BiographyEarly life= He was born in Turnu MƒÉgurele, Teleorman County, in a peasant family. (Various sources give his birthdate as either December 10 or 13, in either 1865 or 1866.) He went to study in Bucharest, after which he returned to teach at a school in Li»õa, near his native town. In September 1885 he enlisted as a volunteer soldier in the 11th CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi Regiment in Boto»ôani. In 1888, after having reached the rank of sergeant, he was approved to go directly to the graduation exam at the Military School of Infantry and Cavalry in Bucharest; he ranked first out of a graduating class of 100, and was promoted to second lieutenant on October 1, 1888. =Military training and career= For the next two years Praporgescu attended the Cavalry Special School in Bucharest, from which he also graduated as head of promotion. After advancing in rank to lieutenant in 1893, he was sent in 1894 to train at the Cavalry School in Saumur, France, after which he continued with the 5th Dragoon Regiment in Compi√®gne. Upon his return to Romania, he attended the Higher War School and was promoted to captain in 1898. Between 1902 and 1903, he was sent for another training course with the Austro-Hungarian army. In the following years he advanced in rank to major (1906), lieutenant colonel (1909), and colonel (1912). Praporgescu taught at military schools, being head of department and professor of cavalry and cavalry weapon tactics at the School of Infantry and Cavalry Officers between 1903‚Äì1908, and head of the cavalry tactics department at the Higher War School. During the Second Balkan War of 1913 he commanded the 4th Ro»ôiori Regiment, and in 1915 he took command of the 4th CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi Brigade. In 1916 he was promoted to brigadier general, and shortly after, on 1 July 1916, he became commanding officer of the 2nd Ro»ôiori Brigade. =World War I= Olt Valley (C√¢ineni is in the center) At the onset of the Romanian Campaign of World War I, Praporgescu was named commander of the 20th Infantry Division, which was part of the Romanian 1st Army, under the command of General Ioan Culcer. The campaign started on 27 August 1916 with the Battle of Transylvania. After the Romanian forces launched an offensive towards Sibiu and defeated the defending Austro-Hungarian troops, a counter-offensive was launched by the 9th German Army under the command of Erich von Falkenhayn. From 26‚Äì29 September Praporgescu's troops, including those of the 23rd Division under the command of Colonel Traian Mo»ôoiu, fought tenaciously in the Olt and Topolog valleys, blocking an attempted breakthrough by the Bavarian Alpenkorps. On 30 September Praporgescu took command of the 1st Army Corps, and participated in several of the skirmishes preceding the Battle of the Southern Carpathians. His 20th Division remained a part of the 1st Army, joining the other two divisions of the 1st Army Corps. By his actions, he infused new courage and energy into his subordinates. On October 13, 1916, during an engagement at the Turnu Ro»ôu Pass, he went to inspect the troops in the Co»õi Mountains, at the western end of the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains, up from C√¢inenii Mici. While there, he was mortally wounded in the chest by a shrapnel from a stray artillery shell. He was buried three days later at Bellu Cemetery, in Bucharest. =Personal life= Praporgescu had a daughter, Maria, and a son, Barbu, who had his own military career, rising to the rank of colonel. In the early 1960s Barbu Praporgescu met and married in LƒÉ»õe»ôti Elena Ilinoiu Codreanu, the widow of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.

Martin, who eventually became a Colonel in the United States Air Force and shares a tombstone with his father in Arlington National Cemetery. Aviator In 1917, now Major Martin transferred to the Aviation division of the Signal Corps. Though he deployed to Europe with the Aviation division during World War One, he was not yet trained as a pilot, and spent the war working in supply and logistics. Upon his return from Europe, Martin trained as a flier in 1920 and began a series of assignments in flight and technical training. Major Martin and Sergeant Harvey at Port Moller after crash of the Seattle In 1923, Major Martin was selected to command the US Army Air Service's first aerial circumnavigation. Martin piloted the Douglas World Cruiser Seattle, from March 17, 1924 until April 30. On that day, already separated from the rest of the planes after losing an engine and being stuck in the remote Alaskan village of Chignik, Martin struck a mountain on the Aleutian Peninsula in the fog. While the Navy and Coast Guard searched, Major Martin and his mechanic Sergeant Harvey hiked down the mountain to a fishing cannery near Port Moller, Alaska.

Though the original plan had been for the prototype Douglas World Cruiser to be upgraded to match the operational aircraft and for Martin to rejoin his command, when it became obvious that the time required would entail missing over half of the circumnavigation, Major Martin requested that \\"in fairness to Lieutenant Smith, who succeeded me in command, I think he should so continue and himself bring the flight back to the United States.\\"Major Martin to General Patrick, 03 June 1924, as quoted in ‚ÄúLieut.

In 1937, he was promoted to Brigadier General and took command of the 3rd Wing (later 3rd Bombardment Wing) and Barksdale Field in Louisiana. In 1940, with American entry into World War II looking imminent, he was promoted to Major General and assigned to command the Hawaiian Air Force. Pearl Harbor Attack and Aftermath Martin as Major during US Army World Flight As commander of Army Air Forces in Hawaii, Major General Martin coordinated with his Navy counterpart, Admiral Patrick N. L. Bellinger to plan the defense of Hawaii in case of Japanese attack. The two wrote the (then classified) \\"Martin-Bellinger Report\\" that both correctly assessed the most likely Japanese course-of-action should they decided to attack and that the US did not have sufficient patrol planes to reliably detect an attack. They warned ‚Äúin a dawn air attack there is a high probability that it could be delivered as a complete surprise in spite of any patrols we might be using and that it might find us in a condition of readiness under which pursuit would be slow to start.‚ÄùUnited States Congress Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Pearl Harbor Attack: Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress‚Ä¶, vol. 24, 40 vols.

Martin requested additional aircraft both in this report and in a follow-up through Army Air Corps channels a few months later, but what planes he did receive were ordered on to forward bases expected to bear the brunt of any fighting.Ibid, 2147-2160. When the attack on Pearl Harbor did come on December 7, 1941, the Martin-Bellinger report proved prophetic. The damage was exacerbated by Hawaii Army District Commander Lieutenant General Walter Short ordering Alert Number One. The measures in this alert were designed to make sabotage easier to guard against, but they also gathered aircraft together in ways that made it easier to attack them from the air. In the aftermath of the attack, General Scott, his Navy counterpart Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Martin were all relieved of command. However, the presidential Roberts Commission determined that General Martin had done all he could to improve the islands' readiness, and he was sent to a larger command, Second Air Force, headquartered at Fort George Wright, Washington and responsible for bomber training and defense of the Pacific Northwest. Later Life Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Mo In July of 1942, General Martin took command of the Second District, Army Air Forces Technical Training Command (AAFTTC), St. Louis, Missouri. He served in this position for much of the rest of the war, with his command changing names when AAFTTC consolidated from five districts into three and General Martin's became the Central Technical Training Command.‚ÄúMartin Given Command in Air Training Shakeup,‚Äù The Shreveport Times, 24 August, 1943.

Hawley (October 31, 1855 - January 27, 1926) was a physician and politician from Burlington, Vermont. A nationally recognized expert in the field of colorectal surgery, he was an attending surgeon at several Burlington-area hospitals and a frequent contributor to numerous medical journals. A Republican, among the offices in which he served was mayor of Burlington (1901-1903) and member of the Vermont Senate (1917-1919). Early life Donly Curtis Hawley was born in Fletcher, Vermont on October 31, 1855, a son of Dr. Curtis F. Hawley and Louise Ann (Boynton) Hawley. He was raised and educated in Fletcher and Fairfax. Hawley graduated from Fairfax's New Hampton Institute in 1873 and Barre City, Vermont's Barre Academy in 1874. Hawley then attended the University of Vermont, from which he received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1874. Hawley worked at his father's Fairfax mercantile business while studying medicine under his father's tutelage. Hawley later studied under Dr. L. M. Bingham. He then returned to the University of Vermont, where he completed his M.D. degree in 1884. Hawley's graduating class included 101 students; he was ranked first, and was selected as the class valedictorian. Medical career After becoming a doctor, Hawley worked for several months at an existing medical practice in Brattleboro, Vermont, then returned to Burlington to establish a practice of his own. Hawley became a surgeon specializing in colorectal procedures, and he was an attending physician on the staffs of Mary Fletcher, Bishop DeGoesbriand, and Fanny Allen Hospitals, all of which are now part of the University of Vermont Medical Center. In addition, he lectured on surgical nursing at the Mary Fletcher Hospital's nurse training school. Hawley was also the attending physician at Burlington's Home for Destitute Children. Hawley was a leader in several professional organizations and societies, including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Medicine, Vermont State Medical Society, Burlington and Chittenden County Clinical Society, and Vermont Society for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis. In the 1890s he served on the federal panel that reviewed the qualifications of surgeons appointed to examine pension applications from veterans of the American Civil War. In addition to his medical society memberships, Hawley was active in St. Paul's Episcopal Church, the Ethan Allen Club, Algonquian Club, Royal Arcanum, Knights of Pythias, Modern Woodmen of America, and Burlington Chamber of Commerce. In addition, he served on the board of directors of the Burlington Mutual Fire Insurance Company. As Hawley's career progressed, his professional memberships grew to include the American Proctologic Society, American Society for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, and American Public Health Association. He served as a member of the Vermont Tuberculosis Commission from 1907 to 1908, and was also a member of the state board that oversaw the registration of nurses. Hawley was a prolific author on medical topics including heart disease and colorectal surgery. More than 20 of his works were published, and he presented many of them in person at medical society meetings and professional conferences. Political career Hawley was active in politics and government from an early age. A Republican, he served as Fairfax's school superintendent from 1881 to 1882. He was a member of the Burlington School Board from 1893 to 1901, and also served on the city park commission. In 1901, Hawley was elected mayor of Burlington and he was reelected in 1902. Hawley ran for a third one-year term in 1903. He appeared to win the election by three votes, and was sworn in at the start of the term in April 1903. Populist challenger James Edmund Burke challenged the result in court. The Vermont Supreme Court declared him the winner of a recount in May, and Burke took office on May 30. In 1916, Hawley was a successful Republican candidate to represent Chittenden County in the Vermont Senate. He served one term, 1917 to 1919. During his term, Hawley was chairman of the Public Health Committee, and served on the Banking and Insurance, Institutions, and Education Committees.

The term was coined from a Rambo-style Chinese action movie, Wolf Warrior. In contrast to prior Chinese diplomatic practice, which had emphasized the avoidance of controversy and the use of cooperative rhetoric, wolf warrior diplomacy is more combative, with its proponents loudly denouncing criticisms of China on social media and in interviews. Although the phrase \\"wolf warrior diplomacy\\" was only popularized as a description for this diplomatic philosophy during the COVID-19 pandemic, the appearance of wolf warrior-style diplomats began a few years prior. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping's foreign policy writ large, perceived anti-China hostility from the West amongst Chinese officials, and shifts within the Chinese diplomatic bureaucracy have been cited as factors leading to its emergence. Overview NYO-China members with Liu Xiaoming at the Embassy of China, London Wolf warrior diplomacy is characterized by Chinese diplomats' use of confrontational rhetoric, as well as diplomats' increased willingness to rebuff criticism of China and court controversy in interviews and on social media. It is a departure from former Chinese foreign policy, which focused on working behind the scenes, avoiding controversy and favoring a rhetoric of international cooperation, exemplified by the maxim that China \\"must hide its strength\\" in international diplomacy. This change reflects a larger change in how the Chinese government and the CCP relate and interact with the larger world. Efforts aimed at incorporating the Chinese diaspora into China‚Äôs foreign policy have also intensified with an emphasis placed on ethnic loyalty over national loyalty. Wolf warrior diplomacy began to emerge in 2017, although components of it had already been incorporated into Chinese diplomacy before then. An assertive diplomatic push resembling wolf warrior diplomacy was also noted following the 2008 financial crisis. The emergence of wolf warrior diplomacy has been tied to Xi Jinping's political ambitions, as well as perceived anti-China hostility from the West amongst Chinese officials. Aside from Xi, Zhao Lijian, Hua Chunying and Liu Xiaoming have also been described as prominent proponents of wolf warrior diplomacy. \\"Wolf warrior\\" began to see use as a buzzword during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, leaders have expressed surprise at the Chinese using a diplomatic tone with them that they previously would only have used with small or weak countries, with the messaging shifting from a tone of collaboration to one of opposition. One factor which may have helped bring about wolf warrior diplomacy was the addition of a public relations section to internal employee performance reports. This incentivized Chinese diplomats to be active on social media and give controversial interviews. Additionally, a younger cadre of diplomats that worked its way up the ranks of the Chinese diplomatic service and this generational shift is also seen as accounting for part of the change. Activity on social media was greatly increased and the tone of social media engagement became more direct and confrontational. Wolf warrior diplomacy has also been framed as a \\"necessary\\" response to Western diplomats' social media presences. Etymology Wu Jing on the set of Wolf Warrior 2 The phrase is derived from the patriotic Rambo-style Chinese movies Wolf Warrior and its sequels Wolf Warrior 2 and Wolf Warrior 3. Wolf Warrior 2‚Äôs tagline was \\"Even though far away, anyone who affronts China will pay.\\" () At the end of the film the cover of the Chinese passport is displayed along with text reading \\"Citizens of the PRC: When you encounter danger in a foreign land, do not give up! Please remember, at your back stands a strong motherland.\\" Response Wolf warrior diplomacy has often garnered a strong response and in some cases has provoked a backlash against China and specific diplomats. The Taiwanese representative to the United States of America Hsiao Bi-khim has been described as a \\"cat warrior\\" and has started using the term herself.

It is located next to Trillium Health Partners' Mississauga Hospital. The facility was taken over, temporarily, by the Province of Ontario in May 2020, as a result of extensive deaths from COVID-19.  History  The facility began accepting patients in March 1970, as Chelsey Park Nursing Home Ltd. Operated by the British Columbia-based National Hospital Management Services, it advertised as a \\"completely modern nursing home designed for the care of invalids, elderly, and convalescent patients.\\" As of 1972, the facility had a teen-aged volunteer group, the Chelsea Park Volunteer Association. In 2001, Toronto Star reported on the lack of air conditioning in some long-term care facilities, featuring Chelsey Park. Only common rooms were air-conditioned at that point, and one resident had been sent to the nearby hospital for dehydration twice. An administrator noted that they had six extra staff devoted to \\"giving out extra fluids,\\" and that residents \\"do everything to fight air conditioning.\\" The facility seems to have kept its Chelsey Park name until at least 2007, however there was a second facility in Streetsville, with the same name. The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care announced a program in October 2014, called the \\"Enhanced Long Term Care Home Renewal Strategy\\".

On May 27, the Province of Ontario announced that it would take over management of the facility for two weeks. The four other facilities listed included the Sienna-owned Altamont Care Community, which had the third-most amount of deaths. At some point, staff from the Mississauga Hospital had been transferred to the facility to help. The Washington Post used the facility as a case study for nursing home deaths in Canada. In the story, the family of one woman who died in April told the Post reporter that the facility had downplayed the severity of the outbreak. Similarly, the facility's deaths were not mentioned in a voice message to families of residents, sent May 8. The story also cited a staff member who shared that the facility had limited the availability of PPE, forcing staff to use one mask for their entire shift. That employee later tested positive. The first outbreak was active from March 30 to June 7. On June 16, a new outbreak was declared at the facility. Peel Public Health declared an outbreak of gastroenteritis at the facility on August 12, 2020.

Biography  Eugenia was born 17 January 1844 in North Clarkson, Monroe County, New York to Joseph Lacy Wheeler and Sarah Ann Peck. In 1859, her parents decided to move to Winona, Minnesota. Ten years later, she graduated at the state's Normal School. Her school employed Eugenia after graduation and she worked there for eight years. When she left, she had a rank of first assistant. Eugenia then held teaching positions in a teachers' training school and in various state institutes. She was also a state inspector of training schools for teachers in Minnesota. An account cited that she worked for two years under the State Superintendent of Schools, teaching patriotism and good citizenship to teachers and students. In 1894, she ran for the Minneapolis school board. Although she lost, Eugenia was endorsed by the Prohibitionist, Populist, and Democratic parties. Eugenia was married to Henry Slade Goff in 1882. The couple founded the National Historical Publishing Company, which published her historical maps. Eugenia died on 12 May 1922.  Works  In 1876, Eugenia wrote Minnesota, Its Geography, History, and Resources. The book was later adopted in all common and graded schools in her state. The text was considered groundbreaking for combining history, resources, and geography, an idea later used by other textbook publishers in the United States.

Pages 19‚Äì24 HistoryInstitute under Catherine the Second= It was originally called the Imperial Educational Society of Noble Maidens. It was founded on the initiative of Ivan Betskoy and in accordance with a decree signed by Catherine the Second on May 16, 1764. This society, as stated in the decree, was created in order to \\"give the state educated women, good mothers, useful members of the family and society\\". The name Smolny comes from the Smolny Palace, built in 1729 by Peter I near the village of Smolny, in which there was a tar factory. Picture by Alexey Venetsianov \\"The Intercession of the Mother of God for the Pupils of the Smolny Institute\\". Between 1832 and 1835 Catherine, a fan of the progressive ideas of Montaigne, Locke and Fenelon, wanted to establish an educational institution similar to the Saint‚ÄìCyr Institute near Paris. According to the charter, children were supposed to enter an institution no older than six years of age and stay there for twelve years, and a receipt was taken from their parents that they would not demand them back under any pretext before the expiration of this period. The Empress hoped, by removing children for a long time from an ignorant environment and returning an already developed and ennobled girl there, to help soften morals and create a \\"new breed of people\\". The Senate was ordered to print and send the charter of this institution to all the provinces, provinces and cities, \\"so that each of the nobles could, if he so wishes, entrust his daughters with this established upbringing\\". The decree provided for the education of two hundred noble maidens in the newly built Novodevichy Convent. In 1765, at the institute, which was originally established as a closed privileged educational institution for the daughters of the noble nobility, a department was opened for the bourgeois maidens (non-noble estates, except serfs). The building for the Meshchansky school was erected by the architect Yury Felten. =Further history= In 1796, the institute entered the Office of the Institutions of Empress Maria. In 1806, a special building was built for the institute according to the project of the architect Giacomo Quarenghi. The Smolny Institute accepted daughters of persons of ranks no lower than a colonel and a Real State Adviser to the treasury bill and daughters of hereditary nobles for an annual fee, and prepared them for court and social life. In 1848, a two-year pedagogical class was opened at the institute for the training of teachers, and the philistine department was transformed into the St. Petersburg Alexander School (from 1891 ‚Äì the Alexander Institute). In 1859‚Äì1862, the class inspector of the institute was Konstantin Ushinsky, who carried out a number of progressive transformations in it (a new seven-year curriculum with a large number of hours devoted to Russian, geography, history, natural sciences, etc.). After Ushinsky's forced departure from the institute, all of his major transformations were eliminated. =After 1917= In October 1917, the institute, headed by Princess Vera Golitsyna, moved to Novocherkassk.An Article in the Encyclopedia Saint Petersburg The last Russian release took place in February 1919 in Novocherkassk. Already in the summer of 1919, the institute left Russia and continued to work in Serbia. Study at the institute Cipher for the best graduates of the Smolny Institute Initially, the pupils were divided into four ages: from 6 to 9 years, from 9 to 12 years, from 12 to 15 years, from 15 to 18 years. The institution sewed special uniform dresses of a certain color for all the pupils of the institute: at a young age ‚Äì coffee, in the second ‚Äì dark blue, in the third ‚Äì blue and at an older age ‚Äì white. Brown color symbolized proximity to the earth and was practical, especially for younger children. Lighter colors symbolized increasing education and accuracy. Parents or relatives who assigned the girl to the institute should have given \\"a written commitment that they, prior to the expiration of the period set for education, will not demand her back under any circumstances\\". Pupils of the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens at a dance lesson (1889) During the training, special attention was paid to the Law of God and languages (domestic and foreign). The program also included teaching Russian literature, geography, arithmetic, history, music, dancing, drawing, secular manners, various types of economics. The main attention was paid to moral education. Later, the training period was reduced to 9 years; Empress Maria Fyodorovna believed that \\"children, for such a long time, are weaned from their parents so that, at the end of the course, they return home with disgust\\" and in 1797 the youngest age was eliminated; now the pupils were divided into three ages: \\"blue\\", \\"gray\\" and \\"white\\" (senior); in the \\"philistine branch\\" began to accept from 10 years. At the final public exam of students of Smolny, the emperor and his family were usually present. The first graduation from the Institute of Noble Maidens, as well as the philistine school, took place on May 11, 1776. At the end of the institute, the best graduates received a \\"code\\" ‚Äì a gold monogram in the form of the initial of Empress Catherine II, worn on a white bow with gold stripes; in the first issue, the \\"cipher\\" received the eight best pupils: Alymova, Molchanova, Rubanovskaya, Levshina, Borshchova, Eropkina, von Valshtein and Nelidova. Subsequently, the cipher received from 6 to 10 of the best pupils. According to the head of the scientific and exposition department of the Smolny State Museum, Olga Fedorova, the institutes were happy to break free, of which they had long dreamed; one of the institutes in her recordings on the album recalled, \\"how they and Zina \\"fried\\" on the piano four hands\\".Olga Fedorova.

The line operates every 15-22 minutes during the weekday peak hours only in the peak direction only. Route 37 trips are roughly 45 minutes long. This route provides limited stop service along Pennsylvania Avenue and Wisconsin Avenue supplementing routes 30N, 30S, 31, and 33. Background Route 37 operates during weekday rush hours only in the peak direction between Friendship Heights station and Archives station mostly along Wisconsin Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue. The line provides limited stop service to supplement routes 30N, 30S, 31, and 33 during the weekday peak-hours along the busy Wisconsin Avenue corridor. Route 37 currently operates out of Montgomery division. It did, however, operate out of Western division until 2017. History Route 37 originally operated as the Wisconsin Avenue Express Line which ran under a similar routing to route 37. The line originally operated between Washington Union Station and Friendship Heights station, then later between Friendship Heights and Archives station. Around the 1990s the line was shortened from Friendship Heights to Tenleytown‚ÄìAU station. The line was later discontinued in 1996 and replaced by routes routes 30, 32, 34, 35, and 36. In 2008, WMATA announced a study on the current 30s lines in order to simplify the line,improve services, reduce delays and bus bunchings. As of 2008, the 30s line has more than 20,000 passengers a day. =Reincarnation= On June 29, 2008, route 37 was reincarnated into service to operate as the Wisconsin Avenue Limited Line in order to provide limited-stop service between Friendship Heights station and Archives station primarily along the Wisconsin Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue corridors. The new route 37 replaced route 30 which operated between Friendship Heights and Potomac Avenue station, a new route 39 provided limited stop service along the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, and routes 31, 32, 36, and M5 replaced the 30, 34, and 35. =2010s= During the 2010s, route 37 was slightly rerouted to instead turn onto Jennifer street and instead terminate at the intersection of Western Avenue and Wisconsin Avenue instead of terminating along Jennifer street to let passengers board/alight closer to the Friendship Heights station entrance along Western Avenue. =Proposed elimination= In 2019 during WMATA's FY2021 budget proposal, WMATA proposed to eliminate the 37 in order to reduce costs and alternative service at most stops. According to performance measures, the 37 averages 450 riders per weekday, 48% of riders can make exact same trip on other routes, and the farebox recovery is 14.6% (the system average is 34.3%). One of the reasons the 37 declines in ridership is due to it skipping Georgetown where ridership is high in the areas for the 30s line. WMATA later backed out the proposals due to customer pushback on April 2, 2020. The proposed elimination was brought back up on September 26, 2020 due to low federal funding. Route 37 has not operated since March 13, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Swedish forces drove the Norwegians back from their fortified positions with a disciplined bayonet-attack and dealt them considerable losses. This battle crippled the morale of the Norwegian defenders, and especially their leader, King Christian Frederik, which contributed to a rapid end of the war, eight days later, with the Convention of Moss. Background As Swedish forces blockaded the Norwegian town of Halden with its fortress Fredriksten, the Swedish Crown Prince Charles John received word that the Norwegians were gathering an army of between 5,000 and 6,000 men under King Christian Frederik, and marched towards von Vegesack from Kj√∏len to break the Swedish blockade of the town.G√∂rlin (1820), p. 75 Prince Charles John then ordered von Vegesack to gather his forces and counterattack the Norwegian main army at Rakkestad. Christian Frederik, however, called off the Norwegian advance after receiving news of the Swedish capture of Fredrikstad; the Norwegian south flank was now seriously threatened, for which reason he withdrew closer to the Glomma river, to keep his escape route open and avoid encirclement. He established his headquarters at Spydeberg, while a Norwegian force of 3,000 men with 4 guns,G√∂rlin (1820), p. 76 under Frederik Wilhelm Stabell, destroyed the bridge at the village of Rakkestad and fortified themselves in an advantageous position behind the river. Battle Vegesack and his troops struck camp at 6 August and marched towards the Norwegians with about 3,000 men and 4 guns of their own.G√∂rlin (1820), p. 76Bonde (1896), p. 92Angel (1914), p. 288 After some reconnaissance, the Swedish commander decided to force his way over the river, on the Norwegian right flank. A bridge was quickly established under the cover of 2 six-pounder guns -- the Norwegians could only answer with 2 one-pounder guns of their ownAngel (1914), p. 289 -- and some Swedish J√§gers, mainly from the V√§rmland J√§ger Regiment, who exchanged fire with the Norwegian center across the river. Once the bridge was completed, one battalion each from the V√§rmland J√§gers and Skaraborg infantry Regiment, led by Vegesack, quickly crossed and launched an all-out bayonet attack on the Norwegian right flank, who were forced back.G√∂rlin (1820), p. 77 This action relieved the pressure on the center, where the 2nd battalion of the V√§rmland J√§gers and Kalmar Regiment could now cross on another temporary bridge and join the fight, which forced the Norwegians to abandon their positions and flee. Some Norwegian reinforcements under P. H. Butensch√∏n arrived and, with the cover of a forest, managed to temporarily halt the Swedish onslaught; they were soon, however, quickly thrown back by the Swedish J√§gers, and so the battle was decided in favor of the Swedes, as more troops crossed the river and pursued the fleeing Norwegians. Aftermath The victory had been total, with as few as 11 to 15 men killed and 36 to 45 wounded Swedes,Vegesack (1850), p. 155 to 100 or 150 killed and wounded and 40 captured Norwegians, among them a captain.G√∂rlin (1820), p. 78Gravallius (1815), p. 83 The V√§rmland J√§gers and Skargaborg infantry regiment distinguished themselves especially. Vegesack soon marched on towards Fl√•testad, where he joined forces with Bror Cederstr√∂m, before continuing towards Tr√∏mborg, where another Norwegian force was repulsed. Once they reached Askim, the Swedes encountered another Norwegian entrenchment a distance away, at Langnes, where another battle took place. Vegesack then advanced as far as Tr√∏gstad and there captured about 200 Norwegians soldiers (the rest withdrew over the Glomma), on 11 August;Gravallius (1815), p. 90 the Swedes had thus became masters of the eastern side of the Glomma, south of √òyeren.Angel (1914), p. 317 At the same day as the Battle of Kj√∏lberg Bridge, on 14 August, the Convention of Moss was signed, in favor of Sweden.Gravallius (1815), pp. 95‚Äì103 ReferencesSources  * * Further reading * Rakkestad Rakkestad Rakkestad Rakkestad Category:August 1814 events ","title":"Battle of Rakkestad"},{"id":"64092974","text":"Pascual Pacheco (born 1 October 1962) is an Ecuadorian taekwondo practitioner.

The main causes of the strike were disputes over wages and cost of insurance. Starting August 9, members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters protested what they alleged were unfair labor practices. The strike, which involved three distribution plants in Alabama and one in Mississippi, ended August 20.  Background  In 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling Company United took over multiple Coca-Cola production and distribution facilities from Coca- Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated in the states of Alabama and Mississippi. Shortly after this consolidation, United announced plans to hire additional workers. However, in 2018 members of Teamsters Local 991, which represented United workers in the region, voiced disapproval of United's plans to cut the starting pay for new hires by between $5 to $7 an hour. Union members alleged that the pay discrepancy would hurt higher-wage earners in the company, as United would be more inclined to hire lower-paid workers to replace them. Tensions between the union and company were exacerbated on July 15, when employment contracts with union members expired. Following this, employees continued to work under a three-week extension. The union expressed concern over increased costs for insurance through the company. On August 9, the union announced a strike at four locations: Robertsdale, Leroy, and Mobile in Alabama, and Ocean Springs in Mississippi. A previous strike involving Local 991 and Consolidated had occurred about ten years earlier.  Course of the strike  The strike began at 2:30 am on August 9, with the union alleging unfair labor practices from the company. Over 200 members of Local 991 ceased work at three distribution plants in Alabama and one in Mississippi. Picketing occurred along U.S. Route 90 in Tillmans Corner, Alabama and Alabama State Route 104 in Baldwin County, Alabama. On August 11, the union president reported that they had not heard from the company since August 8, with the company claiming to be communicating through mediators. On August 13, union and company representatives met with a Federal mediator in an attempt to settle the dispute. On August 20, the strike ended without a contract agreement, with union members returning to work at 5 am that day. According to union members, a contract agreement seemed likely, and negotiations through a mediator were continuing.

The interior features nineteenth-century school desks and displays of photographs and other memorabilia donated by former pupils and teachers. The museum is open to the public on the first and third Sundays of the month, May through October. Admission, including tours, is free. The museum is known locally for its \\"Sundae on a Sunday\\" ice cream social on Father's Day. Mabel Walbridge Hall had taught at the schoolhouse from 1913-1925 as had her grandmother and mother before her. In 1967, Hall persuaded the town council to sell the schoolhouse to the Coventry Historical Society for $1. Hall wrote the booklet The Brick School Story (Coventry Historical Society, 1977) to raise funds for the schoolhouse's restoration.

History The Southern Riverina Football Association (SRFA) was first established in 1905. for towns in the Southern Riverina area, near the Murray River, New South Wales to initially play a series of friendly matches. The competition evolved over the next few years and it went onto become a strong and vibrant football competition up until 1931. In 1907, the SRFA consisted of five teams, Berrigan, Finley, Jerilderie, Leniston and Trefoil Park. In 1908, Trefoil Park dropped out of the SRFA competition, leaving just four teams. In 1912, Berrigan, Finley and Tocumwal attended the Annual General Meeting and as Finley agreed to field two teams, the association was reformed. But shortly afterwards, Tocumwal joined the Goulburn Valley Football Association and thus the association went into recess for the 1912 season. In 1917, the SRFA consisted of the following four teams - Berrigan, Finley, Jerilderie \\"Diehards\\" and the Mairjimmy \\"Hayseeds\\". Tocumwal played in seven consecutive Southern Riverina Football Association grand finals between 1922 and 1928, but unfortunately they only won the last won in 1928. In 1928, six teams made up the SRFA - Berrigan, Corree, Finley, Jerilderie, Lalalty and Tocumwal. In 1931, the SRFA senior football competition was abandoned late in the season, due to a very wet winter, with many matches postponed due to the poor road conditions in the area. The demise of the SRFA came about when both Berrigan and Finley applied to join the Murray Football League (MFL) in 1932, but the two teams were rejected on the grounds of excessive travel for the Victorian based clubs. This left Berrigan and Finley without a senior football competition in 1932 as both clubs did not want to travel to Oaklands and Urana to compete. Berrigan and Finley both entered a team in the SRFA junior competition in 1932. Both clubs, along with Nathalia were finally admitted into the MFL in 1933.

It hosted some of the earliest shows of the rising pop art movement and was the first venue in London to bring op art to the public. It launched the careers of some of Britain's and the British Commonwealth's leading exponents of two- and three-dimensional art and fostered √©migr√© artists from Europe, the Caribbean and the Commonwealth. By the time it closed its doors in 1975 it had mounted around two hundred shows. When the gallery closed Mateusz Grabowski donated his collection of works from the gallery to the Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the National Museum in Warsaw, Poland. History Founded in 1959, the gallery started as a sideline of the Polish √©migr√© pharmacist, Mateusz Grabowski (1904-1976), who had arrived in the United Kingdom as an officer of the Polish Armed Forces in 1940. After demobilisation in the late 1940s following the Second World War, Grabowski formed a pharmaceutical business, having worked as a pharmacist in Warsaw before the war.Dymarczyk I.

His innovation in London was to create a mail order chemist to enable Polish and other resettled Central Europeans in Britain and in other parts of the Free World during the Cold War to send badly needed medicines and medical supplies to their families and friends in countries under Soviet occupation where there were persistent shortages of many everyday goods. His successful business allowed him eventually to indulge his youthful passion for art, first as a collector and subsequently as a patron, by opening a gallery next to one of his chemist outlets at 84 Sloane Avenue in Chelsea. It was an avowedly non-commercial venture. He reputedly mounted exhibitions in exchange for an artwork by the artist. One of its earliest shows was a group exhibition of established Polish artists. Exhibitions The gallery became known as a pioneer of group and solo shows of recent art school graduates, including graduates of the nearby Royal College of Art, as well as artists from the British Commonwealth and established Polish √©migr√© artists.Roberts, Keith. ‚ÄúLondon.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine, vol. 106, no. 732, 1964, pp. 137‚Äì142.

Grabowski was aided by art specialists from Poland, including the leading British Polish-born curator and critic Jasia Reichardt and the artist Stanis≈Çaw Frenkiel. Exhibition themes and titles included Image in Progress, Image in Revolt, Inner Image to MAD - Conroy Maddox and Tomorrow's Artists. Among the exhibitors were: Oliver Bevan Both Ways, 1965 Several of the gallery's exhibition catalogues from 1959 onwards are in the Special Collections of Leeds University Library, including catalogues for exhibitions by Ivor Abrahams, Michael Sandle and Michael Rothenstein.

Granulocyte transfusions were historically used to prevent and treat infections in people with neutropenia (an abnormally low level of neutrophils), but the practice declined in popularity in the 1980s. Interest in the procedure increased in the 1990s due to the development of more effective methods for harvesting granulocytes and a growing population of people with severe neutropenia from chemotherapy. However, the treatment's efficacy remains poorly understood and its use is controversial. Granulocytes are most often collected through leukapheresis, a process that separates the donor's white blood cells from their red blood cells and plasma. Donors may be given corticosteroids or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to increase their granulocyte count prior to the blood collection. Granulocytes have a short shelf life and it is recommended that they are transfused within hours of collection. Adverse effects from granulocyte transfusions include fever, chills, respiratory symptoms, transfusion-transmitted infections, and the development of antibodies against human leukocyte antigens, which can interfere with subsequent transfusions. Medical uses A neutrophil seen in a blood smear Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells that includes neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Neutrophils are the most common type of granulocyte in normal blood, and they play a major role in defending against infections, especially those caused by fungi and bacteria. People with severe neutropenia, a low neutrophil count, have an increased risk of developing serious infections. One of the approaches to preventing and treating infections in people with neutropenia is to increase the neutrophil count, which is commonly done using drugs like G-CSF that stimulate the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow. However, another approach is to directly transfuse granulocytes from a donor into the person's blood. As of 2015, there is some evidence that granulocyte transfusions may help to prevent bacteremia and fungemia in adults who have neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or treatments that suppress the bone marrow. However, it is unclear whether this has any impact on mortality or major adverse events, and the use of granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections is considered controversial because of the potential for serious side effects. Although the studies performed to date have been low-quality, a 2016 review suggested that granulocyte transfusion may not be effective for treating infections in adults with neutropenia. In both cases, the treatment is considered investigational. Granulocyte transfusion is still used in some cases, such as when a person has severe neutropenia and an infection that is life-threatening or does not respond to antimicrobial treatment. The treatment has also been studied in people with aplastic anemia (a condition in which a person's bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells) and chronic granulomatous disease (a disorder in which a person has a normal number of neutrophils, but they do not function correctly). Newborn babies who have neutropenia and sepsis are sometimes given granulocyte transfusions, although a 2011 study found that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not this practice is effective. Donation Prior to donating granulocytes, potential donors must undergo screening and testing procedures. They are required to meet the general criteria for blood donation. Because the granulocyte concentrate also contains red blood cells, the donor's ABO blood type is usually matched to the recipient's. If the recipient has antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA), proteins found on the surface of white blood cells, the donor's cells need to be tested for compatibility, because antibodies against donor granulocytes can reduce the effectiveness of the transfusion and cause transfusion reactions. In order to collect enough granulocytes for the transfusion to be effective, donors are frequently given drugs prior to the blood collection. The treatment typically includes corticosteroids or G-CSF, often in combination, which increase the person's neutrophil count. Before effective techniques were developed for increasing the neutrophil count and isolating granulocytes from other blood cells, granulocytes were sometimes collected from people with chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease that causes a very high neutrophil count. Donors may experience minor side effects from steroid and G-CSF treatment, including headaches, bone and joint pain, insomnia and fatigue. During the blood collection, the donor's blood is mixed with hydroxyethyl starch, which helps separate the granulocytes from other blood components during sample processing. The donor blood undergoes leukapheresis, a process by which white blood cells are separated from red blood cells and plasma. The other components of the blood are returned to the donor's circulation. The process of collecting the granulocytes takes about four to five hours. Because a large amount of blood (seven to ten litres) is processed during apheresis, donors may experience adverse effects from changes in fluid balance. An alternative approach, more commonly used in the United Kingdom, is to combine the buffy coats (the fraction of blood containing white blood cells) from multiple routine blood donations to create a blood product containing a high amount of granulocytes. Once collected, granulocytes have a 24-hour shelf life. It is recommended that they are transfused within a few hours of collection. They cannot be frozen, as this severely inhibits the cells' functions. The white blood cell concentrate obtained through leukapheresis contains a high number of active T lymphocytes, which can cause graft-versus-host disease in the recipient, so it is often exposed to radiation to inactivate these cells. Risks Adverse effects are more common with granulocyte transfusions than with red blood cell transfusions. 25 to 50 percent of people who receive granulocyte transfusions experience mild to moderate side effects, while 1 percent experience severe complications. Fever and chills are common side effects. Granulocyte transfusions may affect the lungs, causing cough, difficulty breathing, low oxygen levels, and abnormal chest X-rays. These lung complications may potentially be fatal. A review paper found that the frequency of lung-related side effects ranged from 0 to 53 percent. Recipients can develop transfusion-transmitted diseases if pathogens are present in the donor blood, which is a particular problem with granulocyte transfusions because of their short shelf life, which means they must be transfused before infectious disease testing is complete. Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a concern, as this virus is found in white blood cells, so if the recipient is at risk of developing the disease, it is recommended that granulocytes be collected from a CMV-negative donor. If the donor white blood cells are not irradiated, the recipient may be at risk of developing graft-versus-host disease. Finally, people who receive granulocyte transfusions may develop antibodies against the human leukocyte antigens found on the surface of white blood cells, which can predispose them to transfusion reactions, decrease the lifespan of donor white blood cells in their circulation, and reduce the efficacy of platelet transfusions and allogeneic stem cell transplants. History In a 1934 experiment, Strumia gave neutropenic patients intramuscular injections of neutrophils, but this proved ineffective in improving their neutrophil function. In 1953, Brecher et al. demonstrated the principle behind granulocyte transfusion by infusing neutrophils into dogs and showing that they travelled to sites of inflammation. The first human granulocyte transfusions were carried out in the 1960s, using white blood cells harvested from people with chronic myeloid leukemia and concentrated using centrifugation. Steroid treatment and leukapheresis were later introduced, allowing granulocytes to be collected from healthy donors. However, these techniques were not very effective as they did not produce a high granulocyte count. Owing to poor efficacy, an undesirable side effect profile, and the impracticality of storing granulocytes for an extended period of time, the use of granulocyte transfusions declined. Improvements in antimicrobial therapy and supportive care also played a role in the treatment's decreasing popularity. However, the introduction of donor treatment with G-CSF in the 1990s allowed high numbers of granulocytes to be collected from healthy donors. This, combined with an increasing number of people with severe neutropenia as a result of chemotherapy and the growing prevalence of multidrug resistant infections, led to a renewal of interest in granulocyte transfusions.

They have since achieved considerable success in their musical and community endeavours, being well-recognised by various UK Governmental organisations (including the BBC), the Diplomatic Service and NGOs such as PRS for Music. The band has since assumed a status of national importance to modern British culture and has become symbolic of the importance of the relationship between the UK and the Commonwealth, particularly Trinidad and Tobago.  Background  Steelpan Culture in Trinidad and Tobago = Steelpan Instruments at Trinidad and Tobago Carnival The modern steelpan is the one of the newest musical instruments created during 20th Century Music. It was created on the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago in the 1930s and began in the underground culture due to a ban by the British colonial government, being first popularised by players such as Elliot \\"Ellie\\" Mannette, the Oval Boys and the Woodbrook Invaders. There was a shift in attitudes towards steelband after the War, exemplified by the positive reception it received at the carnival of 1946 (the first allowed since the start of the war), in front of the then-governor and a series of initiatives between 1948‚Äì1950 to end \\"clashes\\" between rival groups. = Steelpan Culture in the UK = Although it is uncertain at precisely which time the instrument first came to the UK or properly entered popular consciousness, there are a variety of origin stories for the growth of the movement in the UK. One such assertion is that the first UK Steel Orchestra began when Trinidadian soldiers who were stationed in London at the end of WWII (possibly in the Caribbean Regiment), joined in the celebrations by playing their instruments. However, it would also certainly seem that in many places in and outside London, that it was primarily the Windrush generation of musicians such as Lord Kitchener and other migrants from the Caribbean that were responsible for the growth of this instrument. By 1951, the government of Trinidad and Tobago had selected the Trinidad All-Steel Percussion Orchestra (containing Elliot Mannette, Sterling Betancourt and others) to represent the country at that year's Festival of Britain.  Formation  Early History and Inspiration = Fittingly, much of the inspiration for the band in the UK stemmed from the experiences of Terry Noel MBE during his time playing at the original Melodians Steel Orchestra in Arima, Trinidad. This earlier namesake was formed in 1953 and is renowned for its community work within the town and surrounding area. Terry Noel MBE then came to London in 1967 to train as a psychiatric nurse after a career in the Mounted Police. In 1975, he was instrumental in organising the first Adult Steelband Music Festival in London at the Commonwealth Institute, became a founding member and chairman of the Commonwealth Arts Association and founded an earlier Steel Orchestra \\"The Groovers\\", sponsored by British Airways. In 1976, he helped to set-up the Steelband Association of Great Britain (SAGB). The Groovers were also successful and recorded a CD in 1982 for Princess Diana, which was presented to her on the birth of her son Prince William. = Emergence of Melodians Steel Orchestra UK = Perhaps rediscovering an affinity for more explicitly Trinidadian and Tobagonian culture after a year's sabbatical in Trinidad, Terry Noel returned to London in 1987 and founded The Melodians Steel Orchestra UK in September‚ÄìOctober of that year. The band then increased their abilities to recruit and expand by gaining BT as a national sponsor, briefly becoming known as the BT Melodians Steel Orchestra (BTMSO). He further promoted the movement by founding the Steel Advisory Service in the UK in April 1988, an organisation intended to assist those that would like to create their own steelbands. The newer Melodians have maintained close links with the historic group, exemplified by a member of the earlier Arima band- Robert Thompson- writing the \\"Commonwealth Melody\\" which the UK band performed at the Commonwealth Day Service in Westminster Abbey on 9 March 2020.  Membership  Players = Due to the pans within the Steel Orchestra needing to act as guitars, cellos and bass, sometimes along with instruments like maracas, cowbells and tambourines in the rhythm section, a broad array of players, specialities and skills are required. Although the band was understandably initially composed mainly of British Afro-Caribbeans, particularly those with strong links to Trinidad and Tobago, the band has always been welcoming and contained a diverse spectrum of people. Indeed, the scope of ages (from 12-60), races and backgrounds of players associated with the band today are unprecedented and the band has managed to retain its loyal British Trinidadian and Tobagonian membership, whilst attracting ensemble members united in their appreciation for Trinidadian culture. = Location = Although the band did, does and will contain participants throughout the London area and beyond, it does maintain especially strong ties to South London and areas predominantly within the boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth. Michael Fuller, the first Black Chief Constable, Commander and Deputy Assistant Commissioner within the UK, wrote about his encounter with the Melodians by Clapham Junction during his tenure at Battersea Police Station in the late 1990s. He asserted that they had a particularly strong link to the Winstanley and York Road Estates area, as many of the members \\"lived on the estate\\". The band also practice at Henry Cavendish School in the area of Balham that falls into the London Borough of Lambeth.  Community Initiatives  The Melodians have been a registered charity (number 1036904) since 1994, responsible for a wide range of cultural, ambassadorial, educational and social programs to try and benefit a wide involvement of communities. One of the most notable and long-standing partnerships that the band has is with the Henry Cavendish Primary School, where the band has agreed to provide music lessons for the pupils due to practising at the site. Michael Fuller wrote of his admiration for their community outreach work in the Winstanley and York Road Estates in the late 1990s, which inspired him to direct increased municipal funding towards them and convincing him that \\"its rising star .... coincided and perhaps contributed something to the area's change\\". The Melodians also introduced steelpans to Northern Ireland at Harpurs Hill Junior School in Coleraine and organised for a Catholic and Protestant Junior School to play together at a junior festival in Barbados in October 2000 to encourage unity during the Peace Process. Terry was also awarded the Community Centre and Culture award from the Royal Chartered Borough of Arima in 2008 due to his promotion of steelband participation around the world. However, probably the highest honour that the leader of the group has received was his MBE for services to Music and Community Involvement from the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2015.  Recognition and Awards  As previously mentioned, the group's pre-eminent status within the UK steelpan community has meant that it has enjoyed considerable success over the years, not least with the award of an MBE for its leader in 2015. Due to the entrepreneurial spirit and resilience of the group it is also vital to recognise some of the group accolades that have been bestowed upon it. These include: Two Performing Rights Society Enterprise Awards, Her Majesty the Queens's 40th anniversary Royal Anniversary Challenge Award and a BT Innovation Award.  Projects and Performances  Although the number of performances that the band has participated in since their inception would be impossible to fully record, they have a long and proud history of ambassadorial and ceremonial performances. Domestic examples are their performances: for 15 years consecutively in the Royal Variety Show at the Albert Hall, at the Queen's 40th Anniversary, the BBC's first-ever virtual Orchestra in 2016 and the Commonwealth Melody during Commonwealth Day Service on 9 March 2020 at Westminster Abbey. The band have been described as ambassadors for modern British Culture by envoys and have played in over 30 countries around the world in the service of the British Government's cultural outreach programmes. They have also performed at London Art Night in both 2018 and 2019. Terry Noel also has a long-standing association with Clayground Collective as \\"a champion bearer of clay to London\\", a company awarded for ‚ÄúEngaging new and diverse audiences and passing on Craft Skills‚Äù by Creative and Cultural Skills in 2013.  Features in Film and Media  The Melodians have produced many CDs since their formation, all available for purchase on their website and the internet in general. Terry Noel's pre-cursor to the Melodians, \\"the Groovers\\", also recorded a CD for Princess Diana, which was presented to her on the birth of her son Prince William in 1982. One of their most ground-breaking recent collaborations was with 2004 Turner Prize Winner Jeremy Deller for the soundtrack of his film \\"English Magic\\" in 2013. The film was recorded for a British Council exhibition and represented Britain's entry during the competition of the 55th Venice Biennale.

It focuses on honesty and fair dealing with everyone. Moral Explanation describes ways in which are considered correct and honest towards each member of the society. Moral Properties tend to describe an individual in an explanatory way. The notable thinkers have carried out specific trials to form correctness and acceptability regarding Moral explanation and its properties. The first philosopher to have discussed it in detail is Gilbert Harman (Nature of Morality ch. 1; ‚ÄúMoral Explanations‚Äù; ‚ÄúResponses to Critics‚Äù). Nicholas Sturgeon discusses it further in his article, ‚ÄúMoral Explanations.‚Äù See also Harman‚Äôs contribution to Moral Relativism.) Harman discussed a group of street gangsters to elaborate immorality. The goons were pouring gasoline over the cat. Anybody who witnesses this process of setting the cat on fire may regard it as immoral or wrong. But Harman denies to accept that the actual wrong is not the action. He believes that this judgement has doubtful credibility relevant to the onlooker. He adds that it is a non‚Äênaturalistic form of moral realism. Harman compares it with the example of a scientist. While a scientist performs an experiment where a vapor forms at the cloud chamber and scientist declares the emulsion of a proton as something very recent- everyone will demand the proof and correctness of the statement. While no one would ask for further psychological correctness of the phenomenon occurred to the cat. This is where the difference lies.

Open dialogue interventions are currently being trialed in several other countries including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Key principles of the open dialogue method include: the participation of friends and family, responding to the client's utterances (which may seem nonsensical in the case of pyschosis), trying to make meaning of what a client has to say, and \\"tolerating uncertainty\\".  Theoretical basis  In a paper illustrating the Open dialogue method Seikkula, Alakar and Aaltonen postulate that \\"from the social constructionist point of view, psychosis can be seen as one way of dealing with terrifying experience in one's life that do not have language other than the one of hallucinations and delusions\\" and that \\"psychotic reactions should be seen [as] attempts to make sense of one's experiences that are so heavy that they have made it impossible to construct a rational spoken narrative\\" arguing that people may talk about such experiences in metaphor. They offer a model that \\"psychotic reactions greatly resemble traumatic experiences\\" with experiences of victimization \\"not being stored in the part of the memory system that promotes sense-making\\". Postulating that \\"an open dialogue, without any preplanned themes or forms seems to be important in enabling the consturction of a new language in which to express difficult events in one's life.\\" This understanding differs radically from common psychiatric models of psychosis that view it as being caused by a biological process in the brain, such as the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia.

In the 1870s, he resisted the building of a town hall in the Octagon, but was in office a decade later when the present Municipal Chambers were built. Walter developed a bitter feud with Henry Smith Fish, and after Fish beat him in 1879, challenged Fish‚Äôs right to hold the contract for painting the municipal building. Fish was then disqualified and Walter was appointed mayor himself. Due to the bad-feeling this generated in the council, Walter did not receive a mayoral salary for the year. Walter faced bankruptcy proceedings after an iron foundry failed in the 1890s in Dunedin, and then moved to Wellington, where he was the licensee of the Western Hotel. Walter did not prosper in Wellington, and a motion was made to vote him the salary he did not receive during his second term of office. The motion failed, but friends raised funds to support Walter and his wife in Wellington. Walter's widow, Emma, died in her 82nd year in St Andrew's Street Dunedin in 1910.

According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 2,377 people. It is bounded to the north by Barangay Bulonay of Impasug-ong, to the east by the Municipality of La Paz, Agusan del Sur, to the south by Saint Peter and Kulaman, and to the west by Kibalabag and Manalog.  Geography  Busdi is located between the Tago and Pantaron mountain ranges and is therefore characterized by mountainous and hilly landscape with the Pulangi River forming a valley in between the ranges where the village proper is situated. The western portion is a highland part of Mount Tago Range and is characterized by cloud forests (saldab) and primary forests (puwalas). The east is part of the Pantaron Range which forms a natural boundary between the provinces of Bukidnon and Agusan del Sur. Major rivers found in Busdi include the Pulangi, Adgaoan, Namnam, and Saludinganun. Busdi lies in an important watershed area of the Pulangi River and Mount Tago which is considered as a critical area for the conservation of biodiversity. Due to the large territory of Busdi, several sitios are within its jurisdiction. The largest is Sitio Bendum, on the east across the Pulangi River. It was recognized as a sitio of Busdi in 1980 but due to its location it has developed a closer association with Barangay Saint Peter. To its north lies Sitio Nabag-o. Sitio Tubigon is located in the south on the border with Kulaman. Near the boundary with Bulonay are the sitios of Mahawan, Nabawang, and Nahigit.  Socio-economic profile  Busdi is inhabited mainly by Higaunen or Higaonon people and the entire village is within the Bukidnon Higaonon Tribal Association (BUHITA) ancestral domain claim. The Higaunen (or in Cebuano orthography, Higaonon) are one of the least known ethnolinguistic groups in Mindanao. Busdi is primarily agricultural where rice and corn are the major products. Abac√°, coffee, and rubber are also grown there as alternative livelihood. A section of the Malaybalay-Gingoog Road passes through Busdi; the same section is part of the Agusan-Malaybalay Road. There is one public school in the village which provide elementary and secondary education. There is also a Jesuit-operated school in Bendum which provides basic cultural education.

Its first formation in March, 1941 was based on the last prewar shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions. When the German invasion began it was still organizing well away from the front near Krivoi Rog but was soon sent to the Kiev Fortified Sector where it eventually came under command of the 37th Army. It was deeply encircled by the German offensive in September and destroyed, but not officially stricken from the Soviet order of battle until late December. At that time a new division was forming which was soon redesignated as the 206th, based on the shtat of December 6. It spent the first half of 1942 forming up and was still not fully equipped when it was sent to the front as part of 40th Army in Voronezh Front. It saw its first action in the Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh Offensive and shortly after in the Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye Offensive, as part of 38th Army, helping to defeat and drive the Axis forces west from the territory that became the Kursk salient. The 206th was on a mostly quiet sector in 40th Army during the Battle of Kursk but then joined the 1943 summer offensive in eastern Ukraine as part of 40th and later 47th Army. In October it was reassigned to the 27th Army, where it remained for the duration of the war. During the winter and spring of 1943/44 the 206th took part in the fighting along the Dniepr and into western Ukraine and, remarkably, was awarded a battle honor and three decorations during just over two months; it also lost two commanders killed or died of wounds between the end of December and the beginning of May. The division, now in 2nd Ukrainian Front, saw heavy fighting in the T√¢rgu Frumos area of Romania during April and May 1944. By mid-summer the vast majority of its personnel were of Kazakh nationality. The 206th then took part in the offensive that drove Romania out of the Axis in August and continued its advance into the Balkans, including the campaigns for Transylvania and eastern Hungary, and ended the war in the 33rd Rifle Corps of 27th Army, now in 3rd Ukrainian Front, advancing into western Austria. This highly distinguished division continued its service into mid-1946, but was then disbanded. 1st Formation The 206th Rifle Division began forming for the first time on March 14, 1941 at Pavlograd in the Odessa Military District. As of June 22 it was still in that District and its order of battle was as follows: * 722nd Rifle Regiment * 737th Rifle Regiment * 748th Rifle Regiment * 661st Artillery RegimentCharles C.

By July 8 it was fighting near Novograd-Volynskii and later that month the 206th was one of the first units assigned to the Kiev Fortified Sector covering the immediate approaches to the city from the west. The units of the fortified sector were redesignated as the 37th Army in August.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", pp. 95-96 On August 25 the German 2nd Panzer Group began its advance to the south with the objective of linking up with 1st Panzer Group and surrounding most of Southwestern Front. By September 9 it was making rapid progress but Stalin refused to give Col. Gen. M. P. Kirponos permission to pull back from Kiev. On September 15 the German pincers met at Lokhvitsa. The 206th, along with the rest of 37th Army, was deeply encircled and forced to give up Kiev on September 19.David Stahel, Kiev 1941, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, pp. 120, 210-11, 215, 220, 228-29, 260-61. Note the map on p. 210 misnumbers the 206th as the 208th Rifle Division. The bulk of the division was destroyed the next day but a small group led by Colonel Gorshkov managed to escape, along with another led by the divisional chief of staff, Lt. Col. P. I. Kulizhski, in late October. Gorshkov would go on to be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and commanded the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps in the last year of the war. The division was not officially removed from the Red Army's order of battle until December 27.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 96 2nd Formation The 206th began forming again on December 26, 1942 based on the 428th Rifle DivisionWalter S.

After six months of forming-up the division was still lacking crucial heavy weapons; it had only 12 of its authorized 18 120mm mortars while the 661st Artillery Regiment was short two of its 76mm guns and had no 122mm howitzers at all. By the time it arrived the main fighting had mostly moved farther east and the 206th remained on the defensive along the upper Don River and the city of Voronezh through the rest of the year.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 82 =Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh Offensive= On December 31 Colonel Ivanov handed his command over to Col.

At this time the division was in the 60th Army of Voronezh Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 238 On January 13 the left-wing and center forces of the Front began the Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh offensive operation against the 2nd Hungarian Army and part of the 8th Italian Army. 60th Army consisted of the 100th, 121st, 206th, 232nd and 303rd Rifle Divisions and the 104th Rifle Brigade. Each division had between 5,000-6,000 personnel on strength. By January 19 the Axis Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh group of forces had been encircled and the Army was defending along a 60 km line from Olkhovatka to Voronezh to Kremenchug, facing the German 88th, 323rd (minus one regiment) and 75th Infantry Divisions.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., Part III, sections 1, 2 =Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye Offensive= In a regrouping that took place before the start of the next offensive the 206th was transferred to the 38th Army, still in Voronezh Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 38 The intention was to encircle and destroy the Axis forces in the area of Voronezh and Kastornoye and subsequently develop the offensive directly on Kursk and Kharkov. Instructions to prepare and conduct the operation were issued by the STAVKA on January 20 and it was to involve the 40th, 60th and 38th Armies of Voronezh Front and the 13th Army of Bryansk Front. The first attack, scheduled for January 24, would involve the 40th and 13th Armies, which had the shortest distances to cover to meet up. 38th Army would attack second from the area of Terbuny. Its main forces would advance toward Nizhnyaya Veduga with one division on Kastornoye. Once the encirclement was made the secondary attacks by 38th and 60th Armies would split up and eliminate the isolated forces.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, sections 1, 2 When the offensive began the command of German Army Group B correctly determined its intention and possibilities. Believing that the encirclement of its 2nd Army would only be a matter of several days, orders were given to the VII Army Corps to withdraw from Voronezh and across the Don. Reconnaissance by 60th Army discovered this movement and it began to pursue. By dawn on January 25 the city had been completely cleared.Valeriy Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 84-85 38th Army's offensive began on January 25, moved up a day due to the German retreat from Voronezh. The attack did not begin until 1630 hours following a 30-minute artillery preparation on a 14 km sector from Kozinka to Ozerki. It had only 91 tanks (mostly in the 180th Tank Brigade) in support and no infantry reserves. The 206th was to attack toward Golosnovka and Zemlyansk to gain a line from the former village to Ilinovka by the end of the day to secure the left flank of the Army's shock group.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, sections 1, 2 It wasn't until dawn on January 26, following another artillery preparation, that the 240th and 167th Rifle Divisions, forming the Army's shock group, began to make any progress. Heavy fighting continued until 1300 hours when resistance began to weaken and the Axis forces began to fall back to the south. One regiment of the 206th which was attached to the shock group fought throughout the day for the village of Ivanovka. During the day the combined force advanced up to 8 km. As the Axis withdrawal continued the 38th Army went over to the attack along its entire front on January 27. Col. Gen. F. I. Golikov, commander of Voronezh Front, ordered a change to the operational plan, sending all three divisions plus the 180th Tanks in the direction of Kastornoye. This led to an advance of 15 km during the day's fighting. The 206th reached as far as Malopokrovka and Ilinovka but was unable to seize these places. The next day the tank brigade reached Kastornoye in conjunction with mobile forces of the 13th and 40th Armies, followed by rifle units of the 13th Army and the shock group of the 38th, leading to a stubborn fight for the town into the morning of January 29; meanwhile the 206th reached a line from Milavka to Akulovo to Makhovatka. As a result of these advances the main escape routes of the Axis Voronezh- Kastornoye group of forces had been cut.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, section 3 Battle for the Pocket During the following days the 38th Army was to help complete the destruction of this grouping before beginning to advance on Kharkov at the beginning of February. By the end of January 29 the 206th had occupied Dolgushi and was continuing to attack towards Ploskoe. During the next day the division reached a line from Kotovka to Lozovka. By now there was a developing threat that significant Axis forces could escape from the encirclement because the 25th Guards Rifle Division of 40th Army was unable to hold a 30 km-wide front. Golikov ordered the 206th to move up to backstop the 25th Guards. During January 31 the division advanced to the southwest, reached Bykovo and was then subjected to counterattacks by Axis forces falling back on Yastrebovka. The division was forced to deploy along the line from Bykovo to Gologuzovka with its front facing to the southeast to repel breakout attempts to the west by Axis forces. Most of 38th Army's forces were now marching or preparing to march towards the Tim River.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, section 3 On February 1 the Army's commander, Maj. Gen. N. E. Chibisov, was ordered to occupy the town of Tim with the 240th and 167th Divisions and to pull the 206th out of the fighting in the Bykovo area and move it up to a line from Yastrebovka to Teplyi Kolodez by the end of the day. However, there remained an Axis group of 30,000-35,000 men east of Gorshechnoye still attempting to break out of the encirclement and the 206th, along with four other rifle divisions and one brigade, were tied down in fighting with it. One of three independent break-out groups consisted of 6,000-8,000 men of the 57th, 68th and 323rd Infantry Divisions and beginning on February 2 sought to escape in the direction of Bogatyrevo. By the end of the 4th it had made progress and was engaged in stubborn fighting with the 206th along a line from that village to Bykovo as the division was reinforced by the 232nd Division. The next morning the German group attacked the 206th's right flank regiment and pushed it out of Bogatyrevo to the north, then continued to move towards Verkhnie Apochki where it was halted by a regiment of the 237th Rifle Division and the 253rd Rifle Brigade. By now Golikov had assigned 38th Army the task of completing the elimination of the encircled groupings. On February 6 the 206th and 129th Divisions and the 253rd Brigade received orders to pursue the retreating Axis forces towards Degtyarnaya and Shlyakhovaya, which actually amounted to pushing back rearguards; by the end of the day the division had reoccupied Bogatyrevo. The next day it captured Srednie Apochki and Nizhnyaya Kleshevka. During these two days the \\"mobile pocket\\" advanced from 15 km-30 km westward and was making a bid break out through Tim and Manturovo toward Oboyan.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, section 3 During February 6‚Äì7 blizzard conditions had severely hampered the movement of men and supplies on both sides but also provided the Axis forces with cover from observation. This weather did not abate until February 10. During February 8 the 206th reached a road junction near Shlyakhovaya while the Axis forces pushed back units of the 237th and 232nd Divisions while not yet achieving a breakthrough. That day as well the 60th Army liberated Kursk and 40th Army reached Belgorod, which was cleared on February 9. On that day the main body of the \\"mobile pocket\\" made further advances against the positions of the 232nd and 167th Divisions. Fearing they might be encircled themselves the divisional commanders ordered their men to the north and southwest respectively, giving the Axis group a clear path to reach Manturovo and then Solntsevo. Advancing against rearguards once again the 206th reached Stuzhen.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, section 3 With its breakout achieved the Axis group, which had abandoned nearly all its artillery and vehicles, continued its march on Oboyan. 38th Army scrambled to close the ring again but was hampered by the state of the roads which left the tanks and other vehicles without fuel and the troops with little food or ammunition. By the end of February 10 the 206th had occupied Pokrovka and reached the area from Krutye Verkhi to Aleksandrovka to Height 248 where it seized part of the abandoned Axis equipment. On the night of February 12/13 the 240th Division cut the retreat route of one of the three original breakout groups, which was almost completely destroyed. At about the same time the 206th occupied Troitskoe and Ukolovo. Meanwhile, most of the remainder of the Axis forces reached Oboyan where they prepared to defend. General Chibisov now ordered his forces to encircle and destroy the Axis garrison of that town in preparation for a renewed offensive on Sumy, 100 km to the southwest. By the end of February 16 the 206th reached Krasnyi Pochinok and Korovino. By this date Oboyan was already partly encircled by three rifle divisions, including the 206th, and a brigade. Chibisov planned to take the town in an attack from three sides on February 18 but on the day before, anticipating the attack, the Axis garrison staged a hasty retreat. In the end only a few thousand men of the original encircled Axis force managed to escape.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part IV, section 3 Battle of Kursk German plan of attack at Kursk. The position of 40th Army is shown in the center of the south face of the salient. Before the end of the month the division was transferred back to the 40th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 64 By now Army Group South was well into its counteroffensive and by March 17 the Army was threatened with encirclement between Sumy and Belgorod. Under the circumstances 40th Army had little option but to retreat, giving up Belgorod in the process.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, p. 364 The German offensive shut down shortly thereafter. Colonel Tsukarev handed his command over to Lt. Col. Viktor Ivanovich Rutko on May 11; this officer would be promoted to the rank of colonel on June 18. In early May the STAVKA made its decision to stand on the defensive within the Kursk salient which was occupied by the Central and Voronezh Fronts. The new commander of the latter, Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin, reported as follows on May 11:40th Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. K. S. Moskalenko, was assigned a front 50 km wide between 38th and 6th Guards Armies. At the outset of the battle the 206th was in the first echelon with the 217th, 219th and 100th Rifle Divisions. It was due to become part of the 47th Rifle Corps but this did not occur until after the German offensive began.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., Book One, Part I, section 1 The division was on the right (west) flank of the Army adjacent to its former 38th Army. It manned, apart from other defenses, an antitank strongpoint consisting of 16 guns of 45mm and 76mm calibre and nine antitank rifles.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book One, Part I, section 2 In the event, since the main attack of the 4th Panzer Army fell on the positions of the 6th and 7th Guards Armies to the east the 40th Army saw little action during Operation Zitadelle; on July 7 Vatutin sent Moskalenko a warning order for a flank attack towards Tomarovka, but this was soon revised to a transfer of most of 40th Army's armor and heavy artillery to bolster 6th Guards and 1st Tank Armies and a feint attack in support. Little of this affected the 206th on the opposite flank.Robin Cross, The Battle of Kursk, Penguin Books, London, UK, 1993, p. 197 =Belgorod- Kharkov Offensive Operation= Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation. Note direction of advance of 40th Army. After the German offensive came to a halt in mid-July the STAVKA made its long-delayed plans for its own summer offensive. Voronezh and Steppe Fronts would attack to regain Belgorod and then push towards Kharkov and the Dniepr River. 40th Army was to attack with its shock group, consisting of the 206th and 100th Divisions of 47th Corps, the 2nd Tank Corps, a Guards heavy tank regiment, and a large number of supporting antitank, artillery and mortar units. This group deployed along an 8 km front between Vysokii and Kresanov to break through the German defense on the sector from Terebreno to Lipovye Balki and attack along the Vorsklitsa River to secure the flank of the 27th Army.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 1 The overall offensive began on August 3 but did not involve 27th and 40th Armies until August 5. The 40th's shock group attacked at 0715 hours, following a two-hour artillery preparation against the positions of the German 57th Infantry Division, which had been severely damaged in the Kastornoye pocket months before. Its resistance was soon crushed; the two Soviet armies broke through along a 26km-wide sector and by the end of the day had advanced from 8km-12km, reaching a line from Starosele to Kasilovo to Ivanovskaya Lisitsa to Nikitskoye despite counterattacks by 11th Panzer Division which were beaten off. What remained of the 57th Infantry pulled back to Tomarovka.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 2 Following this success 40th Army was ordered to advance in the direction of Trostyanets with 47th Army, still in Front reserve, coming up behind. On August 6, 40th Army's shock group fought against the 323rd Infantry Division in the Dorogoshch area. It quickly broke the German defenses and began rolling them up towards the west, reaching a line from Krasnopole to Popovka to Slavgorodok. Army Group South now committed the 7th Panzer and Gro√üdeutschland Divisions in an attempt to stop the 40th and 27th Armies. During August 8-11 40th Army attacked towards Boromlya. On the first day it pushed aside remnants of 11th Panzer, as well as 57th and 323rd Infantry, and took the area around Zhigaylovka by the end of the day. By August 9 it was facing increasing resistance; its right flank units advanced 4-5km and captured a German stronghold at Chernetchina. Meanwhile the 10th Tank Corps, operating in cooperation with the Army, broke through the German defense, covered 20km, and seized Trostyanets.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 2 On August 10 the 40th Army advanced another 10-12km and captured Grebennikovka and Boromlya. Its left flank units were engaged in stubborn fighting in Trostyanets, beating back counterattacks by Gro√üdeutschland well into the next day,Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 2 when Maj. Gen. Serafim Petrovich Merkulov took over command of the 206th from Colonel Rutko. During August 12-16 the 38th and 40th Armies were fighting along a line from Verkhnyaya Syrovatka to Trostyanets and were unable to advance. The offensive was renewed on the morning of August 17 with the commitment of 47th Army from the reserve; the division was transferred to that Army on the same day.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 82 Following a 50-minute artillery and air bombardment the combined forces of the three Armies broke through the German defense and advanced 10-12km, reaching a line from Bezdrik to Velikii Istorop. The next day 47th Army advanced another 20km, after which it was ordered to cut the road from Lebedyn to Akhtyrka to help isolate the group of German forces massed around the latter place. This was accomplished on August 19.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 2 The 47th and part of 40th Army engaged in heavy fighting on August 20 with German forces transferred from Akhtyrka and made a further advance of between 5 and 10km. This cut the last road to that town from the west. The next day the 47th resumed the offensive with the goal of enveloping the Akhtyrka area from the west and southwest. While the German force there evaded encirclement, over the next three days it was defeated and Akhtyrka was liberated. By the end of August 27 the right-flank armies of Voronezh Front had reached the Psel River and a line to the south as far as Kotelva. From here the Front was to undertake a new offensive to the west toward Gadyach and to the south toward Poltava.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book Two, Part II, section 2. This source states that the 206th was moved to 47th Army on August 20. Into Ukraine As of September 1 the 206th was subordinated to the 21st Rifle Corps in 47th Army, along with the 218th Rifle Division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 222 As the advance towards the Dniepr continued, on September 17 General Merkulov was given command of the 47th Rifle Corps; two days later he handed his command of the 206th to his chief of staff, Lt. Col. Luka Minovich Dudka, who held it for one day before being replaced by Col. Nikolai Mikhailovich Ivanovskii. By the end of September 22 the 47th Army reached a line from Chepilki to Ashanovka with the 206th as one of the divisions in the lead, but had lost contact with the German forces covering their crossing of the Dniepr in the Kanev area.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, p. 29 That night the first soldiers of 3rd Guards Tank Army crossed the river near Bukrin, establishing a bridgehead that would be the focus of considerable fighting over the following weeks.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, p. 170 Days later the 21st Corps captured two insignificant shoreline sectors southeast of Kanev. By October 12 it had been moved, with the rest of 47th Army, to another bridgehead at Studenets. On that date the Voronezh Front (soon redesignated as 1st Ukrainian Front) made its first attempt to break out of the Bukrin bridgehead and 47th Army was to secure the left flank of the Front's shock group. 21st Corps was deployed on the right flank of the bridgehead with both the 206th and 218th Divisions in the first echelon.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 39, 54 In the event neither this attack nor a further effort on October 21 had any success largely due to a lack of bridging material to allow heavy artillery to cross to the bridgehead. The STAVKA now switched its attention to another bridgehead at Lyutezh, north of Kiev.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 184-85 This led to a considerable regrouping of the Front's forces in the course of which the 206th, which was left holding the Studenets bridgehead, was transferred as a separate division to Lt. Gen. S. G. Trofimenko's 27th Army.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, p. 86 It would remain in this Army for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 82 During the fighting for the Bukrin bridgehead Sen. Lt. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kotov, the commander of a battery of 76mm guns of the 661st Artillery Regiment, repeatedly distinguished himself in action. His battery was one of the first from the Regiment to cross the Dniepr and immediately began providing direct fire support to the infantry. During the fighting for Hill 243.2 from October 2-24 he directed his guns in repelling eight German counterattacks, destroying more than 150 enemy troops, three mortar and two artillery batteries, plus three tripod-mounted and two bipod-mounted machine guns. He then led the establishment of an observation post on the height. On March 6, 1944, Lieutenant Kotov, who had previously won the medal \\"For Courage\\", the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd Degree, was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. In early 1945 he was transferred to the 11th Artillery Division with the rank of captain; he survived the war, returned to teaching, and died in 1988 in Bataysk, where he was buried.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=23323.

As winter weather approached the division organized its own ski battalion to serve as a mobile reserve but in late December this was re-formed as the 3rd rifle battalion for the 722nd Regiment, whose original 3rd Battalion had been disbanded due to heavy losses.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 82 On December 31, while personally assigning combat missions to the commander of this Regiment and his battalion commanders only 400m from the forward edge of the German lines, Colonel Ivanovskii was killed by a sniper. The attack he had been directing went ahead but only gained 100-200m due to heavy German fire. On January 17, 1944 Ivanovskii was posthumously promoted to the rank of major general.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, pp. 119, 231 During the first three weeks of January the division was commanded by Lt. Col. Nikolai Andreevich Ivanchenko but on the 22nd it was taken over by Col. Vladimir Pavlovich Kolesnikov. In a report to 27th Army on January 6 the division gave its weapons strength as follows: rifles: 1,300; submachine guns: 750; heavy machine guns: 54; light machine guns: 245; 50mm mortars: 2; 82mm mortars: 41; 105mm and 120mm mortars: 14; antitank rifles: 69; antitank guns: 31; 76mm guns: 28; 105mm guns: 12.Combat Path of the 206th Rifle Division (2nd Formation), p. 40.

On January 26 a mechanized corps and a Guards tank corps of the Front penetrated the right flank of 1st Panzer Army and began driving south. Meanwhile a reconnaissance- in-force by 2nd Ukrainian Front against German 8th Army had found a weak point between Cherkassy and Kirovograd which was soon penetrated and exploited by 4th Guards and 6th Tank Armies. On the afternoon of the 28th the forces of the two fronts met at Shpola, encircling the 56,000 troops of XI and XXXXII Army Corps. During the first half of February two German panzer corps made desperate efforts to break through to the pocket while the encircling forces, including 27th Army, did their best to reduce it. On February 16 about 30,000 managed to escape, without any vehicles or heavy equipment.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 219, 225-28, 232-34, 237 Two days later the 206th was granted an honorific for its part in the battle:During the battle the 27th Army was transferred to 2nd Ukrainian Front and the division came under command of the 33rd Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 76 Following this victory it took part in the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive and on March 19 was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the liberation of the former city. Battles in Moldova As the offensive continued towards Boto»ôani the 206th staged an assault crossing of the Dniestr River and took part in the capture of the city of Beltsy, for which it was decorated on April 8 with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree. It was now part of the 35th Guards Rifle Corps. While the 52nd Army staged diversionary actions towards Ia»ôi, the shock group of the Front, including both Corps of 27th Army, thrust southward across the Prut River 16-60km northwest of Ia»ôi. The initial mission was to reach the T√¢rgu Frumos, Pa»ôcani and T√¢rgu Neam»õ regions and, ideally, to take those towns from their Romanian defenders by surprise. The advance was complicated by heavy terrain, multiple rivers and streams, and spring flooding.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 54, 60 On April 24 the 206th would be further decorated with the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd Degree, for its successful forcing of the Prut. =First Battle of T√¢rgu Frumos= The 232nd Rifle Division captured Boto»ôani on April 7, forcing part of the Romanian 8th Infantry Division southward toward T√¢rgu Neam»õ. Meanwhile, to the east, the 3rd Guards Airborne Division also attacked to the south, driving the main forces of the Romanian division back towards the town of H√¢rlƒÉu, flanked by the 202nd and 206th Divisions. The next day the 206th drove the Romanian group out of H√¢rlƒÉu, which placed it just 27km north of T√¢rgu Frumos. All that separated the 27th Army from its objectives were the disorganized remnants of the Romanian 7th and 8th Divisions. By now, however, the Romanian 4th Army had managed to assemble enough forces to man the Strunga Defense Line from T√¢rgu Neam»õ to just south of Ia»ôi.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 60-61 35th Guards Corps resumed its advance towards T√¢rgu Frumos at mid-morning on April 9 with the 202nd and 206th Divisions in the first echelon. The 206th quickly cleared the Romanian troops from the town and the adjacent region and dug into defensive positions to the southeast and southwest. Forward detachments of the 2nd Tank Army tried to reinforce the Corps but were unable to break contact with a battlegroup of the 24th Panzer Division north of Podu Iloaiei. The German 8th Army was already moving to counter the threat from 27th Army by moving the Gro√üdeutschland Division from well east of Ia»ôi. During the afternoon this Division's 52nd Assault Engineer Battalion launched a counterattack which managed to seize and hold a small foothold in the southern part of T√¢rgu Frumos, but the 3rd Guards Airborne soon came up to reinforce the 206th. By nightfall the three Soviet divisions had carved a menacing salient 5-10km deep into the Romanian defense south and southeast of the town and were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the main body on 2nd Tank Army which was struggling through virtually roadless and muddy terrain.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 61-66 Early on April 10 Gro√üdeutschland, which fielded 160 tanks including 40 Panthers and 40 Tigers, attacked westward along the road from Podu Iloaiei to T√¢rgu Frumos in two columns on each side of the road. This was just as the 206th, 3rd Guards Airborne and 93rd Guards Rifle Divisions were preparing to resume their assault to the south so that only their rear elements remained behind in to town. The German attack tore these rear links and lines of communications apart. Their forward detachments were also struck by the Romanian 7th Infantry and 1st Guards Armored Divisions. The three divisions had no choice but to fight their way out of the developing trap; their only saving grace was that most of the motorized infantry of Gro√üdeutschland had fallen behind leaving gaps between the tank groups that the riflemen could escape through overnight. By the next morning the survivors took up new defenses north and northeast of T√¢rgu Frumos while the German forces built up positions to defend it. During the day on April 12 German infantry and assault guns cleared isolated parties from the 206th and 3rd Guards Airborne from a small pocket west of the town before further digging in. By the end of the day the three Soviet divisions held a line from the east bank of the Seret River near Pa»ôcani east to the village of Munteni, 16km northeast of T√¢rgu Frumos.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 66-69 The next day the Grenadier Regiment of Gro√üdeutschland began probing the defenses of 35th Guards Corps. This produced a penetration in the sector of 3rd Guards Airborne which required the 93rd Guards to be brought back to the front line from second echelon. Further jockeying for position by both sides continued through the next ten days. Overnight on April 24/25 the 206th was relieved-in- place by the 36th Guards Rifle Division which almost immediately came under attack by Gro√üdeutschland and Romanian 1st Guards Armored.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 71-74, 183 =Second Battle of T√¢rgu Frumos= The commander of 2nd Ukrainian Front, Marshal I. S. Konev, was still determined to take Ia»ôi and organized a new offensive to begin on May 1. As part of this 2nd Tank Army was to support 27th Army in recapturing T√¢rgu Frumos by enveloping the town from the east and then exploiting towards Vaslui in the south or through Slobodzia to capture Ia»ôi. The 16th Tank Corps was to support and exploit the assault by the 206th and 3rd Guards Airborne Divisions. Gro√üdeutschland continued to man defenses on a wide arc from northwest to northeast of the town, supported by 1st Guards Armored on its left and a regiment of the German 46th Infantry Division on its right. In the event Konev had to postpone the start of the offensive by 24 hours. On May 1 the shock groups of 27th Army attempted to carry out reconnaissances, but were met by German artillery fire and bombing attacks. In one of the latter Colonel Kolesnikov \\"perished\\" and Colonel Nosal, commander of 722nd Rifle Regiment, was wounded. By the next morning the division occupied positions south and southeast of Lake Hirbu.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 195, 197, 206Commanders of Corps and Divisions states that Kolesnikov remained in command until May 15, when he was replaced by Maj. Gen. Vasilii Ivanovich Kalinin. See Bibliography. The 27th Army's combat journal for May 2 describes the first day of the offensive:The 3rd Guards Airborne and 206th Divisions had shattered the defenses of the Fusilier Regiment of Gro√üdeutschland from Hill 192 eastward to just west of the village of Polieni, captured the hilltop strongpoint, and driven the Fusiliers back towards Facuti. The supporting armor, including 16 IS-2 tanks of the 6th Guards Heavy Tank Regiment, reached the northern outskirts of that village and soon penetrated into it. This thrust was met by a battlegroup of 24th Panzer and the Panzer Regiment of Gro√üdeutschland and stalled with losses to both sides.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 233-34, 237-40 Meanwhile the 206th, supported by the 164th Tank Brigade and 16th Motorized Rifle Brigade, was attacking the German strongpoint at Polieni, which was defended by one battalion of the 46th Infantry. During the afternoon the German armor renewed its attack at Facuti and in a matter of hours defeated and drove back the 3rd Guards Airborne and 16th Tank Corps. During the day 35th Guards Corps and 54th Fortified Region lost a total of 160 soldiers killed and 289 wounded. Overnight Marshal Konev refined his offensive plan, ordering his forces to concentrate on far narrower sectors than the day before. The 78th Rifle was to replace the 206th on the Polieni sector, after which it was to regroup to the west and take up assault positions due north of Hill 192. 16th Tank Corps was to regroup on a narrow 1.5km sector between the village of Nikola and Hill 197. Altogether the 206th, 3rd Guards Airborne and 93rd Guards were concentrated, left to right, on a 6km-wide front backed by about 70 armored vehicles and most of 27th Army's artillery, in order to penetrate the German defenses and support the commitment of 2nd Tank Army towards T√¢rgu Frumos.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 242-43, 246, 249-52 Overnight the German LVII Panzer Corps, which now included the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf, regrouped the bulk of its forces precisely opposite the sectors where Konev intended to deliver his main attack. The journal of 27th Army for May 3 states:No further progress was made on May 4, at a cost to the Corps of 55 killed and 237 wounded. Konev now gave up all hopes of resuming his offensive.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 253, 256, 260-61 Operation Katja At 0550 hours on May 7 the LVII Panzer Corps began a counteroffensive against Konev's positions north and northeast of T√¢rgu Frumos. After failing to halt the German attack the 206th began to withdraw toward Hill 192, which was lost to units of the 24th Panzer and 46th Infantry Divisions before an intervention by 16th Tank Corps stabilized the Soviet line. 35th Guards Corps lost another 86 killed and 291 wounded during the day and lost most of the gains made since May 2. The next day both sides went over to the defense. Later that month the division was transferred back to 33rd Rifle Corps. In the last days of May Gro√üdeutschland and 24th Panzer were assembled near TƒÉute»ôti for a spoiling attack designated Operation Katja. The 206th was just arriving in this area to form the second echelon of its Corps. The attack began on June 2 and quickly penetrated 33rd Corps' forward defenses. The 206th hastily manned defenses at and forward of Epureni before the 24th Panzer arrived late in the day as a few tanks of 11th Guards Tank Brigade arrived to reinforce.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 264-67, 338, 349-51, 354-55 At nightfall the Soviet armor, along with the remnants of the 206th and 202nd Divisions and the heavy weapons crews of 54th Fortified Region, were able to establish stable defenses just south of Movileni Station and the high ground to the west; more tanks from 16th Tank Corps arrived after dark. By now part of this sector of the Axis front had been turned over to the Romanian 18th Mountain Infantry Division. In the morning the Grenadier Regiment of Gro√üdeutschland renewed the assault on Epureni and by evening had advanced to within 2km of that village in the face of counterattacks by up to 20 tanks, including several IS-2s. The heavy fighting south of Epureni continued through June 4; at this point the German division had just four Tigers still serviceable. The next day the Romanian 18th Mountain took over the entire front facing Epureni as the panzers shifted to the east. On June 7 the 33rd Corps, now reinforced with the 93rd Guards and 409th Rifle Divisions, counterattacked toward Zahorna and took Hill 181 from the Romanian force. Gro√üdeutschland was forced to intervene with what was left of its assault gun brigade. It was now clear that Katja could make no further progress and both sides went over to the defense the next day.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 356-61, 363-65 =Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= On July 5 General Kalinin was hospitalized to convalesce from earlier wounds and was replaced in command the next day by Col. Aleksei Maksimovich Abramov. At about this time, as the division was rebuilding, it was noted as having about 80 percent of its personnel of Kazakh nationality, while most of the remainder were Russian.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 593 By the beginning of August it had returned to 35th Guards Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 228 but before the start of the summer offensive it was again transferred, now to the 104th Rifle Corps. In the plan for the offensive the 27th and 52nd Armies were to provide the shock group for 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 104th and 35th Guards Corps were in 27th Army's first echelon. The 104th Corps deployed the 206th and 4th Guards Airborne Division in its first echelon on a 4km-wide attack front, backed by the 11th Artillery Division, a heavy howitzer brigade, and 15 attached artillery brigades and regiments; in all the 206th would have 514 guns, mortars and rocket launchers firing in support. 27th Army was deployed along its previous lines, northeast of T√¢rgu Frumos.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 24, 37-39 Overnight on August 17/18 the 202nd Division took over a wide sector of the front from the 206th, allowing the latter to concentrate for its attack. The offensive began on the morning of August 20 following a powerful artillery preparation which lasted an hour and 40 minutes. 27th Army broke through the Axis front northwest of Ia»ôi between Spinoasa and Zahorna along a 20km-wide front and as early as 1100 hours had forced the Bahlui River. By 2000 hours the Army's forces had advanced 7-12km. In the face of Axis counterattacks by the end of the day the 104th Corps was southeast of a line from Kosiceni to PƒÉu»ôe»ôti. The first echelon rifle divisions had successfully carried out their combat tasks for the day; among these was opening a breach to allow the 6th Tank Army to be committed and begin its exploitation role. Among the Axis forces facing 2nd Ukrainian Front four Romanian front-line divisions and the German 76th Infantry Division suffered heavy losses and 3,000 officers and men were taken prisoner.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 74, 97-99 The following day the offensive resumed at 0600 hours. Assisted by the 5th Guards Tank Corps the 104th Corps crushed the resistance of the Romanian 18th Mountain and 13th Infantry Divisions and the German 76th Infantry and 1st Panzer Divisions before fighting through heavy forest to overcome the Mare ridge. By the end of the day the 104th Corps reached a line east of Sine»ôti to Schitu Stavnic. On August 22, while the Corps crossed the B√¢rlad River the 206th was pulled back into second echelon and concentrated in the Boresti area. The Front's goal for the next day was to help close the encirclement of the Axis Chi»ôinƒÉu group of forces in conjunction with 3rd Ukrainian Front and by day's end 104th Corps had reached a line from IvƒÉne»ôti to Corodesti.

The 27th and 53rd Armies were facing units of German 6th Army, which included the III Panzer Corps, Hungarian 2nd Armored Division and five Hungarian infantry divisions, but the Panzer Corps was soon moved westward to deal with the thrust on the Hungarian capital. On the morning of November 4 the 27th Army was to relieve units of 53rd Army along a sector from Polg√°r to Tiszaf√ºred but this was complicated by ongoing fighting for the former town. A renewed offensive began on November 7 and the right flank continued a slow advance until the 25th. During this period the 206th was moved again, now back to the 35th Guards Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 350 At this point the 27th and 40th Armies were directed to regroup with the objective of capturing the Miskolc area.

Accessed: 13 October 2013. History Lappos joined the US Army in 1968. As a Vietnam veteran pilot on the Bell AH-1 Cobra, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with over 900 combat missions. After graduating from Georgia Tech with a bachelors degree in aerospace engineering, Lappos was hired by Sikorsky where he worked on the CH-53, UH-60, and RAH-66 helicopter platforms. He was the Sikorsky S-76 Project Pilot onboard for the maiden flight on 13 March 1977 at William P Gwinn Airport in Jupiter, Florida. Lappos also worked on Sikorsky‚Äôs co-axial, rigid rotor, advancing blade concept; high speed aerodynamic research platform; the Shadow fly-by-wire flight control research program; and the fantail embedded fenestron rotor research project. He holds 17 patents for advanced engine and flight controls which increase flight safety in poor weather or during extreme maneuvers. In 2002 Lappos became program director for the S-92 helicopter winning the Robert J. Collier Trophy. He joined Gulfstream Aerospace in 2005 as Vice President of Government Programs responsible for the integration of radar and sensor technology into the Gulfstream G-5. In 2008 with Bell Textron, Lappos worked as Senior VP Research Development/Rapid Prototyping and then as Chief Technology Officer. In 2011, he became Senior Technical Fellow for Advanced Technology at Sikorsky. Lappos is Chairman of the United States Vertical Lift Consortium, chartered by the United States Armed Forces next generation development of rotorcraft: The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative. In the FVL initiative, he lobbies for use of common components and a common cockpit to reduce costs while accepting minor inefficiencies. In 2018, the Vertical Flight Society awarded him the Alexander A. Nikolsky Honorary Lectureship. Lappos lectures on the \\"Design Advantages of an Integrated Cyber-Physical Aircraft\\" which collates his test pilot experience and test engineer knowledge on how modern digital flight controls, real-time usage monitoring, and airborne analytics can replace the sub-system design rule paradigm. Lappos has flown over 70 different helicopters and amassed more than 7,500 flight hours. Sikorsky S-92 team leader Sikorsky S-92FAA certified under part 29, the S-92 (military H-92) is a 19-passenger, twin-engine transport that has a range of approximately 575 miles at speeds of up to 190 miles per hour. Safety improvements include: an onboard health monitor of all critical drive-system components, the highest crashworthiness standard fuel system, enhanced bird- strike design, and increased protection from lightning and high-energy field radiation. The S-92 engine failure design permits safe landings within the entire flight envelope. Focused on reducing costs, the S-92's transmission is the only component requiring overhaul at 6,000 hours. It has a full-height cabin (six-foot) and reduces cabin noise by as much as 50 percent. Sikorsky developed an active vibration control system that creates counter vibrations to cancel the vibration signatures normally present which achieves a 30-percent decrease in vibration levels. 2002 Collier Trophy In 2002, Nicholas Lappos became the director of test engineering and then the program director for the S-92 program, finishing its development and taking it through its successful certification. Sikorsky Aircraft and the S-92 team, led by Nicholas Lappos, were awarded the 2002 Collier Trophy for their work on the S-92. The National Aeronautic Association (NAA) has chosen a rotorcraft for the Collier Trophy in only four previous occasions: in 1930, to Harold Pitcairn's autogyro; in 1950, to the Helicopter manufacturers, United States Armed Forces, and United States Coast Guard for using helicopters to rescue over 10,000 wounded in Korea; in 1983, to the U.S. Army and Hughes Helicopters for the AH-64A Apache; and in 1990, to Bell Helicopter and Boeing for the world's first large-scale tiltrotor aircraft, the V-22 Osprey.

The food and beverage subsector alone contributed 32% of manufacturing's GDP and 71% of exports. New Zealand has a disadvantage in export manufacturing due to its small population, isolated location, and high costs. Therefore, the majority of manufacturing is for the domestic markets, with the majority of exported manufactured goods being large-scale commodities (e.g. meat and dairy), high- value innovative products, and products targeting global niches.  Employment  The manufacturing sector (ANZSIC division C) in New Zealand employed 238,417 people according to the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase from 188,286 people at the 2013 census. However, the proportion of employed New Zealanders working in manufacturing decreased slightly from 9.80% to 9.75%. The large increase in employee numbers between the 2013 and 2018 census was mainly due to Statistics New Zealand adding data from other sources (mainly employee monthly schedules from Inland Revenue) to the 2018 census to reduce the number of non-responses. At the 2013 census, there were 133,644 males and 54,645 females working in manufacturing, a ratio of 2.45 males per female. The sex ratio varied from 0.83 males per female in the textile, leather, clothing and footwear subsector up to 7.22 males per female in the primary metals and metal products subsector.  Subsectors  Food and beverage = Meat and meat products  The ship Dunedin successfully exported the first shipment of refrigerated meat from New Zealand to England in 1882, causing a rapid development of the meat processing industry. By 1892, New Zealand had 21 \\"freezing works\\" killing, gutting and freezing beef and lamb for export. The industry was mechanised and the production line (\\"chain\\") was introduced in the 1930s. The 1970s and 1980s saw a material change to the freezing works industry. The UK joining the European Economic Community in 1973, stricter hygiene standards, new processing and packaging technologies, deregulation of the meat-processing industry in 1980 and the removal of agricultural subsidies in 1984 all contributed to the change. The inability to meet new hygiene standards as well as overcapacity saw many high-profile freezing works closures during the 1980s. In August 1994, five freezing works across the North Island closed after owner Weddel went into receivership. As of May 2019, there are approximately 56 beef and lamb processing plants in New Zealand: 34 in the North Island and 22 in the South Island. Major companies include AFFCO Holdings, Alliance Group, ANZCO Foods, and Silver Fern Farms. There are four major chicken and poultry processors in New Zealand: Brinks, Inghams, Tegel, and Turks. Together, the four companies produce 99% of New Zealand's poultry meat.  Dairy products  Fonterra dairy processing plant at Maungaturoto, Northland At the peak in the 1920s, there were around 600 dairy processing plants in New Zealand. Improvements in transport and economies of scale soon saw the old smaller dairy factories replaced by new larger ones. For example, the dairy-rich Taranaki region went from 118 dairy factories in 1933 to just one (Whareroa, near HƒÅwera) in 1992. Coinciding with the consolidation of dairy processing, many dairy co-operatives and companies merged over the years. By the late 1990s, there were just four major companies left: New Zealand Dairy Group (based in Waikato), Kiwi Co-operative Dairies (based in Taranaki), Westland Milk Products, and Tatua Dairy Company. In 2001, the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001 was passed, allowing New Zealand Dairy Group and Kiwi Dairies to merge with the New Zealand Dairy Board to form Fonterra. Smaller and boutique dairy companies in New Zealand include The a2 Milk Company and Lewis Road Creamery.  Wine and beer = Wood and paper = Kinleith Mill New Zealand has several pulp and paper mills. The largest complex is Tasman Mill in Kawerau, where Norske Skog owns a combined pulp and paper mill, Oji Fibre Solutions runs a pulp mill, and SCA runs a paper mill. New Zealand Forest Products owns and operated four mills: Te Papapa (paper), Kinleith (pulp and paper), Whakatane (paper), and Mataura (pulp and paper). Pulp-only mills include Winstone Pulp at Karioi, near Ohakune, and Pan Pac Forest Products at Whirinaki, near Napier. Combined, the mills produce around 1.52 million tonnes of paper per year. = Chemicals = As part of the Muldoon government's \\"Think Big\\" programme in the early 1980s, two major chemical processing plants were established in Taranaki to take advantage of the region's natural gas resources, primarily the Maui gas field. These were the Kapuni ammonia-urea plant and the Motunui methanol and synthetic petrol plant. The Kapuni plant southeast of Eltham was commissioned in 1982. The plant uses the Haber process to react nautral gas and atmospheric nitrogen to form ammonia, then reacts the resulting ammonia with carbon dioxide to form urea. In 1992, the plant was sold to the Bay of Plenty Fertiliser Co-operative, now Ballance Agri-Nutrients, who continues to operate the plant. The Motunui plant near Waitara was commissioned in 1986. The plant used a two-stage process, converting natural gas to methanol and then converting the methanol to synthetic petrol using a process developed by Mobil. The synthetic petrol process became uneconomic in the late 1990s as a result of falling oil prices, so the synthetic petrol part of the plant was decommissioned in April 1999. Today, the Motunui plant continues to produce methanol and is owned and operated by Methanex. = Refining = Marsden Point Oil RefineryMarsden Point Oil Refinery is New Zealand's only oil refinery, located at Marsden Point in Northland. In 2017, it refined 41.7 million barrels of crude oil, meeting 68% of New Zealand's fuel requirements. = Metals = New Zealand Steel's mill at Glenbrook New Zealand Steel operates the Glenbrook steel mill, near Waiuku south of Auckland. Commissioned in 1969, the Glenbrook mill uses ironsand as the ore, in contrast to many steel mills internationally. The ironsand is mined at the Waikato North Head mine at Otaua, and sent to the mill via an 18-kilometre underground pipeline. The mill produces approximately 650,000 tonnes of steel, primarily flat rolled steel, per year. Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter The Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, near Bluff in Southland, is New Zealand's only aluminum smelter, and is owned and operated by New Zealand Aluminium Smelters. The smelter was commissioned in 1971, taking advantage of the 800-megawatt Manapouri Power Station in Fiordland, built in conjunction with the smelter, to supply the required electricity. As New Zealand doesn't have any significant bauxite deposits, all the raw materials for the smelter are imported from overseas. Under the \\"Think Big\\" programme, an aluminium smelter was proposed at Aramoana, near Dunedin, but the proposal was dropped due to public opposition.

International was owned by a Canadian subsidiary of the Great Northern Railway and was involved in sharp competition, including steamboat racing, with similar vessels owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Construction International was built at the Mirror Lake shipyard just south of Kaslo, British Columbia by James Carson for the International Navigation & Trading Company. The IN&T;'s rival, the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company had launched the steamer Kokanee in April 1906 at Nelson, prompting IN&T; to build International in response. The frames for International were pre-manufactured and shipped to Mirror Lake, where they arrived in April 1896, and construction began soon afterwards.  Dimensions  International was long measured over the hull, and exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the fantail, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The beam was and the vessel had a depth of hold. International drew feet of water. The overall size of International was 526 gross tons and 281 net tons, with ton in this instance being a measure of volume and not of weight. The Canadian merchant vessel registry number for International was 103489. International was licensed to carry 300 passengers.  Engineering  International was propelled by a stern-wheel, which was turned by twin high pressure steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with a cylinder bore and a piston stroke of . The engines were manufactured by the Iowa Iron Works Co., of Dubuque, Iowa. The boiler was manufactured by John Inglis and Company, of Ottawa, Ontario. Career International (left) racing Kokanee (right) International was launched in November 1896. Despite early expectations that International would be a ‚Äúflyer,‚Äù the boat struggled to maintain a speed of per hour. Even so, International was raced against other steamers on the lake, and on December 12, 1896 was able to outrun Kokanee by two boat lengths. International was favored by the townspeople of Kaslo, while its rival Kokanee was popular in Nelson. Although International and Kokanee raced on at least two occasions, which of the two was the faster boat was never settled. International also raced against Moyie and Kuskanook In February 1897, IN&T;'s time card for International showed a departure time from Kaslo bound for Nelson, at 5:30 a.m., stopping at Ainsworth, Pilot Bay, Balfour and way points. Returning, International departed Nelson at 4:40 p.m. Rail connections to Spokane and Northport, Washington, and Rossland, BC were made at Five Mile Point, near Nelson. The run between Kaslo and Nelson took about two hours. From 1896 to 1901, International was placed on the route between Nelson, British Columbia and Kaslo. From 1902 to 1906, International was operated on the same run, but as a relief vessel for the newer steamer Kaslo. In 1898, the Great Northern Railway organized a Canadian subsidiary, the Kootenay Railway and Navigation Company. KR&N; took over the operations of IN&T;, including the International. In 1906 International was rebuilt at the Mirror Lake shipyard. From 1906 to 1908 International returned to the Kaslo- Nelson route, as the primary vessel. Disposition Hulk of International beached at Galena Bay. At about the same time, the Great Northern began to wind up its operations in the Kootenay region, and other than Kaslo, very little maintenance was done on its boats after 1906. In 1909 International‚Äôs boiler failed. The boiler was removed in 1910. The new boiler was never delivered, and International was never returned to service. When KR&N; ceased operations, International was taken to Mirror Lake and beached. In March 1912 International was sold to Gus Mathew for use as a tourist lodge at Riondel, British Columbia. International lay derelict at Riondel for many years, and was finally destroyed by fire in 1952.

It is the seventh-highest peak in the Methow Mountains, and ranks 80th in the state of Washington. Martin Peak is set on Sawtooth Ridge, at the head of Martin Creek, on land managed by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Other peaks of Sawtooth Ridge include Oval Peak, Star Peak, Hoodoo Peak, Courtney Peak, Switchback Peak, and Mount Bigelow, which is the nearest higher neighbor, to the north of Martin. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Martin Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Martin Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Precipitation runoff on the west side of the mountain drains into Lake Chelan via Prince Creek, whereas the east side of the mountain drains into Martin Creek and tributaries of the Methow River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Writing  The first versions of the song was based on the acoustic guitar and a keyboard synthesizing an accordion, over which Russo tried to sing. He struggled to find a melody line and ended up recording many channels with his voice, making the music base and the lyrics so chaotic. The text became so scary that made guitarist Dado Villa-Lobos and his wife Fernanda fled from the studio after they read the written words.

EffectsIn work= In the workplace, specialization of labor is used to divide up the workload in a manner that improves efficiency. However, holders of overspecialized positions tend to perform repetitive jobs, leading to boredom, dissatisfaction, and lower- quality output. In medicine The breadth of medical knowledge has expanded vastly since the 1980s. It has been argued that specialization is necessary in medicine to divide up the vast knowledge needed to tackle certain classes of diseases, such as cancer. However, specializing to narrowly leads to poor training; unnecessary health care; low-quality care, especially in regions with poor medical infrastructure; and knowledge that can rapidly become outdated. Overspecialization detracts from physicians' ability to identify and treat problems in patients.

However, overspecialization is considered to be a serious problem in research because it prevents academics from assessing the relationship between different fields in order to solve certain problems. The Ph.D system has been criticized for encouraging overspecialization, which can leave students ill-prepared for corporate jobs. John A.

A member of ZANU‚ÄìPF, he represented the Zhombe and Kwekwe North constituencies. Born in Masvingo, he attended the Ruzawi and Peterhouse schools before going to the United States to study agriculture and ranching at the University of Missouri and the University of Texas at Austin. He returned to Southern Rhodesia and began farming near Masvingo, and later, near Kwekwe. He was also involved in the meat processing industry and owned a shop in Harare. Upon his election to the House of Assembly in 1990, he became one of three white parliamentarians in Zimbabwe.  Early life and education  Hewlett was born on 18 July 1941 in Fort Victoria, Southern Rhodesia (now Masvingo, Zimbabwe). He attended Ruzawi School and Peterhouse School for his primary and secondary education, both located near the town of Marandellas. He decided to become a farmer like his parents, and went to the United States for two years to study modern farming methods. There, he studied cattle ranching and irrigation at the University of Missouri and beef production at the University of Texas at Austin.  Career  After his two-year tour of study, Hewlett returned to Southern Rhodesia and leased a farm near Fort Victoria. In the 1960s, he purchased a farm near Que Que (now Kwekwe), where he grew maize and wheat. He bought East Range Farm in 1975 and developed it into a cattle ranch. He went on to start his own Butcheries and later entered the Meat processing industry. In 1982, he purchased the 3,288-hectare Lorraine farm in Kwekwe District. He eventually owned seven farms in total in the Kwekwe area. By 1995, he was running a gourmet shop in Harare. In 1998, his company Umshandige Ranches, owned two farms covering a total 14,180 hectares. In the March 1990 general election, Hewlett ran as the ZANU‚ÄìPF candidate for the Zhombe constituency. He was elected with 92 percent of the vote against Rodger Ross of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, who received six percent, and independent candidate Raphael Muroyiwa, who got two percent. Hewlett was one of three white members of parliament, alongside Max Rosenfels and Sean Hundermark, both also of ZANU‚ÄìPF. In March 1992, after Parliament passed legislation allowing for seizure of white-owned farms with partial compensation, Hewlett warned that the law would destroy the Zimbabwean economy. He called on the government to slow down the land reform process and use the farms it had already purchased before acquiring more. Hewlett, who was absent for the vote, had himself already sold five of his seven farms to the government. In the April 1995 election, Hewlett was reelected to parliament unopposed for the newly- created Kwekwe North constituency. He was once again one of three white MPs, along with Allan Elliot and Jacobus de Wet. He did not run for reelection in 2000. That year, his Lorraine farm was listed among those set to be acquired without compensation by the Zimbabwean government.  Personal life  Hewlett was married to the Northern Rhodesian-born Geraldine Ann Thomas. Together, they had two children, Grant and Mireille. Grant is a Kwekwe-based businessman, while Mireille is a competitive rower. Geraldine, Grant, and Mireille Hewlett were among the Zimbabweans named in the Panama Papers. Hewlett speaks Shona fluently.

Released worldwide on January 23, 2020 for the Nintendo Switch, the game received a Metacritic rating of 65. An homage to arcade gaming in the 1980s, 198Xs coming-of-age story follows an unnamed \\"Kid\\" as he discovers a video arcade in an abandoned factory and falls in love with video gaming. The gameplay of 198Xs 5 chapters are each based around different arcade game genres that were popular at the time, such as beat 'em ups and horizontally-scrolling space shooters. Plot In an introductory sequence entitled Beating Heart that plays like a side-scrolling beat 'em up, the teenage protagonist fights his way from the subway station and through the streets of the unnamed city in which he lives until he reaches a hospital where he is attacked by a hooded figure with glowing red eyes. Set in the 1980s, the game follows the \\"Kid\\", the teenager from the introduction, who feels stuck in his childhood home in \\"sleepy suburbia\\" as he waits for his life to \\"move forward\\". One night, as \\"the Kid\\" wanders the streets of his unnamed city looking for anything to \\"make his heart skip a beat again\\", he stumbles onto an abandoned factory that was built \\"long before\\" the protagonist was born and now houses an arcade. Wondering if he found a place where he can fit in, he starts playing a horizontally scrolling space shooter entitled Out of the Void. Feeling disconnected at school, the Kid's mind frequently returns to the arcade where he was \\"on an asteroid somewhere fighting space invaders.\\" The only person he notices in school is \\"her\\" a \\"punk rocker from the south district\\" who's freedom the Kid admires. 198X then cuts to the KId playing an arcade racing game entitled The Runaway. During The Runaway's second stage, the Kid explains that he's started to spend every night at the arcade, where every game he mastered made him \\"stronger\\" and \\"more confident\\". One evening, the Kid reminisces about his childhood and how \\"anything was possible\\" back then before \\"everyone got brainwashed\\" in high school. He then mentions how when your a kid \\"shadows seem darker and more terrifying\\" yet \\"more exciting\\" at the same time. The game then transitions to a ninja video game called Shadowplay. That night, while walking to the arcade, the Kid reveals that his parents split up due to an incident involving the Kid's father. He also mentions that night was when \\"everything changed\\" at the arcade before 198X transitions into a role-playing video game entitled Kill Screen where the player has to defeat 3 dragons in order to solve a maze before fighting the unwinnable SHODAN-like final boss. Afterwards the Kid is seen sitting outside the arcade in the rain mentioning that he \\"was still there\\" but that \\"nothing was the same\\". Characters from 198X's various games begin to materialize around him, with the protagonist concluding that the \\"game was not over\\". Development A KickStarter page for 198X was launched on May 3, 2018, With the developer Hi-Bit Studios seeking SEK 500,000 for the project. The goal was reached a little under a month later on June 2 with 1,920 backers pledging SEK 676,558. Reception 198X received a score of 65 on Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Writing for Nintendo Life, Damien McFerren gave the game 8/10 stars, stating that while 198X had an \\"exceptional\\" soundtrack and cited Out of the Void as \\"perhaps the highlight of the entire game\\", he found the game to be too short, with McFerren able to breeze through the entirety of 198X in \\"around an hour\\". He also bemoaned the lack of replayability in the mini-games, which he found little point in returning to \\"outside of boosting your high score\\". In his review for GameSpot, James O'Connor gave 198X 5/10 stars, calling the game \\"mediocre\\" and stating that while the soundtrack \\"does a great job of evoking the arcade classics it is paying homage to\\" and calling Shadowplay \\"great\\" he ultimately concluded that 198X was a \\"great idea with middling execution\\" and that there's \\"not enough here for the game to feel like a proper ode to '80s arcades\\" and that \\"the Kid's plight, and his longing to escape his current life\\" don't totally connect\\". He finished the review by saying \\"198X feels more like a proof of concept than a final product.\\" Eurogamer's Martin Robinson stated that he was \\"cynical\\" going into 198X due to seeing many other games like it before, but praised its style and the \\"pitch perfect pastiches\\" of classic arcade games, which he called \\"the most assured part of the whole package\\". Robinson, however, wasn't convinced by the story, chalking up his issues with it to either 198X being the first game in a planned series that just only found its feet at the end of the first title or the narrator who he found to \\"sound both bored and melodramatic at once\\". He concluded the review by stating the developer Hi-Bit Studios did \\"Fine work here\\" while stating that 198X is \\"nestled between near meticulous versions of key inspirations such as Ninja Warriors, OutRun, Gradius and R-Type and stated that \\"there's no greater compliment than to say that the tributes on offer here sit happily alongside the originals\\".

She is the George Daniel Olds Professor in Economic and Social Institutions at Amherst College. She has published work on the structure of anti-discrimination law and the legal responses to rape and domestic violence. Career Bumiller attended Northwestern University, obtaining a BA degree and an MA degree in political science in 1979. In 1984, she graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison with a PhD in political science. Amherst College granted her an honorary AM degree in 2001. In 1988, Bumiller published The Civil Rights Society. Using interviews with victims of race, gender, and age discrimination and studying changes in the two decades following the Civil Rights Act, she argues that the type of legal protection that forms the basis of civil rights law prevents victims of structural oppression from liberating themselves. Many anti-discrimination laws assume that victims will report offenses that have been perpetrated against them and will willingly participate in the process of remedying those offenses, but Bumiller shows that this assumption is often not justified. Worse, Bumiller argues that legal remediation is designed in such a way that it often results in misinterpretations and misrepresentations of the victim, so that remedies which are supposedly designed to right injustices instead encourage victims to passively accept discrimination. A victim who does not pursue legal actions that they justifiably feel might harm them can be more easily portrayed as tacitly accepting the abuse that they are subjected to, so these systems can actually worsen discrimination. By criticizing the foundations of anti-discrimination laws, Bumiller questions the efficacy of civil rights legislation that does not alter the structure of legal remedies for disciminatory abuses. Bumiller published another book in 2008, called In an Abusive State: How Neoliberalism Appropriated the Feminist Movement against Sexual Violence. In In an Abusive State, Bumiller studies the relationship between American feminist efforts in the 1970s to protect women who were victims of rape and abuse and the simultaneous movement towards criminalization and increased state punishment. She argues that the criminal justice movement co-opted the movement to fight violence against women, using it as a pretense to increase the apparatus of the state to control crime and allowing the state to do more violence. Bumiller does not blame the feminist movement for this co-optation, but rather argues that the expansion of repressive state power and the narrative of a universal female victim ironically resulted in re-victimizing the victims of sexual violence. Analyzing two prominent gang rape trials, the New Beford gang rape case and the Central Park jogger case, Bumiller argues that these highly publicized efforts by criminal justice allowed the state to portray itself as a force that helps keep sexual violence contained, in a mechanism called expressive justice, and that these efforts helped develop the harmful idea of a good victim. Bumiller notes that criminal justice efforts directed at suspected perpetrators of sexual violence have taken government money and resources away from grassroots work that aims to support victims. Bumiller connects this trend to a consistent process of privatization in neoliberalism, and notes that many of the state powers that were expanded in response to activism that seeks to reduce violence against women were ironically parts of the government that have been historically criticized by feminist activists. Bumiller offers alternative proposals to reduce violence against women, such as nonviolent preventative measures. The name of In an Abusive State is a double entendre, referring both to the circumstances of women who have had abuse done to them, and to the situation of existing under a state that can abuse its citizens. In an Abusive State won the 2009 Victoria Schuck Award, an annual award that is granted by the American Political Science Association to the author of the best book published in the previous year on the topic of women and politics.

These short stories are told from the perspective of young women and revolve around the themes of secrecy, deception, and self-discovery. The short story collection has received many awards and accolades, including being named an NPR Best Book of 2013, as well as making it to the shortlist for the 2013 Frank O'Conner International Short Story Award.  Plot  \\"I Looked For You, I Called Your Name\\" = A woman goes on her honeymoon but faces a series of disasters on the trip, including a plane crash, a broken nose and a hotel fire. She soon realizes these events are reflective of the looming end to her marriage. = \\"Opa-Locka\\" = A woman and her sister run their own private investigation business, and they are hired to investigate a man whose wife suspects he is having an affair. However, the man disappears while they are watching him, and they are ensnared in the ensuing investigation. Along the way, they also learn about their criminal father's mysterious past. = \\"Lessons\\" = A young woman named Dana, her two cousins, and her thirteen-year-old brother leave their family's farm and travel the countryside, committing robberies and bank heists. One day, a bank heist goes wrong, and witnesses see Dana's brother's face, forcing Dana to choose between protecting her brother or staying loyal to her cousins. =\\"Acrobat\\" = A woman and her husband are on vacation in Paris, but her husband decides to end the marriage and go home alone. In the face of her failed marriage, the woman reacts by following around and eventually joining a group of street acrobats in Paris. = \\"Antarctica\\" = A housewife travels to Antarctica after finding out her brother died in an explosion at a research station there. While trying to figure out how he died, she reflects on the secrets she kept from him that may have led to his death. = \\"The Greatest Escape\\" = A teenage girl is an assistant in her mother's struggling magic show, and she turns to theft and deception to make money of her own. She soon realizes the scale of her own mother's deception when she discovers the truth about her missing father. = \\"The Isle of Youth\\" = The titular story revolves around a woman who travels to Florida at the request of her estranged twin sister. The twin sister asks the main character to switch places for a few days, while the sister goes on a lavish vacation with her married lover at the Isle of Youth in Cuba. However, the woman soon discovers her twin sister's deception, both in trying to steal the her husband, as well as in the real purpose of their life swap.  Themes  Deception/Secrecy = The most obvious themes present in every story are deception and secrecy. One critic wrote that the stories are about \\"the secrets we keep from each other, and ourselves.\\" In each story, it is these secrets that drive the stories, with each woman's deception causing or influencing the events in each story. = Role of the Observer = All of the main characters are observers of the events of each story. They do not have a direct impact on what happens. They are hyper-aware of the events taking place around them, yet they are unable to do anything about any of it. In \\"I Looked For You, I Called Your Name,\\" \\"Opa-Locka,\\" \\"Acrobat,\\" and \\"The Isle of Youth,\\" this is apparent in how each woman watches her marriage fall apart. = Self- Discovery = Each of the stories features the main female character searching for some piece of information about others or themselves. By the end of each story, each woman discovers something, usually about herself. One critic wrote this self-discovery at the end of each story allows the reader to feel a sense of freedom. The self-discovery comes in different forms in every story. In \\"I Looked For You, I Called Your Name,\\" the main character realizes the extent and reasons behind her failed marriage. In \\"Lessons,\\" the main character realizes her role in the destruction of her little brother. In \\"The Greatest Escape,\\" the main character's self-discovery occurs when she learns the truth about her father's disappearance, which opens her eyes to the reality of the larger world as well.  Style  Van den Berg's stories are written with a cool, detached tone. One critic said the book had a specific feeling of \\"aloofness in the face of strange events.\\" Another called her prose \\"crisp and cool.\\" Because of this, critics have compared Van den Berg's style to that of other famous authors, such as Haruki Murakami and Richard Lange.  Reception  The book has received widespread praise from critics at organizations such as Kirkus Reviews, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, and many more. John Williams, of The New York Times, called the stories \\"confident and gripping.\\" Also, Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"a mesmerizing collection of stories about the secrets that keep us.\\" The book did receive some negative reception, with one NPR review saying the collection contained \\"one or two duds\\" with \\"brittle\\" storytelling. Despite this, the same critic then went on to say the rest of the stories were \\"full of delicacy and surprise.\\" In 2013, the book was named an NPR Best Book of 2013. In 2014, the final short story of the collection, \\"The Isle of Youth,\\" was named to the shortlist for the 2013 Frank O'Conner International Short Story Award.

Hollon (born 1949) is an American psychologist, academic and researcher. He is the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of Psychology at Vanderbilt University. Hollon's research focuses on the treatment and prevention of depression with a particular emphasis on cognitive therapy in comparison to antidepressant medications. His research (mostly in collaboration with Robert J. DeRubeis) has found that cognitive therapy is as efficacious and more enduring than antidepressant medications in the treatment of unipolar depression.DeRubeis, R. J., Siegle, G. J., & Hollon, S. D. (2008). Cognitive therapy versus medication for depressions: Treatment outcomes and neural mechanisms. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 9(10), 788‚Äì796. https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn2345 That cognitive therapy has an enduring effect is perhaps his major contribution; studies dating to the early 1980s have found that treating patients with cognitive therapy cuts risk for relapse by more than half following relative to medication treatment following treatment termination and is at least as efficacious as keeping patients on antidepressant medications.Hollon, S. D., Thase, M. E., & Markowitz, J. C. (2002). Treatment and prevention of depression. Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 3(2), 39‚Äì77. https://doi.org/10.1111/1529-1006.00008 He has over 300 publications and has mentored over 20 doctoral and post-doctoral advisees.  Early life  Hollon was born in 1949 in Washington DC. He received a B.A. in Psychology and Anthropology in 1971 from George Washington University. He completed his graduate training at the Florida State University where he worked with Jack Hokanson. He received a M.Sc. in Clinical Psychology in 1974 and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology in 1977. It was in graduate school that he developed his interest in the nature and treatment of depression with a particular emphasis on work by Aaron T. Beck (cognitive theory and therapy), Martin E. P. Seligman (learned helplessness), and Gerald Klerman (controlled clinical trials). After his third year in graduate school with dissertation data in hand, Hollon followed his future wife Judy Garber to Philadelphia where she had gone earlier that year to work with Martin Seligman (an informal mentor to Hollon as well). Hollon got the opportunity to work with Aaron T. Beck, the progenitor of cognitive therapy, who became his primary mentor. The following year, Hollon went through the psychiatric residency program at University of Pennsylvania to broaden his exposure to other interventions. During his time in Philadelphia, his primary mentor Beck introduced him to his third mentor Gerald Klerman, a major proponent of controlled clinical trials.  Career  Hollon joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota as an Assistant Professor of Psychology in 1977 and was promoted with tenure to the rank of Associate Professor three years later in 1980. Hollon connected early with Robert DeRubeis and has collaborated with him on multiple studies over the course of his career. In 1985, Hollon moved to Vanderbilt University where he was promoted to Full Professor in 1988. In 2011, he was named the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of Psychology. He is the former Editor of Cognitive Therapy and Research and Associate Editor of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. He is a past President of Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT), the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP), and the first chair of the steering committee advising the American Psychological Association on clinical practice guidelines.Hollon, S. D., Are√°n, P. A., Craske, M. G., Crawford, K. A., Kivlahan, D. R., Magnavita, J. J., Ollendick, T. H., Sexton, T. L., Spring, B., Bufka, L. F., Galper, D. G., & Kurtzman, H. (2014).

Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 10, 213-241.http://doi:10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050212-185529  Research interests  Since the beginning of his career, Hollon's work has been focused on depression and its treatment. His work extends from basic psychopathology to prevention and treatment. When he moved to Philadelphia to work with Beck in the mid-1970s, he joined a group that was studying the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of depression. Beck and colleagues, Augustus John Rush and Maria Kovacs completed the first controlled trial to suggest that a psychosocial intervention could at least hold its own with medicationsRush, A.

Though not released as a single, \\"On Your Radio\\" has since become a live favorite of Jackson's and has seen positive critical reception. Lyrics and music According to AllMusic's Tom Maginnis, \\"On Your Radio\\" was written by Jackson as an \\"honest yet cutting kiss-off to all those who ever doubted him\\". The song condemns Jackson's enemies of the past in lyrics such as \\"Ex-friends, ex-lovers, and enemies/I've got your cases in front of me today/All sewn up/Ex-bosses you never let me be/I got your names and your numbers filed away/I've grown up.\\" Jackson had been an unpopular outcast during his youth; in an interview, Jackson recalled struggles with asthma and remembered being \\"punched, tripped and taunted in the playground\\". Musically, the song is consistent with the new wave style of Jackson's music at the time; according to Maginnis, the song \\"cruises along upon the exuberant bounce of a straight driving bassline\\" played by Joe Jackson Band bassist Graham Maby. Maginnis also notes the \\"steady rhythmic jangle\\" that comes from guitarist Gary Sanford's performance. Reception Maginnis writes, \\"If nothing else, 'On Your Radio' signaled to fans that if you liked Look Sharp!, you were going to find some tunes that you like just as well on this one\\". Trouser Press named the song as one of the tracks on I'm the Man that \\"up[s] the bile quotient\\" from Look Sharp! Peter Larsen of The Orange County Register described the song as \\"one of the fast and furious early songs\\". Glide Magazine ranked the song as Jackson's best song, while Dave Marsh and James Bernard ranked the song as the 14th best song about radio. Jackson collaborator Suzanne Vega named the song one of her five essential Joe Jackson songs, stating, \\"The ultimate revenge song of fame.

Etymology  The name of the well belongs to the Canaanite military commander Sisera who fought the Jews in Palestine, and he was the commander of the Canaanite army. His name was mentioned in the biblical and Christian texts as he is an enemy of the Jews. [2] [3]  Description  The Sisra Well is a well dug in a sandy rock, and it takes the oval shape with diameters of length 8m x 7m, with a depth of about 15m. It was carved on its inner sides stairs to its bottom. There is a channel engraved in the rock inside the well that was used to transport water to farms. This type of irrigation system was known during the Nabataean period (1st century AD).

Al-Jouf was visited by a scientist called Professor Winnett and his colleague Reed in 1962 AD. They said: \\"This well is like a pond in the pocket in Palestine. It is known that some of the low areas in Sakaka surrounding the well from the eastern and southern sides were supplied of water from the well through underground tunnels, as well as through channels that exist on the ground, and carved into the rock. Some parts of these tunnels were discovered accidentally after they were covered in sand. ‚Äù[4]  Gallery  File:ÿ®ÿ¶ÿ± ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ÿ±ÿß.jpg File:ÿ®ÿ¶ÿ± ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ÿ±ÿß ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ŸÖŸäŸÖ.jpg File:ŸÖŸÜÿ∏ÿ± ŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ± ÿ≥Ÿäÿ≥ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÉÿßŸÉÿß - panoramio.jpg  See More  Al-Jawf Sakaka Columns of Rajajil  References  1-^Al-Jawf, Hussain Ali Al-Khalifa, Nawwaf Dhabban Al-Rashed, Al-Jouf Wing, Janadriya 18, p. 7. 2-^ Al-Riyadh newspaper, Sisra Well named after the Leader of Canaani.

Since the collapse of Venezuela's oil refining industry and 2019 sanctions imposed by the United States preventing fuel suppliers from sending gasoline to Venezuela, the country is experiencing a chronic shortage of gasoline. The Iranian tankers sent in May carried 1.53 million barrels of Iranian gasoline,\\"Fourth Iranian Fuel Tanker Enters Venezuela, U.S. Slams 'Distraction, The New York Times while Golsan was expected to contain 190,000 to 345,000 barrels. All the tankers were loaded at a gasoline refinery near Bandar Abbas, and were escorted by the Venezuelan navy after U.S. threats of intervention. Background The decline in the Venezuela's oil refining industry has accelerated since 2016 because of underinvestment and mismanagement. Also, since late 2019, the U.S. has prevented sending gasoline by Venezuela's fuel suppliers. The own once- formidable refining industry of Venezuela cannot produce gasoline and country is facing a chronic shortage of gasoline. Fuel shortages have been common in Venezuela. In 2020, the shortages reached Caracas, sparking mile-long lines at filling stations. Due to shortages, the price of fuel in the black market reached $10 a gallon. Venezuelan petrol prices were once among the world's cheapest. Fuel prices are subsidized, which cost the government a total of $18 million per year. With both Venezuela and Iran under economic pressure, the two countries have developed \\"more political and symbolic\\" ties. The Iranian shoot-down of an American surveillance drone over the strategic Strait of Hormuz escalated US‚ÄìIran tensions at sea to the highest point in June 2019. Gasoline export Fortune was the first tanker to arrive in Venezuela's territorial waters on 24 May 2020. On 26 May, the second Iranian oil tanker, Forest, arrived in the Venezuelan port of El Palito. The third tanker, Petunia, arrived at the Venezuelan's exclusive economic zone on 26 May. The fourth tanker, Faxon, arrived on 29 May. The fifth tanker, Clavel, entered Venezuela's territorial waters on 31 May. All the tankers were escorted by the Venezuelan naval and air forces. =Payment= Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, Hojjatollah Soltani, told the Islamic Republic News Agency that Iran \\"has fully received payments of the gasoline exported to Venezuela.\\" A member of Iran's Expediency Council, Ali Aqamohammadi, said that the money received from the gasoline sold to Venezuela has been deposited in the treasury as a credit obtained by the National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company and the Oil Ministry. Controversies The U.S. said it was considering how it would respond to the shipments. The presidents of both Iran and Venezuela issued warnings about U.S. attempts to block the fuel delivery. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also wrote to Ant√≥nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, to alert him to the possible dispatch of U.S. troops to the Caribbean to block the operation. Also, Abbas Araghchi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs summoned the Swiss ambassador who looks after U.S. interests in Iran to warn the U.S. against interfering with its tankers. Ahmad Sobhani, a former Iranian ambassador to Caracas, described the U.S. decision not to interfere in the gasoline delivery as indicating Iran's \\"deterrent power.\\" Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston, said that the shipments of the five tankers are far lower than the required amount to resolve Venezuela's severe gas shortage. Experts say that with the shortages In Venezuela, the gasoline imports will last only a few weeks.  Aftermath  President of Venezuela Nicol√°s Maduro, said, \\"Thanks Iran\\" in a tweet after the first Iranian oil tanker arrived in Venezuela. \\"Only the brotherhood of free peoples will save us,\\" he added. The United States Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on four Venezuelan oil companies and the five Iranian ship captains who delivered gasoline to Venezuela. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza called the sanctions ‚Äúan excess of arrogance‚Äù and ‚Äúmore proof of the Trump hawks‚Äô hatred of all Venezuelans.‚Äù Previously the price of petrol in Venezuela was set to less than the equivalent of a US penny a gallon, though scarcity generated a black market where fuel was sold at prices of up to US$10 per gallon. Following the shipments, the Maduro administration raised prices to about US$1.90 a gallon. On 2 July 2020, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to seize four Iranian gasoline tankers headed for Venezuela. While the lawsuit would only apply in US territorial waters, the administration hoped other countries would similarly block the fuel shipment.

It is a rare plant in Victoria and South Australia. Description Leionema microphyllum is a small shrub to high with terete branchlets that are covered with tiny star-shaped hairs or sometimes smooth. The stiff, leathery leaves are egg-shaped to broader egg-shaped, long, wide with an apex almost heart-shaped or pointed to rounded, occasionally smooth or with minute star-shaped hairs with flat, smooth margins. The inflorescence is a cluster of 1-4 flowers at the end of branches in upper leaf axils. The white to pink petals are narrowly egg- shaped, about long and smooth, stamens almost length of the petals. The pedicels are long, fleshy, triangular-shaped lobes are about long and smooth. The dry fruit are smooth, about high and the surface finely corrugated with a rounded apex. Flowering occurs in spring. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller and gave it the name Eriostemon microphyllus. In 1998 Paul G. Wilson changed the name to Leionema microphyllum and the name change was published in the journal Nuytsia.The specific epithet (microphyllum) is from the Greek microphyllus, micro- meaning \\"small\\" and -phyllus meaning \\"leaved\\". Distribution and habitat This species has a restricted distribution in Victoria growing in heathland in the Natimuk district, but unknown in the area since 1962, and found near Lake Hindmarsh in 2014. In South Australia it is found in the southern Eyre Peninsula district.

He served as the director of Calico Museum of Textiles in Ahmedabad and was one of the founder members, and former head, of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). He was a trustee of the Mehrangarh Museum in Jodhpur. Singh has been described as India's \\"best-known textile revivalist\\". In a 1997 interview in The New York Times, Singh said about the Indian crafts community: \\"People assume that we will always have these craftspeople, but at the current rate of change, these skills may soon be a thing of the past.\\" Biography Singh was born in Kapurthala, a former princely state in Punjab, to Sita Devi, Maharani of Kapurthala and Karamjit Singh. He attended The Doon School in Dehradun, and then went to St. Stephen's College, Delhi. In 1985, he was the co-curator, along with Diana Vreeland, of the celebrated exhibition Costumes of Royal India, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Along with Pupul Jayakar and Rajeev Sethi, Singh documented the diversity of textiles and weaves across India, and all three were in the organising committee of the Festival of India, a state-sponsored six-month exhibition of Indian art and culture, held in London in 1982. In 2018, the Japanese designer Issey Miyake held the exhibition, Khadi: Indian Craftsmanship, Homage to Martand Singh, at his Tribeca store in New York, which came about as the textile director of Miyake Design Studio, Makiko Minagawa, had earlier worked with Singh and was greatly influenced by his efforts in textiles and design conservation. Before his death in 2017, Singh was working as the chief consultant for the exhibition Peacock in the Desert: The Royal Arts of Jodhpur, which was displayed at Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Seattle Art Museum and Royal Ontario Museum; the shows, which opened in 2018 after his death, were dedicated to his memory. =Vishwakarma exhibitions= Between 1982 and 1992, Singh curated a series of seven exhibitions, titled \\"Vishwakarma\\" (Hindi for \\"all-creating\\", meaning the personification of the ultimate reality, and in the current context \\"master artisan\\"), which for the first time captured the diversity of Indian textile arts under one roof. The 1981 exhibition, which brought together textiles from every Indian state, travelled to London as part of the state-sponsored cultural programme Festivals of India. The later exhibitions toured Russia, Japan, France, Italy, Sweden, China and the United States. The exhibitions, as a whole, systematically showcased India's textile heritage for the first time, and were instrumental in reviving interest in handmade textiles, weaving and dyeing traditions of the country. Awards Singh was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India, for his contributions in the field of Indian arts and culture.

It includes cartography of the Netherlands (i.e. history of surveying and creation of maps of the Netherlands) and cartography of the Low Countries in general (i.e. history of surveying and creation of maps of the Low Countries). It also includes Dutch colonial cartography, i.e. cartography in the Dutch overseas world, in the early modern period (especially in the Age of Discovery). In the history of cartography, especially in the 16th‚Äì18th centuries, early modern Netherlandish (Dutch and Flemish) cartography, both as science and art, has a very special place. From both national and international perspectives, early modern Netherlandish cartographers, geographers, explorers and navigators played a highly significant historical role ‚Äì who helped revolutionize and shape cartographic, geographic, geodetic, navigational, cosmographic and astronomical knowledge of the modern-day world as we know today. For example, the concept of 'atlas', in its modern sense, was the brainchild of early modern Netherlandish cartographers, geographers and cosmographers; most notably Gerardus Mercator (who first used the term 'atlas' for a collection of maps)Van der Krogt, Peter (2015), 'Chapter 6: Gerhard Mercator and his Cosmography: How the 'Atlas' became an Atlas,'; in: Gerhard Holzer, et al.

(London: Headline Book Publishing, 2003) The period of late 16th and much of the 17th century (approximately 1570s‚Äì1670s) has been called the \\"Golden Age of Netherlandish (Dutch and Flemish) cartography\\". The Netherlandish Golden Age is considered one of the most important and remarkable periods in the history of cartography and geography. Some works by Netherlandish Golden Age cartographers (including atlases such as Theatrum Orbis Terrarum/Theater of the Whole World, Spieghel der Zeevaerdt/Mariner's Mirror, Mercator-Hondius Atlas, Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem, Atlas Maior, and Harmonia Macrocosmica) are considered scientific and artistic masterpieces. During the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography, mapmaking firms of Antwerp and Amsterdam, especially, dominated the art and industry of cartography in the civilized world. They were leaders in supplying maps and charts for almost all of Europe. As James A. Welu (1987) notes, \\"For roughly a century, from 1570 to 1670, mapmakers working in the Low Countries brought about unprecedented advances in the art of cartography. The maps, charts, and globes issued during this period, at first mainly in Antwerp and later in Amsterdam, are distinguished not only by their accuracy according to the knowledge of the time, but also by their richness of ornamentation, a combination of science and art that has rarely been surpassed in the history of mapmaking.\\"Welu, James A.

There was always a cultural relationship between many Dutch Golden Age artists (like Vermeer) and cartographic works. The \\"Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography\\" (of the 16th and 17th centuries) was a period of the unique combination of scientific, artistic, political, and economic elements in the history of mapmaking.

The word \\"landscape\\", in fact, entered the modern English language as \\"landskip\\", an anglicization of the Dutch \\"landschap\\", around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works of art. Origins Until the fall of Antwerp (1585), the Dutch and Flemish were generally seen as one people. The center for cartographic activities in sixteenth-century Low Countries was Antwerp, a city of printers, booksellers, engravers, and artists. But Leuven was the center of learning and the meeting place of scholars and students at the university. Mathematics, globemaking, and instrumentmaking were practiced in and around the University of Leuven as early as the first decades of the sixteenth century. The university is the oldest in the Low Countries and the oldest center of both scientific and practical cartography. Without the influence of several outstanding scholars of the Leuven University (such as Gemma Frisius, Gerardus Mercator, and Jacob van Deventer), cartography in the Low Countries would not have attained the quality and exerted the influence that it did.Koeman, Cornelis; Schilder, G√ºnter; van Egmond, M.; van der Krogt, Peter: Commercial Cartography and Map Production in the Low Countries, 1500‚Äìca. 1672 (Part 2: Low Countries), pp. 1296‚Äì1383, David Woodward ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007) Notable figures of the Netherlandish school of cartography and geography (1500s‚Äì1600s) include: Franciscus Monachus, Gemma Frisius, Gaspard van der Heyden, Gerard Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, Christophe Plantin, Lucas Waghenaer, Jacob van Deventer, Willebrord Snell, Hessel Gerritsz, Petrus Plancius, Jodocus Hondius, Henricus Hondius II, Hendrik Hondius I, Willem Blaeu, Joan Blaeu, Johannes Janssonius, Andreas Cellarius, Gerard de Jode, Cornelis de Jode, Michiel van Langren, Claes Visscher, Nicolaes Visscher I, Nicolaes Visscher II, and Frederik de Wit. Leuven, Antwerp, and Amsterdam were the main centres of the Netherlandish school of cartography in its golden age (the 16th and 17th centuries, approximately 1570‚Äì1670s). The Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography that was inaugurated in the Southern Netherlands (current Belgium; mainly in Leuven and Antwerp) by Mercator and Ortelius found its fullest expression during the seventeenth century with the production of monumental multi-volume atlases in the Dutch Republic (mainly in Amsterdam) by competing mapmaking firms such as Lucas Waghenaer, Joan Blaeu, Jan Janssonius, Claes Janszoon Visscher, and Frederik de Wit.Carhart, George S.: Frederick de Wit and the First Concise Reference Atlas. (BRILL, 2016, ) During the Golden Age of Dutch exploration (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s) and the Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography (c. 1570s‚Äì1670s), Dutch-speaking navigators, explorers, and cartographers were the firsts to chart/map many hitherto largely unknown regions of the earth and the sky. During roughly a century, Netherlandish (Dutch and Flemish) cartographers made important contributions to the science and art of mapmaking. Their publications are remarkable milestones in the history of cartography, the extant editions are not only valuable sources of contemporary geographic knowledge but also fine works of art. The main role in this was played by a special artistic atmosphere of the Netherlands (or the Low Countries) in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Low Countries experienced cultural and economic booms that was combined with enthusiasm of different classes of people for geography and maps. The unique atmosphere made mapmaking a form of art. Cartography and visual arts were related activities: art and mapmaking interacted with each other: many cartographic elements, such as images, colour, and lettering, were shared with art; tools and methods used to produce maps and artistic works were very similar in printmaking and in mapmaking: copperplate engravings, which were hand coloured in later, required specific artistic skills; a significant number of both little-known and the most outstanding artists were involved in decorating maps; maps and art works were often performed by the same artists, engravers and publishers who worked for both areas; artists, engravers and mapmakers belonged to the same group of society that determined the development of culture in many areas. Gemma Frisius was the first to propose the use of a chronometer to determine longitude in 1530. In his book On the Principles of Astronomy and Cosmography (1530), Frisius explains for the first time how to use a very accurate clock to determine longitude.Allaby, Michael (2009). Oceans: A Scientific History of Oceans and Marine Life (Discovering the Earth) The problem was that in Frisius' day, no clock was sufficiently precise to use his method. In 1761, the British clock-builder John Harrison constructed the first marine chronometer, which allowed the method developed by Frisius. Triangulation had first emerged as an efficient method in cartography (mapmaking) in the mid sixteenth century when Frisius set out the idea in his Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione (Booklet concerning a way of describing places). Dutch scientists Jacob van Deventer and Willebrord Snell were among the firsts to make systematic use of triangulation in modern surveying, the technique whose theory was described by Frisius in his 1533 book. Gerardus Mercator is considered as one of the founders of modern cartography with his invention of Mercator projection. Mercator was the first to use the term 'atlas' (in a geographical context) to describe a bound collection of maps through his own collection entitled \\"Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mvndi et fabricati figvra\\" (1595). The hypothesis that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596. Rise to the golden age and declineSouthern Netherlands (Flanders, Habsburg Netherlands)=Gerardus Mercator: Birth of Mercator projection and the concept of atlas Gerardus Mercator, the German-NetherlandishSee the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#The question of nationality. cartographer and geographer with a vast output of wall maps, bound maps, globes and scientific instruments but his greatest legacy was the mathematical projection he devised for his 1569 world map. The Mercator projection is an example of a cylindrical projection in which the meridians are straight and perpendicular to the parallels. As a result, the map has a constant width and the parallels are stretched east‚Äìwest as the poles are approached. Mercator's insight was to stretch the separation of the parallels in a way which exactly compensates for their increasing length, thus preserving shapes of small regions, albeit at the expense of global distortion. Such a conformal map projection necessarily transforms rhumb lines, sailing courses of a constant bearing, into straight lines on the map thus greatly facilitating navigation. That this was Mercator's intention is clear from the title: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata which translates as \\"New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation\\". Although the projection's adoption was slow, by the end of the seventeenth century it was in use for naval charts throughout the world and remains so to the present day. Its later adoption as the all-purpose world map was an unfortunate step.See the discussion in Mercator projection#Uses Mercator spent the last thirty years of his life working on a vast project, the Cosmographia;See the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#Duisburg 1552‚Äì1594 a description of the whole universe including the creation and a description of the topography, history and institutions of all countries. The word atlas makes its first appearance in the title of the final volume: \\"Atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura\\".See the discussion in Gerardus Mercator#atlas1595. This translates as Atlas OR cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created, thus providing Mercator's definition of the term atlas. These volumes devote slightly less than one half of their pages to maps: Mercator did not use the term solely to describe a bound collection of maps. His choice of title was motivated by his respect for Atlas \\"King of Mauretania\\"See the preface to the 1595 posthumous section of Mercator's atlas as translated in , pp34‚Äì38 (PDF pp103‚Äì108) Abraham Ortelius: Hypothesis of continental drift and the era of modern world atlases Abraham Ortelius generally recognized as the creator of the world's first modern atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World). Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570) is considered the first true atlas in the modern sense: a collection of uniform map sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. It is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century cartography.Thrower, Norman J. W. (2008).

Australasia during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s): including Nova Guinea (New Guinea), Nova Hollandia (mainland Australia), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and Nova Zeelandia (New Zealand). During the Age of Discovery (the Dutch Golden Age in particular, approximately 1580s‚Äì1702), using their expertise in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation, the Dutch traveled to the far corners of the world, leaving their language embedded in the names of many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch-speaking cartographersincluding Southern Netherlands-based (Zuid-Nederlanders in Dutch) cartographers and geographers such as Gemma Frisius, Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of modern cartography, including nautical cartography and stellar cartography (celestial cartography). The Dutch-speaking people came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks.Koeman, Cornelis; Schilder, G√ºnter; van Egmond, M.; van der Krogt, Peter; Zandvliet, Kees: The History of Cartography, Volume 3: Cartography in the European Renaissance (Part 2: Low Countries), pp. 1246‚Äì1462, David Woodward ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007) The Dutch initiated what we would call today the free flow of geographical information. As Dutch ships reached into the unknown corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. The Dutch were the first (non-natives) to undisputedly discover, explore and map many unknown isolated areas of the world such as Svalbard, Australia,that comprising mainland Australia, Tasmania and their surrounding islands New Zealand, Tonga, Sakhalin,The first European known to visit Sakhalin was Martin Gerritz de Vries, who mapped Cape Patience and Cape Aniva on the island's east coast in 1643. The Dutch captain, however, was not aware of their being on an island, and 17th century maps usually showed these points‚Äîand often Hokkaido, too‚Äîas parts of the mainland. and Easter Island. In many cases the Dutch were the first Europeans the natives would encounter.McManamon, Francis; Cordell, Linda S.; Lightfoot, Kent; Milner, George (2009). Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia (4 volumes), p. 26 Australia (originally known as New Holland), never became a permanent Dutch settlement,As Peter J. Taylor (2002) notes: 'The Dutch polity of the seventeenth century was famously unconcerned with territorial expansion: as long as the frontier operated effectively as a defensive shield no extra land was deemed necessary.' yet the Dutch were the first to undisputedly map its coastline. The Dutch navigators charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast. During the Age of Exploration, the Dutch explorers and cartographers were also the first to systematically observe and map (chart) the largely unknown far southern skies ‚Äì the first significant scientific addition to the celestial cartography since Ptolemy's time (2nd century AD). Among the IAU's 88 modern constellations, there are 15 Dutch-created constellations, including 12 southern constellations. The constellations around the South Pole were not observable from north of the equator, by Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese or Arabs. During the Age of Exploration, expeditions to the southern hemisphere began to result in the addition of new constellations. The modern constellations in this region were defined notably by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who in 1595 traveled together to the East Indies (First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia). These 12 newly Dutch-created southern constellations (that including Apus, Chamaeleon, Dorado, Grus, Hydrus, Indus, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana and Volans) first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597/1598 in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographers Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of these constellations in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.Simpson, Phil (2012): Guidebook to the Constellations: Telescopic Sights, Tales, and Myths, p. 559‚Äì561, p. 599‚Äì600Among 15 Dutch-created constellations (recognized by the IAU), three constellations including Camelopardalis, Columba, and Monoceros, formed by Petrus Plancius in 1592 and in 1613, are often erroneously attributed to Jacob Bartsch and Augustin Royer From Frisius to Snellius: Early systematic uses of the triangulation method in modern surveying and mapmaking Triangulation had first emerged as a map- making method in the mid sixteenth century when Gemma Frisius set out the idea in his Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione (Booklet concerning a way of describing places).Swann, G.

The Grapes of Math: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life, p. 74 Dutch cartographer Jacob van Deventer was among the first to make systematic use of triangulation, the technique whose theory was described by Gemma Frisius in his 1533 book. The modern systematic use of triangulation networks stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom, approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all.Kirby, Richard Shelton et al.

Lucas Waghenaer and the rise of Dutch maritime cartography Waghenaer (1584). The publication of Waghenaer's De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt (1584) is widely considered as one of the most important developments in the history of nautical cartography. The first printed atlas of nautical charts (De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt or The Mirror of Navigation / The Mariner's Mirror) was produced by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer in Leiden in 1584. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify nautical maps. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and sailing directions with instructions for navigation on the western and north- western coastal waters of Europe. It was the first of its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a \\"waggoner\\" (an atlas book of engraved nautical charts with accompanying printed sailing directions), the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.Struik, Dirk J.

Among the 88 IAU-recognized constellations, there are 15 constellations created by Dutch celestial cartographers, including 12 southern constellations.The 15 constellations are: Apus, Camelopardalis, Chamaeleon, Columba, Dorado, Grus, Hydrus, Indus, Monoceros, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana, and Volans. The constellations around the South Pole were not observable from north of the equator, by the ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, or Arabs. During the Age of Exploration, expeditions to the southern hemisphere began to result in the addition of new constellations. The modern constellations in this region were defined notably by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman,Knobel, E. B. (1917).

These 12 newly Dutch-created southern constellations (that include Apus, Chamaeleon, Dorado, Grus, Hydrus, Indus, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana, and Volans) first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597/1598 in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographers Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of these constellations in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. In 1660, German-born Dutch cartographer Andreas Cellarius' star atlas (Harmonia Macrocosmica) was published by Johannes Janssonius in Amsterdam. In 1645, Dutch-born Michiel van Langren published the first known map of the Moon with a nomenclature. Competing mapmaking firms in the age of corporate cartography Replica of an East Indiaman of the Dutch East India Company/United East Indies Company (VOC). The VOC was a major force behind the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s). Also, during the Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography (c. 1570s‚Äì1670s), VOC navigators, explorers, and cartographers helped shape cartographic and geographic knowledge of the modern-day world.Schilder, G√ºnter (1993).

[Explokart: Utrecht Studies in the History of Cartography]. (BRILL, 2010, ) Australia (Nova Hollandia) was the last human-inhabited continent to be explored and mapped (by non-natives). The Dutch were the first to undisputedly explore and map Australia's coastline. In the 17th century, the VOC's navigators charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast. The Dutch dominated the commercial cartography (corporate cartography) during the seventeenth century through the publicly traded companies (such as the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company) and the competing privately held map-making houses/firms. In the book Capitalism and Cartography in the Dutch Golden Age (University of Chicago Press, 2015), Elizabeth A. Sutton explores the fascinating but previously neglected history of corporate (commercial) cartography during the Dutch Golden Age, from ca. 1600 to 1650. Maps were used as propaganda tools for both the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC/GWIC) to encourage the commodification of land and an overall capitalist agenda. In the long run the competition between map-making firms Blaeu and Janssonius resulted in the publication of an 'Atlas Maior' or 'Major Atlas'. In 1662 the Latin edition of Joan Blaeu's Atlas Maior appeared in eleven volumes and with approximately 600 maps. In the years to come French and Dutch editions followed in twelve and nine volumes respectively. Purely judging from the number of maps in the Atlas Maior, Blaeu had outdone his rival Johannes Janssonius. And also from a commercial point of view it was a huge success. Also due to the superior typography the Atlas Maior by Blaeu soon became a status symbol for rich citizens. Costing 350 guilders for a non-coloured and 450 guilders for a coloured version, the atlas was the most precious book of the 17th century. However, the Atlas Maior was also a turning point: after that time the role of Dutch cartography (and Netherlandish cartography in general) was finished. Janssonius died in 1664 while a great fire in 1672 destroyed one of Blaeu's print shops. In that fire a part of the copperplates went up in flames. Fairly soon afterwards Joan Blaeu died, in 1673. The almost 2,000 copperplates of Janssonius and Blaeu found their way to other publishers.

It describes several mathematical concepts related to the short story \\"The Library of Babel\\", by Jorge Luis Borges. Written by mathematics professor William Goldbloom Bloch, and published in 2008 by the Oxford University Press, it received an honorable mention in the 2008 PROSE Awards. Topics \\"The Library of Babel\\" was originally written by Borges in 1941, based on an earlier essay he had published in 1939 while working as a librarian. It concerns a fictional library containing every possible book of a certain fixed length, over a 25-symbol alphabet (which, including spacing and punctuation, is sufficient for the Spanish language). These assumptions, based on the dimensions of his own library and spelled out in more detail in the story, imply that the total number of books in the library is 251312000, an enormous number. The story also describes, with an attitude of some horror, the physical layout of the library that holds all of these books, and some of the behavior of its inhabitants. After a copy of \\"The Library of Babel\\" itself, as translated into English by Andrew Hurley, The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel has seven chapters on its mathematics. The first chapter, on combinatorics, repeats the calculation above, of the number of books in the library, putting it in context with the size of the known universe and with other huge numbers, and uses this material as an excuse to branch off into a discussion of logarithms and their use in estimation. The second chapter concerns a line in the story about the existence of a library catalog for the library, using information theory to prove that such a catalog would necessarily equal in size the library itself, and touching on topics including the prime number theorem. The third chapter considers the mathematics of the infinite, and the possibility of books with infinitely many, infinitely thin pages, connecting these topics both to a footnote in \\"The Library of Babel\\" and to another Borges story, \\"The Book of Sand\\", about such an infinite book. Chapters four and five concern the architecture of the library, described as a set of interconnected hexagonal rooms, exploring the possibilities for their connections in terms of geometry, topology, and graph theory. They also use mathematics to deduce unexpected conclusions about the library's structure: it must have at least one room whose shelves are not full (because the number of books per room does not divide the total number of books evenly), and the rooms on each floor of the library must either be connected into a single Hamiltonian cycle, or possibly be disconnected into subsets that cannot reach each other. Chapter six considers the ways the books might be distributed through these rooms, and chapter seven views the library and its interactions with its inhabitants as analogous to Turing machines. A concluding chapter provides references to the literature on the story, critiques the scholarship on this story from the point of view of its mathematics, and discusses how much of this mathematics might have been familiar to Borges. Author William Bloch, a mathematics professor at Wheaton College (Massachusetts), says that his book was originally intended as a short paper, based on his research from a sabbatical visit to Borges's home city Buenos Aires, but that it \\"grew and grew and grew\\". The endpapers of the book are decorated with reproductions of Borges's original manuscript for his story. Audience and reception Reading The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel requires only high- school mathematics, and its chapters are independent of each other and can be read in any order. Although written for a popular audience, it has enough depth of content to interest professional mathematicians as well. The book's reviewers point to some minor issues with the book, including a too-facile derivation of the (correct) conclusion that an index for the library would be as large as the library itself, a miscalculation of the number of permutations of books that are possible, a missed easy explanation of logarithms as approximating the number of digits in a number, an incorrect statement that a book with infinitely many infinitely thin pages would necessarily itself be infinitely thin, the choice for an example of a letter that does not appear in Borges's descriptions, and a failure to address the Spanish-language literature on Borges's work. Nevertheless, reviewer James V. Rauff calls it \\"a treat for anyone with a passion for infinity, logic, language, and the philosophy of mathematics\\". And reviewer Dan King, who himself has taught the mathematics of Borges's writing, writes that the book is \\"as eloquent and provocative as Borges‚Äô story itself\\", and a must-read for all fans of Borges.

Donaldson is an American neuroscientist and Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. Donaldson explores the neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of social bonding and social behavior in rodents. Her work will help to elucidate how variations in genetics and circuit activity across the population predispose certain individuals to mental illness. Donaldson is a pioneer in the use of the monogamous prairie voles to study social behaviors and has been developing novel genetic tools, since her graduate work at Emory University, to study voles in the lab to better understand the neural circuits underlying pair bonding.  Early life and education  Donaldson was raised in Reno, Nevada. At the age of 16, Donaldson left high school to pursue college level classes at Bard College at Simon‚Äôs Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. In 2000, she had completed her Associate of Arts Degree and decided to pursue her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. During her time at UCLA, Donaldson travelled to West Africa to study Malaria, and later conducted research under the mentorship of Barney Schlinger. Her research, supported by a Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research Fellowship, focused how androgen steroid signalling impacted courtship behavior in birds. She presented her work at several conferences. In 2002, Donaldson completed her Bachelors of Science at the age of 21 and decided to pursue her graduate studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Donaldson studied under the mentorship of Larry J. Young in the Department of Psychiatry at Emory. She used the monogamous Prairie Vole as a model organism to study the neural correlates of social behavior and the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in driving social behaviors in these organisms. specifically studied how genetic diversity in the regulatory genetic elements located upstream of the vassopressin receptor gene (VIaR) affect behavior. She first explored variation at the AVPR1A locus in primates and found both single and duplicated alleles of this gene. Following these findings, Donaldson created three mouse lines with which to study variation in the upstream regions of the AVPR1A gene. In addition to her mouse models, Donaldson also created transgenic voles and RNAi technologies with which to probe the implications of variation in this gene on Vole social behavior. Since her tools enable dissection of variations at the level of DNA and RNA and in two different model organisms, her graduate work equipped the field with the ability to probe the role of V1aR in novel and innovative ways. Donaldson later probed the role of V1aR in the formation and expression of partner preferences in voles and found that V1aR is necessary for each of these processes to take place. Donaldson completed her PhD in Neuroscience in 2009, and moved to New York City to pursue her postdoctoral training at Columbia University under the mentorship of Ren√© Hen. In Hen‚Äôs lab, Donaldson probed the role of the Serotonin 1A autoreceptor in behavior. She first examined how suppression of 5-HT1A signalling in the raphe neurons early in life impacted anxiety and social behaviors. Donaldson found that this early life decrease in 5-HT1A signalling led to increased anxiety and decreased social interaction later in life. After seeing how early life modulation of 5-HT1R signalling impacted behavior later and predisposition to disease-like states, Donaldson then honed in on a specific polymorphism in this 5-HT1AR promoter that had been previously linked with psychiatric diseases. Donaldson found that the rs6295G allele of 5-HT1AR is associated with increased risk for substance abuse, psychaitric hospitalization, and suicide attempts. When they probed the expression of HTR1 in the brains of donors with the allele, they found that patterns of disrupted transcription correlated with depression and suicide.  Career and research  In 2016, Donaldson was recruited to University of Colorado, Boulder and became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Donaldson is also affiliated with the Center for Neuroscience as an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience. Donaldson is the principal investigator of the Donaldson Lab, where she leads a research program centered around using mice and voles to explore the biological bases of variation in behavior. Donalson‚Äôs work will help to elucidate why specific genetic or environmental factors increase the likelihood of mental illness in certain individuals. Specifically, Donaldson focuses on how social relationships modulate mood and behavior. She tries to understand how losing a partner, social loss, causes pain and grief at the neural circuit level. One of the main techniques that Donaldson uses to probe neural activity, and its relation to specific genes and behaviors, is in vivo calcium imaging and she also develops novel genetic tools with which to study neural mechanisms in voles. = Social buffering = Social buffering is a phenomenon in which animals, in the presence of another animal, have attenuated stress and fear responses upon presentation of typically fearful stimuli. Donaldson explored the potential in activating neurons involved in social processing to attenuate fear, mimicking the experience of social buffering. She tagged neural ensembles that were activated upon encoding of a cagemate, and found that reactivation of these social ensembles in fearful contexts attenuated fear responses. = Neural correlates of pair bonding = Since Donaldson is a pioneer in the use of voles to study social behavior, she wanted to pursue a very fundamental question about the neural mechanisms that drive monogamous voles to form pair bonds. Using in vivo calcium imaging, Donaldson imaged the activity of neurons in the nucleus accumbens during pair bond formation and found that neurons specifically responded to partner approach and that the ensemble of neurons encoding partner approach increased in size over time and predicted the strength of the pair-bond.

Film reviewer Hong Wen compared the symmetrical image structure coupled with the sweet and quirky style to be a cross be reminiscent of \\"Wes Anderson walks into Emily's Whimsical World\\", lauding the independent, rebellious spirit of the film. In an interview with the Hindu, Ramaswamy revealed the film's playful tone was inspired by filmmakers like John Hughes and Sai Paranjpye, expressing that she wanted to showcase a more grounded representation of Indian millennials through the film. The film launched to mostly positive reviews on Netflix, trending #2 on the top movies in India on Netflix at the time of release and being featured in GQ's \\"top-content-to- watch\\" list.

Early life and education  Sein Win was born in the Irrawaddy Delta town of Kyaunggon, British Burma (now Myanmar) on 12 February 1922, as the son of a minor civil servant. He attended Judson College, a constituent college of Rangoon University. However, outbreak of World War II disrupted his education, and he briefly continued his education at Fukuoka, Japan, returning in 1945. While working as a reporter, he obtained dual undergraduate degrees, a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Laws degree.  Career  Sein Win began his journalism career at the outset of the 1942 Japanese conquest of Burma. During World War II, Sein Win also served as a volunteer reporter and translator for the New Light of Burma newspaper, and also served as an apprentice reporter, editor, publisher and foreign correspondent. In 1958, he became the chief editor and publisher of The Guardian, an English language Burmese newspaper, by which he would become known. In 1959, he wrote a seminal book, The Split Story: An Account of Recent Political Upheaval in Burma, which described the political chaos and disintegration of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), the country's first post-independence ruling party. In 1962, Ne Win led a coup d'√©tat and drove forward the Burmese Way to Socialism. In 1964, The Guardian, along with The Mirror and The Botataung, two other leading private newspapers, were nationalized and placed under the control of the Ministry of Information. The following year, in 1963, Sein Win became a member of the International Press Institute‚Äôs board and won the Golden Pen of Freedom award from the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers. He joined the Associated Press in 1969, becoming one of the few sources of news from the isolated country and served until 1989. He spent his remaining years working for Japan's Kyodo News Service. Throughout his career, Sein Win served three stints in prison for his journalistic work, in 1958, and again in 1988 following the 8888 Uprising.

Benavides. On 19 February 1939, as the result of a fake seance, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez staged an unsuccessful coup d'√©tat attempt against Benavides. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was shot and killed that same day. Antonio Rodriguez Ramirez Early life Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was born in Lima. His father served in the Peruvian military. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez attended military school, where he was recognised as a top student. When Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro became President of Peru on December 8, 1931, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez, then an army colonel, was appointed Chief of Staff of the military.  Government career  In March 1932, assassins unsuccessfully attacked S√°nchez Cerro in a church in Miraflores. During the attack, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was shot in the leg, leaving him permanently disabled. This injury gave him the nickname ‚Äúel lajo Rodr√≠guez‚Äù. On April 30, 1933, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was in S√°nchez Cerro's car when he was assassinated. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was unhurt and may have shot the assassin. When Benavides was appointed president by the Constituent Assembly, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez became his ally. Benavides promoted him to general. In 1935, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was appointed Minister of Government and Police. At that time, the Apristas,or supporters of APRA and Communists were harshly persecuted. While serving in the post, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez continued to repress them. When Benavides, with the approval of the Constituent Assembly, restored the vice-presidencies (abolished since 1920), Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rezwas appointed second vice-president of the Republic, for being the Minister of Government, while Ernesto Montagne Markholz was appointed First Vice President.  Spiritualist plot  At the time, it was rumored that Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was a Mason who also believed in astrology and spiritualism. After learning this, APRA leader V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre introduced Manuel Cenzano, a medium, into Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez's spiritual session. A secret aparista, Cenzano worked to influence Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez for the benefit of APRA. Cenzano convinced Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez that he was invoking the \\"spirit\\" of S√°nchez Cerro. According to Cenzano, the spirit wanted Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez to end the Benavides dictatorship and restore democracy. To carry out this purpose, the spirit said that he needed help from APRA As a result of this deception, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez met with Haya de la Torre. By April 1938, with a promise of support from Haya de la Torre, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez started planning a coup attempt. He enlisted the support of General Cirilo Ortega, head of the dissident groups of the Revolutionary Union, or the \\"Sanchecerista party\\".  1939 coup attempt  February 19, 1939, Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez launched his coup attempt against Benavides. It was a Carnival Sunday in which Benavides was vacationing in Pisco. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez immediately occupied the Government Palace in Lima. Before the troops gathered in the courtyard, he was proclaimed acting head of the Republic. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez immediately declared a general amnesty, called for a new Constituent Assembly and free elections. However, later that day, the Assault Battalion of the Civil Guard of Peru, under Major GC Luis Rizo Patron Lembcke, reoccupied the palace. Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez was executed by machine gun, ending the coup attempt.  Aftermath  Rodr√≠guez Ram√≠rez's coup d'√©tat reportedly failed due to a lack of support from other Army unit, important leaders or the general public. Despite their promises, the APRA failed to help him. . Soon after the coup attempt, Benavides called for general elections.

Same as bilateral filter, this image filter can also filter out noise or texture while retaining sharp edges.Guided Image Filtering Unlike the bilateral filter, the guided image filter has two advantages: first, Bilateral filters have very high computational complexity, but the guided image filter does not use too complicated mathematical calculations which has linear computational complexity. Furthermore, due to the mathematical model, bilateral filters sometimes have unwanted gradient reversal artifacts and cause image distortion. While the guided image filter, since the filter is mathematically based on linear combination, the output image must be consistent with the gradient direction of the guidance image, and the problem of gradient reversal does not occur.  Definition  One key assumption of the guided filter is that the relation between guidance I and the filtering output q is linear. Suppose that q is a linear transformation of I in a window \\\\omega_k centered at the pixel k. In order to determine the linear coefficient (a_k, b_k), constraints from the filtering input p are required. Model the output q as the input p subtract some unwanted components n, such as noise/textures. The following is the basic model of the guided image filterÔºö (1) q_i = a_k I_i + b_k, \\\\forall i \\\\in \\\\omega_k (2) q_{i} = p_{i} - n_{i} In the above formula: : q_{i} is the i_{th} output pixel; : p_i is the i_{th} input pixel; : n_{i} is the i_{th} pixel of noise components; : I_i is the i_{th} guidance image pixel; : (a_k, b_k) are some linear coefficients assumed to be constant in \\\\omega_k. The reason to define as linear combination is that the boundary of an object is related to its gradient. The local linear model ensures that q has an edge only if I has an edge, since abla q = a abla I. Subtract (1) and (2) to get formula (3)ÔºõAt the same time, define a cost function (4)Ôºö (3) n_{i} = p_{i} - a_k I_{i} - b_k (4) E(a_{k},b_{k})=\\\\sum_{i{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\omega}_{k}}^{}((a_{k}I_{i} + b_{k} - p{i})^{2} + {\\\\epsilon}a_{k}^{2}) In the above formula: : \\\\epsilon is a regularization parameter penalizing large a_{k}; : \\\\omega_{k} is a window centered at the pixel k. And the cost function's solution is given byÔºö (5) a_{k} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\omega\\\\right}\\\\sum_{i\\\\epsilon\\\\omega_{k}}I_{i}p_{i} - \\\\mu_{k}\\\\bar{p_{k}}}{\\\\sigma^{2}_{k}+\\\\epsilon} (6) b_{k} = \\\\bar{p_{k}} - a_{k}\\\\mu_{k} In the above formula: : \\\\mu_{k} and \\\\sigma^{2}_{k} are the mean and variance of I in \\\\omega_{k}; : \\\\left\\\\omega\\\\right is the number of pixels in \\\\omega_{k}; : \\\\bar{p}_{k} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left\\\\omega\\\\right}\\\\sum_{i\\\\epsilon\\\\omega_{k}}p_{i} is the mean of p in \\\\omega_{k}. After obtaining the linear coefficients (a_k, b_k), we can calculate the filtering output q_i by (1)  Algorithm  By definition, the algorithm can be written as: Algorithm 1. Guided Filter inputÔºö filtering input image p Ôºåguidance image I Ôºåwindow radius r Ôºåregularization \\\\epsilon outputÔºö filtering output q 1\\\\. mean_{I} = f_{mean}(I) mean_{p} = f_{mean}(p) corr_{I} = f_{mean}(I.*I) corr_{Ip} = f_{mean}(I.*p) 2\\\\. var_{I} = corr_{I} - mean_{I.} * mean_{I} cov_{Ip} = corr_{Ip} - mean_{I.} * mean_{p} 3\\\\. a = cov_{Ip}./(var_{I} + \\\\epsilon) b = mean_{p} - a. * mean+{I} 4\\\\. mean_{a} = f_{maean}(a) mean_{b} = f_{maean}(b) 5\\\\. q = mean_{a.} * I + mean_{b} f_{mean} is a mean filter with a wide variety of O(N) time methods.  Properties  * Edge-Preserving Filtering When the guidance image I is the same as the filtering input p. The guided filter will filter out noise in the input image while preserving clear edges. Specifically, one can define what is a ‚Äúflat patch‚Äù or a ‚Äúhigh variance patch‚Äù by the parameter \\\\epsilon of the guided filter. Those patches with variance much lower than the parameter \\\\epsilon will be smoothed, and those with variances much higher than \\\\epsilon will be preserved. The role of the range variance \\\\sigma_r^2 in the bilateral filter is similar to \\\\epsilon in the guided filter. Both of them define ‚Äúwhere are the edge/a high variance patches that should be kept. what is noise/flat patch that should be smoothed.‚Äù * Gradient-Preserving Filtering When using the bilateral filter to filter an image, some artifacts may appear on the edges. This is because the pixel value abrupt change on the edge. These artifacts are inherent and hard to avoid, because edges usually appear in all kinds of pictures. The guided filter performs better in avoiding gradient reversal. Moreover, in some cases, it can be ensured that gradient reversal does not occur. * Structure-Transferring Filtering Due to the local linear model of q = aI + b, it is possible to transfer the structure from the guidance I to the output q. This property enables some special filtering-based applications, such as feathering, matting and dehazing.

Life  Born in Zeulenroda, Schenker learned trombone and piano as a child and made his first compositional attempts at the age of 10. At the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin he studied trombone from 1961 to 1964 with Helmut Stachowiak and music composition with Eisler's student G√ºnter Kochan. During his studies he taught himself the technique of dodecaphony and played in a jazz band. After the instrumental Staatsexamen in 1964 he was employed as principal trombonist in the Rundfunk- Sinfonieorchester Leipzig until 1982. He continued his composition studies in evening classes at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig until in 1968 with Fritz Gei√üler. In 1970 he founded the Gruppe Neue Musik Hanns Eisler with the oboisten Burkhard Glaetzner and six other musicians from the Rundfunk- Sinfonieorchester and the Gewandhaus orchester in Leipzig. This special ensemble, which also included Schenker's brother, the percussionist Gerd Schenker, became the most important interpreter of contemporary chamber music of the avant-garde of the German Democratic Republic. Together with he also moved in the field of Free improvisation. As a master student of Paul Dessau at the Academy of Arts, Berlin from 1973 to 1975, Schenker received important impulses for his artistic motivation and aesthetics. His membership in the Berlin Academy of Arts from 1986 onwards was followed ten years later by admission to the S√§chsische Akademie der K√ºnste as well as the . Until 1989 he was a member of the board of the . Since 1982 Schenker has been a freelance musician and composer as well as consultant for new music at the Leipzig Gewandhaus (until 1989) and received lectureships for music composition and improvisation at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Leipzig. From 2000 to 2002 he was theatre composer at the Staatstheater Kassel. Schencker's grave Schenker died in Berlin on 8 February 2013 at the age of 70 after a serious illness. He is buried at the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery.

The combined work of two major English architects, it was designed by Capability Brown and subsequently remodelled by John Nash. It is a Grade I listed building. History The bath Corsham Court was built in 1582 by Thomas Smythe, a haberdasher and customs collector for the City of London. In 1745 the estate was bought by Paul Methuen, grandson of another wealthy cloth merchant. Dying unmarried in 1757, the house passed to his cousin, another Paul, who in 1761 employed Capability Brown to make major alterations to the court and to landscape the grounds. Brown's main focus was the reconstruction of the house, in particular the building of a picture gallery to accommodate the large number of paintings Methuen had inherited from his cousin, but during his time at Corsham, Brown undertook the construction of the bath house to the north of the court. Between 1797 and 1802, the bath house was reconstructed by John Nash, who had been employed to make further modifications to the house by Paul Cobb Methuen. Nash undertook the construction of a number of buildings in the grounds, mostly in Gothick styles, including the stables, the coach house, a cloistered dairy and a cottage by the lake. His reworking of the bath house was extensive, including the insertion of arches to the front of the building, reconstruction of the roof and renovation of the interior. Nash's remodelling saw the removal of some of Brown's earlier Gothick stonework, elements of which were incorporated into structures Nash was building elsewhere on the estate, including the Sham Ruin that stands to the front of the court. Architecture and description The Georgian era saw a heightened interest in the physical and mental benefits of cold water bathing, and those that could afford to do so constructed bath houses, or plunge pools, on their estates. The physician John Floyer, who treated a young Samuel Johnson, wrote, \\"No part of Physick is more ancient than Cold Bathing, since we find many descripts of its good effects in our oldest authors...a Cold Regimen is proper to Cold Countries\\". The Corsham bath house is of two storeys, and open to the elements on its main frontage. Nikolaus Pevsner, in his Buildings of England, described it as \\"a charming little building..in a half-Gothic, half-Elizabethan style\\". The entrance front has three Gothic arches forming an open loggia. The sunken bathing pool is on the ground floor, and a changing room is above. A passage at the rear of the bath house leads through to the Bradford Gate, a genuinely medieval porch recovered from a demolished manor house in Bradford-on-Avon and erected at Corsham in 1967. The passageway ceiling is decorated with the remnants of patterns of moss and fir cones in a rustic style, which date from Browns's original construction. The bath house is a Grade I listed building.

It runs in the Danube valley from Ingolstadt via Neuburg an der Donau, Donauw√∂rth and Dillingen an der Donau to Neuoffingen, where it joins the Augsburg‚ÄìUlm railway. The Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen railway and the Regensburg‚ÄìIngolstadt railway together form the Bavarian Danube Valley Railway (Donautalbahn).  History Thirteen towns along the Danube between G√ºnzburg and Regensburg considered that they had been neglected by the Bavarian state parliament when it came to railways. They therefore founded a railway committee in 1863 and presented it with a memorandum. A deputation travelled to Munich on 20 October 1866 to underline the need for a line to be built by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. As a result the proposal began to progress. A draft proposal was submitted to the Bavarian Landtag (Parliament) on 28 January 1868. The Landtag approved 1.595 million Gulden for the construction of this railway on 29 April 1869. A field inspection took place with the affected farmers for the first time in the spring of 1871. Numerous property negotiations had to be carried out and compensation had to be determined. Cutting at Unterhausen station For a long time it was not clear where the station in Ingolstadt would be built. This delayed the work between Weichering and Ingolstadt. Another problem was the cutting at Unterhausen, which had a length of 1.3 km and a maximum depth of 17 m. At that time, machines were rare. The excavation had to be done with picks and shovels. The farmers transported around 300,000 cubic metres of humus near Unterhausen and around one million cubic metres of earth in the Neuburg area. In addition to the construction of the line, water supply was also an important issue. A steam locomotive could not run more than 50 km without taking on water. Therefore, water cranes were established at both Neuburg and Burgheim stations. Maschinenfabrik Augsburg was responsible for building the crossing over the Lech at Rain, which required a railway bridge for the first time. Very long and high embankments were constructed so that rail operation would not be interrupted even during floods. The embankments caused significant changes to the landscape and cut the terrain into two parts. Numerous railway overpasses became necessary. The bed of the Ach river had to be moved in Weichering. The townscape in Neuburg was changed. The station was built on the road to Feldkirchen and the rail track cut the road. A new connecting road, including an underpass, were built to re-establish the connection to Feldkirchen. Railway construction boosted the demand for labour and foreign workers were hired. Some of them were considered dubious. There were repeated brawls and injuries. A police station was therefore established at the Rohrenfeld stud and the Neuburg and Burgheim police stations were strengthened. The construction of a station in Donauw√∂rth was not yet certain, so the line ended in Hamlar. It was not until the end of 1874 that work began on the Hamlar‚ÄìDonauw√∂rth section and the station was built at its current location. The first train ran tentatively from Ingolstadt to Neuburg on 20 April 1874 and the first train ran over the Lech Bridge on 28 May 1874. The first official steam train journey ran on the Ingolstadt‚ÄìDonauw√∂rth route on 15 August 1874. = Operations= The railway had plans to fuel the steam locomotives with peat. The material was obtained from the nearby Old Bavarian Donaumoos. The area of Weichering station would serve as a loading area. As a result, Weichering station was built with an exceptionally large station area, twelve km from Ingolstadt. The railway company had already signed a contract with the municipality of Obergrasheim for the purchase of 500,000 cubic metres of peat to be delivered in 1874. The first deliveries were made between 1 April and 30 June and amounted to 141,000 cubic metres. The dry pieces of peat could be a maximum of 25 cm long and 8 cm wide. However, the peat had too low a calorific value and therefore did not provide the locomotives with the required power. So this contract had to be cancelled. The company eventually switched from steam to diesel operation. The construction of the Bertoldsheim power station in 1967 allowed the electrification of the line. The 97.5 km- long Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen section was electrified on 5 May 1980 and electric operations were officially inaugurated on 24 May 1980. A passenger train in Rohrenfeld station Passenger and freight trains cross in Rohrenfeld Potato loading The line between Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof and Weichering station was completely rerouted from 1990 to 1995. The line previously ran north out of the station and ran in a loop across the city, but the line now runs south from Ingolstadt. The line initially runs with one track on each side of the Ingolstadt‚ÄìMunich railway. The Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen services run regularly on the eastern track in both directions. The western track is mainly used by trains on the Ingolstadt‚ÄìAugsburg railway, which runs together with the Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen railway to Seehof operations station. Seehof station has two tracks and various transfer options between the two lines. After leaving Seehof, the Ingolstadt‚ÄìAugsburg railway branches off and the line now continues as a single track to Weichering station, where it returns to the original route from the entry signal. The old line has been completely dismantled up to that point. On 29 May 1995, a regional train running from Ingolstadt via Weichering to Donauw√∂rth was the first train to use the new route. The carriage of freight between Ingolstadt and Donauw√∂rth was discontinued on 15 December 2002. After the takeover of the transport services by agilis and an expansion of the train service, the train crossings that used to take place almost exclusively in Unterhausen only occur there on weekends. Under the current timetable, train crossings now take place every two hours in Unterhausen and every two hours in Neuburg. There are three pairs of express trains between Ulm and Regensburg on weekdays, which do not serve all stops. Due to these additional journeys, the stations of Rain, Burgheim and Weichering are also used for scheduled train crossings. Unterhausen station is also important as a connecting point for the private freight wagon repair shop there, mainly for tank wagons. The braking distance between Weichering and Rain is reduced to 700 m, otherwise it is 1000 m. The top speed is 140 km/h. Since the timetable change on 13 December 2015 the Agilis trains have also been arriving in Ingolstadt Nord from both directions (Donauw√∂rth and Regensburg) from Monday to Friday in order to improve connections to the Audi plant. There are some express trains that are not busy. Platform 3 in Weichering station, which was dismantled in 2003, was reinstalled in 2016. This allowed freight traffic to be handled outside the Ingolstadt node. Due to the passenger level crossings to platform 1 that have existed in both Weichering and Rohrenfeld stations, crossings with freight trains has always been a cause of delay for the Agilis local trains. The reconstruction of these stations needs to take into account the increasing freight traffic. The first work on clearing the old track bed and the first survey work were carried out at Weichering station in the autumn of 2012. A new, modern and disabled- friendly platform was put into operation in Schwenningen at the timetable change on 10 December 2006. Previously, Schwenningen had a split platform that was divided by the level crossing of the connecting road to Wolpertstetten. Due to the crossing signalling, trains had to stop behind the level crossing. After the modernisation of the crossing and platform, this is no longer necessary, so that a simple platform on the eastern side of the road is now sufficient. On the Ingolstadt‚ÄìNeuoffingen section, Agilis operates through regional trains to/from Regensburg, usually every hour to G√ºnzburg. The service to Ulm usually runs hourly, using Alstom Coradia Continental multiple units. The passenger trains are scheduled to cross in Dillingen between Donauw√∂rth and G√ºnzburg. The braking distance is largely 1000 m, with the exception of the Dillingen‚ÄìH√∂chst√§dt section running towards Donauw√∂rth, where the braking distance is only 700 m. The top speed is 140 km/h. To improve traffic control and to minimise delays after operational disruptions, a new outer platform was built at platform 2 at Blindheim (traditionally known in English as Blenheim) station after a long planning phase. Access takes place directly at the level crossing of the connecting road between Blindheim and Unterglauheim, The length of the platform is 140 m and the platform height is 55 cm. The platform itself was put into operation at the timetable change of December 2012, but the reconstruction of the surroundings had not yet been completed. Platform 1, which was previously used at the old station building, was to be replaced by a new platform next to platform 2, which was also new. The community of Blindheim would have liked to have a bike&ride; facility after the actual work on the construction of the platform has been completed, with. in addition to parking spaces, a bus stop for better connections with public transport. The platform on track 2 previously used will no longer be available once the construction work has been completed. As of 2012, it was not known whether the entrance building in Blindheim, which was in very poor condition, would be preserved and modernised. The access points to the side ramp were upgraded when platform 1 in Blindheim was rebuilt in the spring of 2012. There has not been a freight customer in Blindheim for a long time. Construction of a second platform in Tapfheim on track 2 had not started as of November 2012. The municipality of Tapfheim wanted to provide preliminary support for the project. DB Station&Service; had already agreed to build the second platform at Tapfheim, provided that a necessary underpass was built by the federal government and the Free State of Bavaria. In contrast, the overpass that had been planned for more than 10 years was built between Tapfheim and Schwenningen in the summer 2012. In the Tapfheim area, a new overpass on \\"Am Wackerberg\\" was built over the railway line. The former level crossings at \\"Dettenhardter Stra√üe\\" and \\"Brachst√§dter Stra√üe\\" were closed. Several collisions between rail and road vehicles had occurred at both level crossings, several involving fatalities.

Chryssostomos Chatgilialoglu  Education and career  In 1971, Chatgilialoglu moved from Greece to Italy for university studies and began his scientific involvement at the University of Bologna where he obtained his Italian doctorate degree (Laurea) from the Faculty of Industrial Chemistry. In 1977, he moved to England for two years postdoctoral appointment at the University of York with Professor R.O.C. Norman. In the end of 1979 he moved to Canada for three years postdoctoral appointment at the National Research Council of Canada, with Professor K.U. Ingold. In 1983, he joined the National Research Council (CNR) of Italy in Bologna as Visiting Scientist becoming permanent Researcher in 1985. From 1991 he held the position of Research Director at the Institute of Organic Synthesis and Photoreactivity (ISOF) of CNR Research Area of Bologna until he retired from this position in the end of 2019, becoming Research Associate of ISOF-CNR from February 2020. From March 2014 to May 2016, Chatgilialoglu was appointed as the Director of the Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at the NCSR ‚ÄúDemokritos‚Äù in Athens (Greece) and from May 2015 he served as the vice-President of the NCSR ‚ÄúDemokritos‚Äù for one year. He is the Co-Founder and President of the company Lipinutragen Srl, which was incorporated on December 2005 as spin-off company officially recognized by the CNR. From February 2019, he has been distinguished as Visiting Professor at the Center for Advanced Technologies, Adam Mickiewicz University, Pozna≈Ñ (Poland). Dr. Chatgilialoglu is actually the leader of his research group in Bologna at ISOF-CNR. His actual research activities are focused on Free Radical Chemistry with a multidisciplinary approach including structure-reactivity-mechanism studies leading to applications in synthetic methodologies, materials science, and in life sciences.  Research and Innovation  His forty-years research activity focuses mainly on free-radical chemistry using an original multidisciplinary approach that, informed by structure-reactivity-mechanism studies, led to applications in synthetic and analytical methodologies, materials science, and in life sciences. He is known for free radical chemistry and molecular mechanisms of cellular stress and related biomarkers. His work on free radical properties and synthetic strategies has led to the discovery and development of tris(trimethylsilyl)silane as radical-based reducing agent (Fluka prize ‚ÄúReagent of the Year 1990‚Äù) a breakthrough solution to the health and environmental toxicity of chemical reagents. The start and progress of this reagent in free radical chemistry have been presented from time to time in several reviews and books. The focus on biomimetic radical chemistry have led to the discovery of the process occurring in eukaryotes that bring to the endogenous formation of trans-lipids; He has pioneered the epigenetic role of membrane fatty acids with the innovative approach of fatty acid-based membrane lipidomics, the evaluation of free radical-induced endogenous transformation of trans fatty acids and lipid remodelling in disease conditions. He developed the applicability of this scientific discovery in lipidomics to the market of molecular diagnostics by the foundation of the spin-off company Lipinutragen. He has contributed the expertise on bioinspired synthetic approaches in the area of nucleic acids has been applied to discoveries in one of the most important processes related to aging and disease: the damaging potential of hydroxyl radical (HO‚Ä¢) toward deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). He has contributed to understand the DNA damage mechanism leading to purine lesions, and developed the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù protocol for the accurate quantification of the purine lesions in DNA samples, using LC-MS/MS analysis and isotopomeric internal standards.

Life  V√∂tterle was born in Augsburg. With the intention of printing song sheets for the members of the musical youth movement, he founded the B√§renreiter-Verlag in Augsburg in 1923 (since 1927 in Kassel), which he made into one of the major music publishers worldwide. The rediscovery of Heinrich Sch√ºtz was decisive for the success of the publishing house in the first years. With the publication of the Quempas in 1930 he again stimulated new advent and Christmas musical singing customs. In Munich he became involved in the youth movement reformed Hochschulgilde Werdandi. The association magazine Der deutsche Bursch of the appeared about this contact in the youth movement- oriented B√§renreiter publishing house.Karl V√∂tterle on B√§renreiter. Early on V√∂tterle published contemporary composers like Hugo Distler, Ernst Pepping and Willy Burkhard. Promoting the music of the present has always been one of the publisher's guidelines, along with the cultivation of the masters of the past. In 1933, together with Richard Baum, he founded the Kasseler Musiktage, initially a gathering of amateur musicians, then after the war soon an event with a sharply defined content profile that attracted many interested people to Kassel. Between 1933 and 1945, as director of the B√§renreiter publishing house, he continued to publish (also contemporary) Christian music, but also published national sozialistic songs and choral works, among them an SS- Treuelied,Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933-1945, Kiel 2004, . as well as choral books with system-conform prefaces. As publisher of the Christian Sonntagsbrief in the affiliated Neuwerk publishing house V√∂tterle was expelled from the in December 1935, but shortly afterwards was taken up again under conditions.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, Kiel 2004, . The Christian newspaper, in which articles critical of the system had also appeared, was banned. In 1936 V√∂tterle joined the Reiter- Sturmabteilung, in which he last had the rank of Oberscharf√ºhrer. On application of 4 April 1937, he became a member of the NSDAP with effect from 1 May 1937 (member number 4.629.166). In September 1944 V√∂tterle was denounced by Herbert Gerigk at the Hauptamt Schrifttum in Amt Rosenberg for anthroposophical and denominational ties.Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, Kiel 2004, , source: ACDJC, Document CXLV-641. After the war V√∂tterle had to face the denazification proceedings. On 21 November 1947 a declared him exonerated and gave the following reasons in summary: \\"From all this it follows that the person concerned at the latest since 1935 has actively resisted National Socialism according to his strength out of his anti-National Socialist convictions.\\"Aktenzeichen K.-St. 131/47 After the subsequent regaining of the publisher's license, V√∂tterle and his employees, who had returned home from the war, rebuilt the destroyed publishing house with their own hands and continued the publishing work. As a consequence of the regained democracy in Germany and the international contacts that were once again possible, V√∂tterle established a network of relationships far beyond Germany as early as the 1950s. He saw the \\"Stunde der Gesamtausgabe\\" coming at this time and, in cooperation with publicly funded institutes, gradually began publishing scholarly critical collected works of Christoph Willibald Gluck. (from 1951), Georg Philipp Telemann (from 1953), Johann Sebastian Bach (from 1954), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (from 1955), George Frideric Handel (from 1955), Heinrich Sch√ºtz (from 1955), Franz Schubert (from 1964) and Hector Berlioz (from 1967). These editions, some of which have not yet been completed, are the basis of the international reputation of the B√§renreiter publishing house. Already in 1949 the first of the 17-volume encyclopedia Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG) was published. V√∂tterle continued his commitment to contemporary music. Composers like Ernst Krenek, Giselher Klebe, G√ºnter Bialas and others published their works with B√§renreiter. V√∂tterle was founder and co-founder of numerous companies, including the Neue Sch√ºtz-Gesellschaft (today \\"Internationale Heinrich-Sch√ºtz- Gesellschaft\\"), the Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikforschung, the Interessengemeinschaft musikwissenschaftlicher Herausgeber und Verleger (today ). V√∂tterle was also active beyond the field of music, for example as one of the founders of the Berneuchen Movement and the . The B√§renreiter publishing house and the affiliated Johannes-Stauda publishing house published books and writings on theology, history, Hessian regional studies, etc. He received numerous honours, including honorary doctorates from the universities of Kiel (musicology, 1953) and Leipzig (theology, also 1953).

Wara art in Japan  Traditionally, rice straw was used for making tatami mats and other objects. At the beginning of the 21st century, these objects were increasingly replaced by manmade materials, leaving rice farmers with a problem, namely what to do with the rice straw. In 2007, the farming community in Niigata prefecture, Japan, a major rice growing prefecture, asked Professor Shingo Miyajima of the Department of Science and Design at the Musashino University to find a creative solution for the problem. He suggested using the straw to create sculptures of animals supported by a wooden frame. This straw art is called in Japan, wara art, ‚Äúwara‚Äù meaning rice straw. Since 2007, there have been annual festivals of wara art in Niigata prefecture, Nishikan-ku ward. Some of the Wara Art statues have been as high as 9 metres tall, but they are usually around 4 metres in height. Wara art in York, Western Australia  Straw sculpture of the endangered numbat Wara art sculptures of endangered Australian animals, designed by Professor Miyajima, have also been created in York, Western Australia as part of the annual York Festival. There are seven statues in York. They were constructed by Australian fibre artists and Japanese wara artists brought to Australia as part of Japanese/ Australian art exchanges, assisted by many volunteers. As there is no rice straw in Western Australia, the York sculptures are made from wheat straw sourced from a York farm that still harvests in stooks.

It was released on June 27, 2017, as the lead single from his debut studio album Aromanticism through Jagjaguwar. It is the ninth track on the album. The song was written and produced by Sumney alongside Matthew Otto, a former member of the Canadian music group Majical Cloudz. Background and composition In an interview with Jon Pareles of The New York Times, Sumney called \\"Doomed\\" the \\"thesis\\" of Aromanticism in explaining why he chose the song as the album's lead single. \\"Doomed\\" is an existential reflection on mortality and love in relation to a lack of love, or aromanticism. In the chorus, Sumney ask himself: \\"Am I vital / If my heart is idle? / Am I doomed?\\" With the lyrics \\"If lovelessness is godlessness / Will you cast me to the wayside?\\", Jason King of Pitchfork described it as \\"foreclosing the possibility of finding lasting intimacy and love with a partner.\\" The track is musically minimalist, prominently featuring Sumney's \\"nearly-a cappella\\" falsetto vocals which are backed by sustained synthesizer chords. Brian Josephs of Spin wrote, \\"Sumney is luminous here within the percussion-less drones' warmth‚Äîhis falsetto angelic, his sentiments human.\\" Cyclone Wehner of Music Feeds called it an \\"existentialist operatic dirge.\\" Critical reception The track was met with favorable reviews. It was awarded \\"Best New Track\\" distinction by Pitchfork upon its release, with Briana Younger praising the \\"rawness\\" of Sumney's vocals as \\"arresting\\" and saying \\"the best qualities of his music are put into overdrive.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Sumney's \\"unearthly falsetto\\". Brian Josephs of Spin called the song \\"the album's stunner.\\" =Year-end lists= \\"Doomed\\" was listed at #36 by Pitchfork on its \\"The 100 Best Songs of 2017\\" list. The song was included at #35 on Spins \\"The 101 Best Songs of 2017\\" list. Music video The accompanying music video of \\"Doomed\\" was released the same day as the track. Directed by Allie Avital, the video features Sumney floating naked in a tank of water. Near the video's end, a woman is seen separated across from Sumney in her own tank as they stare at one another. The visual pans outward from Sumney to reveal a field of tanks with naked individuals floating within each one. The visual has been compared to the pods of The Matrix films. The music video was listed at #2 on \\"The 5 Best Videos Of The Week\\" list by Stereogum, who called it \\"a tragically resonant visual metaphor about black American isolation.\\" The music video was nominated for the Independent Video of the Year award at the 2018 AIM Independent Music Awards. Performances Sumney performed the song at St Stephen's Uniting Church in Sydney, Australia. A video of the performance was released on Sumney's YouTube channel on July 10, 2017, the same day his debut album Aromanticism was announced.

Recording and release  Rosco Gordon had originally been associated with the Beale Streeters, a loose coalition of Memphis, Tennessee musicians that also featured Johnny Ace, B.B. King, and Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, in the late 1940s. In 1951, Gordon was scouted by Ike Turner to record for the Bihari brothers at Modern Records.

The stratonautical space suit (Spanish: Escafandra Estraton√°utica) was a pressurised suit designed by Colonel Emilio Herrera in 1935 to be worn during a stratospheric flight using an open basket balloon scheduled for the following year. It is considered one of the antecedents of the space suit. The flight never took place due to the start of the Spanish Civil War. Herrera, a member of the Republican side, fled to France in 1939, where he died in exile in 1967. The suit, made of vulcanized silk, was cut and used to make raincoats for the troops. It would have been the first fully pressurized functional suit in history, although it was never worn in real conditions. The suit had a hermetic cover on the inside (tested in the bathroom of Herrera's apartment in Seville), covered with an articulated metal frame with accordion-like folds. It had articulated parts for the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, and fingers. The mobility of the suit was tested at the Cuatro Vientos experimental station, and according to Herrera it was \\"satisfactory\\". The suit was supplied with pure oxygen. Herrera designed a special carbon-free microphone to use inside the suit and avoid any possibility of spontaneous ignition. The helmet visor used three layers of glass: one unbreakable, one with an ultraviolet filter, and an opaque infrared exterior. All three layers had an anti-fog treatment. Herrera included an electric heater in the suit, but during tests in a chamber simulating high altitudes it turned out that the suit was heated to 33 ¬∞ C while the temperature of the atmosphere around it dropped to -79 ¬∞ C. Herrera soon realized that the problem with a pressurized suit in a near- vacuum environment was actually removing excess heat produced by the human body.

It was first performed on stage in 1950. Plot Sigismondo Malatesta, the 15th-century ruler of Rimini, is offered the cities Spoleto and Foligno if he gives up his own city to the troops of Pope Paul II. Malatesta is furious and goes to Rome to assassinate the Pope, but ends up accepting an honorary office in the Vatican. After falling ill, Malatesta is brought back to Rimini by his wife Isotta. Back in his home he is poisoned by the learned Porcellio and dies. Themes The play portrays the vulnerability of a man who is at once unsuspecting and immoral. The sacrilegious and immoral hero ties in with Henry de Montherlant's typically preferred protagonist. He exemplifies what Montherlant called alternance, which refers to the contrary aspects found within the same character: Malatesta is simultaneously able to kill casually and show tender human emotions, and simultaneously flirts with many women and is attached to his wife. The hero's demise ties in with Friedrich Nietzsche's writings about the superior man and his greater vulnerability when compared to the herd man, and the period setting correlates with Nietzsche's admiration for the Renaissance period. Production history The play was first performed on 19 December 1950 at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny in Paris. Jean-Louis Barrault directed the production and starred in the title role.

It is one out of 4 known red supergiants in the Westerlund 1 super star cluster, although its outlying position, spectrum, and parallax, suggest it could be a foreground giant. As a red supergiant, it would be one of the largest known stars and one of most luminous of its type.  Physical characteristics  Westerlund 1-237 compared to the other 3 RSGs (Red Supergiants) in the Westerlund 1 star cluster. Westerlund 1-237 is classified as a luminous cool supergiant emitting most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is surrounded by a radio nebula which is similar in mass to those of Westerlund 1-20 and Westerlund 1-26, and moreover directly comparable to that of VY Canis Majoris. The elliptical structure of this nebula however indicates that it has been less affected by the cluster wind of Westerlund 1 (W20 and W26 have pronounced cometary shaped nebulae). The outflow velocity for the RSG wind is assumed to be around 30 km/s. The nebula itself seems to have a mass of and a radius of about 0.11 parsecs. This results in a kinematic age around 3,600 years and a time averaged mass loss rate of per year. The star occupies the upper right corner of the Hertzsprung- Russell diagram. With an effective temperature of 3,600 K and a bolometric luminosity of , the radius of Westerlund 1-237 would be 1,233 times the solar radius (), which would corresponds to a volume 1.93 billion times bigger than the sun. If placed at the center of the Solar System, the star would engulf the orbit of Jupiter.  Distance  The distance of Westerlund 1-237 is assumed to be around or based on it being commonly thought of as a member of the Westerlund 1 star cluster (the elliptical shape of its nebula indicates that it might not be near the center of W1, while other RSGs like W20 and W26 are). Another source suggests a similar distance of . Westerlund's 1987 analysis assigned a spectral type of M6+ III to W1-237 and considered it to be a foreground giant with a luminosity only around .
