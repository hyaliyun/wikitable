Description  The badik consists of three parts, namely the handle and blade, as well as the sheath or scabbard. It comes in a great variety of shapes and sizes. The badik can have a straight, curved, bulbous or wavy, single- or double-edged blade. The blade is smooth or with hollow sections (fullered). The point of the blade can be either pointed or rounded. Like the kris, the shape of the blade is asymmetric and often shows patterns typical of pamor (pattern welding steel commonly known as Damascus steel). However, it differs from the kris in that the badik does not have a ganja (a buffer strip steel). Some versions from Sulawesi are decorated with inlaid gold figure on the blade called jeko. The handle is made of wood, horn or ivory in a shape of a pistol grip at a 45° to 90° angle or similar in a bent shape often decorated with carvings. From its native Sulawesi, the badik soon spread to neighbouring islands like Java, Borneo, Sumatra and as far as the Malay Peninsula, creating a wide variety of badik styles according to each region and ethnic group. There are many versions made and used throughout the Indonesian archipelago alone. File:Sari 3.jpg File:Knife 1a.JPG File:Knife 1b.JPG  Culture  Examples of pamor found in badik blades. As with other blades in the Malay Archipelago, traditionally- made badik are believed to be imbued with a supernatural force during the time of their forging. The pamor in particular is said to affect its owner, bringing either well-being and prosperity or misfortune and poverty. Aside from being used as a weapon and hunting tool, the badik is a symbol of cultural identity in Sulawesi. In the colonial era, it was considered a pity if a man died without his badik. As recently as the 1960s, the badik was worn as part of daily attire and badik crimes were reported regularly. The Bugis and Makassar people still carry badik on ceremonial occasions today. The badik is worn on the right side, butt end of the handle pointing to the rear; it may also be positioned at their left side providing the butt end of the handle points to the rear. When the weapon is shifted from the right to the left side, or when worn at the left, handle reversed facing forward, it is signatory of impending combat. =Duels= The traditional form of duelling among the Bugis-Makassar community was called { (in Bugis language), (in Makassarese language) or sibajji lalang lipa (among the Banyorangese community) in which the duellists fight in a sarong. The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and respectfully invites the other man to step into the sarong. The sarong itself is kept taut around both their waists. When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other with badik within the confined space of a single sarong. Because avoiding injury is near- impossible even for the victor, this type of duel was considered a sign of extraordinary bravery, masculinity and the warrior mentality. Although true sitobo lalang lipa are no longer practiced, enactments of these duels are still performed at cultural shows today. Techniques The badik is the main weapon in Bugis and Mangkasara styles of pencak silat. The Badik almost always is brought into action from the intended victim's side or rear. The Draw is made across the operator's body by slashing from left to right; the blade may be \\"feathered\\" (turned over) and another slash from the right to the left, but only if the first one fails to do the job. But it is the thrust which the Bugis and Makassarese rely most heavily upon. The blade of the Bugis badik is thinner than that of the Makassarese type. The latter therfore must be thrust with its blade flat if lethal penetration is to be achieved in rib areas; other areas of the victim's anatomy do not require this repositioning, but the Makassarese generally use the flat-blade tactic, and seek full penetration of the blade. The Bugis on the other hand, pinch the blade more often than do. The Makassarese, with the fingers just below the place where the handle joins the blade. And the thrust may be brought to penetration in a vertical or flat entry, to the depth of the pinch grip. Lethal penetration in selected vital anatomical targets can be surely made with less than 3 inches of the blade See also *Rencong *Keris  References   Further reading  * * Category:Blade weapons Category:Weapons of Indonesia ","title":"Badik"},{"id":"42791628","text":"Clemson Bros.

It includes an ensemble of accelerometers and gyroscope based on quantum technology to form an Inertial Navigation Unit.  Description  The work about quantum technology based inertial measurement units (IMUs), the instruments containing the gyroscopes and accelerometers follows from the early demonstrations of matter-wave based accelerometers and gyrometers. The first demonstration of onboard acceleration measurement was made on an Airbus A300 in 2011. A quantum compass contains clouds of atoms frozen using lasers. By measuring the movement of these frozen particles over precise periods of time the motion of the device can be calculated. The device would then provide a tamper proof accurate position in circumstances where satellites are not available for satellite navigation, e.g. a fully submerged submarine.

Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai Party came to power in 2001 and became very popular among the electorate, especially rural voters. Opponents, however, criticized his authoritarian style and accused him of corruption. Thaksin was deposed in a coup d'état in 2006, and Thailand became embroiled in continuing rounds of political crisis involving elections won by Thaksin's supporters, massive anti-government protests by multiple factions, removals of prime ministers and disbanding of political parties by the judiciary, and two military coups. Thaksin was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, when he was ousted by a coup following protests by the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD, \\"Yellow Shirts\\"). However, his supporters were brought back to power in a new election following the enactment of new constitution in 2007. The PAD protested against the government through most of 2008, and the ruling party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court. The opposition Democrat Party, led by Abhisit Vejjajiva, formed a government, but also faced protests by the opposing Red Shirt movement led by the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship. This led to a violent military crackdown in May 2010. Another Thaksin-aligned party won the election in 2011, installing his sister Yingluck Shinawatra as prime minister. Renewed anti-government protests began in November 2013, and continued until the military again staged a coup in May 2014. Coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha took power as prime minister, and oversaw systemic suppression of political freedom before finally allowing elections in 2019 under a pro-military constitution, which reinstalled Prayut as prime minister. The conflicts have sharply divided popular opinion in Thailand. Even in exile, Thaksin still commanded strong support, especially among the rural population of the North and Northeast, who widely benefited from his policies and formed the majority of the electorate. They were joined, especially after the 2006 coup, by liberal academics and activists, who opposed his opponents' pushes to achieve a non-elected government. On the other hand, Thaksin's opponents consisted of much of Bangkok's urban middle class and the Southern population (a traditional Democrat stronghold), professionals and academics, as well as members of the \\"old elite\\" who wielded political influence before Thaksin came to power. They claim that Thaksin abused his power and undermined democratic processes and institutional checks and balances, monopolizing power and using populist policies to secure his political standing. While Thaksin's opponents claim that elections which resulted in victories for his allies were not truly democratic because of such interference, his supporters have also accused the courts, which brought down multiple Thaksin-aligned governments, of engaging in judicial activism. Thaksin's influence began to wane following the 2019 election, which separately saw the rise of a progressive youth- oriented movement directed against military interference in politics. These events took place as the country approached the end of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's reign. The King, who had reigned for 70 years, died in October 2016 after several years of deteriorating health during which he appeared less and less frequently in public. Bhumibol had long been regarded as a uniting figure and guiding moral authority for the country, and commanded a great amount of respect, unlike his successor Maha Vajiralongkorn. The uncertainties surrounding the impending royal succession compounded the political instability. Many anti-Thaksin groups claimed to be loyal to Bhumibol, accusing their opponents of bearing republican sentiments. Prosecutions under the lèse-majesté law sharply increased after 2006, in what has been criticized as politicization of the law at the expense of human rights. Meanwhile, the long-standing separatist movement in the deep South has significantly worsened since 2004, with almost 7,000 having been killed in the conflict. Economically, the country made its recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and became an upper-middle income economy in 2011, though it was affected by the Great Recession and GDP growth has slowed from the early 2000s. The multiple political crises and coups had little impact on the Thai economy individually, and the country quickly recovered from major disasters including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and widespread flooding in 2011. However, inequality remains high, contributing to the urban–rural divide and potentially fuelling further social and political conflict. The future of the country remains unclear as the 2017 constitution, drafted under junta, paved the way for further military intervention in politics, amidst concerns regarding the return to democratic rule and the changing role of the monarchy under a new reign. Politics =Premiership of Thaksin Shinawatra= Thaksin in 2005 Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai Party came to power through a general election in 2001, where it won a near-majority in the House of Representatives. As prime minister, Thaksin launched a platform of policies, popularly dubbed \\"Thaksinomics\\", which focused on promoting domestic consumption and providing capital especially to the rural populace. By delivering on electoral promises, including populist policies such as the One Tambon One Product project and the 30-baht universal healthcare scheme, his government enjoyed high approval, especially as the economy recovered from the effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Thaksin became the first democratically elected prime minister to complete a four-year term in office, and Thai Rak Thai won a landslide victory in the 2005 general election.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 262–5 However, Thaksin's rule was also marked by controversy. He had adopted an authoritarian \\"CEO-style\\" approach in governing, centralising power and increasing intervention in the bureaucracy's operations. While the 1997 constitution had provided for greater government stability, Thaksin also used his influence to neutralise the independent bodies designed to serve as checks and balances against the government. He threatened critics and manipulated the media into carrying only positive commentary. Human rights in general deteriorated, with a \\"war on drugs\\" resulting in over 2,000 extrajudicial killings. Thaksin responded to the South Thailand insurgency with a highly confrontational approach, resulting in marked increases in violence.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 263–8 Public opposition to Thaksin's government gained much momentum in January 2006, sparked by the sale of Thaksin's family's holdings in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. A group known as the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), led by media tycoon Sondhi Limthongkul, began holding regular mass rallies, accusing Thaksin of corruption. As the country slid into a state of political crisis, Thaksin dissolved the House of Representatives, and a general election was held in April. However, opposition parties, led by the Democrat Party, boycotted the election. The PAD continued its protests, and although Thai Rak Thai won the election, the results were nullified by the Constitutional Court due to a change in arrangement of voting booths. A new election was scheduled for October, and Thaksin continued to serve as head of the caretaker government as the country celebrated King Bhumibol's diamond jubilee on 9 June 2006.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 269–70 =2006 coup d'état= Supporters gathered to greet soldiers as tanks rolled into Bangkok. On 19 September 2006, the Royal Thai Army under General Sonthi Boonyaratglin staged a bloodless coup d'état and overthrew the caretaker government. The coup was widely welcomed by the anti-Thaksin protesters, and the PAD dissolved itself. The coup leaders established a military junta called the Council for Democratic Reform, later known as the Council for National Security. It annulled the 1997 constitution, promulgated an interim constitution and appointed an interim government with former army commander General Surayud Chulanont as prime minister. It also appointed a National Legislative Assembly to serve the functions of parliament and a Constitution Drafting Assembly to create a new constitution. The new constitution was promulgated in August 2007 following a referendum.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 270–2 As the new constitution came into effect, a general election was held in December 2007. Thai Rak Thai and two coalition parties had earlier been dissolved as a result of a ruling in May by the junta-appointed Constitutional Tribunal, which found them guilty of election fraud, and their party executives were barred from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai's former members regrouped and contested the election as the People's Power Party (PPP), with veteran politician Samak Sundaravej as party leader. The PPP courted the votes of Thaksin's supporters, won the election with a near-majority, and formed government with Samak as prime minister. =2008 political crisis= PAD protesters occupied the Government House in August 2008. Samak's government actively sought to amend the 2007 Constitution, and as a result the PAD regrouped in May 2008 to stage further anti-government demonstrations. The PAD accused the government of trying to grant amnesty to Thaksin, who was facing corruption charges. It also raised issues with the government's support of Cambodia's submission of Preah Vihear Temple for World Heritage Site status. This led to an inflammation of the border dispute with Cambodia, which later resulted in multiple casualties. In August, the PAD escalated its protest and invaded and occupied the Government House, forcing government officials to relocate to temporary offices and returning the country to a state of political crisis. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court found Samak guilty of conflict of interest due to his working for a cooking TV programme, terminating his premiership in September. Parliament then chose PPP deputy leader Somchai Wongsawat to be the new prime minister. Somchai is a brother-in-law of Thaksin's, and the PAD rejected his selection and continued its protests.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 272–3 Living in exile since the coup, Thaksin returned to Thailand only in February 2008 after the PPP had come to power. In August, however, amid the PAD protests and his and his wife's court trials, Thaksin and his wife Potjaman jumped bail and applied for asylum in the United Kingdom, which was denied. He was later found guilty of abuse of power in helping Potjaman buy land on Ratchadaphisek Road, and in October was sentenced in absentia by the Supreme Court to two years in prison. The PAD further escalated its protest in November, forcing the closure of both of Bangkok's international airports. Shortly after, on 2 December, the Constitutional Court dissolved the PPP and two other coalition parties for electoral fraud, ending Somchai's premiership. The opposition Democrat Party then formed a new coalition government, with Abhisit Vejjajiva as prime minister. =Abhisit government and 2010 protests= Abhisit presided over a six-party coalition government, which was formed through the support of Newin Chidchob and his Friends of Newin Group, who had broken away from the previous PPP-led coalition. By then, Thailand's economy was feeling the effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing Great Recession. Abhisit responded to the crisis with various stimulus programmes, while also expanding on some of the populist policies initiated by Thaksin. Relatively early in Abhisit's premiership, the pro-Thaksin group the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) began staging anti- government protests. The UDD, also known as the \\"Red Shirts\\" in contrast with the PAD's yellow, was formed following the 2006 coup and had previously protested against the military government and staged counter-rallies against the PAD in 2008. In April 2009, the UDD staged protests in Pattaya, where they disrupted the fourth East Asia Summit, and also in Bangkok, leading to clashes with government forces.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 274–5 Smoke rising throughout central Bangkok as fires were set amid the May 2010 military crackdown The UDD suspended most of their political activities throughout the rest of the year, but regathered in March 2010 to call for new elections. The protesters later occupied a large area of Bangkok's central shopping district, blocking off areas from Ratchaprasong Intersection to Lumphini Park. Violent attacks, both against protesters and government units, escalated as the situation dragged on, while negotiations between the government and the protest leaders repeatedly failed. Around mid-May, in an attempt to remove the protesters, military forces performed a crackdown on the protest, leading to violent confrontations and over ninety deaths. Arson attacks erupted around the protest site as well as several provincial centres, but the government soon took control of the situation. The protesters dispersed as UDD leaders surrendered.Baker & Phongpaichit 2014, pp. 275–7 =Yingluck government and 2013–2014 crisis= Demonstrations at the Democracy Monument, during the early stages of the protest in November Abhisit dissolved the House of Representatives the following year, and a general election was held on 3 July 2011. It was won by the Thaksin-aligned Pheu Thai Party (created to replace the PPP in 2008), and Yingluck Shinawatra, a younger sister of Thaksin's, became Prime Minister. Although the government initially struggled in its response to the widespread flooding in 2011, the political scene remained mostly calm throughout 2012 and early 2013. Continuing on the populist platform, Yingluck's government delivered on election promises, including a controversial rice-pledging scheme, which was later found to have lost the government hundreds of billions of baht. However, it was the government's push to pass an amnesty bill and amend the constitution in 2013 that sparked public outcry. Protesters, whose leadership would later call itself the People's Democratic Reform Committee, demonstrated against the bill, which they perceived as being created to grant amnesty to Thaksin. Although the bill was voted down by the Senate, the protests turned towards an anti-government agenda, and the protesters moved to occupy several government offices, as well as the central shopping district, in a bid to create a \\"People's Council\\" to oversee reforms and remove Thaksin's political influence. Yingluck responded to the protests by dissolving the House of Representatives, and a general election was held on 2 February 2014. The protesters moved to obstruct the election, forcing voting to be postponed at some polling stations. This later became the basis of the Constitutional Court's annulment of the election, since according to the constitution, it had to take place in one day. This left the country still without a working government, amid increasing violent attacks by unnamed factions. As the political stalemate continued, the Constitutional Court on 7 May ruled on a case concerning the transfer of Thawil Pliensri from his post as Secretary-general of the National Security Council back in 2011. It found that this was done with conflict of interest, and ruled that Yingluck be removed from her role as caretaker prime minister, along with nine other cabinet members. Deputy Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan was chosen to replace Yingluck as caretaker prime minister. =2014 coup d'état= Prayut in 2016 Amid the ongoing political crisis, the Royal Thai Army under Commander General Prayut Chan-o-cha declared martial law on 20 May 2014, citing the need to suppress violence and maintain peace and order. Talks were held between leaders of various factions, but after these failed, Prayut took power in a coup d'état on 22 May. The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) was established as the ruling junta, and the constitution was again repealed. In contrast to the 2006 coup, the NCPO oversaw a more systemic suppression of opposition. Politicians and activists, as well as academics and journalists, were summoned; some were detained for \\"attitude adjustment\\". An interim constitution was eventually promulgated on 22 July, followed by the creation of an appointed National Legislative Assembly, and the appointment of Prayut as prime minister on 25 August. Despite promising a road map for the return to democracy, the junta exercised considerable authoritarian power; political activities, especially criticism of the military, were banned, and the lèse-majesté law was even more heavily enforced than before. After several drafts, a new constitution was passed in a referendum on 7 August 2016. It contained many provisions that allowed the military to assert its influence in politics. After repeated postponements, elections took place on 24 March 2019. =2019 parliament and 2020 protests= Several new parties emerged to contest the 2019 election, including the pro- Prayut Palang Pracharath Party, and the liberal, anti-junta Future Forward Party led by multimillionaire businessman Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. The constitution's provision that also included the junta-appointed Senate in the parliamentary vote for prime minister led to the Palang Pracharath–led coalition successfully installing Prayut as prime minister in June. Meanwhile, Future Forward, which had found success mobilizing support from young people and became the most vocal among the opposition, found itself the target of technicality-based petitions, and the Constitutional Court ruled in February 2020 that a loan the party received from Thanathorn was illegal, dissolving the party. The ruling was met by student protests in university campuses all over the country, which subsided due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see , below). The protests resumed in July and developed into a sustained movement against the military-dominated government and human rights violations, with several large demonstrations, some of which also included public criticisms of the monarchy. Several protest groups emerged, most prominently the Free People group, who demanded the resignation of the cabinet, dissolution of parliament, and drafting of a new constitution. Death of King Bhumibol People queuing to pay their last respects at the Grand Palace in January 2017 Throughout most of the 2010s, King Bhumibol Adulyadej underwent a period of deteriorating health, being repeatedly hospitalized and making few public appearances. The King died on 13 October 2016, prompting an outpouring of grief among the people and a year of national mourning. The King had reigned since 1946, and was regarded as a moral authority and a pillar of stability for the nation. He was succeeded by his son Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who, in a break with tradition, delayed his formal accession until 1 December 2016. King Bhumibol's royal cremation ceremony was held on 26 October 2017, with over 19 million people attending sandalwood flower-laying ceremonies throughout the country. Conflicts In the three southernmost Muslim-majority provinces, a long-standing separatist movement flared up in 2004, during Thaksin's premiership. Thaksin's heavy-handed responses escalated the violence, which entailed frequent bombings and attacks on security forces as well as civilians. Almost 7,000 people are estimated to have died. The government held peace talks in 2013, which were unsuccessful. Though the violence has declined since its peak in 2010, sporadic attacks still occur, with little sign of resolution. Thailand has also seen several terrorist attacks outside of the South, the most significant being a bombing in Bangkok in 2015, which killed 20 and injured over 120. The bombing is suspected to be the work of Uyghur nationalists retaliating against Thailand's earlier repatriation of Uyghur asylum-seekers to China, though the case has not been conclusively settled. Other (unrelated) attacks have also occurred in Bangkok in 2006 and 2012. Disasters The 2011 floods caused extensive damage to the manufacturing industry. Thailand saw some of its worst natural disasters during this period. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami caused over 5,000 deaths, while the 2011 floods resulted in economic losses estimated at 1.43 trillion baht (US$46 billion). Thailand was one of the first countries affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While it was relatively successful in containing the virus, its tourism-dependent economy was badly affected. Economy and society Thailand made its recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, completing repayment of loans from the IMF in 2003. The World Bank re-classified Thailand as an upper-middle income economy in 2011. However, the level of economic disparity remains high, even as absolute poverty levels have continued to decline. A number of government policies have successfully provided a social safety net for the large majority of the population, including a universal healthcare system and free access to primary and secondary education. The successes of Thaksin's policies have coincided with an increased political awareness among the rural populace, who benefited from them. Following Thaksin's removal, they took on an active political role, and became competing forces with the urban middle class in the subsequent political crises. Thai society has thus become highly polarized along political lines, which for the most part reflected the socioeconomic divide. While military rule since the 2014 coup has for the most part suppressed overt conflict, there is uncertainty over the expected eventual return to democratic rule.

Properties A red giant ranging between spectral types M4e and M6e and with a surface temperature of 3300 K, it is a long period Mira variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15. These are highly evolved ageing stars that are on the asymptotic giant branch, their wide range in magnitude making them ideal targets for monitoring by amateur star observers. T Ursae Minoris has been monitored closely since 1905. Up until 1979, its brightness had varied over a period of 310 to 315 days. However, from 1979 its period decreased suddenly to 274 days, and appeared to be decreasing by 2.75 days a cycle since. Variable star observers Janet Mattei and Grant Foster proposed that the star had just undergone a shell helium flash - a point at which \\"the helium shell around the dense core of the star reaches a critical mass and ignites\\", which \\"influences the star's pulsation via changes in surface luminosity and radius\\". By mid 2008, its period had decreased to 230 days (thus removing it by definition from the class of Mira variables), before changing to pulsation as a semiregular variable star, with a dominant period of 113.6 days. This has been the most dramatic change of any Mira variable. The lack of technetium in its spectrum indicates it is not as advanced in age as some other Mira-type stars, as it has either not yet dredged up this sort of material from its core or is of insufficient mass for this to occur.

Vitrimers consist of molecular, covalent networks, which can change their topology by thermally activated bond-exchange reactions. At high temperatures they can flow like viscoelastic liquids, at low temperatures the bond-exchange reactions are immeasurably slow (frozen) and the Vitrimers behave like classical thermosets at this point. Vitrimers are strong glass formers. Their behavior opens new possibilities in the application of thermosets like as a self-healing material or simple processibility in a wide temperature range. Vitrimers were first discovered and termed as such in the early 2010s by French researcher Ludwik Leibler, from the CNRS. Besides epoxy resins based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, other polymer networks have been used to produce vitrimers, such as aromatic polyesters, polylactic acid (polylactide), polyhydroxyurethanes, epoxidized soybean oil with citric acid and polybutadiene. Background and significance Thermoplastics are easy to process, but corrode easily by chemicals and mechanical stress, while the opposite is true of thermosets. These differences arise from how the polymer chains are held together. Historically, thermoset polymer systems that were processable by virtue of topology changes within the covalent networks as mediated by bond exchange reactions were also developed by James Economy’s group at UIUC in the 1990s including consolidation of thermoset composite laminae. As well, the Economy group conducted studies employing secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on deuterated and undeuterated fully cured vitrimer layers to discriminate the length scales (<50 nm) for physical interdiffusion between vitrimers constituent atoms – providing evidence towards eliminating physical interdiffusion of the polymer chains as the governing mechanism for bonding between vitrimer layers. Thermoplastics are made of covalent bond molecule chains, which are held together by weak interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces). The weak intermolecular interactions lead to easy processing by melting (or in some cases also from solution), but also make the polymer susceptible to solvents creep under constant load. Thermoplastics can be deformed reversibly above their glass-transition temperature or their crystalline melting point and be processed by extrusion, injection molding, and welding. Thermosets, on the other hand, are made of molecular chains which are interconnected by covalent bonds to form a stable network. Thus, they have outstanding mechanical properties and thermal and chemical resistance. They are an indispensable part of structural components in automotive and aircraft industries. Due to their irreversible linking by covalent bonds, molding is not possible once the polymerization is completed. Therefore, they must be polymerized in the desired shape, which is time-consuming, restricts the shape and is responsible for their high price. Given this, if the chains can be held together with reversible, strong covalent bonds, the resultant polymer would have the advantages of both thermoplastics and thermosets, including high processability, repairability, and performance. Vitrimers combine the desirable properties of both classes: they have the mechanical and thermal properties of thermosets and can be also molded under the influence of heat. Vitrimers can be welded like silicon glasses or metals. Welding by simple heating allows the creation of complex objects. Vitrimers could thus be a new and promising class of materials with many uses. The term vitrimer was created by the French researcher Ludwik Leibler, head of laboratory at CNRS, France's national research institute. In 2011, Leibler and co-workers developed silica- like networks using the well-established transesterification reaction of epoxy and fatty dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids. The synthesized networks have both hydroxyl and ester groups, which undergo exchange reactions (transesterifications) at high temperatures, resulting in the ability of stress relaxation and malleability of the material. On the other hand, the exchange reactions are suppressed to a great extent when the networks are cooled down, leading to a behavior like a soft solid. This whole process is based only on exchange reactions, which is the main difference from that of thermoplastics. Functional principle =Glass and glass former= If the melt of an (organic) amorphous polymer is cooled down, it solidifies at the glass-transition temperature Tg. On cooling, the hardness of the polymer increases in the neighborhood of Tg by several orders of magnitude. This hardening follows the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation, not the Arrhenius equation. Organic polymers are thus called fragile glass formers. Silicon glass (e.g., window glass), is in contrast labelled as a strong glass former. Its viscosity changes only very slowly in the vicinity of the glass-transition point Tg and follows the Arrhenius law. This is what permits glassblowing. If one would try to shape an organic polymer in the same manner as glass, it would at first firmly and fully liquefy very slightly above Tg. For a theoretical glassblowing of organic polymers, the temperature must be controlled very precisely. Until 2010, no organic strong glass formers were known. Strong glass formers can be shaped in the same way as glass (silicon dioxide) can be. Vitrimers are the first such material discovered, which can behave like viscoelastic fluid at high temperatures. Unlike classical polymer melts, whose flow properties are largely dependent on friction between monomers, vitrimers become a viscoelastic fluid because of exchange reactions at high temperatures as well as monomer friction. These two processes have different activation energies, resulting in a wide range of viscosity variation. Moreover, because the exchange reactions follow Arrhenius' Law, the change of viscosity of vitrimers also follows an Arrhenius relationship with the increase of temperature, differing greatly from conventional organic polymers. =Effect of transesterification and temperature influence= The research group led by Ludwik Leibler demonstrated the operating principle of vitrimers at the example of epoxy thermosets. Epoxy thermosets can be represented as vitrimers, when transesterification reactions can be introduced and controlled. In the studied system as hardeners must be used carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid anhydrides. A topology change is possible by transesterification reactions. These transesterification reactions do not affect the number of links or the (average) functionality of the polymer, which means that neither the decomposition of polymer linkages nor the decrease of integrity of polymers happens when transesterification reactions take place. By that the polymer can flow like a viscoelastic liquid at high temperatures. When the temperature is lowered, the transesterification reactions are slowed down, until they finally freeze (be immeasurably slow). Below this point vitrimers behave like normal, classical thermosets. The shown case-study polymers did offered an elastic modulus of 1 MPa to 100 MPa, depending on the bonding network density. The concentration of ester groups in vitrimers is shown to have a huge influence on the rate of transesterification reactions. In the work done by Hillmyer, et al., about polyactide vitrimers, they demonstrated that the more ester groups present in the polymer, the faster the rates of relaxation will be, leading to better self-healing performance. Polyactide vitrimers which are synthesized by cross linking reactions of hydroxylterminated 4-arm star-shaped poly((±)-lactide) (HTSPLA) and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) with the presence of cross-linking and transesterification catalyst stannous(II) octoate [Sn(Oct)2], have many more ester groups than all previous vitrimers; therefore, this material has a significantly high stress relaxing rate compared to other polyester based vitrimer systems. Applications There are many uses imaginable on this basis. A surfboard of vitrimers could be brought into a new shape, scratches on a car body could be cured and cross-linked plastic or synthetic rubber items could be welded. Vitrimers which are prepared from metathesis of dioxaborolanes with different polymers that are commercially available, can have both good processibility and outstanding performance such as mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance. The polymers that can be utilized in such methodology range from poly(methylmethacrylate), polystyrene, to polyethylene with high density and cross-linked robust structures, which makes this preparative method of vitrimers able to be applied to a wide range of industries. Recent NASA-funded work on reversible adhesives for in-space assembly has used a high performance vitrimer system called aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP) as the basis for coatings and composites reversibly bondable in the solid state – providing new possibilities for the assembly of large, complex structures for space exploration and development.

Organization Henry L. Cake, who had commanded the 25th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, had received authority from the U.S. War Department, on the 13th of August, 1861, to raise a regiment for three years; and establishing a camp at Lawton's Hill, overlooking the town of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, at once commencing the work of recruiting with many of the officers and men of his old command entering the new. The National Light Infantry of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, a militia company of over thirty years' standing, was the first organized body of men in the United States to offer its services to the government at the outbreak of the rebellion. Having been accepted, it was one of the first five companies from Pennsylvania to reach the menaced capital, and afterwards became a part of the 25th Pennsylvania Infantry in the three months' service. Afterwards it formed the nucleus of the 96th Regiment, and recruited and re-organized under its former Second Lieutenant, Lewis J. Martin, was the first to report in camp. With the exception of companies C, E, G and H, in which were some men from Luzerne, Berks, Dauphin, and Montgomery counties, the regiment was recruited in Schuylkill County. On the 23rd of September the command was mustered into the United States service with the following field officers: Henry L. Cake, Colonel; Jacob G. Frick, Lieutenant Colonel; Lewis J. Martin, Major.Bates, Samuel P. History of the Pennsylvania Regiments, p. 1861-1865. A week later, a company under William H. Lessig, organized as a light battery, to be attached to the regiment, came into camp. Subsequently, Company C, Captain Beaton Smith, was, by order of the Governor, transferred to the Fifty- second Regiment, when Lessig's Good Intent Light Artillery was substituted as infantry in its place. On the 6th of November, Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin and staff visited Pottsville, and presented, with appropriate ceremonies, the State colors. History On the 8th of November the regiment moved by rail to Washington, and upon its arrival went into camp at Kendall Green, where it was armed with Harper's Ferry muskets. Colonel Cake promptly reported to General Casey, and was at once placed in command of the First Provisional Brigade, of which the Ninety-sixth formed part. The regiment was here thoroughly drilled in the manual, company, and battalion exercises. On the 25th it crossed the Potomac, and encamped on the Leesburg Pike, a short distance beyond Fort Ellsworth. It was assigned to Slocum's Brigade of Franklin's Division, and on the 27th of December went into permanent winter-quarters on the Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad, near its crossing of Four Mile Run. It remained engaged in drill and occasional picket duty until the 10th of March 1862, when it joined in the abortive movement upon Manassas, but soon returned to camp. On the 4th of April, with McDowell's Corps, it took up the line of march for Fredericksburg. On reaching Catlett's Station it went into camp, and remained until the 12th, when Franklin's Division returned to Alexandria, and embarked for the Peninsula. McClellan was now engaged in the siege of Yorktown, and on the 23rd, the division having arrived, a part of it debarked n the vicinity of Cheeseman's Creek. The enemy having evacuated Yorktown on the 4th of May, the troops on shore again embarked, and proceeding up the York River, on the 6th, in company with the divisions of Sedgwick, Porter, and Richardson, arrived at four P.M. at Brick House Point, below West Point, where the Twenty-seventh New York, and companies A, B, C and D, of the Ninety-sixth debarked, and forming in line of battle, with skirmishers thrown out, advanced for the protection of the pioneers engaged in slashing timber and obstructing the roads. \\"At nine o'clock on the following morning the order was given for the Sixteenth, Thirty-first, and Thirty-second New York, and the Ninety-fifth and Ninety- sixth Pennsylvania regiments to advance into the woods and drive off some of the rebel scouts who were firing occasional shots at our pickets, supposed to be supported by a force concealed in the woods. This proved correct; for no sooner had our men made an advance into the woods than they were received with a volley of musketry from the rebels who were hidden in the dense undergrowth. Our men pressed on and gave them a volley, after which the enemy retreated further into the woods, with the Thirty-second New York close at their heels; but they were too swift footed for our boys-being more protected-and they soon left the Thirty-second struggling in the mud.\\" The Ninety-sixth was now held upon the extreme left of the line, nearest to Brick House Point, to prevent a flank movement of the enemy in that direction, while the fighting on the right center, where his forces were concealed in a dense swamp, was animated, the Thirty-first and Thirty-second New York, and the Ninety-fifth Pennsylvania sustaining considerable loss. After the engagement at West Point, the Fifth and Sixth Provisional corps were organized, to the latter of which General Franklin was assigned, General Slocum being promoted to the command of the division, and Colonel Bartlett, of the Twenty-seventh New York, to that of the brigade. On the 25th the division moved past Gaines' Mill, and went into camp in the vicinity of Hogan's House, just beyond. A few days later the brigade moved up to Mechanicsville, where it remained doing picket duty along the Chickahominy until the 6th of June, when it returned to its former position at the Hogan House. On the 18th the division was relieved by the Pennsylvania Reserves, and crossing the Chickahominy at Woodbury Bridge, took position on the right bank, between Smith's Division, which had the right, and Sumner's Corps the left. Here the brigade remained engaged in arduous picket and fatigue duty until the opening of the Seven Days' Battles. On the evening of that day, the 26th, a detail of three hundred and fifty men of the Ninety- sixth, with a like detail of the Seventh Maine, under Lieutenant Colonel Jacob G. Frick, advanced to the front in the direction of Old Tavern, and under cover of darkness, threw up a redoubt in close proximity to the enemy's lines. At early dawn it retired unassailed, leaving the relief to fight during the day, what was known as the battle of Golden's Farm. Returning to camp near Strong Courtney's House, it re-joined the brigade, and with the entire division moved to a position on the right of Smith's Division, between Lewis' Hill and Chickahominy, the right resting near Duane Bridge, opposite the left of the Gaines' Mill battle-field. Here it remained until two o'clock, when Porter's forces being hard pressed in the battle, under orders, Newton's, then Taylor's Jersey Brigade, and shortly after Bartlett's, marched to his support, crossing the Chickahominy by the Woodbury Bridge. Previous to starting, a detail from the Ninety-sixth, with one from the Third Vermont, under Adjutant M. E. Richards, destroyed Duane Bridge. At twenty minutes past three the brigade reached the scene of action on the left of the line, moved past General St. George Cooke's Cavalry, occupying a sheltered position to the rear and left of Adams' House, and was immediately afterwards ordered to the relief of Sykes' command, which was engaged in supporting Weed's, Edwards', and Tidball's batteries, the latter on the extreme right of the position. The arrival of the brigade was opportune. The Fifth and Tenth New York, on the left of Sykes, driven back, had been re-placed by the First Pennsylvania Reserve, which in turn was relieved by a part of Newton's Brigade. The Regulars, hard pressed, were wavering. Instantly the Fifth Maine, then the Twenty-seventh New York, the Sixteenth New York, and shortly after the Ninety- sixth Pennsylvania, advanced across the field under a heavy fire, and took position along the crest of the hill, from the left of Griffin's-then supported by Newton's men-to the rear of Tidball's Battery. The Ninety-sixth was at first held in support, closed in mass in the open valley below, where it was fearfully exposed. To shield his men and save them from the destruction to which they seemed almost inevitably condemned, Colonel Cake moved them close up on the side of the hill. The Sixteenth New York, which was ordered to advance, soon came under a fearful enfilading fire, and was driven in some confusion. The Ninety-sixth, which had in the meantime been deployed in line, was brought to confront the enemy's line, and the word given to advance. It was answered with a cheer, and as by one impulse, the line dashed forward; re- took the lost ground, and held it until night. The boldness of this charge undoubtedly saved the right of the army from disaster. The loss of the brigade in this engagement was severe, that of the Ninety-sixth was thirteen killed, fifty-nine wounded, and fourteen missing. Lieutenant Ernest T. Ellrich was among the killed. Retiring to its old camp beyond Woodbury Bridge, the brigade rested for the night, and on the following morning was moved to Fort Davidson, to the right of the line. Scarcely had it got into position, when the enemy opened a heavy artillery fire from the vicinity of Dr. Gaines' House, on the opposite bluff of the Chickahominy, rendering the position untenable, and obliging it to retire, when, with the entire army, it about faced, and commenced the march for the James. After crossing White Oak Creek, it was posted to defend the passage, and in the battle of Charles City Cross Roads occupied a position to the right of the line, in the vicinity of Glendale. During the night of the 30th, it retired to Malvern Hill, where, during the terrific fighting of the 1st of July, it was posted on the extreme left of the field, near Carter's Mill, and Colonel Cake was placed in command of the brigade. Retiring with the army to Harrison's Landing, on the morning of the 3rd of July, the regiment pitched tents on the muddy plains of Westover Landing. From this it moved out on the Westover Road, and after two successive changes of camps, on the 15th moved with the brigade into the breastworks looking towards Malvern Hill, where it remained employed in picket and fatigue duty until the evacuation. While here the regiment received Enfield rifles in exchange for the Austrian muskets with which it had made the campaign. The Pottsville Cornet Band, which had been attached to the regiment from its organization, was by a general order of the War Department relieved from further duty, and returned home. On the 29th Lieutenant Colonel Frick resigned, to take command of the One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania, Captain Joseph Anthony of company F, to be Major of the same regiment, and Lieutenant Z. P. Boyer of company D, to be Lieutenant Colonel of the One Hundred and Seventy-third Regiment. On the 16th of August the brigade moved from camp on the James and taking transports at Newport News, arrived at Alexandria on the 24th, and went into bivouac along the Little River Turnpike, below Fort Ellsworth. On the 27th it moved into Fort Lyons, but was relieved on the 29th, and followed the rest of the corps, joining it at Annandale. On the 30th the corps pushed forward through Fairfax and Centreville, crossed Cub Run, and arrived in time to join in stemming the tide of disaster, which was sweeping the Bull Run battlefield. Officers of the 96th Pennsylvania Infantry at Camp Northumberland, Col. Cake being right of the Agar gun Returning to Alexandria, the regiment joined in the Maryland campaign, which was immediately after inaugurated. The army moved for the crossing of the South Mountain, by Crampton's and Turner's passes. Each held by strong bodies of the enemy. Franklin's Corps arrived in front of Crampton's Gap, which debouches into Pleasant Valley in the rear of, and but five miles from Maryland Heights, opposite Harper's Ferry, at noon of the 14th of September. The Ninety-sixth in advance of the column, entered Burkettsville early in the morning, driving out the rebel skirmishers, and drew the fire of his artillery upon the mountain developing his line of defense. Immediately forming with Slocum on the right, his line being composed of Bartlett's and Torbert's brigades, supported by Newton's, with Smith disposed for the protection of Slocum's flank, Franklin attacked. The pass was held by Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws' Division of the rebel army, under General Cobb, the position an excellent one for defense. The brigade was formed on the right of the line, and advanced to within a thousand yards of a stone wall, where the enemy was making a final stand. The Ninety- sixth, which had been engaged upon the left of the line, now came up, and the other regiments of the brigade, with ammunition exhausted, falling back, advanced upon the concealed foe, in line with Torbert's Brigade, which had the left. The path of the Ninety-sixth was across open fields, intersected by fences and hedges, where every man presented a fair mark for the keen eyed rebel sharpshooter. But the line dashed forward, pausing at each fence to fire a volley, until it reached a thin strip of corn. As it approached this field the enemy's fire ceased, and while it was passing through it an ominous silence prevailed; but the moment it emerged from this slight cover a perfect sheet of flame was poured upon it, and many of the bravest fell. But unflinching the survivors dashed forward with the bayonet, completely routed the enemy's line, and took many prisoners. The loss in the Ninety-sixth was twenty killed, seventy-one severely, and fourteen slightly wounded, out of less than four hundred effective men who entered the engagement. Major Martin, and Lieutenant John Dougherty, were among the killed. On the 17th, at Antietam, Franklin's Corps arrived upon the right of the field, where the fighting had been most terrific, at a time when the corps of Hooker and Sumner, broken and greatly thinned, where yielding ground, and immediately hurled back the foe, sweeping across the corn field, and holding firmly the gory ground, over which the fiery bellows of the battle had been sweeping to and fro, until the close of the contest. The position of Bartlett's Brigade was to the rear and left of the batteries of Porter, Walcott, and Williston, where it remained throughout the day. Though exposed to a continuous and heavy artillery fire the loss in the regiment was only two killed. After the battle the corps was posted at the crossroads northeast of Bakersville. General Slocum, who had been promoted to the command of the Twelfth Corps, was succeeded in command of the division by General W. T. H. Brooks. Captain Peter A. Filbert was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel, to date from July 30, and Captain William H. Lessig to Major, to date from September 15. With the corps the regiment moved back into Virginia, and followed the army in its subsequent maneuvers, until, under Burnside, it entered on the Fredericksburg campaign, Colonel Cake in the meantime being placed in command of a mixed force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which was in position at Thoroughfare Gap, and subsequently in command of the brigade. On the 12th of December, after having first assisted in laying the pontoons at Franklin's crossing, it moved over the Rappahannock, and after some skirmishing took position with the brigade along the Bowling Green Road at a point above where it is crossed by Deep Run. Here it remained, under an almost continuous shower of shot and shell without becoming actively engaged except upon the skirmish line, until the night of the 15th, when it re-crossed the river, the army at the same time retiring, and went into camp near White Oak Church. Late in December, Lieutenant Colonel Filbert was honorably discharged, Major Lessig being subsequently promoted to succeed him. On the 16th of January 1863, the regiment moved to Belle Plain Landing on fatigue duty, retiring on the 19th, and on the 20th joined the column in its movement upon the Mud March. Returning to the old campgrounds of the brigade near White Oak Church on the 25th, the regiment remained until the 1st of February, when, with the exception of companies C and K, it was detached, and sent to Windmill Point on heavy fatigue duty [to unload coal barges]. Here, subject to the orders of General Patrick, Provost Marshal General of the Army, it was engaged in constant service until the 1st of March, when it again re-joined the brigade. Colonel Cake received his first leave of absence since entering the service, in January 1863, resigned March 12, and his resignation was accepted on the 2nd of May following. The command of the regiment then devolved on Lieutenant Colonel Lessig. Towards the close of April, the army having been thoroughly re-organized under General Hooker, stood ready for the order to advance on the Chancellorsville campaign. To the Sixth Corps, now under command of General Sedgwick, was assigned the part to advance by way of Fredericksburg and Marye's Heights. At two o'clock on the afternoon of the 28th of April the brigade occupied Stafford Heights. On the night of the 29th, following closely Russell's Brigade, it passed over the Rappahannock at Franklin's Crossing, and with slight lose occupied the enemy's works on the Bernard Farm. On the morning of the 3rd of May, the regiment was sent out by General Brooks to clear the front of the enemy's sharpshooters, who were annoying the Union artillerists posted beyond the Bowling Green Road, in front of the Bernard Mansion. This order was successfully executed, but not without stubborn resistance, the regiment losing five killed and eighteen wounded. After the capture of Marye's Heights-which was handsomely accomplished by Newton's and Howe's divisions-Brooks' Division, which had been held in reserve, now advanced,-with the exception of the 27th New York, left behind for guard and observation,-and took the lead in pursuit of the retreating enemy. In the vicinity of Salem Church, Bartlett's Brigade was drawn up, and advanced in line of battle on the left of the road, Torbert's Jersey Brigade on the right, Russell's Brigade, with the artillery, moving upon the road in reserve, ready to act as occasion might require. It was known that the enemy was in the woods beyond, but it was supposed to be the rear guard of his retreating column, and the information had been derived from rebel deserters, doubtless sent back to mislead the Union generals, that his trains had fallen into hopeless confusion and could be easily captured. Without stopping to shell the woods or develop the enemy's strength, Brooks' Division was pushed forward, on the very heels of the skirmishers, until it came suddenly upon three divisions of the rebel army,-most of which had been sent back from Chancellorsville,-drawn up in ambush, awaiting the advance of the Union column. The surprise was complete, and the division with its support was driven back, suffering grievous slaughter. The loss in the regiment, including that at the Bowling Green Road, was sixteen killed, fifty-seven wounded and twenty missing. Lieutenant Alexander Allison was among the mortally wounded. Unable to hold the ground the corps retired by Banks' Ford, and at midnight of the 4th of May, the regiment bivouacked on the heights overlooking the ford. The Twenty-third New Jersey having been left to cover the ford and remove the pontoons, unable to accomplish the work, the Ninety-sixth was sent to take its place, and successfully performed the duty. Relieved by the cavalry on the 8th, it re- joined the brigade, and again went into camp near White Oak Church. About the middle of May, the term of service of the Sixteenth and Twenty-seventh New York regiments having expired, they were mustered out, and the Ninety-fifth Pennsylvania and Thirty-first New York, of Russell's command, were transferred to the brigade. A few days later General Brooks was ordered to the command of the Department of the Allegheny, headquarters at Pittsburgh, and General H. G. Wright succeeded him in command of the division. Early in June, great activity being manifested by the rebel army, the Sixth Corps was again ordered to cross the Rappahannock, for a reconnaissance in force. At two P.M. on the 6th, the brigade occupied Stafford Heights, and at evening passed over at Franklin's Crossing. Extensive earthworks were thrown up all along the line of the Bernard Plantation, from Deep Run Ravine to a point beyond the ruins of the Bernard Mansion. Continuous skirmishing was kept up with occasional artillery practice. From supporting the Fifth U.S. Battery, the regiment was sent on the 7th to picket the Deep Run Ravine. Here it remained under a continuous fire until relieved by the Forty-ninth, and One Hundred and Nineteenth Pennsylvania regiments, and late at night on the 10th it returned to Stafford Heights, where, on the following day, in presence of nearly the entire division, a beautiful silk flag, the gift of friends in Schuylkill county, was presented by a committee of citizens. Early on the morning of the 12th, the brigade was sent out on picket, covering the country from the Rappahannock nearly to the Potomac. At nine o'clock on the evening of the 13th the regiment was withdrawn from the picket line, and re-joining the brigade at White Oak Church, started on the ever memorable Gettysburg campaign. With only short intervals of rest the movement continued until the afternoon of July 2, when at the moment of great peril in the battle, as the veterans of Longstreet, massed upon the extreme left, were doubling up and driving the corps of Sickles, it arrived upon the field. Foot sore and weary, the men were at once formed, and with scarcely a moments rest, were pushed forward upon the right of the road leading out to the Peach Orchard, to a slight elevation, on the right and front of Little Round Top, and took position behind a stone fence which it held with slight loss until the close of the battle. On the morning of the 5th of July the Sixth Corps started in pursuit of the enemy. Prisoners were taken at every turn, and the enemy's rear guard was closely pressed, compelling him to open frequently with his artillery. The sufferings in this pursuit were intense. The crossing of Cotoctin Mountain, along a by-road, at night, and in the midst of a terrific thunderstorm, will ever be remembered for its hardships. On the 10th the regiment, with two companies of the One Hundred and Twenty-first, skirmished in the advance along the Funkstown Road, and drove the rear of the enemy, after stubborn resistance, across the Antietam at Claggett's Mill. In this skirmish, and subsequently, while upon the picket line in front of Hagerstown, the regiment lost several wounded. Without coming to battle the enemy escaped into Virginia, and the Union army followed. After successive marching and countermarching, the brigade in the latter part of July, was detached from the division and sent to New Baltimore, where it was employed in picketing and scouting, and the usual rounds of drill and parade. On the 4th of September rebel guerrillas made a midnight descent upon General Bartlett's headquarters. The regiment was at the time on picket, and in the encounter three of its number were wounded, the enemy being quickly routed. On the 15th of September the command left New Baltimore, and moved to Warrenton, where it entered on Meade's Rapidan Campaign, returning from Centreville to the vicinity of Warrenton on the 20th of October. Here it remained until the 7th of November, when, with the command, it moved to Rappahannock Station, the brigade supporting Russell in the battle, which ensued. The loss was one severely, and several slightly wounded. The command went into camp near the confluence of the Aestham with the Rappahannock, and with the exception of the movement to Mine Run, and in support of the cavalry in the reconnaissance to Robertson's River, it remained in quarters here during the winter, a considerable number of the regiment re-enlisting, in the meantime, as veteran volunteers. On the 4th of May 1864, the brigade broke up winter-quarters and crossing the Rapidan, joined in the Battle of the Wilderness. It was almost constantly engaged in skirmishing during the five succeeding days, and on the 10th of May took part in the charge of the twelve picked regiments of the Sixth Corps on the enemy's works. The loss in the command was very heavy, Captain Edward Thomas being among the mortally wounded. On the 12th, at the salient known as the Slaughter Pen, in front of Spotsylvania, the fragment of the regiment remaining, with the division decimated as it was, held the position from early dawn until late at night, exposed during the whole time to a fire of musketry, which for severity, has few parallels in the history of warfare. So incessant was the shower of missiles, that tress over a foot in diameter, were cut off by the constant stroke of bullets. The loss in this series of engagements was thirty-three killed, one hundred and thirteen wounded, and thirty-nine missing, of whom the greater part were subsequently ascertained to have been killed. Remaining in the vicinity until the 14th, under almost continuous fire, the command moved to Bleak Hill, where, as at Salem Church, the division was pushed against the enemy in force; but soon finding itself overpowered, rapidly retired, some of the general officers making a narrow escape. Upon reaching Cold Harbor, the brigade to which the Second Connecticut Heavy Artillery had been added, stormed and carried a portion of the enemy's works in front of the Cold Harbor House, sustaining heavy loss. It was here that acting Adjutant John T. Hannum received his mortal wound. From Cold Harbor the brigade moved to the James, bivouacking on Taylor's Plantation, and moving hence by water to Bermuda Hundred. Crossing the Appomattox it moved up to the Petersburg front, arriving on the 19th of June. Here the regiment was employed in building breast works, picketing, sharpshooting, with occasional charges upon the enemy's works, involving sharp fighting. On the 29th it took part in the descent upon the Weldon Railroad, in which a considerable portion of the track was completely destroyed. Remaining in front of Petersburg until July 10, the brigade, in company with a part of the corps, marched to City Point, whence it moved by transport to Washington. Upon its arrival it was at once put upon the track of Early, who, with a considerable body of the rebel army, was threatening Washington. With the Army of the Shenandoah the regiment participated in all the operations in the Valley up to September 22, when, its term of service had expired, leaving a battalion composed of the veterans and recruits, which was subsequently consolidated with the Ninety-fifth Regiment, it withdrew from the front at Strasburg, and took up the line of march for Harper's Ferry, convoying thither a train of ambulances filled with the wounded. Proceeding by way of Baltimore and Harrisburg it reached Pottsville on the 26th, and on the evening of that day received at the hands of the citizens, a most flattering public welcome. On the 21st of October, at Hestonville, in West Philadelphia, it was paid and finally mustered out of service. Source: Bates, Samuel P. History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5. vol. III.

Between 1918 and 1922 the character was also the subject of a series of short animated cartoons. Fictional biography Alexander Rumhauser, better known as Judge Rummy, works as a court judge as his moniker implies. However, he is often seen doing other things like drinking alcohol and having affairs with women despite being married. Whenever he interacts with other characters, the strip often ends with at least one of them (including Judge Rummy) being upside down and showing only the feet (as shown in the strip above). He had a minor role in an earlier strip in which his best friend was the protagonist, but later strips began focusing on him. His wife is an obese lady who is four times his size. Whenever Judge Rummy dates a woman other than her or does something she finds unfavorable, the hefty wife would resort to brawling and roughing him up. Unlike other characters in the strip, she calls him either by his real name or sometimes \\"Alecthander.\\" Judge Rummy's best friend is a look-alike dog named Silk Hat Harry. Both dogs share similar interests in drinking booze and pursuing ladies. In film A scene from A Joy Ride, one of the animated cartoons based on the strip. Judge Rummy also appears in short films created by the International Film Service and Bray Productions from 1918 to 1922.

It is in the deanery of Preston, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Emmanuel Church was built between 1869 and 1870 and was designed by Myres, Veevers and Myres. The land for the church was given by Thomas Tomlinson of London, and the foundation stone was laid on 18 August 1868 by Sir T. G. Fermor-Hesketh, the local Member of Parliament. The church cost about £6,000, and when first built could seat 1,000 people. Architecture The church is built in red brick with some decoration in blue, black and white brick, and has sandstone dressings and slate roofs. It is in a mixture of Early English and Decorated architectural styles. The church consists of a five-bay nave without aisles, north and south transepts, and a chancel. Attached to the east sides of the transepts are vestries, each with an apse, and at the southwest corner is a tower. At the corners of the lower stages of the tower are angle buttresses, and the top stage has corner pilasters. In the lower stages are lancets and small circular windows, and in the top stage are paired bell openings. At the top of the tower is a carved band, corner gargoyles in the form of winged beasts, a parapet consisting of two pierced bands, the lower in brick and the upper in stone, and octagonal corner pinnacles. At the west front is a rectangular porch with stone carving, including a pierced parapet containing two inscribed tablets with triangular heads. In front of the porch is a modern glazed extension. Above the porch is a four-light window, over which is a polychrome band with zig-zag decoration. Along the sides of the church the bays are divided by buttresses, and each bay contains a two-light window. In the transepts are small lancet windows, and each transept has a large four-light window in the gable. The chancel has a five-light east window. The windows contain Geometrical tracery. Inside the church is a hammerbeam roof, and the transepts contain galleries. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1874, possibly by Ainscough of Preston, and was renovated in 1912 by R. G. Phillips of Preston. Building closure In 2014, due to dry rot affecting the building, the congregation stopped using the church building and moved to the adjacent community centre. The building was formally closed two years later in February 2016 but the Church continues to meet for worship and other activities in the Plungington Community Centre.http://www.blogpreston.co.uk/2016/03/opinion-how-closure-of-emmanuel- church-doesnt-mean-its-spirit-wont-live-on/ See also *Listed buildings in Preston, Lancashire References External links *Photograph of the church from GENUKI Category:Church of England church buildings in Lancashire Category:Grade II listed churches in Lancashire Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Lancashire Category:Churches completed in 1870 Category:Diocese of Blackburn Emmanuel Emmanuel Church ","title":"Emmanuel Church, Preston"},{"id":"42792091","text":"The Apostolic Administration of Estonia is a Latin, territorial Catholic circonscription that covers all of the Baltic state of Estonia. It is an apostolic administration (quasi-diocesan jurisdiction) of the Latin Roman Catholic church in Estonia, hence is exempt (i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province) and has its cathedral episcopal see, Peeter-Pauli katedraalis (Saints Peter and Paul), in the national capital Tallinn. The post of apostolic administrator has often been held by titular archbishops, combining it with papal diplomatic posts in the three Baltic republics (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).  History  In 1918, when Estonia gained independence, its citizens had complete freedom of religion. The Holy See recognized Estonia on 10 October 1921. The Apostolic Administration of Estonia was established on November 1, 1924,\\"Apostolic Administration of Estonia\\", Catholic Hierarchy.

Directed by Erlend Gjertsen, the film was issued on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in November 2011 via Jester Records and Kscope. The film documents Ulver’s performance at The Norwegian National Opera on 31 July 2010. The concert was later issued as a CD/DVD set, and double LP. The film holds an 18 rating from the BBFC for containing strong sex and bloody images, however, no cuts were made to the performance. The concert also included performances from artist Ian Johnstone, “welcoming everyone as Mr. Ark Todd in a static dance under a levitating moon, and parting with a pillar, on the skeleton legs of a horse, pale and naked as nature intended. The two pieces were accompanied by piano prepared by Daniel and the sound of a sleeping beast from Kris' pad.” Until recently Ulver had remained exclusively within the studio. This changed in May 2009 when the band accepted an invitation to appear at the Norwegian Festival of Literature. The success of this gig lead to them embarking on a string of other live performances in 2009 and 2010, selling out prestigious venues such as the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, Volksbühne in Berlin and La Cigale in Paris before they returned to their homeland for their performance at The Norwegian Opera House. Ulver were the first band outside the established Norwegian music scene to be invited to play at the Opera House. On 9 September 2011 a trailer was released by Kscope.  Background  During their first fifteen years Ulver never played live, which contributed to the shaping of their musical legacy. Stig Sæterbakken finally persuading the band to play their first concert at the Norwegian Festival of Literature in May 2009, fans came from all over the world – including Australia, Japan, Canada and the US. A national newspaper wrote on the band's concert at the Logen Theatre in Bergen, \\"The cult band hit us hard with suggestive music. Ulver is one of the few bands which can move from pictures of Jesus to sex, burlesque and atom bombs without making you jump. The music alone is too powerful for anything to make you more flabbergasted.\\" Malcolm Dome, writing for Classic Rock Magazine, commented, \\"Ulver's presentation is surreal and stark. A psychedelic excursion, an immersive experience, fuelled by haunting, progressive art. After such a night, you don't want to see another band for a few days. Because anything else would pale when put alongside Ulver.\\" Mojo writer, Phil Alexander, added, \\"In many respects, Ulver epitomise what happens when metal's melancholic strand is taken to its logical conclusion. While the band's roots lie in clattering black metal, their evolution began with the release of 1998's openly progressive Themes From William Blake's The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell. By the time they'd got to Shadows Of The Sun, they'd wandered still further away from their gnashing early work, sitting at the remote, windswept crossroads of art-rock, ambient adventurism, improvisational noise, and the hymnal aspects of modern classical music.\\"  Critical reception  Upon release The Norwegian National Opera received positive reviews from music critics. Mats Johansen, writing for Mind Over Metal gave the DVD a 5/5 rating, calling it “a magnificent rock extravaganza.” Craig Haze, writing for Hellbound called the film “mesmerizing and stunning beautiful.” Tom De Val, writing for Dutch Progressive Rock Page, rated the album 8.5/10, noting “they are a unique and at times hypnotic live experience; far from a conventional one, true; I’d liken seeing them live as more akin to a piece of performance art than a standard concert.”  Track listing   Personnel  ;Ulver *Kristoffer Rygg - lead vocals, programming *Tore Ylwizaker - keyboards, programming *Jørn H.

He was one of the founders of neuropsychology and studied perception. He coined the term double dissociation. He also introduced the \\"Corollary Discharge\\" hypothesis. He gave the classic definition of agnosia as \\"a normal percept stripped of its meaning\\". He was the recipient of the Karl Spencer Lashley Award in 1966. Biography He was born in Berlin on August 7, 1916. He studied at the French College in Berlin and at the University of Basel in Switzerland (1935-1939). He immigrated to the United States in 1941 and in August of the same year married Marianne Liepe. In 1947, he earned his PhD in social psychology at Harvard University, under the mentorship of Gordon Allport. His thesis studied the efficacy of psychiatric treatments on delinquent adolescents. After graduating, his early work was in San Diego with neurologist Morris Bender. While living in Dobbs Ferry, New York from 1946 to 1961, he headed the Psychophysiology Lab at the New York University-Bellevue Medical Center. His work focused on assessing brain injuries from World War II veterans, with a focus on the effects of frontal lobe injury. From this research, he introduced the \\"corollary discharge\\" hypothesis, which says that the frontal lobe is involved in the anticipation of movement. In 1960, Teuber moved to Massachusetts to start a Department of Psychology at MIT after previous attempts had failed. Today, it is known as the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. He hired Jerry Fodor, Thomas Bever, and Merrill Garrett. At MIT, he was one of the researchers who studied the case of H.M.. He died in a swimming accident in the Virgin Islands.

It attempted to build a shale oil industrial production complex for utilization of Swabian Alb oil shale deposits (Posidonia Shale). The project was driven by the fuel needs of the German army at the last phase of World War II due to decreasing conventional petroleum supplies. Three companies conducted pilot tests. LIAS-Ölschiefer-Forschungsgesellschaft mbH, established in September 1942, started tests in Frommern.Holoch (1978), p. 232 Kohle-Öl- Union von Busse KG, established on 30 July 1943 in Berlin, tested in-situ retorting on the outskirts of Schörzingen.Megargee (2009), p. 1012 Deutsche Ölschiefer-Forschungsgesellschaft mbH, established on 20 September 1943 in Schömberg, became later the core of the Operation Desert. Schutzstaffel (SS) and Hermann Göring personally became involved in the project in late 1943. On 2 May 1944, SS established oil shale company Deutsche Schieferöl GmbH for its own shale oil plant near Erzingen.Longerich (2012), p. 685 Also IG Farben became involved in shale oil. In July 1944, Operation Desert became a part of the Geilenberg Programme. For the Operation Desert construction of ten shale oil extraction plants in Württemberg and Hohenzollern were ordered by Edmund Geilenberg. Prisoners from seven nearby subcamps of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp, established by the route of Tübingen - Aulendorf and Nebenstrecke Balingen- Rottweil railway lines, were used as a workforce. The main contractor for building these plants was Deutsche Bergwerks- und Hüttenbau GmbH, a subsidiary of Reichswerke Hermann Göring. About 5,000 prisoners were used for construction works and more than 10,000 prisoners had been exploited for the oil-shale works. When the Soviet troops advance into Estonia in 1944, about 200 oil shale specialists from Estonia, employees of Baltische Öl GmbH , an affiliate of IG Farben, were evacuated to Schömberg.Holmberg (2008), pp. 130-131 However, out of ten planned plants only four became operational. The technology was primitive carbonization and oil yield was low. Mined oil shale was heaped into mounds which were ignited after covering by peat. Distilled shale oil and oil shale gas were collected through perforated pipes. Oil was separated from gas by electric filters. Until the end of the war, only 1,500 tonnes of shale oil was produced. After the war French occupation forces tried continue the shale oil production operations but due to unprofitability it was halted in 1948.

He was the first journalist to expose the role of Toto Riina and the Corleonesi within the Sicilian Mafia, and because of this he was killed on January 26, 1979. After 22 years, in 2001, those who had decided to eliminate him were convicted. Early years Born in Syracuse, Sicily, he moved to Palermo to finish school. In the 1950s Francese got his first job as a journalist at the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata (ANSA). Shortly afterwards, he was hired by the newspaper La Sicilia in Catania as a correspondent with the task of writing about crime and judicial affairs. As he was looking to improve his financial situation, in 1957 he accepted a job as head of the press office at the regional administration of Sicily. Mario Francese, quando una biro fa più paura di una pistola , Antimafia Duemila, January 26, 2014 Thanks to his improved financial situation, he decided to marry Maria Sagona in 1958. Soon, however, he resigned from his second job at ANSA and started to collaborate with the Giornale di Sicilia, the main newspaper of Palermo. He was appointed to cover crime and judicial affairs and became one of the best experts on the Mafia. After some time, however, he was forced to make a choice between his job at the Sicilian regional administration and the one at the Giornale di Sicilia. In 1968, he chose to become a professional journalist. Crime reporter in Palermo At the Giornale di Sicilia he began to take care of all crime reporting, from the Ciaculli massacre to the murder of Carabinieri Colonel Giuseppe Russo. By digging in the intrigues connected with the construction of the Garcia dam, he also was the first to understand the strategic evolution and the new interests of the Mafia of Corleone and their spread to Palermo. Francese looked into the connections of the Corleonesi, businessmen and politicians in relation with public contracts.Longrigg, Boss of Bosses He was the only journalist to interview Ninetta Bagarella, the wife of Salvatore Riina.Siebert, Secrets of Life and Death, p. 162 In his motivation of the sentence of his killers in 2001, 22 years later, the judge described Francese's skills: \\"An extraordinary capacity to make connections between the most significant news events, interpret them with courageous intelligence, and thus to draw a reconstruction of exceptional clarity and credibility on the evolutionary lines of Cosa Nostra, in a historical phase in which – in addition to the emergence of insightful and widespread mafia infiltration in the world of procurement and economics – Cosa Nostra's strategy of attacking the State institutions began to take shape. A subversive strategy that had made a quality leap just with the elimination of one of the most lucid minds of Sicilian journalism, a professional stranger to any form of packaging, free of any complacency towards the cliques colluded with the Mafia and able to provide the public with important tools for the analysis of the changes taking place within Cosa Nostra.\\" Murder and trial He was shot five times and killed on the evening of January 26, 1979, in front of his house in Palermo by Leoluca Bagarella, the brother-in-law of Riina.Follain, The Last Godfathers, p. 112 The murder of Francese was recorded a crime of passion; soon forgotten and the investigation closed. The investigation on the murder was reopened years later, at the insistence of the family, particularly of his son, Giuseppe Francese. Biografia Giuseppe Francese, Fondazione Francese The sentence of the first instance came in 2001, condemning the whole leading Commission of Cosa Nostra. Riina, Francesco Madonia, Nenè Geraci, Giuseppe Farinella, Michele Greco, Leoluca Bagarella (the actual killer) and Giuseppe Calò were sentenced to 30 years. Bernardo Provenzano was sentenced to life imprisonment. Biografia Mario Francese, Fondazione Francese The sentences were confirmed in appeal. In December 2003, the Italian Supreme Court absolved Pippo Calò, Nenè Geraci and Giuseppe Farinella \\"for not having committed the crime\\" and confirmed the sentence of 30 years of prison for Totò Riina, Leoluca Bagarella, Raffaele Ganci, Francesco Madonia and Michele Greco. The conviction of Bernardo Provenzano was also confirmed. Giuseppe, the son of Mario Francese and like him a journalist at the Giornale di Sicilia, after having fought so much for the truth about the murder of his father, committed suicide shortly before the sentencing of the murderers by the Appeal Court. Suicida il figlio del cronista Francese, vittima di mafia, Corriere della Sera, September 4, 2002 Awards In 1996 the Mario Francese Award was created to honor his memory.

Il quarto comandamento, Fondazione Francese A square in Corleone, was named after Mario and Giuseppe Francese.

About  The Mofos website was created by Brazzers in 2008. The goal was to create videos with simpler storylines, as opposed to Brazzers' videos. The videos would feature lesser-known pornographic actors who would be able to accurately embody the various roles specifically written for reality pornography. The Mofos website was eventually acquired by Manwin in 2010. The online network consists of twenty-two hardcore pornography websites (or sub- networks) along with five series. As of October 2016, Mofos.com has a global traffic ranking of 6,946.  Sub-Networks There are over twenty websites operating under the Mofos network. Each site follows different themes and storylines within the reality pornography genre. Themes may include: interracial pornography, public sex, legal-aged teenagers, mature women, etc. The sub-sites are named in order to be able to easily identify said themes without needing much research.  Operations  Regardless of any explicit themes, Mofos and its subsites are carefully run under the supervision of MindGeek so as to avoid all illegal activities. Mofos is currently owned and operated by Mindgeek, formerly known as Manwin. The name was changed shortly after managing partner, Fabian Thylman, stepped down. Thylman had first acquired the company after purchasing the assets from the original founders. In 2013, he sold his stakes to Feras Antoon and David Tassillo, the senior management of the company. The company then merged with Redtube, a large porn tube site, thus creating MindGeek.

A specialist sprinter, he won eight races over five and six furlongs in a ten race career which lasted from June 1977 until October 1978. As a two-year-old, he won three of his four races, including the Coventry Stakes in England and the Anglesey Stakes in Ireland. In the following year, he was the dominant sprinter in the British Isles, winning the Ballyogan Stakes, King's Stand Stakes, July Cup, and William Hill Sprint Championship. He was then retired to stud but died a year later. Background Solinus was a strong, lengthy, good-looking bay horse with a large white snip and white socks on his hind feet, bred by Len Hall at his stud near Rugby, Warwickshire. He was the best horse sired by Comedy Star, an American-bred stallion who raced in England, producing his best effort when finishing second to Brigadier Gerard in the Washington Singer Stakes. Solinus was the third foal of Cawston's Pride, an outstanding filly who won nine of her ten races and had previously produced the Coventry Stakes winner Cawston's Clown (also by Comedy Star). Solinus was sent to the United States and was consigned to the Saratoga Yearling Sales where he was bought for $75,000 by representatives of California businessman, Danny Schwartz. Solinus was returned to Europe and sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle in County Kildare. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Solinus began his racing career in a maiden race over five furlongs in early June. He started the odds-on favourite and won by eight lengths. Later in the month, he was sent to England and moved up in class for the Group Three Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he started the 7/4 favourite and won by three lengths from Sharpen Your Eye, having taken the lead shortly after half way. Solinus did not reappear until late August, when he started 4/9 favourite for the Anglesey Stakes at the Curragh in which he was opposed by the Railway Stakes winner Thunor. He won very easily by six lengths from Embee Twist. In September, Solinus went back to England to contest the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead and quickened two furlongs from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length by Sexton Blake. Piggott expressed the view that the seven furlong distance was too short for the colt. =1978: three-year-old season= Despite Piggott's opinion, Solinus was campaigned exclusively at sprint distances in 1978. He made his first appearance in the Group Three Ballyogan Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in early June and started second favourite behind the four-year-old Ballad Rock. Ridden by Tommy Murphy, Solinus disputed the lead from the start and won by a head from Ballad Rock. Three weeks later, Solinus was moved up in class for the Group One King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Piggott and started the 4/6 favourite. He took the lead soon after the start and drew away from the field in the final furlong to win by four lengths from the Temple Stakes winner Oscilight. On his next appearance, Solinus started 4/7 favourite for the Group One July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. In what Timeform described as the best sprint race run in England that year, he took the lead after a furlong, turned back the challenge of Double Form, and held off the late run of the French-trained filly Sanedtki to win by a neck. At York Racecourse in August, Solinus started the 1/2 favourite for the Group Two William Hill Sprint Championship over five furlongs. He raced lazily, following the filly Smarten Up before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths. Solinus returned to Ireland in September for the Airlie/Coolmore/Castle Hyde Championships over six furlongs at the Curragh. Despite rumours that he had sustained an injury a day earlier, he started favourite and won easily by three lengths from Spence Bay. In October, Solinus was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started the 6/10 favourite despite an unfavourable draw but was beaten three lengths by the two-year-old French filly Sigy. Assessment In the Irish Free Handicap for 1977, Solinus was rated the second best colt of his generation, five pound behind his stable companion Try My Best. The independent Timeform organisation gave Solinus a rating of 124, six pounds behind the champion Try My Best. In the following year, Solinus was rated on 130 by Timeform, who named him the best sprinter of the year. The International Classification placed him eighth among the three-year-old colts of 1978, seven pounds below Ile de Bourbon. Vincent O'Brien described Solinus as the fastest sprinter he had ever trained. Stud record Solinus was retired from racing and became a breeding stallion at the Longfield Stud in County Tipperary, having been valued at £800,000 for syndication. He died after a single season at stud, with the best of his offspring being the filly Henry's Secret who finished second in the Princess Margaret Stakes and was rated 108 by Timeform in 1982.

Smith, American International Pictures: The Golden Years, Bear Manor Media 2013 p 76 produced by O'Dale Ireland and directed by David Bradley. It stars Yvonne Lime, Gary Clarke, Fay Wray and Connie Stevens. Set in coastal California, the film centres on a false accusation that a sportscar club member is responsible for the death of a member of a motorcycle gang and the gang's attempts to take revenge. Dragstrip Riot was released in the US by American International Pictures as a double feature with The Cool and the Crazy (1958), and distributed in Canada by Astral Films and in the UK by Anglo Amalgamated. Plot The clean-cut members of the local sportscar club are enjoying summer in Malibu, California - driving their Corvettes, going to the bach, hanging out at the malt shop. But tensions simmer, nonetheless. Rick Martin (Clarke) and Bart Thorson (Bob Turnbull) both consider Janet Pearson (Lime) to be \\"their\\" girl. The boys almost come to blows, but Rick refuses to fight. Rick lives with his mother, Norma (Wray), a war widow, and Gramps (Ted Wedderspoon), his paternal grandfather. The stern Gramps believes that Norma is coddling Rick by giving him an expensive sportscar and letting him loaf away the summer. A motorcycle gang with leather jackets, greasy hair and long sideburns invades the malt shop, rudely ordering beer instead of the Cokes that the sportscar kids drink. The lone motorcycle girl is unlike the sportscar girls. She wears tight pants instead of dresses, and smokes cigarettes, and when she and one of the sportscar girls collide rumps while dancing, she says angrily, \\"Pull in your bumper, sister!\\" The two fight. Bart bumps the arm of Silva (Gabe DeLutri), the gang's leader, but makes it look as if Rick caused Silva to spill his beer. Silva challenges Rick to a fight, but Rick walks away. Outside the malt shop, Silva again challenges Rick. This time Rick loses his temper and in the ensuing fight pins Silva to the ground. As the gang leaves, a humiliated Silva menacingly tells Rick that \\"this is only round one.\\" Bart aligns himself with the motorcyclists because with Rick out of the way, Janet will be all his. The sportscar boys enter a road race. Bart, trailing in second place, forces Rick out of the lead and goes on to win. Rick confronts Bart, accepting Bart's dare to a \\"train drag,\\" in which they park their cars side by side on railway tracks and face a train speeding toward them at 90 mph (146 km/h). The \\"winner\\" is the driver who moves out of the way last, after the \\"loser\\" has chickened out and sped away. Rick wins, but realizing that he could have been killed, admits his stupidity to Janet. After Bart tells the motorcycle gang where Rick is, they chase Rick up a mountain road. Silva pulls his motorcycle alongside Rick's Corvette, singing wildly at him with a large wrench. After several misses, Rick stomps on his brakes and Silva accidentally hits fellow gang member Gordie (Barry Truex) on the head. Gordie fatally crashes; Silva blames Rick. An honourable Rick turns himself in to face a manslaughter charge. When the sportcar kids read a newspaper article about Rick, they're shocked that he had spent six months in reform school for beating a boy when he was 14. Rick tells Janet that the boy had pulled a knife on him, but he was convicted as the boy was the son of \\"some bigshot politician.\\" It is the reason Rick avoids fighting. Bart tips off the gang that Rick and Janet are at the beach. They ambush the couple. Silva produces a speargun, intending to kill them to avenge Gordie's death. But just as Silva fires, Janet breaks free and the spear strikes Bart, who had been forced against his will to restrain Janet while Silva shoots her. A brawl erupts. Norma and Gramps arrive. Instead of trying to stop the mayhem, though, Gramps encourages Rick to fight. A police car pulls up. The officers fire their guns into the air to stop the brawl and quickly arrest the motorcyclists. Bart survives being speared. Rick and Janet walk arm-in-arm down the beach, away from everything.

The British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) approved the film under both titles for exhibition in the UK after reviewing it on 21 May 1958 and requiring that unspecified cuts be made. The BBFC issued the movie an A-certificate, which meant that it was \\"more suitable for adults.\\" Dragstrip Riot was in production at Sunset Stages in Los Angeles between 19 August and \\"early September\\" 1957, with location filming done in Malibu itself and at Paradise Cove, a beach in Malibu. The film's premiere in March 1958, along with that of The Cool and the Crazy, \\"may have been\\" in Kansas City, Missouri, where The Cool and the Crazy had been filmed in its entirety. Clarke said in an interview with academic film historian Tom Weaver that the film had had three directors: credited director David Bradley, producer O'Dale Ireland and someone who lasted such a short time that he couldn't remember his name. As a result, he said, the actors \\"mostly directed ourselves.\\" Although the film is listed as being in production for three weeks, Clarke said in the same interview that Dragstrip Riot was actually shot over a six-month period, although the actors were only paid for the contractual three weeks.p. 17 Weaver, Tom Gary Clarke Interview in Earth vs. the Sci-Fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews McFarland, 23 Jun. 2014 Dragstrip Riot was Wray's final film and Clarke's first.  Distribution  Dragstrip Riot was distributed in the US by AIP; in Canada by Astral Pictures; and in the UK by Anglo Amalgamated. The film was sold twice into US television syndication: in 1965 as part of the 69-film \\"AIP Package\\" from Screen Entertainment and again in 1971 by AIP as part of its 26-film \\"A.I.P. Feature Group\\" package.  Reception  Dragstrip Riot got mixed reviews from the publications consulted by BoxOffice magazine for its weekly \\"Review Digest.\\" Film Daily rated it as \\"good\\"; BoxOffice, Harrison's Reports and Variety called it \\"fair\\"; and The Hollywood Reporter ranked it as \\"poor.\\" But in terms of audience, the film scored an average of 101 points on the \\"Boxoffice Barometer,\\" where reports from various cities were compiled on a scale on which 100 points represented \\"average\\" box office receipts. Four cities reported above-average scores: Kansas City at 140; Denver and Milwaukee, 125 each; and Buffalo, 115. Detroit had an average score of 100. Below-average scores were recorded in San Francisco and Portland, 90 each; Boston, 75; and Los Angeles, 50. The BoxOffice review had little to say about the film itself. However, it did note that Dragstrip Riot and The Cool and the Crazy were marketed as a \\"package.\\" The magazine said that AIP specialized in \\"those modestly budgeted programmers for which the product-starved exhibitors were screaming. Then to make doubly sure that their product commanded the attention they had foreseen, they started pairing them, thus giving unprecedented importance to the so-called package deals which have proven so financially successful (...).\\" Comparing the two movies, the anonymous reviewer wrote that \\"As concerns script, performances, production, etc., it's about a tossup as to which of the offerings in the better.\\" The movie was given a rather bad review by the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle newspaper. Reviewer JW called it \\"a hideous little production that maligns teen-agers generally\\" and wrote that \\"Besides being a sloppy picture that deals with sick kids, it is a third rate production from the standpoint to cast and direction.\\" It was playing at the time of the review at the Paramount Theater in Rochester on a 10:30 pm \\"Twin Rock 'N Roll Show\\" as the first film on a double bill with The Cool and the Crazy. Academic film historian Peter Stansfeld contrasts the train drag in Dragstrip Riot with the over-the-cliff chicken race in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). He writes that the train drag sequence is constructed in such a way that \\"filmmakers are tantalizing their audience with thrills\\" that they don't see. \\"The movie is thus rendered as a harmless and uncontroversial entertainment,\\" he continues. \\"The film's lack of affect, however, was more certainly a consequence of the fact the filmmakers did not have the resources to produce the kind of finely-honed cinematic rendering of danger, suspense, and thrills that was achieved in Rebel. And more recently film critic Rob Craig has described Dragstrip Riot as being a \\"trite melodrama of the soap opera variety\\" and \\"a wheezy, long-winded affair which seems to go on forever.\\" Music Music for Dragstrip Riot was composed and conducted by Nicholas Carras, with song lyrics by Carl Eugster. According to the website Ringostrack, the songs \\"Teenage Rumble,\\" \\"Rock & Rollin Joe\\" and \\"Only One to a Customer\\" were performed by The Rip Chords. Connie Stevens, accompanied by The Rip Chords, sang \\"Something New\\" and \\"Jamaica Rock.\\" Although unrelated to the movie, the Seattle alternative rock/punk band The Flesh Eaters released a recording titled \\"Dragstrip Riot,\\" which is also the title of a song on it. An LP, cassette and CD were issued by SST Records in 1991.

A tactical unit furnished by this territorial unit was also known as sadrosho, each under the command of a military official, sardali. United Kingdom of Georgia The origin of the sadrosho system traces its origin to the period of a united Georgian monarchy, the Bagratid kingdom of Georgia (1008–1491), which, according to the 18th-century historian Prince Vakhushti, was subdivided into four principal sadrosho: * metsinave (მეწინავე), \\"avant-garde\\", was furnished by the southern provinces of Upper and of Lower Kartli. * memarjvene (მემარჯვენე), \\"right flank\\", was provided by the western provinces of Imereti and Abkhazia. * memartskhene (მემარცხენე), \\"left flank\\", was supplied by the easternmost provinces of Kakheti and Hereti. * mepis (მეფის), \\"royal\\", by Inner Kartli. After the united monarchy With the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the latter half of the 15th century, the unified military organization collapsed and the three successor kingdoms—Kakheti, Kartli, and Imereti—reestablished their own systems of sadrosho. In Kakheti, newly created sadrosho were put under the command of bishops, generally more loyal to the king than princes (tavadi), who filled the similar positions in Kartli, usually as hereditary offices, and were prone to defiance to the central royal authority. Over time, the number and administration of sadrosho underwent several changes, but the system survived until the Russian annexation of the Georgian monarchies in the early 19th century. =List of sadrosho in Kakheti= * metsinave, \\"avant- garde\\", was under the bishop of Bodbe (bodbeli) and consisted of the district of Kiziki up to the village of Kisiskhevi. * memarjvene, \\"right flank\\", was commanded by the bishop of Nekresi (nekreseli) and comprised much of Thither Kakheti up to the town of Gremi. * memartskhene, \\"left flank\\", was subjected to the bishop of Rustavi (rustveli) and commanded much of Outer Kakheti from Kisiskhevi to the Aragvi river, including Martkopi and Saguramo. * mepis, \\"royal\\", was commanded by a royally-appointed person, not infrequently by a crown prince, and covered much of Inner Kakheti and the territory of the Bishopric of Alaverdi west from Gremi, including the Pankisi gorge. =List of sadrosho in Kartli= * metsinave, \\"avant-garde\\", included Lower Kartli—the districts of Somkhiti and Sabaratiano—and was under the hereditary command of the Princes Baratashvili and their offshoot, the Princes Orbeliani. * memarjvene, \\"right flank\\", included Inner Kartli and was hereditarily commanded by the Princes Amilakhvari. * memartskhene, \\"left flank\\", comprised Samukhranbatono and the duchies of Aragvi and Ksani, and was under the hereditary command of the Princes Mukhranbatoni. * mepis, \\"royal\\", included parts of Kartli along the right bank of the Mtkvari river from Tbilisi to Tashiskari and the estates of the Catholicos.

He graduated as an economist in Lisbon he did an internship at the Office of Economic Studies of the Banco de Portugal in 1982. In 2004, he was elected as Mayor of Bissau, a position he held until 2009, when he was named by President Malam Bacai Sanhá as Minister of Finance. He and the other ministers were ousted in the 2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'etat. He is a member of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde and won the right to represent the party in the 2014 presidential election by besting eleven hopefuls during a two-day primary in March 2014. In the first round of the election, held on 13 April 2014, he won 40.9% of the votes, and entered a runoff with the second leading vote-getter, Nuno Gomes Nabiam, who was backed by the military. In the second round, on 18 May 2014, he received 61.9% of the vote. Though Gomes Nabiam initially contested the result, he conceded the election on 22 May 2014. During the election, Mário Vaz promised to focus on reducing poverty and increasing investment in agriculture, as well as forgiveness for participation in the sorts of criminal activities that have turned Guinea-Bissau into a haven for drug traffickers. After the 2012 coup, he fled to Portugal, but returned in February 2013 and spent three days under arrest.

He ran the Victoria Theatre on what became Times Square, Manhattan, presenting very popular vaudeville shows with a wide variety of acts. He was known for \\"freak acts\\", where celebrities or people notorious for scandals appeared on stage. Hammerstein's Victoria Theatre became the most successful in New York. Early years Paradise Roof Garden around 1902 William Hammerstein was born in New York City on 26 September 1875,\\"New York, New York City Births, 1846-1909,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:271S-4VN : accessed 21 September 2015), William Hamerstein, 26 Sep 1875; citing Birth, Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, New York Municipal Archives, New York; FHL microfilm 1,322,094. son of Oscar Hammerstein, the theater impresario, and his first wife, née Rose Blau. He started work as a press agent, then built a vaudeville theatre on 110th Street, Manhattan, called Little Coney Island. He also managed burlesque shows. Willie Hammerstein managed his father's Olympia Theater, which opened in 1895. In November 1896 Willie Hammerstein brought the Cherry Sisters to the Olympia roof garden. The sisters put on a terrible act where they sang sentimental, dialect or patriotic songs. One of them played the piano and another banged a drum. Willie knew how bad they were. He provided a net that protected them when the audience, as expected, started throwing produce and garbage at the stage. The word spread, and the sisters became a big draw. Oscar Hammerstein went bankrupt in 1898. The Olympia theater was sold in an auction. Hammerstein managed to raise enough money to build the Victoria Theatre, which opened as a legitimate theater on 3 March 1899. On 26 June 1899 he opened a partially enclosed roof garden theater, the Venetian Terrace Garden, with an outdoor promenade that was attached to the roof garden of Hammerstein's Theatre Republic in 1900. Hammerstein enlarged the roof garden theater and reopened it in May 1901 as the Paradise Roof Garden. Victoria Theatre 1913 poster for the Victoria In February 1904 Willie Hammerstein took over management of his father's Victoria Theatre. He was talented at promoting his shows, and was skilled at finding and booking profitable acts. The Victoria had been staging variety acts, plays and musicals. Willie Hammerstein started putting on popular low-brow vaudeville shows at low prices. He signed up stars and unknown new performers, celebrities of all types, physical freaks, illusionists and risqué exotic dancers. The highly varied programs drew large and often noisy audiences. Hammerstein ran the only vaudeville theater in Times Square, and had no other theatres. He was able to develop shows uniquely fitted to his local audience. The crowd at the Victoria like the rather jaded and cynical atmosphere, the stage slang and black humor. Acts could afford to include more sexual innuendo than in other houses. To keep costs and prices down, a typical Hammerstein bill would feature a few well-paid stars and a large number of lower-priced novelty acts. Hammerstein made the Victoria the most popular venue for vaudeville in New York. The Victoria was a grand building, and played some high-quality acts. As of 1905 the theater owners who booked through the William Morris Agency seemed likely to become dominant in the vaudeville industry. They included Hammerstein, Frederick Freeman Proctor, Timothy Sullivan and Percy G. Williams. Later the Keith-Albee circuit booking office gave Hammerstein a monopoly on big-time vaudeville in Times Square. Willie's father was much more interested in grand opera, and in 1906 opened the Manhattan Opera House. Revenue from the Victoria kept the opera house running. At one point Oscar Hammerstein, always short of money, moved to sell the Victoria to the Shubert family. Willie and his brother Arthur, who produced shows, blocked the attempt. In March 1913 Keith and Albee paid Oscar Hamilton a reported $225,000 to give up his monopoly. They opened the Palace Theatre at 47th Street and 7th Avenue, advertising \\"refined glamour\\" and featuring the biggest stars of vaudeville. Acts became harder to book, since performers did not want to be connected with a rival of the powerful Keith's circuit. Advertisement from The New York Times, 18 July 1909 Acts Performers enjoyed playing the Victoria. Buster Keaton thought it was the greatest of the vaudeville houses. Hammerstein asked performers back many times if he liked them, as with the British comedian Harry Tate. In June 1905 Willie Hammerstein signed up Will Rogers to perform in the Victoria for afternoon matinees and in the Paradise Roof Garden in the evenings. The young Mae West played eleven one-week engagements in 1912 and 1913, a good fit with the audience through her suggestion of notoriety. Hammerstein often booked acts from Europe, who sometimes made up half the show. He introduced the dancers Gertrude Hoffmann and Constance Stewart-Richardson to the vaudeville stage. A review in the New York Dramatic Mirror of 12 August 1905 gives a sense of the shows: The scandalous Evelyn Nesbit was a draw Willie Hammerstein became known for his \\"freak acts\\". Typically these featured people who had scandalized the public and gained notoriety. Members of love triangles involving murders or suicides were popular, if one of their members was free to appear and give the public the titillating details. Evelyn Nesbit was an example. In 1911 Irving Berlin was featured at the Victoria, billed as \\"The Composer of a Hundred Hits\\", and performed a number of his songs including That Mysterious Rag. Berlin was hired more as a celebrity songwriter than for his ability to sing, but was a hit with the audience anyway. Other types of human curiosity were \\"Shekla, Court Magician to the Shah of Persia\\" and \\"Madamoiselle Fatima, Escaped Harem Dancer: ... She has a distinctive Turkish personality and dances with original movements all her own, accompanied by her two Eunuch Servants.\\" Hammerstein also put on novelties like Don the Talking Dog. Sports celebrities like boxer James J. Corbett and baseball pitcher Rube Marquard also drew audiences. Family and legacy Hammerstein was unusual in making a sharp separation between his work in the theater, which he loved, and his home life. He would not pose for a photograph, and told his press agents not to use his name in publicity. Hammerstein married Alice Nimmo in 1893, and they had two sons, Oscar and Reginald. They lived at 315 Central Park West. His wife died in 1910 and he married her sister, Annie Nimmo. He never took part in Broadway night life, and he did not want his two sons to get involved in theater. However, Oscar Hammerstein II became famous as a lyricist and musical comedy writer. Willie Hammerstein suffered from a disease of the kidneys, and died in New York on 10 June 1914. He was aged 38. He had made the Victoria his own. His brother, Arthur, took over management but was unable to recapture the spirit. The theater soon had to be closed. The Victoria Theatre was pulled down two years after Willie Hammerstein died, and the Rialto was built in its place, the first movie palace in Times Square.

First researches  He was born in Rome and graduated in Geology in 1964 from the University of Rome La Sapienza with a thesis on \\"Physical nature and size of the Earth's Core\\". He became a Volunteer at the chair of Seismology directed by Professor Pietro Caloi in academic years 1964–1967. Since graduation he is a researcher at the ENEA (National Committee for Nuclear Energy) in the Research Centre \\"Casaccia\\" of Rome, where he conducts research on the material damage produced by ionizing particles (Radiation Damage). At the same time he is research associate at the European Joint Research Centre: Ispra. From 1966 he began a long line of research on the Atomic Scattering Factor of metals for the knowledge of the electronic configurations of metal elements from Titanium to Copper (3d elements) in collaboration with the Research Centre MASS (U.S. Army Materials and Mechanics Research Centre in Watertown). In 1968, after a visit to the facilities of the reactors CEA Saclay (France) he participated in the development and construction of a neutron collimator for the development of the diagnostic systems of Neutronigraphy at the Triga Mark II reactor of the Casaccia. In 1969 he began a research program, with practical application perspectives, on the technique of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering, as a research associate at the University of Paris-Orsay Laboratoire de Physique des Solides directed by Professor André Guinier (inventor of the \\"Guinier chamber\\"), to work at the creation of an instrument for the technique of Small Angle x-ray for high penetration. In 1971, with the same technique, he built at the laboratories of Casaccia an analysis system for the study of the size and distribution of pores in alumina filters, used for uranium enrichment. From 1972 to 1996 he was head of research at the CNEN (that then became ENEA).  Technology applied to cultural heritage  In 1983 he started the activity of technology transfer to the field of Cultural Heritage, creating an innovative model for management of resources and research facilities: a selected group of experts appointed by him develop specific research and begin to offer services to the operating structures (Superintendents) of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, using the most advanced laboratories of ENEA.“Le nuove tecnologie per la Salvaguardia del Patrimonio Artistico” (New technologies for the Protection of Artistic Heritage), Edizioni De Luca, Roma 1985 In 1984 he coordinated the first of a long series of projects dedicated entirely to the preservation of Italian heritage: “Seismic safety of Monuments”. Subsequently, he coordinated the project “Studies of microclimate in museums: Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan), Museum of Viterbo, Museum of Capodimonte (Naples).\\" That same year, he coordinated the work of analysis of the Angel of Castel Sant'Angelo, the famous work of Peter Anton von Verschaffelt among the best known symbols of the artistic heritage of Rome. The Angel, never moved from the time of its installation in 1753, was dismantled into its constituent thirty pieces, arranged in as many containers on the terrace of Castel S. Angelo, and transported to the ENEA Casaccia Research Centre with an Army helicopter. In 1985, he created the project \\"Design of an advanced system for semi-automatic cataloging of archaeological ceramics\\" (Stelit Systems S.p.A.) and the following year he promoted and coordinated the \\"Project Piemonte\\", in collaboration with Fiat Engineering, the Programme \\"Cultural deposits\\" of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage. In 1986 Maurizio Diana and his team took part in the Venice Biennale in the section \\"Art and Science\\" with a didactic analysis on capillary action of water within the walls of the palaces of Venice, through the technique of \\"radiative capture of neutrons\\".\\"Tecnologie per la Cultura\\" (Technologies for Culture) page. 15 and following, Edizioni De Luca, Roma 1988  Importance of ENEA projects in Italy and abroad  In light of the important scientific value of ENEA researches in the conservation of Cultural Heritage promoted and coordinated by Maurizio Diana, in Italy and in the rest of the world an interest develops for the use of new technologies in this field. In 1988 Maurizio Diana, together with an ENEA delegation led by him, went to Moscow for \\"Italia 2000\\" (exhibition of Italian excellence organized by ICE) with the statue of \\"Aegis Jupiter\\" of the Archaeological Superintendency of Rome and exposes to the USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and the Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita performing live on the diagnostic techniques used on the statue . In 1989 he is appointed Director of Macro-structure Project \\"Technology for the Safeguarding of Artistic Heritage\\". This important project has achieved in 10 years of activity over 500 diagnostic interventions of many important works of art.\\"L'attività dell'Enea per i Beni Culturali\\" (The activities of ENEA for Cultural Heritage) page. 220 and following, ed. Il Torchio, Firenze 1995 The evolution of technologies applied to Cultural Heritage generated more interest in the academic and scientific worlds, and between the late eighties and early nineties Diana decided to channel this growing interest in the organization of three major international conferences devoted entirely to the relationship between heritage and science: in 1987 “Science as Art” in Rome,Proceedings of the round table “Art as a science”, card catalog of the National Library Service in 1992 \\"Art and Science\\" in Vinci, in 1993 \\"The Instruments of Memory\\" in Bologna. The team of Maurizio Diana, in the wake of considerable interest for the cutting-edge research in the field, participated in numerous international events, such as: the conference for the European project “Eureka! L'Europe” in Paris (1987), the World Expo in Seville (1992), the exhibition \\"Tecnova\\" in Madrid (1987), the conference \\"Worldtech\\" in Vienna in 1989. In 1993 Diana organized the ICE Week \\"Italian Technology for Cultural Heritage\\" in the city of Chicago, a major conference and exposition dedicated to technological innovation in the Italian sector. In support of the activities of ENEA for research in the field of conservation of cultural heritage he promoted and directed the publication of four volumes: “New technologies for the Protection of Artistic Heritage” (published by De Luca, 1985), “Technologies for Culture” (published by De Luca, 1988), “The Chimera of Arezzo” (ed. Il Torchio, Firenze, 1992), and “The activities of ENEA for Cultural Heritage” (ed. Il Torchio, Firenze 1995).  The 2000s: teaching and large restorations  After finishing his work at ENEA, Diana decided to continue his experience as a scientist of Cultural Heritage freelance and put at the service of the university his vast experience in the industry. In 2000 he was adjunct professor for the Course of “Technology Applied to Restoration and Conservation of Cultural Heritage” of the Faculty of Science, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, in 2002 is the founder and coordinator of the Training Course \\"Physical non-destructive investigations' of Cultural Heritage methods\\" at the Faculty of Physics. From that experience the book \\"Physical Methods for non-destructive investigations of Cultural Heritage\\", edited by Maurizio Diana together with Prof. Giovanni E. Gigante, later used as a study text in many Italian universities, would be born in 2005. For all the 2000s Maurizio Diana offered his professional expertise for the development of major projects of restoration of essential artistic goods and of cultural interest of the country. In 2003 he directed the scientific analysis of the restoration of the \\"Apollo of Veii\\" and the following year of the \\"Heracles of Veii\\", two important life-size clay statues in the Museum of Villa Giulia in Rome.Page on the restoration from the official site of the Apollo of Veii MIBACMinistry of Culture official press release on the restoration (.doc format)“Apollo of Veii: today in Rome is the restoration” in La Repubblica, July 15, 2004.“RESTORATION: handsome again as an Apollo” in Il Manifesto, July 15, 2004. In parallel with the restoration of the statues of Veii, he was responsible for the scientific analysis for the restoration of the Chapel of Italy in the St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta (Malta). 2005 is the year of the stone statue \\"The girl of Anzio\\" of the National Museum of Rome and in 2008 of the Lateran Obelisk, the Obelisk placed in Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, including the coordination of scientific investigations on the conservation status and the stability of the work.M. Diana, \\"The Lateran Obelisk, Scientific Investigations Report\\", Archaeological Superintendence of Rome, Rome 2008 In 2006, in the wake of this series of major renovations, Diana was rewarded by Legambiente at the launch of the campaign \\"Salvalarte\\" with the \\"Friends of Art Award\\" born to report \\"ten personas working in the cultural heritage that have distinguished themselves for having contributed to the restoration of works of art at risk, to carry on the battles in defence of the protection of cultural heritage, having returned to legality and citizens pieces of art stolen and/or violated, or for finding innovative ways of management and use of historical and artistic heritage\\".Official page of the “Friends of Art Award” The list of winners of the “Friends of Art Award”  Artistic activity  At the same time, Diana has joined the business of scientist as a painter started from the age of adolescence. In the sixties, following the trend of neo-figurative art in the wake of \\"the Roman School\\", in 1969 he worked in Paris in an avant-garde group (CAP, Comité d'Action Plasticien) experimenting and applying collective painting on current politics affairs through the production of \\"posters\\" for posting on the roads and for public debate (copies of these posters, donated by him, are preserved at the Musée de la Publicité in Paris). In the seventies, he worked with the gallery \\"Il Babbuino\\" of Rome, and participated in the Paris salons of the \\"Jeune Peinture\\" and \\"Figuration Critique\\". From the eighties he developed an innovative image composition method where great paintings become installations in which the images painted on canvas blend with landscapes and physical locations through a in black and white slide show and the variation of the intensity of the projected light. The eighties saw the production of many works that take advantage of this new compositional technique. The creation of works with this technique is immortalized in a documentary produced in collaboration with the director Luciano Emmer titled \\"The Last Supper? – Movements of Light and Sound\\". The first and second part of the video posted on the official Youtube channel of the artist From 2000 onwards he consolidated its presence abroad with solo and group exhibitions.

In the background his cloak hangs up to dry from a sunbeam (copper engraving, 1714) Saint Lucanus of Sabiona or Lucanus of Säben ( or Lugano; ; fl. 5th century; died 20 July), is a Roman Catholic saint of the fifth century, associated with the Dolomites and the Tyrol. He is often described as bishop of Säben, and later—erroneously—as bishop of Brixen in the South Tyrol.  Legend  Lucanus is scarcely known outside the immediate area of his labours and much that is said of him is legendary. He is said to have been a bishop of Säben, earlier Sabiona, above Klausen, in the first half of the 5th century (the bishops moved to Brixen in the 10th century). During a famine he allowed the consumption in his bishopric during the forty days' fast of Lent of milk, butter and cheese if they could be obtained. For this his enemies denounced him in the year 424 before Pope Celestine I, who ordered him to Rome. Lucanus set out, despite his advanced age, accompanied by a single servant. On the way his horse was killed and eaten by a bear: Lucanus commanded the bear in the name of God to take the horse's place, and then saddled and bridled it and rode it to Rome. Stopping overnight at an inn in Spoleto, Lucanus discovered that the landlord's wife was bedridden with dropsy, and cured her by praying at her bedside. He continued to Rome, and ordered a flock of partridges to fly ahead of him to the Pope as a gift, since he had nothing suitable to give him. When he arrived in Rome for his audience he wanted to take off his cloak, which was wet from the rain, but found nowhere to hang it, so threw it over a ray of sunshine, which supported it. When the Pope saw that Lucanus was in grace he declared him innocent and allowed him to return home with his blessing and rich presents. On his return, however, Lucanus was driven from Säben by his enemies and took refuge in the valley of Agordo in the modern Italian province of Belluno. There he was given food by a woman called Avatia (who was also venerated as a saint by the church in the valley). He became famous on account of his many miracles, and died there on a 20 July. His head was kept in Agordo, while his body was kept in a marble coffin in Belluno Cathedral. At the beginning of the 16th century an account of his life was compiled by the public notary of Belluno, Peter Paul von Diolaitis, although he did not give his sources.  Cult  Carl Pfaundler wrote in his book (published in 1843) Heiliger Tyroler-Ehrenglanz oder Lebensgeschichten — heiliger, seliger, gottseliger, frommer und ausgezeichneter Tyroler concerning the veneration of Lucanus to the following effect: In Brixen up to the early 17th century little or nothing was known of Lucanus: the old lists of bishops and other liturgical books of the region made no mention of him. Only after 1621, and after Bishop Hieronymus Otto Agricola had repeatedly re-published the breviary of Brixen of 1604, was Lucanus counted among the patron saints of Brixen Cathedral and officially venerated there. He had however for some considerable time previously been venerated in the church of Belluno as bishop of Säben. His cult grew after 1658, when Anton von Crosini, bishop of Brixen, sent Canon Johann Andreas von Rossi to Belluno in order to acquire some relics from Lucanus's grave for Brixen. With the agreement of the Doge and High Council of Venice as well as of the administrator and members of the council of Belluno, von Rossi took a shoulder-blade and a rib, with which he returned to Brixen on 3 October 1658. The relics were kept initially in the church of the Capuchins in Brixen until the following Sunday, 6 October, when they were solemnly translated to their resting-place in Brixen Cathedral. The feast day was established on 20 July, but only for the town of Brixen, not for the whole diocese. The relics were publicly venerated every year on this day, and sometimes also carried in processions with the relics of the other saints of the cathedral. In 1814 the relics of Lucanus were given new containers in the same form as the containers of the relics of patron saints of the diocese, Saints Ingenuin, Albuin and Hartmann. The bones of Lucanus remain today in Belluno Cathedral and in Brixen.  Patronage  Parish church of St. Lycanus in San Lugano (Truden) in the South Tyrol Lucanus is invoked as a protector against dropsy. San Lugano (in Truden) in the South Tyrol is named after him, and the parish church of Sankt Lukan is dedicated to him. In the diocese of Belluno-Feltre there at least two churches dedicated to him (San Lucano or San Lugano). The San Lugano Pass, the Alpine pass from the Etschtal into the Fleimstal and a valley near Agordo bear his name, as he is supposed to have stopped there both before and after his flight.  Iconography  The saint is represented with a mitre and with a cloak hanging to dry on a sunbeam. He is also shown riding a bear. This motif also occurs in the legends of Saints Romedius and Corbinian, who were active in geographical areas very close by, His feast days are 20 July and 27 July.Österreichischer Amtskalender 2004/2005, S. 1768Katholische Kirche Österreich, Liturgischer Kalender auf http://www.katholisch.at/ am 27. Juli 2013 – Quelle: Jakob Torsy, Hans-Joachim Kracht (2002): Der große Namenstagskalender. 3850 Namen und 1680 Lebensbeschreibungen der Namenspatrone, Verlag Herder, Freiburg  Other  He is not the same as the French Saint Lucanus of Loigny (also Lucian, Lucain, Lucien), of Loigny in Beauce. The French saint similarly lived in the 5th century but died a martyr by being beheaded; his feast day is 30 October. His relics are now in the cathedral of Notre-Dame, Paris. The name of the well- known place Lugano in Ticino, Switzerland, is not derived from this saint.

It operated from 1937 to 1960. The Chippewa-Hiawatha was one of several regional trains to carry the \\"Hiawatha\\" brand.  History  The Milwaukee Road introduced the Chippewa on May 28, 1937. The new train featured streamlined coach equipment and a running time two hours faster than previous services. Its original northern terminus was Iron Mountain, Michigan, north of Chicago in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trains operated daily, carrying number 21 northbound and 14 southbound. The northern terminus was extended twice: first to Channing in October and then finally in March 1938 to Ontonagon, on the southern shore of Lake Superior. In the fall of 1948 the Milwaukee Road re-branded the train Chippewa-Hiawatha and upgraded its equipment, including Beaver Tail parlor cars. Dieselization followed in 1950. After that the train was downgraded as the Milwaukee Road's passenger service contracted. Service north of Channing ended on December 29, 1953. Parlor service ended north of Milwaukee in 1956. In April 1957 the train's name reverted to the Chippewa. The Milwaukee Road discontinued the train altogether on February 2, 1960.  Equipment  An advertisement depicts a third-generation Beaver Tail car on the rear of the Midwest Hiawatha in the 1940s. The Chippewa received these cars in 1948. Much of the Chippewas equipment came second-hand from its more famous cousin. The original Chippewa operated with two coaches, a railway post office (RPO), dining car, and parlor car. As part of a reshuffling of equipment on the Milwaukee Road in late 1948 the Chippewa received the \\"Beaver Tail\\" parlors made famous by the original Hiawatha. Motive power was provided by Class A 4-4-2 steam locomotives between Chicago and Milwaukee, and by the Class F3 Pacifics north. Dieselization came in 1950 with Erie-builts from Fairbanks- Morse. Later diesels included EMD E7s, EMD FP7s, and finally EMD GP9s. The train received newer equipment in 1948, including third-generation Beaver Tail parlors. These cars were removed in 1951 along with the full dining car. Between 1950-1952 a Doodlebug replaced conventional equipment between Channing and Ontonagon.

Tensions grew between forces loyal to Kiir and Machar and South Sudan plunged into the South Sudanese Civil War.Niels Kastfelt, Religion and African Civil Wars, page 28. https://twitter.com/SPLMIO_Viva/status/1228922622106329088/photo/1 The party and militia are led by Riek Machar. Machar also appointed General Simon Gatwech Dual as Army Chief of General Staff, deputized by DCoGS for operations, training, political and moral orientation, logistics, administration and finance.  Etymology  During the Nasir convention in April 2014, the rebels in the South Sudanese Civil War were split on whether to maintain an affiliation with the ruling SPLM party. While Maj. Gen. Garouth Gatkuoth and many generals spoke against a SPLM affiliation, Angelina Teny and much of the leadership were in favor, leading Riek Machar to defer a final decision. The group decided on the provisional name SPLM-SPLA. Shortly after the meeting, however, the media began to call the group the SPLM-in- Opposition, due to its opposition to the governing SPLM party.  Politics  By May 2018, the SPLM/A-IO had set up a \\"parallel bush government\\" in Upper Nile, rivalling the government in Juba. People in rebel-held areas did no longer accept South Sudanese currency which had lost its worth due to hyperinflation, and instead used United States dollars and Ethiopian birr. The party's ideology (or in some cases, the lack thereof) is essentially identical to the original SPLM, and only differs in the fact that the split between the two was mostly along ethnic lines, with the SPLM-IO representing the same Nuer ethnic group as leader Riek Machar.  Armed wing  SPLA-IO soldiers in April 2016. The military forces of the SPLM-IO are known as \\"Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition\\" (abbreviated \\"SPLA-IO\\") and consist of deserters from the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), alongside the private armies of rebel warlords and tribal militias. Those elements of the South Sudanese military that joined the SPLA-IO have done so to protect tribal interests or felt marginalized by the government due to their previous membership in the SSDF. Despite attempts by Machar to attract other ethnic groups to his cause, the SPLA-IO is dominated by Nuer people. Parts of the SPLA-IO are known to recruit child soldiers. For weapons to fight the South Sudanese civil war, the SPLA-IO used a \\"shadowy\\" network of arms dealers, of which little is known other than that most of the gunrunners appeared to be European. A rare exception was the Franco-Polish arms dealer Pierre Dadak who was arrested on 14 July 2016 at his villa in Ibiza. At his villa, the Spanish National Police Corps allege that they found documents showing he was negotiating to sell the SPLA-IO 40, 000 AK-47 assault rifles, 30, 000 PKM machine guns and 200, 000 boxes of ammunition. In 2017 SPLA-IO lost the town of Pagak on the Ethiopian border during a government offensive. = Organization = The SPLA-IO did not have a formal military structure until the Pagak I conference in December 2014, after a year of war.

It was found by chance in the early nineteenth century and was later donated to the British Museum.British Museum Highlights Discovery Lochar Moss, located on the Solway Firth in southwest Scotland, was one of the largest raised peat lands in Europe until much of it was destroyed and reclaimed for agricultural and urban uses in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It was in the 1840s that two Iron Age objects, a bowl and torc, were accidentally unearthed during peat-cutting. Most scholars suggest that the two items were deliberately deposited in the bog as a votive or religious offering. They later came in to the possession of a local collector called Thomas Gray, who presented them both to the British Museum in 1853.British Museum Collection Description The Lochar Moss Torc was found inside a small bronze bowl, which helped to preserve it relatively intact. The collar is made of brass and is cast in two pieces: a solid crescent-shaped bar with engraved La Tène patterns and a series of hollow beads, one of which is missing. Although it was without doubt a prestigious item of jewellery that was cherished by the local community, it remains unclear who it originally belonged to and how the collar would have been worn by the wearer. The design of this type of neck-ring is unique to northern Britain during the early stages of the Roman colonisation of the province of Britannia.

Vacancy The vacancy had been caused by the death of the borough's 45-year-old Liberal MP Colonel Robert Edward Boyle, who had held the seat since the 1847 general election. Serving with the Coldstream Guards in the Crimean War, he died of fever in Varna, and was buried at sea. Boyle had been returned opposed in 1847 and in 1852, and was also unopposed at the by-election in 1853 which followed the annulment on petition of the 1852 result. Candidates Two candidates were nominated. Donald Nicoll was a tailor from London, and a former Sheriff of London. Richard Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan was a grandson of the 8th Earl of Cork, and a nephew of the late MP Robert Edward Boyle. The Earls of Cork had long dominated the borough in alliance with the Conservative-supporting Marquess of Bath, but their support for Dungarvan was controversial. At the West Somerset by-election in 1851, Dungarvan had stood as a Conservative, opposed to the Liberal government of Lord John Russell. He had staunchly opposed the Liberal principle of free trade, and Liberal opinion in Frome was further alarmed by tractarian support for Dungarvan. Nicoll had issued a statement supporting Liberal principles, and was invited to stand. He rapidly became the leading candidate. A Mr Curling from Southwark also addressed the voters, but soon abandoned his campaign and left Frome.  Election  The secret ballot was not used in British parliamentary elections until the passage of the Ballot Act 1872, so elections were still held in public. That was one of the many points of difference between the two candidates in Frome, with Nicoll supporting secret ballots while Dungarvan preferred public polls. The election in Frome began on Saturday 21 October, amidst such an uproar from the crowd that even those closest to speakers were unable to hear all that they said. Once the nomination formalities had been completed, both candidates addressed the crowd. Dungarvan spoke of his family's long history association with Frome, and how a secret ballot was un-needed because the townspeople were \\"not slaves\\". He derided Nicoll's claim to have given employment to the town, saying it was the \\"toil and sweat of the poor man\\" which allowed Nicoll to travel in such style from Regent Street. When it was Nicoll's turn to speak, the majority of the crowd cheered him. He proclaimed that he had always had been a free trader, and remained so. He was opposed to unfair and excessive taxation, and had no titled relatives to be supported by public sinecures. He said that while canvassing, the vast majority of those to whom he had spoken supported a secret ballot, and that all other reforms would be undermined without it. On a show of hands, the vast majority of those present supported Nicoll. However, Lord Dungarvan demanded a poll, which was set for Monday 23 October. Voting took place throughout the day on Monday, amidst scenes of disorder which The Times reported as involving \\"innumerable broken windows, and not a few broken heads\\". By 9am, Dungarvan had established a lead of 9 votes out of the 131 cast, and by the close of poll at 4pm his total of 181 votes was 52 ahead of Nicoll's 129. The disorder escalated, and at 7.15pm the Riot Act was read, and a unit of yeomanry with swords drawn entered the town to disperse the crowd.  Aftermath  Dungarvan held the seat for less than two years, before he succeeded to the peerage in 1856. This triggered another by-election, at which Nicoll was again an unsuccessful candidate, losing by only 1 vote.Craig records the 1856 poll as having been Boyle and Thynne. However, The Times and The Spectator both report that Thynne withdrew, and the poll was between Boyle and Nicoll Nicoll went on to win the seat at the 1857 general election, serving as Frome's MP for two years.

She obtained her Doctorate ès Sciences/State Doctorate in Mathematics in Nancy in 1985 under the supervision of .In the 1980s, there existed in France two levels of PhDs, the higher one, the Doctorate ès Sciences/State Doctorate being necessary to access professorships. It has since been replaced by the habilitation.  Career  Radhia Cousot was appointed Associate research scientist at the IMAG laboratory of the Joseph Fourier University of Grenoble (1975–1979) and, from 1980 on, at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, as junior research scientist, research scientist, senior research scientist, and senior research scientist emerita at the Computer Science laboratories of the Henri Poincaré University of Nancy (1980–1983), the University of Paris-Sud at Orsay (1984–1988), the École Polytechnique (1989–2008) where from 1991 she headed the research team “Semantics, Proof and Abstract interpretation”, and the École Normale Supérieure (2006–2014).  Scientific achievements  Together with her husband Patrick, Radhia Cousot is the originator of abstract interpretation, an influential technique in formal methods. Abstract interpretation is based on three main ideas. # Any reasoning/proof/static analysis on a computer system refers to a semantics describing, at some level of abstraction, its possible executions. # The reasoning/proof/static analysis should abstract away all semantic properties irrelevant to the reasoning. # Because of undecidability, sound, fully automated, and always terminating reasonings on/proofs/static analysis of computer systems must perform mathematical inductions in the abstract and so, can only be approximate (even with finiteness and decidability hypothesis, because of combinatorial explosion beyond tiny systems). In her thesis, Radhia Cousot advanced the semantics, proof, and static analysis methods for concurrent and parallel programs. Radhia Cousot is at the origin of the contacts with Airbus in January 1999 that lead to the development of Astrée run-time error analyzer from 2001 onwards, a tool for sound static program analysis of embedded control/command software developed at the École Normale Supérieure and now distributed by AbsInt GmbH, a German software company specialized on static analysis. Astrée is used in the transportation, space, and medical software industries.  Awards  With Patrick Cousot, she received the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award in 2013 and the IEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Society Harlan D. Mills award in 2014 for “the invention of ‘abstract interpretation’, development of tool support, and its practical application”.

NORAD's 1963 Chidlaw Building Combined Operations Center, then Cheyenne Mountain Complex in 1966 (top left), received SAC data (e.g., to allow relay of messages through northern NORAD radar stations for recalling SAC bombers.) In 1965, RCCs were at 13 \\"operational base command posts\\" (duplexed from different EDTCCs except for 4 RCCs with \\"short order sites\\"), and SRCCs were at 2 \\"missile site alternate command posts\\"—RCCs/SRCCs had a \\"Fault and Facility Control Panel.\\". One Offutt EDTCC communicated with 1 SRCC and 6 RCCs (with 2 circuits to the 1 local RCC), while the other Offutt EDTCC only had circuits to 4 RCCs (2 bomber, 2 ICBM). At the Numbered Air Force bases, circuits from one EDTCC were to 7 RCCs, and the other connected to 5 RCCs and 1 missile SRCC. The ITT 465L Strategic Air Command Control System (SACCS, SAC Control System, 465L Project, 465L Program) was a Cold War \\"Big L\\" network of computer and communication systems for command and control of Strategic Air Command \\"combat aircraft, refueling tankers, [and] ballistic missiles\\". International Telephone and Telegraph was the prime contractor for Project 465, and SACCS had \\"Cross Tell Links\\" between command posts at Offutt AFB, March AFB, & Barksdale AFB (SACCS also communicated with the Cheyenne Mountain Complex and Air Force command posts.

SAGE radar stations used AN/FST-2 sets for transferring data, and GATR sites and BOMARC Ground-to-Air Transmitter Facilities provided radio control for ground-controlled interception. An IBM AN/FSQ-32 transistorized SAGE central was announced in June 1958 and was to planned for in several NORAD nuclear bunkers, but the Super Combat Centers were cancelled in 196x. The transistorized central \\"was given to SDC to be used for the ARPA command-control R&D; program\\", and the USAF \\"later took back [the Q-32] from SDC to SAC HQ at Omaha\\" for the \\"ADEPT…status reporting system\\". http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/Science_and_Technology/DARPA/301.pdf \\"ADEPT, which accepted nearly natural-language computer commands and which could be operated initially on the time-sharing IBM 360/67's and later on other computers. ADEPT incorporated special provisions for security, and beginning in 1968 was used for some time at the National Command Center (NCC) and the Air Force Command Center. SAC also used ADEPT for its status reporting system, for which it later took back the Q-32 computer from SDC to SAC HQ at Omaha.39\\" In 1956, CINCSAC determined SAC's leased teleprinter (teletype) circuits and radio links were too slow, and SAC began using a computer in 1957. A SAC Liaison Team was located at the NORAD command post beginning 1 February 1958, and the 2 commands agreed direct land lines should connect SAC bases and Air Defense Direction Centers. After CONAD designated 3 \\"SAC Base Complexes\\" (geographical areas) by 1956--Northwestern United States, Montana- through-North Dakota area, and the largest: a nearly-triangular \\"South Central Area\\" from Minnesota to New Mexico to Northern Florida—NORAD's Alert Network Number 1 became operational on July 1, 1958, with the 1957 SAC nuclear bunker as 1 of the network's 29 transmit/receive stations.

In September 1960 the \\"installation of a SAC display warning system\\" included 3 consoles (e.g., BMEWS Display Information Processor (DIP) in the Offutt bunker and on 7 December I960, the 465L Program was cut to \\"\\"a most austere approach\\" (an austere air defense sector was also established for NORAD, which soon planned a smaller BUIC control system.) \\"In July 1961, the Department of Defense redirected SACCS 465L to a pre-strike system and established a separate [airborne] post-attack command control system with air and ground elements. by 1962, \\"SAC installations, inclusive of those overseas and of tenant bases, peaked at 85\\". \\"Project 465L, the SAC Control System (SACCS) [with] over a million lines, reached four times the size of the SAGE code and consumed 1,400 man-years of programming; SDC invented a major computer language, JOVIAL, specifically for this project.\\" SACCS \\"was delivered to Strategic Air Command by the contractor in March 1965\\" and was designed to survive nuclear attack and to provide rapid transmission, processing, and display of information to support command and control of SAC's geographically separated forces.

Obituary. p. 4Oxford Times, 12 March 2004, James Alder: Brass band leader. Obituary. p. 13 In 1951, noting that the band no longer had any significant connections to Headington, and reviving an idea first mooted in 1925,Reminiscence of James Alder, COSB archive the band changed its name once again to the City of Oxford Silver Band. The members probably sensing that a more direct association with the historic city would help to raise the band's profile. Challis's energy and drive, his interest in encouraging new young players and his emphasis on training led to the formation of the City of Oxford Youth Band and then, in 1970, the City of Oxford Junior Band. On 27 April 1975 the former achieved a world record by playing continuously for 28 hours and 45 minutes, witnessed by Roy Castle (presenter of BBC Record Breakers and an honorary vice-president of the band at the time).Oxford Mail, 2 May 1975, Blowing for a World Record1976 Guinness Book of Records In August 1976 the youth band also toured the United States and Canada and recorded an LP under the direction of Terry Brotherhood.

In 1997 the band secured eight trophies in five months and became London and Southern Counties Champions. In recent years its fortunes declined and by 2012 the band was playing in the fourth section. In March 2014, however, it secured promotion to the third sectionBrass Band Results and qualified for the National Finals.  Band Hall  The Headington Brass Band never had a permanent home of its own, plans for an ambitious band hall were drawn up in 1919 but it was never built. But in 1966 with the help of the Lord Mayor, the band was able to move to a purpose-built band hall in Temple Cowley.  The current band  The City of Oxford Silver Band currently comprises four units, a senior band for performing and competing, a training band, a beginners band and a reception class.

Bears at Brooks Falls feeding on sockeye salmon. Brooks Falls is a waterfall located within Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Located on the Brooks River a mile and a half (2.4 km) from Brooks Lake and an equal distance from Naknek Lake, the falls are famous for watching salmon leap over the 6 foot (1.8 m) falls to get to their Brooks Lake spawning grounds. Consequently, large populations of brown bears, also called grizzly bears, are attracted to feed on the spawning salmon. Brown bears usually congregate at the falls in July and early September, and many well-known photos of bears have been taken there. July witnesses the greatest concentrations of bears of any month at the falls; up to 25 bears have been seen at one time at Brooks Falls in that month. In September, a smaller number of bears (maximum about 18 at one time) can be seen at the falls to feast on the later salmon runs.  History  Before the 1950s, when Brooks Camp was opened, there were fewer bears at the falls than there are today, and no more than 6-7 bears could be observed at one time. Since hunting was allowed, bear numbers were lower and salmon and sport fishing was the primary attraction to the falls. Now, with hunting banned and viewing controlled, bear numbers have boomed to quadruple their former number. The site's archaeological human remnants date back some 9,000 years, some of the oldest human remains in North America. Since the site is not far from the Bering Land Bridge, it is quite possible that some of the first humans from Russia made villages here. Native Americans still continue to harvest food caches and live their own ways of life at a site not far from the falls known as the Old Savonoski Site. Despite all the old artifacts near the falls, most attention continues to focus on the bears and salmon; it is regular to find up to ten bears at the falls at one time. As many as 43 bears have been sighted at the falls in a single day. Brooks River and Falls with viewing platforms. Naknek Lake is to the left and Lake Brooks to the right. Brooks Falls Fish Ladder 1951 Counting salmon on the Brooks River Weir in 1958 Fish Ladder and Weir In 1921, Kidawik Creek was renamed Brooks River, and Toms Lake renamed Brooks Lake. A controversial \\"stream improvement\\" was implemented in 1920 by the United States Bureau of Fisheries, when they cut a 10 foot gap on the south bank of the river, which was widened to 15 feet the next year. Between 1948 and 1950, the bureau, by then reorganized into the United States Department of the Interior′s Fish and Wildlife Service (later the United States Fish and Wildlife Service), built a fish ladder in the gap as part of its \\"landscape improvements.\\" In 1974, the NPS closed the ladder and in 1986, placed sandbags to block salmon access. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game opposed a 1987 NPS proposal to dismantle the ladder, and the structure remains, though not used. Similarly, a seasonal weir for counting salmon was constructed in 1940 by the bureau, across the outlet of Brooks Lake at Brooks River. This was replaced by a permanent one in 1952. The bureau, renamed the National Marine Fisheries Service, transferred ownership of the weir to the NPS in 1978.

The film stars Rahsaan Noor, Monica Dogra, Kal Parekh, and Sorab Wadia in pivotal roles. The film is loosely inspired by true stories of the NYPD, FBI, and CIA's use of Muslim informants. The film was produced in English and in Hindi and premiered in the United States 15 April 2015. Plot Sabrina Jiwan is filming a news piece about a Muslim informant who was encouraged by the NYPD to entrap his victims. She proceeds to interview the informant, Taz Rahim, where he discloses his story. Six months earlier, Taz was a struggling rapper living in Jackson Heights, New York, an immigrant Bangladeshi neighborhood. To make ends meet he sells marijuana and is one day arrested by an undercover cop. Around the same time, Sabrina receives permission from Mo Khan to make a documentary about his congressional campaign. Later he is revealed to have impregnated his mistress. After spending a few days incarcerated, Taz meets with the undercover cop, whose real name is Nick Patel. Nick threatens to deport Taz unless he agrees to work as a Muslim informant. Taz proceeds to get involved with the neighborhood mosque under the guise that he is trying to turn his life around. While working with his new friends, Taz’s path collides with Sabrina's. On the recommendation of Ali Uncle, Sabrina decides to hire Taz as an intern for her documentary. As time passes on, discussions prompted by Taz concern his friends at the mosque. They decide to report to the NYPD and Nick Patel that they believe Taz is a terrorist planning a terror attack. News of accusation spreads through the community and Mo asks Sabrina to fire Taz from her documentary. Nick is also thinking about removing Taz from the operation after the embarrassment but Taz is able to convince Nick to give him one more chance. Taz then convinces Ali Uncle to talk to Mo about giving Taz another chance. In a private discussion, Mo requests Taz to murder his mistress. Taz feels that he has enough evidence to arrest Mo but is rebutted by Nick, whom wants to arrest Mo for terrorism not murder. Nick encourages Taz to pretend to move forward with Mo’s request in an attempt to uncover real terrorist activities. Unsure whom to trust, Taz moves forward with the plot to murder Mo’s mistress and then goes missing. Nick begins to feel the heat from his superiors and interviews Sabrina about Taz’s disappearance and his connection to the murders of two women at a local strip club. Sabrina does not have any information. Later she is confronted by Taz on the street where he reveals the truth to Sabrina that he is being framed by Mo. Eventually, she is convinced of Taz’s innocence and she plans to help him gain his freedom by having him confess to being an informant. Back in the present, Sabrina releases her interview with Taz. In a final showdown, Taz is able to get Mo arrested with an admission of guilt and the help of Nick. In the end, it is revealed that Taz faked the murder of Mo’s mistress in an effort to put pressure on Nick to arrest Mo. Taz now has his freedom but is scarred by all things he did to let people down in his life.

In recent years, he has been the judge of numerous controversial cases.Judge Salavati, Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1YGEtGLrU He is currently sanctioned by the United States and the European Union. He is one of the judges whom human rights organizations have highlighted as being the instruments of a crackdown on journalists and political activists under the influence of Iran's intelligence and security apparatus. Besides Salavati, the other revolutionary court judges include Mohammad Moghiseh, former justices Yahya Pirabbasi and Hassan Zareh Dehnavi (known as judge Haddad), judge of Court of Media Bijan Ghasemzadeh and appeal judges Hassan Babaee and Ahmad Zargar. These judges are accused of overseeing miscarriages of justice in trials in which journalists, lawyers, political activists and members of Iran's ethnic and religious minorities have been condemned to lengthy prison terms, lashes and even execution.http://artsfreedom.org/iran-musician-sentenced-to-five-years-in- prison-and-74-lashes/ Career Iranian human rights and political activists call him Iran's Hanging Judgehttp://www.iranian.de/Main/bar- ressie%20bidaadgari-haaye%20JE.htm along with Mohammad Moghiseh and Pir- Abbasi. A decision to show clemency to 81 of the people detained in the unrest that followed last year's presidential election in Iran has once again shone the spotlight on the country's judicial and penal systems. On June 2, 2013, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved a recommendation by the head of the judiciary. Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, to release some of the 81 under amnesty and reduce the sentences of the rest.http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2013/09/130923_l39_ejei_political_prisoners_exonerated.shtml None of those eligible has been named, but most had been convicted by Revolutionary Court system, which is separate from the civil judiciary and are tasked with dealing with threats to the Islamic regime and the constitutional order. As such, they led the way in trying people detained in the wave of arrests that followed protests sparked after 2009 presidential election. Within the Revolutionary Courts, three judges – Abolghasem Salavati, Mohammad Moghiseh and Pir-Abbasi – stand out for their role in presiding over joint and individual trials involving hundreds of defendants. Although some of these trials were held in public, the three judges remain shadowy figures. It is unclear what their legal backgrounds are, or how they came to be appointed. There are few public pictures of Moghiseh or Pir-Abbasi, and they do not appear at public events. Pir-Abbasi's full name is not confirmed. A human rights lawyer in Tehran, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, \\"What they have in common is that they impose sentences that do not correspond with the crime committed; they ignore the defence case put by defendants and their lawyers; they approve indictments that have no legal basis; they are unfamiliar with the law and legal matters; and they undeniably come out with erroneous rulings.\\" Salavati is somewhat better known than his two colleagues. Millions of people remember his face from televised trials where he sat in judgement over hundreds of defendants. At least 12 death sentences are believed to have been passed against alleged participants in the protests that followed the June 2009 re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president, and Salavati was responsible for half of these, winning him the grim nickname \\"Judge of Death\\". Salavati is rumoured to have acquired his post as head of Revolution Court branch thanks to the backing of former intelligence minister Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i. His name first became publicly known in December 2006 when he passed death sentences against two defendants for the 2005 murder of Masoud Ahmadi Moghaddasi, deputy chief prosecutor for Tehran and himself a Revolutionary Court judge, who headed the same branch that Salavati later took charge of. Moghadas also presided over countless trials of dissidents and journalists, including that of prominent investigative journalist Akbar Ganji whom he sentenced to 15 years in jail. In January 2009 Salavati found four people guilty of colluding with the United States government against Iran for working on an HIV/AIDS prevention programme. Arash and Kamyar Alayi, brothers who were both doctors, got six- and three-year sentences, respectively, while Silva Haratounian and Mohammad Ehsani received three-year terms. The Alayi brothers’ \\"crime\\" seems to have been to participate in a seminar held by the non-government Aspen Institute in Washington. Salavati was unmoved by the defense argument that they were not working with the American government. No evidence was produced in court to support the prosecution case, and the judge simply based his decision on the indictment document submitted by Iran's intelligence ministry. The indictment, posted on the internet by the International Campaign For Human Rights in Iran, amounts to little more than a confused story of alleged US interference in Iran, rather than specific factual evidence. Salavati seems to have proved his credentials with this case. His judicial backing for the intelligence agency's pursuit of alleged dissidents made him the ideal candidate to take a leading role in the post- election trials of 2009, the biggest political cases in two decades. In that role, Salavati sat in judgement over some of Iran's most prominent political figures such as one-time vice president Mohammad Ali Abtahi, former deputy speaker of parliament Behzad Nabavi; former government spokesman Abdollah Ramezanzadeh and a number of others from government and parliament. Human rights groups called for Salavati to be suspended from his post because of the unswervingly harsh verdicts he issued based on thin evidence. When the first hearings of 100 detainees were heard, Salavati read out an indictment similar in style to the one used in the Alayi trial. The defendants were accused of various misdeeds, very few of which constitute a crime under the law. Despite the paucity of evidence, Salavati passed sentences of up to 15 years in prison and ordered the death penalty for two alleged protesters, Arash Rahmanipour and Mohammad Ali Zamani. Both men were arrested months before the June presidential election. Rahmanipour's lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran that both the trial and the investigation that preceded it were deeply flawedhttp://www.iranhumanrights.org/2010/01/sudden-and-unannounced-execution- of-two-political-prisoners-audio-interview-with-attorney/ \\"He told me that during two interrogation sessions, his sister was brought into the room and seated opposite him. He was then told that if he wanted her to go free, he must confess to whatever he was told,\\" she said. \\"I was Arash's lawyer, but I was never allowed to participate in his trial. I insisted to be allowed to attend a trial session in August [2009] but security officers threatened to arrest me and confiscated my lawyer's license, which they returned to me only later.\\" Sotoudeh said she was shocked that the two convicted men were executed in secret, and their families and lawyers informed only after the fact. Another controversial case was heard following the December 2009 protests over the election result, which coincided with the Shia holy day Ashura. Salavati sentenced 20-year-old student Mohammad Amin Valian to death on a single piece of evidence – the defendant's own confession that he threw three rocks during the unrest. The extreme nature of the sentence led to an outcry from international and domestic human rights groups. On appeal, the death penalty was commuted to a three-year prison term, a decision which lends weight to the argument that the original judge, Salavati, was swayed more by political than judicial interests. Another defendant convicted by Salavati, and released once he had served his term, said the judge seemed a little vague on the detail of charges, which in his case involved alleged contact with foreign organizations and meetings with political figures abroad. \\"When I asked what foreign organization and which individuals [I met], he couldn’t even name them. I was accused of a range of charges but my entire court hearing lasted no more than eight minutes,\\" said the former prisoner, who did not want to be named. \\"From the nature of the court proceedings, you could tell the judge had already made up his mind. My appearance there with a lawyer was merely to uphold the pretence of due process.http://iwpr.net/report-news/irans-hanging-judge Lawyers involved in such political cases believe Salavati merely signs off on the indictments brought by the intelligence agency, and agrees to the sentences they request. \\"In none of these cases has there been enough evidence to justify even holding my clients in custody,\\" said one lawyer. \\"No judge with any dignity would confirm such verdicts.\\" The decision to show clemency to 81 prisoners comes just ahead of the first anniversary of the disputed presidential election. It is clearly an attempt to show the Supreme Leader has a merciful side, in contrast to the harshness shown by judges like Salavati who in the space of about three months, presided over questionable trials and severe sentences including numerous applications of the death penalty.Iran's Hanging Judge, http://iwpr.net/report-news/irans-hanging-judge In September 2014 he presided over the case of a man, Mohsen Amir-Aslani, executed for Heresy for describing Jonah and the Whale as an allegory.

These contracts are usually regulated by countries' labor laws, to ensure that employers still fulfill basic labour rights regardless of a contract's form, particularly unjust dismissal. Generally, fixed-term contracts will automatically be deemed to have created a permanent contract, subject to the employer's right to terminate employment on reasonable notice for a good reason. In the European Union the incidence of fixed-term contracts ranges from 6% in the UK to 23% in Spain, with Germany, Italy and France between 13% and 16%. By country Due to the potential job insecurity that multiple fixed-term contracts may cause, employment laws in many countries limit the circumstances and the way these contracts may be used. In countries where labour law is more restrictive (compensation/indemnity for dismissal), the differentiation between fixed-term and permanent contracts tends to be clearly set out in law. Where employment legislation is less protective for the employee there tends to be a lesser degree of differentiation between fixed and permanent contracts. =Belgium= There are two possibilities to contract successive fixed-term contracts: # Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of two years: A maximum of four successive fixed-term employment contracts, where the minimum duration of each contract is three months and the total duration of all the successive contracts is not longer than two years. # Successive employment contracts with a maximum term of three years: With the prior authorisation of the Belgian Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue, successive fixed-term contracts can be concluded with a minimum duration of six months if the total duration of all the successive contracts do not exceed three years. =France= The maximum term is twenty four months and may be extended once only =Germany= Fixed-term contracts may not be extended more than three times with a maximum total period of two years. = India = India allows fixed term employment since 2018.

The river is famous for its large concentrations of brown bears and salmon. The salmon arrive mostly in July, having spent their lives in Kamishak Bay, and when they ascend the river to spawn it is an attraction to the largest concentration of brown bears anywhere on earth. Up to 144 brown bears have been identified at the river during a single summer with as many as 72 bears congregating in one place at a time. The river's entire 35 mile (55 km) length lies within the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, created in 1967 by the State of Alaska to protect the numerous Alaska brown bears who frequented the area. It also lies entirely within the Kenai Peninsula Borough boundaries. The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge is part of a piece of land that is protected from hunting; the rest of this is Katmai National Park. Mother brown bear with her cubs near the McNeil River. More famous for its bear population than for the size of the river or the strength of its salmon runs, McNeil River has been featured on many television and film documentaries. So well-known has the area become as a bear-viewing area that in 1973 the State of Alaska began limiting the number of summer visitors to ten per day during peak visitor months of June, July, and August. The area has also been \\"wired\\" for webcam remote viewing for those unable to access the river in person. Various groups have been formed to support keeping the area pristine and free from bear-hunting activity. And while the bear population often wanders outside the protected zone their numbers have gradually continued to rise over the years. In 2007, a group of conservationists managed to keep the state game refuge north of the sanctuary closed to bear hunting. Prior to the hunting debate, bears were legally hunted in the state game refuge north of the sanctuary. As a consequence, bear numbers at the falls dropped and the number of different individual bears decreased. Now, with better hunting and viewing regulations, bear numbers at the falls have risen again. The ADFG and the Friends of McNeil River have fought to keep the area closed to hunting and offer yearly ID books to help viewers identify each bear. July is by far the best month to view bears; up to 100 have visited the falls in one day in that month.

Biography Patrick Cunningham was an Irish shoemaker who immigrated to New Bedford, Massachusetts from Dundalk at the age of nine. He trained with his father to become a cobbler, but joined the Union Navy during the American Civil War where he learnt about, and became interested in, engineering and explosives. He deserted the Navy in 1865 and after returning to New Bedford, established a shoemaking business. Inventions Cunningham, along with Bernard Cogan created the Iron Cunningham & Cogan whaling gun, patented in 1877. In 1892 Cunningham built a 17 foot long torpedo capable of carrying 125 pounds of explosive; ownership of the explosive went to the company of which he was president. The torpedo did not have propellers or screws as was typical for torpedoes, but instead had spirals around its body, in order to make it spin similar to that of a bullet fired from a rifle. It was tested at the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station in July 1893, and found to be unsuitable for use due to its short range and poor trajectory. On October 31 1896, towards the end of the presidential election, Cunningham fired the torpedo down New Bedford's high street during a rally for the Republican candidate. The torpedo traveled haphazardly down the street before crashing into a shop which collapsed before the explosive detonated, causing massive structural damage to the surrounding buildings. Though no-one was killed multiple people were injured in the blast. Cunningham was arrested and charged with maliciously destroying a building. Cunningham went on to build more torpedoes, and in 1898 tested two of them by firing them from a schooner he had purchased. The first fired correctly but the second exploded inside the ship and caused it to immediately sink; no one was hurt.

The album captures Mellencamp's live performance at Town Hall in New York City on July 31, 2003, in which he performed every track from his 2003 Trouble No More covers album as well as several other songs, including his own \\"Small Town\\", \\"Paper in Fire\\", and \\"Pink Houses\\".

Shakespeare and the Bible, Oxford University Press, p. 13 Marx further notes that \\"it is possible that Shakespeare sometimes regarded his own role of playwright and performer as godlike, his own book as potent and capacious as 'The Book'.\\"Marx, Steven (2000). Shakespeare and the Bible, Oxford University Press, pp. 12–13 It is important to note, as a recent study points out “The diversity of versions reflected in Shakespeare’s writing indicates that ‘Shakespeare’s Bible’ cannot be taken for granted as unitary, since it consists of a network of different translations” DeCook, Travis and Alan Galey, eds. Shakespeare, the Bible, and the Form of the Book. New York: Routledge (2011) p. 9.  Specific examples  * In 2 Henry VI, Shakespeare suggests his own biblical verses. Per Shaheen:  “The many biblical references that occur throughout the play are Shakespeare’s own. Shakespeare’s use of Scripture in the play can be seen in the way he drew the character of the king. [Edward] Hall depicts Henry as \\"a man of a meke spirite, and of a simple witte, preferryng peace before warre, reste before businesse, honestie before profite, and quietnesse before laboure…. There could be none, more chaste, more meke, more holy, nor a better creature…. He gaped not for honor, nor thirsted for riches, but studied onely for the health of his soule: the savyng wherof, he estemed to bee the greatest wisedome” [Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke, first published in 1548] (3.105). But Hall makes no biblical references when depicting Henry as a meek, pious ruler, void of ambibition. Shakespeare, however, gives the entire play a religious cast, and puts many biblical references and religious expressions in the mouths of his characters.”  \\"Some of these religious utterances strongly suggest Scripture, but do not seem to be biblical references.\\" Shaheen notes for example the lines \\"O Lord, that lends me life, Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!\\" (1.1.19–20) and \\"God's goodness hath been great to thee. Let never day nor night unhallowed pass, But still remember what the Lord hath done.\\" (2.1.82–84) contain \\"strong overtones of Scripture, but no actual references seem to be involved. The play contains many similar passages that are difficult to deal with, passages that are best classified as religious sentiments rather than actual biblical references.\\"Shaheen, Naseeb (1999, 2011). Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, Newark: University of Delaware Press, p. 301. * In 3 Henry VI, Shakespeare took a biblical theme from a prior source and expanded its usage of biblical references. Per Shaheen:  “[Edward] Hall's theme [per his Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre and Yorke, first published in 1548] was moral. He sought to demonstrate God's providence towards England, and repeatedly points out that those who commit evil will sooner or later be punished. Yet his account contains very few biblical references. Inspired by Hall's theme of divine retribution, Shakespeare adds biblical references that reflect that theme (1.4.168 \\"My blood upon your heads!\\"; 2.2.129 \\"Their blood upon thy head.\\"; 2.6.55 \\"Measure for measure must be answered.\\").”  \\"An example of how Shakespeare added biblical references to what he found in his sources can be seen in the passage in Hall relating the death of Warwick's brother. Hall simply says: “He [Lord Fitzwater] was slayne, and with hym the Bastard of Salisbury, brother to the erle of Warwycke, a valeaunt yong gentelman.\\" (3.181). In 2.3.14–23 Shakespeare expands that statement into a passage that contains at least three biblical references:” * 2.3.15: Thy brother’s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk. (Genesis 4.10–11) * 2.3.17: And in the very pangs of death he cried. (Compare 2 Samuel 22.5) * 2.3.22: [Possible biblical reference] \\"gave up the ghost\\" (Genesis 49.33; Compare also Genesis 35.18; Matthew 27.50; Acts 5.10) * 2.3.23: Then let the earth be drunken with our blood! (Per Shaheen, \\"A common biblical expression.\\" Compare Judith 6.4; Isaiah 49.26; Revelation 17.6. Compare also Deuteronomy 32.42; Jeremiah 46.10; Ezekiel 39.19)Shaheen, Naseeb (1999, 2011). Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, Newark: University of Delaware Press, pp. 324, 328–9. * In Henry V, Shakespeare adds biblical themes to his prior sources. Per Shaheen: “[T]here is nothing in any of Shakespeare's sources that is parallel to Henry's discussion on the responsibility for war and the fate of the soldiers who die therein (4.1.124-91), or to Henry's musings on kingship (4.1.230-84), which contain a large number of biblical and liturgical references. These passages with their references are original with Shakespeare.\\"Shaheen, Naseeb (1999, 2011). Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, Newark: University of Delaware Press, p. 449. * Per Shaheen, “Shakespeare’s use of the book of Revelation in Antony and Cleopatra is outstanding…. Since only three chapters of Revelation were read during Morning and Evening Prayer in the Church of England (…[reference to chapters and church days]…), Shakespeare must have privately read much of Revelation shortly before of during the composition of the play.\\" He further states, \\"The references to Exodus in act 3 scene 13 are also noteworthy.\\"Shaheen, Naseeb (1999, 2011). Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, Newark: University of Delaware Press, p. 644. * Per Shaheen, Timon of Athens \\"provides rare insights into his manner of composition and has several biblical references that are of considerable interest.\\" He further states, \\"As is Shakespeare's custom throughout his plays, his use of Scripture in Timon is primarily intended to serve dramatic ends rather than to have theological significance.\\"Shaheen, Naseeb (1999, 2011). Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays, Newark: University of Delaware Press, pp. 670, 671. * In Macbeth, Act IV, Scene iii, Macduff offers his assistance to Malcolm, saying, “Thy royal father / Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee, / Oftener upon her knees than on her feet / Died every day she lived.” The last part is a direct allusion to 1 Corinthians 15, verse 31: \\"I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.\\" All of the foregoing examples as provided by Shaheen suggest that Shakespeare was well-acquainted with the Bible and its various themes via individual verses spread throughout its various chapters enough so that he could easily expand upon any said theme with his own continuation of such verses.  Versions of the Bible used by Shakespeare  = Geneva Bible = R. A. L. Burnet states: “[A]s Professor E. P. Dickie has pointed out to me, words found in the margin [of the Geneva Bible] will not have circulated very readily nor become proverbial sayings. Shakespeare would not have heard these words either in church or in conversation; he could only have read them.\\"Burnet, R. A. L. (April 1979). \\"Shakespeare and the Marginalia of the Geneva Bible,\\" Notes and Queries 26(2), p. 113. = Bishop's Bible = = Tomson's New Testament = = Rheims New Testament = Although Naseeb Shaheen's important study calls attention to three references to the Rheims translation of the New Testament, it overlooks a number of other allusions or correspondences. For example, Matthew 3.2 is translated in the Tyndale, Geneva, Great and Bishops’ translations as “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” but in the Rheims translation it is “Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” This significant difference in translation, of importance for the Catholic sacrament of penance and the theological notion of satisfaction for sins, occurs numerous times in the Rheims New Testament and nineteen times in Shakespeare's plays. There are some seventy other possible references, according to David Beauregard Beauregard, David. \\"Shakespeare and the Rheims New Testament (1582): Old Claims and New Evidence\\" Renascence XLVII.2 (2015), 107-26.

They are affiliated to Cavan GAA. History In 1889 there were three clubs in the parish, Arva Davitts, Killeshandra National Leaguers and Cornafean Tom Moronies. By the 1890s the G.A.A. had more or less died out in the area. However, by 1900 it began to re-emerge. In 1901 there were two teams in the parish, Drumanery Emmets and Killeshandra De Wits. Throughout the next few years various teams in the parish would come and go. During the 1910s and 1920s the Leaguers had great difficulty in surviving as a club. Cornafean, founded in 1908, would quickly establish itself as one of the leading clubs in the county competing at Senior Level Football. The glamour of playing senior football with this great club attracted many of the best players in the surrounding areas of Killeshandra, Arva, Kilmore, Gowna and Lacken. The 1930s was to mark the beginning of a great era for Cavan football. The parish of Killeshandra could boast of some of the best of the Cavan team. It didn't matter whether they played for Cornafean or for the Leaguers, they were all sons of the parish and they brought a sense of pride to the people of the parish. At an A.G.M held in the Market House in 1932 the Leaguers we re-formed and a new committee was elected. Success happened when in 1935 they reached their first junior championship final. In the final they played Crubany and won easily by 11 points to 1. The team was also known as Croghan during that period. In 1939 they reached their second Junior Final against Crubany. Croghan went on to win. As a result of this victory Killeshandra went Senior, but this lasted for one year only. This would be the last major championship win for 31 years. During the 1940s many good and loyal players served the club and from these Des Benson who won an All-Ireland with Cavan in 1948 playing in goals. By the late fifties the club had lapsed but it was revived again at an A.G.M in 1960. By 1970 the team was back in winning form. After a gap of 31 years they again won the Junior Championship beating Butlersbridge in the final. In 1971 the Leaguers were defeated in the Intermediate final by Redhills In 1981 The Leaguers were promoted to Division 2 and also they won the Division 5 League title defeating Knockbride. 1982 Again the Club won the Division 5 League Title. In 1982 also the \\"Inspiration of the Club\\" - Sergeant Peter Maguire died in Breffni Park while the Club were playing Killygarry in that year's championship. In 1982 - The Killeshandra Leaguers Pitch - \\"Parc Phadraig Ui Dhoibhlinn\\" was officially opened in this year also. 1983 saw The Leaguers winning the Junior Championship by defeating Kill in the final. In 1984 the Club gained promotion to Division 1 and also defeated Drung in the Division 2 League Final. 1986 saw the Club defeat Cuchullans in the Intermediate Championship Final. This was a \\"Golden Period\\" for the club and in 1987 they finished 4th in Division 1 League Table. By 1991 they were again on their winning ways by defeating Munterconnaught in the Intermediate Championship Final. In 1992 they were beaten by a Ramor United side (who went on to win the Senior Championship) in the Quarterfinal of that year's competition. By 1993 some of this set of players had begun to retire and due to these losses the Club were relegated to Division 2 that year. The decline continued and the Club were relegated to Division 3 in 1996. In 1997 somewhat of a revival of fortunes began with the Club winning the Division 3 League Title and also by gaining promotion to Division 2 that year also. The Club remained in Division 2 for years but were then relegated to Division 3 where we they remained until a youthful new team emerged from what was a \\"promising young underage team\\" to win the Junior Championship and League in 2007. This brilliant young team went on to be the first Cavan junior Team to represent the County in an Official GAA Ulster Council Championship Quartetr Final - where they comprehensively defeated the Antrim Champions Aughohill in fine free flowing style in Breffni Park, Cavan. Inexperience proved the undoing of the side when after a disappointing first half performance against \\"The Rock\\" from Tyrone this young side were narrowly defeated.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for St. Stephen, New Brunswick. St. Stephen was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943–1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 5 October 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 6 February 1944. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 July 1944 at Esquimalt. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda in October 1944, St. Stephen was allocated to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-5. She spent the better part of her service as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She returned to Canada in June 1945 to undergo a tropicalization refit at Dartmouth for possible service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water-cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. The refit was cancelled in August 1945 due to the surrender of Japan. St. Stephen was paid off 30 January 1946 at Halifax and laid up in Bedford Basin. =Postwar service= After the war St. Stephen was refit and recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy as a weather ship on 27 September 1947. She spent the next three years at weather station 4YB (Station \\"Baker\\") between Labrador and Greenland, on rotation with an American ship. The frigate was fitted with a special mast and sail for use in heavy weather for better maneuverability and fuel consumption. In August 1950 she sailed to Esquimalt where she was paid off on 31 August 1950 and lent to the Department of Transport. The Department of Transport had just acquired and altered two other River-class frigates, and , to place on station in the Pacific as weather ships. St. Stephen was held in harbour as a spare, in case either of the other two required replacement. In 1955 she was refit to look like other weather ships in service with the Department of Transport but remained in reserve in Victoria. She was purchased outright in 1958 by the Department of Transport and remained in service for another ten years. In 1969 she was sold for mercantile use, for use as a fish factory ship.

Therefore, PMW integrates software performance engineering (SPE) and application performance management (APM) activities. SPE and APM are part of different lifecycle phases of an AS, namely systems development and IT operations. PMW supports a comprehensive coordination of all SPE and APM activities, which is inevitable due to an increased complexity of AS architectures. The term \\"performance management work\\" was first introduced by Brunnert et al. (2014) in Business & Information Systems Engineering as well as in the German WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK'\\".  Context  The dependency on AS increases in many areas, such as in critical infrastructures like traffic control or power supply. Therefore, AS have to meet growing functional and non-functional requirements. An essential non-functional quality factor is called performance, which is described by the metrics response times, resource usage and throughput. Such metrics are used to define performance goals. In order to ensure performance of AS, these metrics have to be constantly measured and assessed. Guaranteeing appropriate performance is a major challenge since AS have evolved to complex system of systems. Furthermore, different subsystems of AS undergo a continuous life cycle and lie within the responsibility of different organizations. The resulting complexity requires new approaches for performance management of such system of systems architectures with a multilateral IT governance. Existing approaches such as SPE or APM focus on certain stages of a life cycle. However, a comprehensive approach is missing, which not only addresses the complexity of systems and organizations but also integrates their life cycles.  Framework  Performance management work framework System architectures used to be monolithic consisting of one large single construct. They have progressed to distributed architectures and further to system of systems architectures. An interrelation between system of systems architectures and IT governance is the allocation of several systems to different organizations or organizational units. Similarly to the expansion of system architecture, the former unilateral IT governance becomes a multilateral IT governance with special needs for organizational integration. The subsystem lifecycle is an iterative process from system development to IT operations, whereas both parts involve different goals. The system development (Dev) is responsible for implementing new features and functionalities to cover functional requirements. In contrast, an IT operations (Ops) team monitors AS and ensures its maintenance and stable state. Traditional SPE activities support Dev teams to meet non- functional requirements such as response times or scalability. In doing so, performance goals and metrics can be defined and measured through load testing. A method to achieve performance goals at an early stage of development are performance models. They can be created using design models and are applied as input for simulation engines and analytical solvers. Traditional APM activities support Ops teams to ensure performance goals mainly by meeting service level agreements (SLA). APM activities have to ensure that sufficient capacity is available to ensure that performance goals can be met. Furthermore, APM activities help to evaluate changes in one or several subsystems. Nowadays, DevOps concepts try to better integrate activities in both life cycle phases. Communication as well as collaboration between both parts support that performance goals can be met. Similarly, SPE and APM activities must be integrated as well. PMW combines SPE and APM activities. By exchanging performance metrics and goals, Dev teams are able to receive information about performance from Ops and vice versa. For instance, Dev teams can use performance information from Ops to enhance performance models. Consequently, they are able to simulate and predict metrics as well as detect bottlenecks more precisely. As a result, performance issues can be eliminated more efficiently. These improved capabilities lead to higher quality Dev deliverables and, thus, support Ops as well. PMW also implies an integration of the three perspectives System Lifecycle, System Architecture and IT-Governance. PMW activities have to be allocated to organizational units. For that purpose, Information exchange and communication principles have to be established in order to support PMW activities.  Capabilities  The integration of PMW activities offers new opportunities. It generates transparency among resource requirements and demands of systems. This leads to a better allocation of hardware, licensing and other costs to organizational units and enables to reduce overall costs. Since these transparencies are also available at an early stage, cross-organizational investments are able to be more cost-efficient. For instance, the choice of cloud or service providers can be more targeted as knowledge about performance metrics allows a better bargaining position. Furthermore, PMW activities help to evaluate performance in the IT value-added chain of cross-organizational AS. This increased transparency of performance metrics across different subsystems also helps to identify bottlenecks and over- and underutilized resources. As this information helps to allocate resources more efficiently across organizations, it also contributes to reduce energy demands of AS and supports environment- friendly systems and green IT.

Description The remote creek flows through Churchill River Upland portion of the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests and is surrounded by mixed forest with stands of black spruce, white spruce, jack pine, and trembling aspen. The shoreline is characterized by steeply sloping irregular rock ridges and poorly drained areas of muskeg. Mistik Creek area is largely pristine and home to moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, and beaver. It is part of the range of the Naosap woodland caribou herd. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle and hawk owl. The creek is not easily accessible, but there is some trapping, hunting, and recreational fishing activity. Etymology Mistik is Cree for \\"Tree\\". The river is notable including fourteen lakes named in numeric order in Cree. The fourteen lakes listed by their Cree names with the English translations in order from south to north are: *Payuk Lake = One (outflow) *Neso Lake = Two *Nisto Lake = Three *Nao Lake = Four *Niyanun Lake = Five *Nikotwasik Lake = Six *Tapukok Lake = Seven *Uyenanao Lake = Eight *Kakat Lake = Nine *Mitatut Lake = Ten *Payukosap Lake = Eleven *Nesosap Lake = Twelve *Nistosap Lake = Thirteen *Naosap Lake = Fourteen (source) Course The river begins in Naosap Lake, and the upper lakes lie in very irregular basins with low banks surrounded by muskeg and flows slowly. Downstream, the lakes become smaller and the river portions form continuous rapids.

It was built in 1901 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, on the site of an earlier bridge built in 1850 by the New Hampshire Central Railroad, and carried its tracks across the Piscataquog River in the center of Goffstown. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and destroyed by arson in 1976. Description and history The Goffstown Covered Railroad Bridge was located in the village center of Goffstown, just east of the bridge carrying New Hampshire Route 114 (Main Street) across the Piscataquog River. The bridge was oriented at an angle to the banks of the river, on granite slab abutments that are still visible, capped in concrete. The bridge was a single span truss structure with a clear span of and a total structure length of . Its trusses were a combination of Town lattice trusses and Pratt trusses, with an integrated laminated arch. Portions of the trusses have iron reinforcements in the form of turnbuckles. The bridge had an inside horizontal clearance of and a vertical clearance of . The railroad deck was supported by a web of timbers anchored into the trusses. The first bridge on the site was built about 1850 by the New Hampshire Central Railroad. In 1895 the line came under control of the Boston and Maine Railroad, which built this bridge as a replacement in 1901. The line, which originally ran to Henniker, was abandoned to Goffstown (ending short of this bridge) in the 1930s, and was still in operation to that point when the bridge was listed on the National Register in 1975. The bridge was destroyed by a deliberately set fire on August 16, 1976. Smoke from the fire could be seen as far as Manchester, eight miles away. Heat from the burning bridge was so intense that paint blistered on the fire engines parked nearby. At the time, the Boston & Maine Railroad was still serving two customers on the western side of the river, Kendall-Hadley Lumber and Merrimack Farmers Exchange. Despite this, the B&M; decided not to replace the bridge. Freight service still ran on the line east of the river until total abandonment in 1981.https://www.bmrrhs.org/abandonment-notices See also *List of New Hampshire covered bridges *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire References Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Bridges completed in 1901 Category:Bridges in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Goffstown, New Hampshire Category:Railroad bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in the United States destroyed by arson Category:Wooden bridges in New Hampshire Category:Pratt truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Goffstown Covered Railroad Bridge"},{"id":"42794448","text":"Al Jazeera America News, also referred to as Al Jazeera America Newshour or simply (Weekend) News, is a news program that aired on Al Jazeera America.

Stories it has debunked include fake videos claiming to depict Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, myths that the 2013 supermoon appeared bigger than it really did, and a \\"Simon Ashton\\" hoax claiming that emails from Simon Ashton should not be opened because doing so will lead to your computer being hacked.

He was senior scholar of Christ Church from 1931-1933. He then became a senior researcher in the Department of Thermodynamics at Oxford, 1933-1935. This was followed by excursions as a Dewar Fellow of the Royal Institution, London, 1936-1940 as Principal Experimental Officer at the Ministry of Supply, 1940-1945 and as Professor of Chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast, 1945-1954. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. In 1954, Ubbelohde became a professor of thermodynamics at Imperial College London, a position he held until 1975. In 1961 he was awarded CBE; from 1961 to 1975 he was the head of the Chemical Engineering Department at Imperial College; following this he was a senior research fellow at Imperial College from 1975-1988. Research Ubbelohde's research interests included chemical thermodynamics, combustion, explosions and detonations, ionic melts, graphite and intercalation compounds. His group was the first to synthesise highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Over the course of his career, Ubbelohde wrote six books and some 400 publications. Ubbelohde was the chair of the Solvay Conferences on Chemistry (London), from 1959 to 1980. The Ubbelohde effect, which is the observation that deuteration increases hydrogen bond length, is named after him. He is also credited with coining the term proton conductor. He also is known for studying life from a thermodynamic perspective, (ch. 9: Life and Thermodynamics, pg. 92-105) and for his eccentric study of the thermodynamics of pigs. In 1960 he bought a pig farm where he raised over 100 pigs and studied them from a thermodynamic perspective. He authored numerous books on chemistry during his career. Awards and honours Ubbelohde was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951. He received the Liversidge Award of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1959.

History Labor unions generally bypassed government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service. =Postal unions= Post Office workers did form unions. The National Association of Letter Carriers started in 1889 and grew quickly. It had 52 branches with 4,600 members in 1890, and 335 branches by 1892. It focused on forcing postmasters to honor federal law mandating an 8 hour day for federal employees. In 1893 it won a Supreme Court decision and $3.5 million in back overtime pay. Local postmasters vigorously opposed the union. It joined the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1917. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches. Two organizations of postal clerks emerged in the 1890s; they merged in 1899 into the United National Association of Post Office Clerks (UNAPOC). It was too conservative for the AFL, which in 1906 sponsored the National Federation of Post Office Clerks (NFPOC), which soon surpassed the UNAPOC. NFPOC grew from 16,000 members in 1922 36,000 in 1932, and nearly 50,000 by 1940. It did not engage in strikes, but spent much of its efforts in opposing hostile Congressional legislation. Additional rivals were formed in the 1930s but the first serious rival was the National Postal Clerks Union (NPCU) that began in 1958 and by 1970 reach the membership of 80,000. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks. Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members.Gary M Fink, ed., Labor Unions (1977) pp 291-94 The postal unions did not engage in strikes, but there was the U.S. postal strike of 1970, a two-week wildcat walkout in New York City and 12 other cities by 200,000 of the 750,000 postal employees. It was not officially sponsored and ended when the Army started delivering the mail in \\"Operation Graphic Hand.\\"William Gardner Bell, ed., Department of the Army Historical Summary: Fiscal Year 1970 (1973) page 15 =1919= Historian Joseph Slater, says, \\"Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s.\\"Joseph Slater, \\"The Boston Police Strike in Aaron Brenner et al. eds. The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History (2011) It came in the strike-ridden year of 1919 when the Boston city police formed a union, affiliated with the AFL, and walked out on strike. A severe popular backlash came as looting of stores and street violence broke out that terrorized citizens. Governor Calvin Coolidge sent in the National Guard; there were hundreds of casualties and at least nine deaths. Richard L. Lyons, \\"The Boston Police Strike of 1919.\\" New England Quarterly (1947): 147-168. in JSTOR Coolidge broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials. The episode made Coolidge nationally famous--he became the Republican nominee for Vice president in 1920.Francis Russell, A city in terror: Calvin Coolidge and the 1919 Boston police strike (Beacon Press, 1975) The police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), affiliated with the AFL. In suburbs and small cities, the National Education Association (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.Marjorie Murphy, Blackboard Unions: The AFT and the NEA, 1900-1980 (1992) Police unions in the United States revived in the 1960s and 1970s after enabling state and federal legislation. =New Deal era= Unionization remained uncommon among government employees outside the Post Office. In the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Chad Alan Goldberg, \\"Contesting the Status of Relief Workers during the New Deal The Workers Alliance of America and the Works Progress Administration, 1935-1941.\\" Social Science History (2005) 29#3 pp: 337-371. Moe points out that Roosevelt, \\"an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector.\\" Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: > All Government employees should realize that the process of collective > bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public > service. It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to > public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of government make > it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the > employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.

Such action, looking toward the paralysis of Government by > those who have sworn to support it, is unthinkable and intolerable. The Wagner Act of 1935 facilitated unions in the private sector but did not apply to the public sector in state or local government, since the federal government could not interfere in state government.Richard C. Kearney and David G. Carnevale, Labor relations in the public sector (2001) pp 1-22 =\\"Little New Deal\\" era= Change came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor Robert Wagner, Jr. issued an executive order, called \\"the little Wagner Act,\\" giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.) Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.Anthony C. Russo, \\"Management's View of the New York City Experience,\\" Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science Vol. 30, No. 2, \\"Unionization of Municipal Employees\\" (Dec., 1970), pp. 81-93 in JSTOR The first U.S. state to permit collective bargaining by public employees was Wisconsin, in 1959. Collective bargaining is now permitted in three fourths of U.S. states. By the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.David Schultz, Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy (2004) p. 143 Recent years After 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.U.S. Census Bureau, \\"Census Bureau Reports State and Local Government Employment Remains at 16.6 Million\\" (press release Aug. 10, 2010) Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees there were 20 million government employees. In 2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,This includes some people who are covered by union contracts but are not themselves members. including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local workers.Bureau of Labour Statistics, \\"Table 3. Union affiliation of employed wage and salary workers by occupation and industry\\" As Daniel Disalvo notes, \\"In today's public sector, good pay, generous benefits, and job security make possible a stable middle- class existence for nearly everyone from janitors to jailors.\\"Daniel Disalvo, \\"The Trouble with Public Sector Unions,\\" National Affairs\\" (issue 5 Fall 2010) In 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9m and 7.4m respectively. In 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack especially in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain. Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.

It is similar to mergesort, but it is a cache-oblivious algorithm, designed for a setting where the number of elements to sort is too large to fit in a cache where operations are done. It was introduced by Matteo Frigo, Charles Leiserson, Harald Prokop, and Sridhar Ramachandran in 1999 in the context of the cache oblivious model.M. Frigo, C.E. Leiserson, H. Prokop, and S. Ramachandran. Cache- oblivious algorithms. In Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 99), pp. 285-297. 1999. Extended abstract at IEEE, at Citeseer.Harald Prokop. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms. Masters thesis, MIT. 1999.  Mathematical properties  In the external memory model, the number of memory transfers it needs to perform a sort of N items on a machine with cache of size Z and cache lines of length L is O \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{N}{L} \\\\log_{Z} N \\\\right), under the tall cache assumption that Z = \\\\Omega(L^2). This number of memory transfers has been shown to be asymptotically optimal for comparison sorts. Funnelsort also achieves the asymptotically optimal runtime complexity of \\\\Theta(N \\\\log N).  Algorithm  = Basic overview = Funnelsort operates on a contiguous array of N elements. To sort the elements, it performs the following: # Split the input into N^{1/3} arrays of size N^{2/3}, and sort the arrays recursively. # Merge the N^{1/3} sorted sequences using a N^{1/3}-merger. (This process will be described in more detail.) Funnelsort is similar to merge sort in that some number of subarrays are recursively sorted, after which a merging step combines the subarrays into one sorted array. Merging is performed by a device called a k-merger, which is described in the section below. = k-mergers = A k-merger takes k sorted sequences. Upon one invocation of a k-merger, it outputs the first k^3 elements of the sorted sequence obtained by merging the k input sequences. At the top level, funnelsort uses a N^{1/3}-merger on N^{1/3} sequences of length N^{2/3}, and invokes this merger once. The k-merger is built recursively out of \\\\sqrt{k}-mergers. It consists of \\\\sqrt{k} input \\\\sqrt{k}-mergers I_1, I_2, \\\\ldots, I_\\\\sqrt{k}, and a single output \\\\sqrt{k}-merger O. The k inputs are separated into \\\\sqrt{k} sets of \\\\sqrt{k} inputs each. Each of these sets is an input to one of the input mergers. The output of each input merger is connected to a buffer, a FIFO queue that can hold 2k^{3/2} elements. The buffers are implemented as circular queues. The outputs of the \\\\sqrt{k} buffers are connected to the inputs of the output merger O. Finally, the output of O is the output of the entire k-merger. In this construction, any input merger only outputs k^{3/2} items at once, but the buffer it outputs to has double the space. This is done so that an input merger can be called only when its buffer does not have enough items, but that when it is called, it outputs a lot of items at once (namely, k^{3/2} of them). A k-merger works recursively in the following way. To output k^3 elements, it recursively invokes its output merger k^{3/2} times. However, before it makes a call to O, it checks all of its buffers, filling each of them that are less than half full. To fill the i-th buffer, it recursively invokes the corresponding input merger I_i once. If this cannot be done (due to the merger running out of inputs), this step is skipped. Since this call outputs k^{3/2} elements, the buffer contains at least k^{3/2} elements. At the end of all these operations, the k-merger has output the first k^3 of its input elements, in sorted order.  Analysis  Most of the analysis of this algorithm revolves around analyzing the space and cache miss complexity of the k-merger. The first important bound is that a k-merger can be fit in O(k^2) space. To see this, we let S(k) denote the space needed for a k-merger. To fit the k^{1/2} buffers of size 2k^{3/2} takes O(k^2) space. To fit the \\\\sqrt{k} + 1 smaller buffers takes (\\\\sqrt{k} + 1) S(\\\\sqrt{k}) space. Thus, the space satisfies the recurrence S(k) = (\\\\sqrt{k} + 1) S(\\\\sqrt{k}) + O(k^2). This recurrence has solution S(k) = O(k^2). It follows that there is a positive constant \\\\alpha such that a problem of size at most \\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{Z} fits entirely in cache, meaning that it incurs no additional cache misses. Letting Q_M(k) denote the number of cache misses incurred by a call to a k-merger, one can show that Q_M(k) = O((k^3 \\\\log_Z k)/L). This is done by an induction argument. It has k \\\\le \\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{Z} as a base case. For larger k, we can bound the number of times a \\\\sqrt{k}-merger is called. The output merger is called exactly k^{3/2} times. The total number of calls on input mergers is at most k^{3/2} + 2\\\\sqrt{k}. This gives a total bound of 2 k^{3/2} + 2 \\\\sqrt{k} recursive calls. In addition, the algorithm checks every buffer to see if needs to be filled. This is done on \\\\sqrt{k} buffers every step for k^{3/2} steps, leading to a max of k^2 cache misses for all the checks. This leads to the recurrence Q_M(k) \\\\le (2k^{3/2} + 2 \\\\sqrt{k}) Q_M(\\\\sqrt{k}) + k^2, which can be shown to have the solution given above. Finally, the total cache misses Q(N) for the entire sort can be analyzed. It satisfies the recurrence Q(N) = N^{1/3} Q(N^{2/3}) + Q_M(N^{1/3}). This can be shown to have solution Q(N) = O((N/L) \\\\log_Z N).  Lazy funnelsort  Lazy funnelsort is a modification of the funnelsort, introduced by Gerth Stølting Brodal and Rolf Fagerberg in 2002.. See also the longer technical report. The modification is that when a merger is invoked, it does not have to fill each of its buffers. Instead, it lazily fills a buffer only when it is empty. This modification has the same asymptotic runtime and memory transfers as the original funnelsort, but has applications in cache-oblivious algorithms for problems in computational geometry in a method known as distribution sweeping.

It is similar to quicksort, but it is a cache-oblivious algorithm, designed for a setting where the number of elements to sort is too large to fit in a cache where operations are done. In the external memory model, the number of memory transfers it needs to perform a sort of N items on a machine with cache of size Z and cache lines of length L is O(\\\\frac{N}{L} \\\\log_Z N), under the tall cache assumption that Z = \\\\Omega(L^2). This number of memory transfers has been shown to be asymptotically optimal for comparison sorts. This distribution sort also achieves the asymptotically optimal runtime complexity of \\\\Theta(N \\\\log N).  Algorithm  = Overview = Distribution sort operates on a contiguous array of N elements. To sort the elements, it performs the following: # Partition the array into \\\\sqrt{N} contiguous subarrays of size \\\\sqrt{N}, and recursively sort each subarray. # Distribute the elements of the sorted subarrays into q \\\\le \\\\sqrt{N} buckets B_1, B_2, \\\\ldots, B_q each of size at most 2 \\\\sqrt{N} such that for every i from 1 to q-1, every element of bucket B_i is not larger than any element in B_{i+1}. This distribution step is the main step of this algorithm, and is covered in more detail below. # Recursively sort each bucket. # Output the concatenation of the buckets. = Distribution step = As mentioned in step 2 above, the goal of the distribution step is to distribute the sorted subarrays into q buckets B_1, B_2, \\\\ldots, B_q. The distribution step algorithm maintains two invariants. The first is that each bucket has size at most 2 \\\\sqrt{N} at any time, and any element in bucket B_i is no larger than any element in bucket B_{i+1}. The second is that every bucket has an associated pivot, a value which is greater than all elements in the bucket. Initially, the algorithm starts with one empty bucket with pivot \\\\infty. As it fills buckets, it creates new buckets by splitting a bucket into two when it would be made overfull (by having at least (2\\\\sqrt{N}+1) elements placed into it). The split is done by performing the linear time median finding algorithm, and partitioning based on this median. The pivot of the lower bucket will be set to the median found, and the pivot of the higher bucket will be set to the same as the bucket before the split. At the end of the distribution step, all elements are in the buckets, and the two invariants will still hold. To accomplish this, each subarray and bucket will have a state associated with it. The state of a subarray consists of an index next of the next element to be read from the subarray, and a bucket number ' indicating which bucket index the element should be copied to. By convention, bnum = \\\\infty if all elements in the subarray have been distributed. (Note that when we split a bucket, we have to increment all ' values of all subarrays whose ' value is greater than the index of the bucket that is split.) The state of a bucket consists of the value of the bucket's pivot, and the number of elements currently in the bucket. Consider the follow basic strategy: iterate through each subarray, attempting to copy over its element at position next. If the element is smaller than the pivot of bucket ', then place it in that bucket, possibly incurring a bucket split. Otherwise, increment ' until a bucket whose pivot is large enough is found. Though this correctly distributes all elements, it does not exhibit a good cache performance. Instead, the distribution step is performed in a recursive divide-and-conquer. The step will be performed as a call to the function distribute, which takes three parameters i, j, and m. distribute(i, j, m) will distribute elements from the i-th through (i+m-1)-th subarrays into buckets, starting from B_j. It requires as a precondition that each subarray r in the range i, \\\\ldots, i+m-1 has its bnum[r] \\\\ge j. The execution of distribute(i, j, m) will guarantee that each bnum[r] \\\\ge j+m. The whole distribution step is distribute(1,1,\\\\sqrt{N}). Pseudocode for the implementation of distribute is shown below: def distribute(i, j, m: int) -> None: \\"\\"\\"Distribute through recursive divide-and-conquer.\\"\\"\\" if m  1: copy_elems(i, j) else: distribute(i, j, m / 2) distribute(i + m / 2, j, m / 2) distribute(i, j + m / 2, m / 2) distribute(i + m / 2, j + m / 2, m / 2) The base case, where m=1, has a call to the subroutine copy_elems. In this base case, all elements from subarray i that belong to bucket j are added at once. If this leads to bucket j having too many elements, it splits the bucket with the procedure described beforehand.

The franchise's first video game, it was released as a tie-in to the 2001 Planet of the Apes film, though the plot is inspired by Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel and the 1968 film adaptation. Fox Interactive contracted Visiware to develop the game for Windows and PlayStation and partnered with Ubi Soft as co-publisher. Torus Games developed a Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color versions, which are based on the 1968 film and its 1970 sequel. In Visiware's game, the player controls Ulysses, an astronaut who crashes on a future Earth where intelligent apes dominate humans. Ulysses explores various environments, aiding a human resistance movement who regard him as a prophesied savior and uncovering the secrets underlying ape society. Versions of series characters, such as Zira, Cornelius, Zaius, Ursus and Nova, appear alongside new characters and species. The game's release was delayed for three years due to problems with the long postponed film remake and Fox Interactive's decision to co-publish with another company. The delays were such that the game missed the film's release date. When it finally debuted on September 20, 2001, it met with largely negative reviews on the PlayStation and PC along with mixed reviews on the Game Boy versions, with the chief criticism being its weak controls and gameplay. Gameplay Planet of the Apes is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view. The player controls Ulysses, an astronaut who has crash-landed on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes, with whom he must engage in battle to survive. For this, he utilizes unarmed hand-to-hand combat, clubs, knives and firearms. Items, such as weapons, may be collected in the inventory for later use. There are three different modes by which to explore any given level: Normal (non-violent traversal), Athletic (violent conflict) and Stealth (covert action). The game also features puzzle solving, like searching down a key card to unlock the next level. The player's progression can only be saved with the completion of each level. Synopsis After drifting in space for centuries, astronaut Ulysses and his crew crash land on a planet in the year 3889. They find primitive humans, but are attacked by hunters on horseback who are revealed to be intelligent apes. The apes kill the crew and capture Ulysses, bringing him to a medical center for study. Human slave Jonah sneaks Ulysses a key that allows him to escape. Exploring the center, Ulysses overhears the apes Zira and Dr. Zaius discussing his fate; Zaius wants him executed. Eventually, Ulysses fakes his death and is brought to a morgue. There, Jonah and his friends reveal that Ulysses is on Earth, and that his arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy that a savior would return to restore humankind. The human rebels give Ulysses one piece of an ancient relic and instruct him to retrieve the other two hidden by other tribes of humans. Ulysses heads to a ruined city, where he frees the human Nova and finds the second relic piece guarded by gorilla General Ursus. He also finds a secret file revealing that Ursus plans to use chimpanzee Dr. Cornelius' human genetics research, combined with information gleaned from studying ancient human sites, to advance the gorillas over the other apes. With help from Nova and her brother Mathias, Ulysses heads to Ape University, where Cornelius agrees to destroy his research so the gorillas cannot misuse it. Ulysses attempts to rescue Jonah from an ape prison; Jonah dies, but tells Ulysses the final relic piece is in the State Archives. Ulysses recovers the final piece and returns to Nova and Mathias. The three pieces combine to form a map to the \\"Forbidden Place\\", located at the Statue of Liberty, which leads to The Pentagon. There, he learns the history of how the apes took over the planet: after a devastating war, humans bred genetically advanced apes as slaves. The apes rebelled and killed most humans; survivors escaped to a subterranean \\"Ark Project\\". Ulysses makes contact with the Arkanites, advanced humans still living underground, and encourages them to reunite with their brethren on the surface to defeat the apes. With his evidence, Ulysses travels to the Ape Palace to expose General Ursus before the council. Ursus is arrested, and Dr. Zaius releases Ulysses. The closing scene shows Ulysses departing with Nova, while the human forces and Arkanites amass to attack the apes. Development =PC and PlayStation version= In 1998, 20th Century Fox greenlit the most recent of several attempts at a Planet of the Apes film remake, to be produced by James Cameron. The company's video game division Fox Interactive prepared to develop a video game tie-in. Cameron dropped out and the film project went on hold, but confident a remake would progress sooner or later, Fox proceeded with the video game. It was the first ever Planet of the Apes video game; Fox had attempted a game for the Atari 2600, but abandoned it amid the video game crash of 1983 (new designers completed and released this game as Revenge of the Apes in 2003). Fox Interactive contracted French video game developer Visiware to design the Planet of the Apes game. With the film in limbo, the creators developed a new story inspired by Pierre Boulle's original novel Planet of the Apes and the 1968 film version. The designers felt an action- adventure game would best suit the material and available technology. They developed the game for PC, PlayStation, and Sega Dreamcast, though they scrapped the Dreamcast version when Sega discontinued the console. Rather than publish the game themselves, Fox Interactive opted to co-publish with a third party. This move, which industry professionals took as a sign that Fox Interactive was in decline, resulted in major production delays. The game was officially announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 1999. The film project subsequently went forward under director Tim Burton; the film, released as Planet of the Apes in 2001, had a substantially different premise and story than the video game. Fox launched a major marketing campaign for the game in 2000, but release was delayed into 2001. Despite the long development, the game missed the July 27, 2001 debut of Tim Burton's film, though Fox Interactive stated that they hoped it would reduce confusion among consumers expecting a straightforward tie-in. On September 6, 2001, Fox Interactive announced a new co-publishing partnership for all its titles with Ubisoft, enabling them to finally release Planet of the Apes. The PC version appeared in stores on September 20, 2001; the PlayStation version was finally released on August 22, 2002. =Game Boy version= In addition, Ubisoft planned a version for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. Created in partnership with developer Torus Games, the games were released December 5, 2001 and December 31, 2001, respectively. The Game Boy version is considerably different from Visiware's PC and PlayStation game; it is a side-scroller and follows the plot of the 1968 film and its 1970 sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes. The player controls human Ben (originally known as Brent in Beneath the Planet of the Apes) as he searches for the films' hero, Taylor, over the course of ten levels, fighting ape warriors and other enemies. Reception During its long delayed development, Planet of the Apes generated bad pre-release press. Its gameplay was poorly received at its Electronic Entertainment Expo previews, with many commentors comparing it unfavorably to similar older games like Doom. Additionally, some critics considered Fox Interactive's decision to hire Visiware a misstep, as French developers of the period had a reputation for creating games with solid graphics but poor play. Others questioned the wisdom of basing the game on the decades-old original films rather than the remake. Upon release, the PC and PlayStation versions received negative reviews from critics. Looking at the PC version, review aggregator website Metacritic calculated a score of 41/100 based on eleven critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". By comparison, GameRankings calculated a score of 48.79% for the PC version, based on fourteen reviews, and 60.00% for the PlayStation version, based on one review. Erik Wolpaw of GameSpot called Planet of the Apes an \\"ugly, boring Tomb Raider clone\\", considering the game's environments, combat mechanics, and puzzles weak. Ivan Sulic of IGN wrote, \\"it's not that Planet of the Apes is truly bad across the boards -- just that it's truly mediocre,\\" finding the controls and gameplay middling and the graphics out of date. Nick Woods of AllGame enjoyed the dialogue-heavy story sequences, but wrote that the positive elements could not make up for the nauseating interface and movement. GameZone's review found the sound and graphics to be highlights, but wrote that overall, the game \\"doesn’t really toe the mark\\". The Game Boy versions received mixed reviews. Looking at the Game Boy Advance version, Metacritic calculated an average score of 54/100 based on six reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". GameRankings calculated a 59.44% average for the Game Boy Advance version, based on nine reviews, and a 40.00% average for the Game Boy Color version, based on one review. Hilary Goldstein of IGN gave the game a rating of 6.0 out of 10, calling it a \\"decent side-scroller that fails to truly impress\\".

Personal life  Born in 1957 in Abertillery, Monmouthshire, Hill still lives in the area (2015). Hill is a strong advocate of tennis and the personal, social and sporting benefits associated with the game. As such he devotes much of his time to working with young people with the aim of helping tennis progress in the town, region and Wales as a whole.  Playing career  Hill started tennis at a very early age at his local “Six Bells” tennis club. Trained by Bob Wallace, the former Secretary of the Welsh Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), he won early rewards as a Welsh Junior Doubles champion and singles semi-finalist before going on to represent Wales at British junior grass courts level. His playing career continued in much the same vein through senior tournaments. He was a multiple Welsh Doubles Championship finalist, a Wales international player and captained his county side. By 2015 at veteran level Hill had gone on to win 15 Welsh titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. On the UK circuit, Hill together with his doubles partner Tony King of Birmingham, was a finalist or winner of the over 55 British Grass Court Doubles championships for 6 years running. They were outright winners on 3 occasions including in 2013 when the tournament was held at Wimbledon. The International Tennis Federation ranks players from all over the world and it was in that year that Hill achieved his so far career best world ITF “top -10” ranking. Again in the same year he was awarded “Welsh Tennis Player of the Year” by the Wales Lawn Tennis Association. In total by 2015 he had been a Wimbledon Champion and achieved over 75 Wales and Great Britain title wins.  Coaching career  Hill’s first venture into coaching came at just 16. It continued for more than 30 years on a part-time basis alongside full-time employment in the steel industry. Redundancy gave him the freedom to take up professional coaching. In 2011, Hill was shortlisted by “Tennis Wales” for Welsh Tennis Coach of the year. That same year he coached Special Olympics tennis player Shain Lewis who went on to win two bronze medals at Athens.https://www3.lta.org.uk/in-your- area/Wales/news/2011/July-11/Shain-achieves-double-bronze-at-Special-Olympics/ Lewis was selected from the competing 6000 athletes to give the closing ceremony speech to 60,000 spectators, and worldwide TV.

The property consists of six extant structures on a parcel in Huntington Beach, Orange County, California. The C.M. Furuta Gold Fish Farm and the Wintersburg Japanese Mission are recognized nationally by historians as a rare, pre-1913 Japanese pioneer-owned property with intact physical features that convey the progression of Japanese American history. The property is noted as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in the City of Huntington Beach General Plan in 2014. Historic Wintersburg is representative of Orange County's early agricultural history and the West Coast's immigration and civil liberties history. Three generations of Japanese American experience are represented: immigration of the Issei in the late 19th century, exclusion and Alien Land Laws of the early 20th Century, the incarceration of American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II, and the return to California from World War II confinement in 1945. The property's modern history dates to the land purchase by Japanese immigrant pioneers in 1908, as part of the former land holdings of the Rancho Las Bolsas. Its pre history includes centuries of occupation by the Tongva, a native people of California. The effort to save and preserve Historic Wintersburg began several years after the property was sold in 2004, when news became public that the new owner planned re-zoning to commercial / industrial uses demolition of all historic and cultural resources. Preservationists have been working with the current property owner for permission to stabilize the structures to prevent demolition by neglect.Demolition by Neglect, Preservation Law Education Materials, National Trust for Historic Preservation, http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/law-and-policy/legal- resources/preservation-law-101/resources/Demolition-By-Neglect.pdf The goal of historic preservation is to create a permanent heritage site with public park uses.  National Treasure  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, Washington, D.C., named Historic Wintersburg a National Treasure in October 2015, remarking, \\"this place honors the Japanese-American experience and the longstanding impact of a people whose tangible history was largely erased by anti-immigrant policies and incarceration during the 20th century.\\" The National Trust stated that Historic Wintersburg is \\"among the only surviving Japanese-American properties acquired before California passed anti-immigrant land laws in 1913 and 1920. Further, as the entire Wintersburg community was incarcerated during World War II, the site is iconic of our nation’s civil rights history and a reminder of the struggle for social justice that many immigrant communities continue to face today.\\"  One of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places  Historic Wintersburg was named one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places on June 24, 2014, by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.Wintersburg Makes the Endangered List, Huntington Beach Independent, June 24, 2014, http://www.hbindependent.com/news/tn-hbi- me-0626-wintersburg-endangered-20140624,0,1306063.story It is considered significant as a Japanese-owned property acquired prior to the Webb-Haney Act, or California Alien Land Law of 1913, which prohibited Japan-born residents from owning property. Historic Wintersburg is endangered because the current land owner rezoned the property in 2013 from residential to commercial / industrial uses, and submitted plans to demolish all six of the site's historic structures. The structures range in age from 70 to 105 years, marking the history of Japanese settlement of the American West as well as the return to California after World War II forced evacuation and confinement in detention and relocation centers. The Historic Wintersburg site includes six extant structures: 1910 Japanese Presbyterian Mission, 1910 Manse (parsonage), 1934 Great Depression-era Japanese Presbyterian Church, 1912 Furuta bungalow, Furuta barn (1908–1912), and 1947 post-World War II Furuta ranch house.Urashima, Mary Adams (2014). Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach. History Press, Historic Wintersburg is part of the 19th-Century Wintersburg Village in north Orange County, annexed into Huntington Beach in 1957. The Historic Wintersburg property ownership pre-dates California’s Alien Land Laws of 1913 and 1920—state laws that prohibited those ineligible for citizenship, primarily Japanese immigrants, from property ownership. The property, originally five acres, was purchased by Reverend Hisakichi Terasawa and Charles Mitsuji Furuta in 1908.Land deed of March 2, 1908, Orange County Recorder, Orange County Archives In 1912, it was deeded by Reverend Terasawa to Charles Mitsuji Furuta in its entirety,Land deed of February 28, 1912, Orange County Recorder, Orange County Archives with an understanding the small, northwest portion of the land would house the Japanese Presbyterian Mission.  Japanese American settlement of the American West  The Historic Wintersburg property is representative of the era of Japanese pioneer arrival and settlement of the American West, as well as the pursuit of citizenship and civil liberties by early 20th Century Japanese immigrants.

Wintersburg Japanese Mission The Wintersburg Japanese Mission originally was founded as a non- denominational, multi-faith and multi-ethnic effort by Christian and Buddhist supporters, first meeting in borrowed spaces in the Wintersburg Village before the acquisition of property in 1909. The clergy who assisted with the founding in 1904 represented the Episcopalian, Methodist and Presbyterian denominations.

The Church history describes clergy walking into the celery fields to meet and talk with Japanese immigrants in 1902. Originally meeting in a borrowed barn or cottages in Wintersburg Village, the Mission was founded in 1904, constructed its first buildings in 1910, and formally recognized as an official church by the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. in 1930. The church exists today as the Wintersburg Church in Santa Ana, California, and remains a predominantly Japanese American congregation. In 2014, the present-day Church separated from the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., returning to its roots as a non-denominational Christian church. The Church was issued a formal apology by the Presbytery of Los Ranchos in 2014 for non action more than seven decades earlier during World War II. The apology explained that \\"while members of the Japanese-American congregation were being relocated, neither the national Presbyterian denomination nor the regional presbytery took a stand on behalf of their members, taking a mostly hands-off position.\\" The Presbytery of Los Ranchos determined the Church could retain their property and assets, and would not have to meet a reimbursement requirement for leaving the denomination. The official apology acknowledged, \\"though we cannot remove the pain that has been experienced as a result of the neglect of our forebears, we wish to extend our deepest apologies to the generations of Wintersburg Presbyterian Church who were and continue to be affected by the abandonment of your brothers and sisters...for the absence of advocacy, the neglect of care and failure of leadership of the church parents we commonly claim, the people of your presbytery humbly request your congregation’s forgiveness.\\"Making Amends: Los Ranchos Presbyterys apologetic dismissal of Wintersburg congregation, The Layman Online, September 2014, http://www.layman.org/making-amends-los-ranchos-presbyterys-apologetic- dismissal-wintersburg-congregation/  Japanese Mission Trail  Historic Wintersburg is considered part of California’s unrecognized Japanese Mission Trail,Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, The Japanese Mission Trail: Lost and at-risk history along the Pacific Coast a new term used by Historic Wintersburg in Huntington Beach, author Mary Adams Urashima, to bring attention to the migration and settlement path of California's Japanese pioneer communities.Discover Nikkei (2013).

In 1885, the first Japanese mission in California—organized six decades after the last Spanish mission in 1823—marked the beginning of an effort by Japanese pioneers to establish communities as they assimilated to American life. While the twenty-one Spanish Franciscan missions were stationed approximately 30 miles apart—a day or two ride by horseback—the Japanese missions sprang up in communities where immigrants established themselves for work. In Orange County, work in the early 1900s was available in the celery, sugar beet, and chili pepper fields surrounding Wintersburg Village and nearby Smeltzer (both now part of Huntington Beach). The Japanese missions along the West Coast were assisted through the work of Ernest Adolphus Sturge,M.D., Missionary of the Presbyterian Board to the Japanese in California with the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. Sturge, who had traveled extensively throughout Asia prior to his role with the Presbyterian Church, was presented the Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor of Japan for his work with Japanese immigrants in America. Sturge was appointed by the national Presbyterian Church in 1886 to serve as a missionary for the Presbyterian Church in California and named General Superintendent of the Japanese Presbyterian Churches, from 1886 to 1934.A Buried Past: An Annotated Bibliography of the Japanese American Research Project Collection, Yuji Ichioka, University of California Press, Jan 1, 1974 His biography notes Dr. Sturge and his wife \\"cheerfully taught classes of Japanese students who were anxious to learn the English language.\\" The couple is acknowledged as among the first to initiate mission efforts in the Japanese immigrant community in America. In 1903, colleagues of Dr. Sturge published a book in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of his mission work, The Spirit of Japan,Hathi Trust Digital Library, The Spirit of Japan registered with the Library of Congress on February 11, 1904, by his protégé, Reverend Joseph Kenichi Inazawa, who later served as clergy at the Wintersburg Mission. There is an entry in the book from Kisaburo Uyeno, His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Consul in San Francisco, noting in 1903 that Sturge already had been living and working with the Japanese in America for twenty years. The Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission was the fifth mission established with the help of Dr. Sturge and his colleagues. The previous missions included San Francisco, Salinas, Watsonville and Los Angeles, California.The Spirit of Japan with Selected Poems and Addresses.

Dr. Sturge was present at the dedication of the Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission in 1910, noted in a Mission program and group photograph taken at the dedication.  Japanese Language Schools supported by the Wintersburg Mission  The Wintersburg Japanese Presbyterian Mission supported four Japanese Language Schools, or gakuens, in Orange County: Garden Grove, Talbert (present-day Fountain Valley), Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach, documented by original mission documents and oral histories of congregants.Urashima 2014, p. 173 The Japanese Language Schools served as multi purpose community centers built by local residents, supported by both Christians and Buddhists, and provided language classes, religious services, and also served as meeting places for local farmers. The sole extant Japanese Language School building is preserved within the federally listed historic district of Crystal Cove State Park. During World War II, when Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from the West Coast per Executive Order 9066 to confinement centers, the Laguna Beach Japanese Language School was converted by the U.S. military for their use. The Crystal Cove State Park historical timeline notes, \\"The purpose was for a coastal defense crew to observe and to furnish data for the guns of a battery for firing at a target.\\" After the war, Japanese American farmers who had leased farmland on the Irvine Ranch were unable to reclaim their farms and homes in the San Joaquin Hills. The Laguna Beach Japanese Language School building today is Cottage #34 and serves as the Crystal Cove State Park's cultural center.  Wintersburg Mission clergy  The first official clergy at the opening of the Mission building in 1910 was Reverend Joseph Kenichi Inzawa, with his wife, Kate Alice Goodman. They also were the first occupants of the manse in 1910. Kenji Kikuchi was one of the longest serving clergy, from 1926 to 1934, and provided one of the detailed oral histories conducted in the 1980s by the oral history program with California State University Fullerton. Sohei Kowta served as clergy from 1938 to 1942. He was interrogated by the F.B.I. following the attack on Pearl Harbor, along with his neighbor, Charles Mitsuji Furuta. Reverend Kowta is acknowledged as a unifying force in the 1945 War Relocation Authority Final Report for the Community Activities Section of the Colorado River Relocation Center at Poston, Arizona. The report notes, \\"The maintaining of a united church was made possible by a very tactful moderator, Reverend Sohei Kowta, of the Presbyterian Church, and the fact that relations with the outside denominations was centralized in one commission representing the interested churches...The contact with the outside denominations was of great importance to the Christian group at the center. It was these groups who had taken the most outspoken stand on the evacuation problem and who represented to the center residents the only evidence in 1942 that they were not totally rejected by America.\\"WAR RELOCATION AUTHORITY Colorado River Relocation Center Poston, Arizona FINAL REPORT Community Activities Section November 16, 1945 Walter Balderston Former Supervisor Community Activities; The Bancroft Library University of California, Berkeley. C.M. Furuta Gold Fish Farm in Wintersburg Village Charles Mitsuji Furuta traveled to America in 1900. Intending to meet his older brother, Soichi, in Hawaii, Furuta was prevented from disembarking due to an outbreak of the Black Plague. He continued on to Tacoma, Washington. After working there several years, he made his way to the developing Wintersburg Village in Southern California's Orange County and found work in the celery fields. One of the first people Furuta met was Reverend Hisakichi Terasawa, an Episcopalian minister who had been enlisted by Dr. Ernest Adolphus Sturge and Reverend Joseph Inazawa to help establish a Japanese mission in Orange County. Reverend Terasawa began meeting with Japanese laborers in Wintersburg-area agricultural fields in 1902. Upon the advice of Reverend Terasawa, Furuta saved money to buy land. Together they bought in 1908 the five-acre parcel known today as Historic Wintersburg.Furuta, Yukiko. Issei Experience in Orange County, California. Interviewed by Arthur A. Hansen and Yasko Gamo.

(June 17, July 6, 1982) By 1912, Reverend Terasawa deeded the five-acre property in full to Furuta, who set aside the northwest corner for the Japanese mission building committee.Orange County Recorder; land deeds 1908 and 1912. Orange County Archives, Santa Ana, California. Furuta returned to Japan in 1912 to meet and marry Yukiko Yajima, and returned with her to America. On their return, Furuta contracted with a Caucasian builder to construct a four-room bungalow on his farm. The finishing touches were made on the house by March 1913-documented in a photograph of Yukiko Furuta standing on the front porch- only months before passage of California's Alien Land Law of 1913 in May of that year. The passage of the Alien Land Law meant that Charles Furuta was one of the rare Japanese immigrant landowners in California. Furuta worked for local Caucasian farmers (notably on the Cole Ranch in Wintersburg Village), attempted a farming cooperative with other Japanese immigrant pioneers, as well as farmed his own land. By 1917, he had established the first goldfish pond on his property. By the 1920s, goldfish ponds covered most of the Furuta farm, with a variety of common and exotic fish species. Two other goldfish farms were established in Wintersburg Village during the same time period, one by Furuta's brother-in-law Henry Kiyomi Akiyama and one by Tsurumatsu \\"T.M.\\" Asari. The Furutas, Akiyamas, and Asaris continued to farm goldfish until forcibly removed from California after the authorization of Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, following the December 7, 1941, attack by Japan at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. World War II forced removal and confinement Events following the attack on Pearl Harbor: Charles Furuta, owner of the Furuta Gold Fish Farm, and Reverend Sohei Kowta of the Wintersburg Japanese Church were interrogated on the Historic Wintersburg property by the F.B.I. following Pearl Harbor. Charles was interrogated in the sunroom of the 1912 Furuta bungalow. Reverend Kowta was interrogated in the 1934 Wintersburg Japanese Church offices. Reverend Kowta was allowed to remain with his family and congregation until the time that all Japanese Americans would be forcibly removed from California. Furuta first was incarcerated at the Tuna Canyon Detention Station, a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Los Angeles County, California. As of March 2016, there are a total of six individuals associated with Historic Wintersburg who have been documented through the efforts of the Tuna Canyon Detention Station Coalition as having been confined at Tuna Canyon, including an elder of the Wintersburg Mission. On February 19, 1942, Executive Order 9066 established a military exclusion zone and mandated the forced removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast.Executive Order 9066 By May 1942, all Japanese Americans had been removed from Orange County, California. In Huntington Beach, most were directed to gather at the Pacific Electric Railway station near the Huntington Beach pier, while others were directed to the Japanese Language School in Garden Grove, before being bused to the Colorado River Relocation Center at Poston, Arizona (Poston).Poston, Densho Encyclopedia, Poston Wintersburg Mission: The missions followed their congregations and communities into confinement, safeguarding congregants' belongings and providing comfort inside relocation camps. Mission clergy helped those coping with the prospect of leaving their homes for confinement. Clergy continued to provide support during confinement and helped those returning to Southern California after World War II, providing shelter and guidance. In 1945, upon departure from Poston, the Wintersburg Church's Reverend Kowta was sent to Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, to assist at the Japanese Union Church of Los Angeles. During World War II years, the Pilgrim House for the African American migrant community set up space in the Japanese Union Church building and Little Tokyo became known as Bronzeville.Little Tokyo, Bronzville, Densho Encyclopedia, http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Little_Tokyo_/_Bronzeville,_Los_Angeles,_California/ The Japanese Union Church building also was used to store the belongings of Japanese Americans in confinement. The National Park Service notes Reverend Kowta's efforts to help Japanese Americans returning from confinement in Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California: \\"Rev. Sohei Kowta...recognized the need to establish a center to aid Japanese Americans returning from the concentration camps. Along with the Presbytery and the American Friends Service Committee, he established a resettlement center... known as the Evergreen Hostel, and Rev. Kowta conducted religious services for Union Church members and other residents.\\"State of California. The Resources Agency, Department of Parks and Recreation. Office of Historic Preservation.

(December 1988) Furuta farm: Charles Furuta—identified as a land owner and president of the Japanese Association—was first taken by the F.B.I. to the Tuna CanyonTuna Canyon Detention Station in Los Angeles County (since demolished). He later was moved to a Department of Justice enemy alien camp in Lordsburg, New Mexico, which began receiving detainees from California in June, 1942. During his time at LordsburgLordsburg there was an incident referred to as the Lordsburg Killings. At the time, Furuta was 61 years old and had lived in the United States for 42 years. On May 16, 1942, Yukiko Furuta and the Furuta children (Raymond and his wife, Martha, Toshiko, Nobuko, Kazuko, Etsuko and Grace Emiko) were removed from Wintersburg Village to Poston. The Furutas were separated for one year before Charles Furuta was allowed to join his family at Poston. Confined for three years, the Furutas were released to return home to their farm in Wintersburg Village in 1945.

Lang's screenplay was based on the Edgar Allan Poe story The Masque of the Red Death, but he heightened the story's sexual tension by making the plague appear in the form of a beautiful seductress. Plot Julia, a rich courtesan (Marga von Kierska), arrives in Florence. A cardinal fears that her beauty could rival the church's power, and orders inquiries to be made about her Christian beliefs. Cesare, the city's ruler, and Lorenzo (his son) both fall madly in love with her. A mob, led by Lorenzo, storms the palace where Julia is about to be tortured. Lorenzo kills Cesare, his father, and rescues her. Lust and excess overtake the city. Even Medardus, a hermit, is overcome by her beauty, and he also is driven to commit sacrilegious acts.

He played a total of 461 matches for Celtic, winning 10 major trophies. Club career =Celtic= McAtee was born in Cumbernauld (then a tiny village) although appears to have been raised in the neighbouring village of Croy, home to another Celtic great of the era, Jimmy Quinn; he joined Celtic in 1910. A fast right winger with strong legs 'said to resemble those of a billiard table' and a fondness for cutting inside to unleash a powerful shot, McAtee formed an effective partnership with Patsy Gallacher. 1914 Celtic team photo with the Scottish Cup; McAtee is bottom row, first left He had already won one Scottish Football League Championship and three Scottish Cups when his career was interrupted by World War I, although the league continued to operate. From a mining background, McAtee was employed in that reserved occupation for much of the period of conflict, with players of the time who did not join the armed forces playing football at weekends on top of a full-time work shift. After winning three wartime titles he was conscripted in 1917 and served in Italy. On returning to Scotland McAtee resumed his successful football career with Celtic, participating in two further league title-winning seasons for a total of six. He also featured in a further Scottish Cup victory in 1923, twelve years after his first in 1911, and won four Glasgow Cups (scoring the winning goal against Clyde in the 1920-21 final) and six successive Charity Cups. =United States= McAtee departed from Celtic in 1924, moving to Massachusetts where he featured for the New Bedford Whalers (managed by former teammate Charlie Shaw), and also featuring for the Newark Skeeters.Andrew McAtee, SoccerStats.us Many other Scottish players of the era also made the move across the Atlantic to play in the 1920s American Soccer League. International career He made one appearance for Scotland in 1913 versus Wales but was selected more frequently for the Scottish League XI, playing in seven games between 1912 and 1920 and scoring once, on his debut. International games were all but suspended during the war, so he had no chance to play during what would have been his peak years. Later life In his later years he returned to Lanarkshire. He died in 1956 and is buried in the same Kilsyth cemetery as Jimmy Quinn - a memorial service in his honour was held at the cemetery in 2015, attended by club representatives Jim Craig and Tom Boyd.The Celtic Wiki - Memorial ceremony for Andy McAtee Honours Celtic *Scottish League: 1913–14, 1914–15, 1915–16, 1916–17, 1918–19, 1921–22 *Scottish Cup: 1911-12, 1911-12, 1913–14, 1922–23 *Glasgow Cup: 1916, 1917, 1920, 1921 References ;Sources * External links * *London Hearts profile (Scotland) *London Hearts profile (Scottish League) Category:1888 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:People from Cumbernauld Category:Scottish Football League representative players Category:Association football outside forwards Category:Scottish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Newark Skeeters players Category:New Bedford Whalers players Category:American Soccer League (1921–1933) players Category:Scottish expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Sportspeople from North Lanarkshire ","title":"Andrew McAtee"},{"id":"42795131","text":"Julio Mariner (24 January 1975-26 May 2004) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for winning the classic St Leger Stakes in 1978. In a racing career which lasted from August 1977 until October 1978 he won three of his twelve starts. As a two-year-old he won only one of his five races but established himself as a top-class performer when he finished a close and unlucky second in the William Hill Futurity. After running well on his three-year-old debut he produced a series of disappointing efforts before recording an upset victory over a strong field in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he became a successful sire of sport horses and died in the Netherlands in 2004. Background Julio Mariner was an exceptionally good-looking bay horse with no white markings bred in Wiltshire by the Fonthill Stud which was managed by James Ian Morrison. He was sired by Blakeney the winner of the 1969 Epsom Derby, who was standing at the National Stud. Julio Mariner's dam Set Free was a moderate racehorse, with a best Timeform rating of 90, but she became an outstanding broodmare. She had already produced the Oaks Stakes winner Juliette Marny (also by Blakeney) and went on to produce Scintillate a filly who won the Oaks in 1979. In 1976, Julio Mariner was sent to the Newmarket October Yearling Sales and was bought for 40,000 guineas by the Greek shipping magnate Marcos Lemos. He was sent into training with Clive Brittain at his Carlburg stable in Newmarket. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Julio Mariner made his debut in the Acomb Stakes at York Racecourse in August when he lost a great deal of ground at the start and finished unplaced. In the Sancton Stakes over seven furlongs at the same venue later that month he was beaten a short head by Tannenberg, with the two finishing twelve lengths clear of the other runners. In the following month he was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. He finished fourth behind Shirley Heights, Bolak and Hawaiian Sound with the independent Timeform organisation suggesting that he may mave been unsuited by the firm ground. He returned to York in early October and recorded his first success in the Leyburn Stakes, drawing well clear of his opponents in the closing stages. On his final appearance of the season, Julio Mariner contested the William Hill Futurity, the most valuable race for two-year-olds ever run in Britain. In a rough race, Julio Mariner was repeatedly blocked before being switched to the wide outside by his rider Eddie Hide to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile. The colt made up a great deal of ground but failed by a head to catch Dactylographer. Timeform commented that \\"he would have won by a length or two with a clear run\\". =1978: three-year-old season= Julio Mariner began his second season at York in May when he contested the Dante Stakes, a major trial race for The Derby. He took the lead three furlongs from the finish before finishing second, beaten one and a half lengths by Shirley Heights. In the Derby, he looked likely to take a hand in the finish but weakened in the closing stages to finish sixth, more than eight lengths behind Shirley Heights. In the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot he finished unplaced behind Classic Example and then won a minor race over one mile at York. In the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York in August he was equipped with blinkers but made little impact, finishing eighth of the ten runners behind Hawaiian Sound. By this time, Julio Mariner's career was regarded as a major disappointment, with both his stamina and courage being questioned. In September, Julio Mariner started a 28/1 outsider for the 202nd running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. The favourite for the race was the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Ile de Bourbon, while the other major contenders included Le Moss and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Galiani. In a change of tactics, Hide retrained the colt at the back of the fourteen runner field before beginning to move forward approaching the final turn. Julio Mariner continued to make steady progress, overtaking the leader Obraztsovy approaching the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths from the fast-finishing Le Moss, with M-Lolshan beating Obraztsovy for third place. On his final appearance, Julio Mariner was brought back in distance for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. He was never able to mount a serious challenge but made some progress in the closing stages to finish eleventh of the eighteen runners behind Alleged. Assessment In 1978, Julio Mariner was given a rating of 121 by Timeform, nine pounds behind the top-rated two-year- old Try My Best. In the official International Classification he was less highly regarded, being rated thirteen pounds inferior to Try My Best. In the following year he was rated on 127 by Timeform, eleven pounds below their top- rated horse of the year Alleged. In the official International Classification he was rated thirteen pounds behind Alleged and eight pounds below the leading three-year-old Ile de Bourbon. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Julio Mariner an \\"inferior\\" winner of the St Leger. Stud record Julio Mariner was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Ashley House Stud in Newmarket, with a syndication value of £800,000. He had limited success as sire of racehorses but after being exported to the Netherlands in 1988 he was more successful as a sire of show jumpers, dressage horses and eventers. Julio Mariner died at De Watermolen in Haaksbergen on 26 May 2004 at the age of twenty-nine.

Background The programme was founded in 1947 by Zeferinas Junkevicius, a Lithuanian- Argentinean who wanted to keep united Latin America's Lithuanian Diaspora by broadcasting covering a host of topics including Lithuanian sports, tourism, news, recipes, music, history and, traditions in Spanish language. The programme was operational in Argentina until 1971 that ended its broadcast. During all those years the programme was broadcast live from different Argentinean radio stations such as “Radio Libertad”, “Radio Antártida” and “Radio Mitre”. Throughout the “Junkevicius Era” all the broadcastings ended with a “Sooner or later Lithuania will be free again\\". These words rang for 24 years in the heart of Lithuanian diaspora and rekindled the hopes that the Motherland regain its freedom. Revival In 2003, with Lithuania now free and independent of the Soviet Union, Juan Ignacio Fourment Kalvelis, a young journalist and member of the Lithuanian community in Argentina, following the steps and values of Zeferinas Junkevicius, decided to re-open \\"Echoes of Lithuania\\". Today, Echoes of Lithuania broadcasts live from Buenos Aires every Sunday, from 19:00 to 21:00, through the radio station FM Difusión – Berisso on the channel 98.1 FM, broadcasting from the municipality of Berisso in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The programme can also be heard on-line, via the Internet. Awards The broadcast won a number of awards including “Gaviota de Oro” and “Lanín de Oro\\". Meanwhile, the radio broadcast is recognized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania, the Embassy of the Republic of Lithuania in Argentina, the World Lithuanian Community and the World Lithuanian Youth among other institutions and organizations abroad.

As an undergraduate, he would have preferred to study liberal arts, but because of his father's preference, he entered the department of economics. He nonetheless studied with the eminent historian Chen Yinke, who supervised his thesis. Other professors and influences included Qian Mu, Lei Haizong, and Tao Xisheng in Chinese studies, and in English, Ye Gongchao (George Yeh). Yang also benefited from instruction in the Japanese language from Qian Daosun, whom Yang later scorned for becoming a puppet administrator for the Japanese after 1938. On the introduction of Zhou Yiliang, Yang became language tutor to Charles Sidney Gardner. Gardner became a professor at Harvard, and helped Yang to enroll there, and was especially helpful to Yang after he arrived.Zhou Yiliang 周一良, \\"哈佛大学中国留学生的“三杰” ——杨联陞\\" (Harvard University's three Chinese student heroes: Yang Liansheng ) In 1940, Yang started graduate work at Harvard University, receiving his M.A. degree in 1942. Charles Gardner provided not only practical help, but moral support. He then assisted Y.R. Chao in a wartime language program for the United States military, and collaborated with Chao on the Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (Harvard University Press, 1947), noted as one of the first dictionaries of whole Chinese words rather than Chinese characters. In 1946, he received his PhD degree for his doctoral thesis, “Notes on the Economic History of the Chin Dynasty.\\" (晉書·食貨志譯注). After becoming assistant professor in 1947, in 1958 he became full professor. He taught many graduate students who went on to careers in the field, including Yu Ying-shih, Kao Yu-kung, Chang Fu-mei, Chang Chun-shu, and Rulan Chao Pian. His first book, Money and Credit in China (中國的貨幣與信用) (Harvard-Yenching Institute 1952) was a slim volume of little over one-hundred pages, but provided the foundation for research by many scholars because it clarified some three-hundred basic terms, put trends in chronological order, and put these trends against the political and military historical background. His numerous publications in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies included investigations of historical linguistics as well as Han dynasty bronze TLV mirrors, female rulers, hostages, the ancient game Liubo, and schedules of work and rest in imperial China. Beginning in the 1940s, he responded to the requests of fellow Harvard professor John King Fairbank for summary but wide- ranging articles on such topics as \\"China's traditional worldview\\" and social attitudes. Yang’s diaries reveal that in the 1950s he felt doubtful of many foreign scholars, wary of Fairbank’s political skills and Benjamin Schwartz’s generalizations. At times his mental condition was not good, and he was even given electric shock treatment An attempt by his friend Ho Ping-ti to arrange a move from Harvard to University of Chicago did not work out. Even being awarded a full professorship in 1958 did not put his heart at ease, and he returned to Beijing in 1974, at the end of the Cultural Revolution. In 1977. since there were then no direct flights between the U.S. and China, they went by way of Zurich arriving in Beijing Fourth of July evening. Yang saw his mother, traveled extensively, reunited with a number of old colleagues and met younger scholars. He was struck by their isolation from world scholarship, however,葛兆光 (Ge Zhaoguang), “正晌午时说话，谁也没有家” (Zheng shangwu shuohua, shei ye meiyou jia) 21ccom.net March 18, 2014 Personal life and friendships Yang's interests were wide and deep. As a student in the 1930s at the Beijing Normal University High School, he was known for the strength of his poetry and style of painting, which went beyond the amateur level, and he excelled at weiqi (Chinese chess). He and a band of friends formed an opera school and performed traditional Peking opera. Even after he retired, Yang and his Tsinghua classmate Ho Ping-ti sang arias together after a dinner at Ho's home at the University of Chicago.Jiang Li, \\"汉学杂家杨联陞\\" (Hanxue zajia Yang Liansheng) (Multi-facted sinologist Yang Liansheng) Tsinghua Alumni Friendship and hospitality were important parts of his life. His modest home in Cambridge was the site for many dinners for Chinese students and visiting scholars. Yang worked very hard to maintain relations with old friends in Taiwan and, after relations with the People's Republic resumed, with scholars there. Hu Shih, the leading scholar in the New Culture Movement which dominated Chinese cultural life starting in the 1910s, was an especially close friend and colleague. Their initial exchange of views on Chinese poetry grew into a wide exploration of Chinese culture. They exchanged dozens of letters in the 1940s and 1950s, and Hu was an important sponsor for Yang's entrance into the Academia Sinica in Taiwan in 1959. Yang began to suffer bouts of serious depression in the 1950s, and even attempted suicide. In later years he sometimes became angry at old friends.周一良 \\"杨联陞为什么生气\\" Zhou Yiliang, (Why Yang Liansheng was so angry\\" He died at his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, in his sleep on November 16, 1990.

That performance was completed under the direction of Rubén Capriles, who came to the orchestra from a job with the Ciudad Guayana Symphony Orchestra in Venezuela. Before Mr. Capriles' directorship, the orchestra performed under Raffaele Faraco, who had retired after 37 years of playing violin with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. While BSO musicians or substitutes are sometimes paid to fill out tough-to-fill positions, the Philharmonia's players are more likely to come from academic groups or other volunteer orchestras, such as the Prince George's Philharmonic, Hunt Valley Symphony, Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, Columbia Orchestra or Gettysburg Symphony.

Regulators argue that these changes are simply completing the Basel III reforms, agreed in principle in 2010–11, although most of the Basel III reforms were agreed in detail at that time. The Basel Committee (BCBS) itself calls them simply \\"finalised reforms\\" and the UK Government has called them \\"Basel 3.1\\". Critics of the reform, in particular those from the banking industry, argue that Basel IV require a significant increase in capital and should be treated as a distinct round of reforms. Requirements Basel IV introduces changes that limit the reduction in capital that can result from banks' use of internal models under the Internal Ratings-Based approach. This includes: * A standardised floor, so that the capital requirement will always be at least 72.5% of the requirement under the Standardized approach; * A simultaneous reduction in standardised risk weights for low risk mortgage loans; * Requiring banks to meet higher maximum leverage ratios (an initial leverage ratio maximum is likely to be set as part of the completion of the Basel III package); * A higher leverage ratio for Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), with the increase equal to 50% of the risk adjusted capital ratio * More detailed disclosure of reserves and other financial statistics. These reforms will take effect from January 2022 (with exception of the output floor, which is phased in, taking full effect only on 1 January 2027). British banks alone may have to raise another £50Bn in capital in order to meet Basel IV requirements. The average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio for major European banks is estimated to fall by 0.9%, with the biggest impact on banks in Sweden and Denmark of 2.5%–3%. History Basel III is an international regulatory framework for banks, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in response to the financial crisis of 2007-08. It contains various rules on capital and liquidity requirements. The 2017 reforms (Basel IV) complement the initial Basel III. This set of rules has been adopted on 7 December 2017 (14 January 2019 for the adjustment to the market risk framework) and has to be implemented by 2022 (2027 for the output floor). As the BCBS does not have the power to issue legally binding regulation, the Basel IV standards have to be implemented by national authorities.

Lauterburg often remakes Swiss folk songs but also composes her own music. In contrast to most contemporary Swiss musicians, who use the Anglo-Saxon folk songs as a foundation, Lauterburg develops her music from local roots. Lauterburg performs solo and in various groups. The style of her music is often referred to as Swiss folk music, folk, pop, techno, or world music. Early life Lauterburg was born in an artistic oriented family and spent her childhood in Bern and Bolligen. Her father Hans Rudolf Lauterburg as well as her mother Lotti Lauterburg-Wunsch were freelance graphic artists. As a child, Lauterburg learned to play the violin and finished her studies as an elementary school educator. She later graduated from the drama school in Bern as an actress. Career =Early work= After graduation from drama school in the early 1980s, Lauterburg acted in many Swiss movies and theaters of that time. Her debut was in a film named \\"Eine vo dene\\" 1981 from Bruno Nick to be followed by \\"E Nacht lang Füürland\\" 1981 from Clemens Klopfenstein/Remo Legnazzi, \\"Akropolis Now\\" 1983, from Hans Liechti, \\"Der Ruf der Sibylla\\" 1984, from Clemens Klopfenstein, \\"Alpenglühen\\" 1987, from Norbert Wiedmer/Silvia Horisberger, \\"Macao oder die Rückseite des Meeres\\" 1988, from Clemens Klopfenstein, \\"Mikes Brother\\", \\"Restlessness\\" 1991 from Thomas Imbach. These were films about the atmosphere of departure in the 1980s when there was a strong attempt to fight for spaces where the young could turn their utopian ideas into reality. At the same time Lauterburg would perform as a musician with different bands. She gradually ventures into the domestic musical roots and explores the traditional Swiss folk music. Lauterburg learns how to yodel as an autodidact. She develops her own unique ways to yodel which gives her music a great share of grace and intensity. Later she learns how to play the Langnauer accordion (Langnauerörgeli) along with her singing. Lauterburg's first music recordings was the music to the film \\"Macao oder die Rückseite des Meeres\\" from Clemens Klopfenstein. =1990s= At the end of the 80s Lauterburg would completely turn to music. Finally, after thirty years of my life I have found out what I can sing: Songs in my own language and the ancient Juchz (shout of joy). 1991 Lauterburg releases her first album named Schynige Platte recorded with Res Margot who plays old Swiss instruments. 1994 the album is followed by Echo der Zeit in coproduction with the Swiss folk music expert Cyrill Schläpfer and the dancefloor producer Pascal de Sapio. The idea was to blend traditional Swiss folk music with contemporary dance- and pop music. Some of the voice recordings were made outside the studio for example on the trail alongside of the river Aare or above the timberline of the Swiss alps. At the time, the fusion of traditional and modern music has triggered intense indignation among some of the traditional Swiss musicians. The Swiss National Yodel Association stated: \\"What Lauterburg sings has no culture\\". There were comments like: \\"An ugly intrusion into our culture of yodeling\\". On the other side there was also praise even from the traditional music circles and Echo der Zeit populated the Swiss charts for 19 weeks. At the beginning of the 90s Lauterburg was touring as a singer under her own name and in other formations like Trio 9, Flädermüüs mit Housi Wittlin through Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Canada, USA, Ecuador, China and Africa. The CD \\"Trio 9 – Live im EI International\\" appeared in 1994. Besides songs in the Swiss German dialect from the locally well known Housi Wittlin the CD also featured songs from Lauterburg. The CD Paradiesvogel was released in 1996 by taking up the music from Echo der Zeit but there were also linguistic elements and music styles from other countries. Lauterburg's interpretation of the ancient Swiss folk song \\"S'Vreneli vom Guggisberg\\" was a big success and it populated the Swiss charts for nine weeks. =2000s= Lauterburg is engaged as a singer in several ethnic music projects along with Corin Curschellas and Walther Lietha in the formations eCHo and Doppelbock. The engagement is to interpret selected old traditional Swiss folk songs in new ways. The result is a Swiss folk music that differentiates from the musical mainstream. The result of that period was a series of CDs like: «S hät deheim en Vogel xunge» (2000), «Pro Helvetia» (2001), «Rund um de Buuchnabel» (2003), «Obio!» (2006), «Schnitter – i hole di o» (2007), «Voodoo-Jodel» (2009). In the summer 2002 Lauterburg appeared at two distinguished appearances: At the festival \\"Live At Sunset\\" that took place at the Swiss National Museum in Zürich along with the American singer artist Bobby McFerrin and at the Expo02 together with the legendary Austrian folk singer Hubert von Goisern. Lauterburg sings and performs with Max Lässer and his Überlandorchester in the years 2002 and 2003. The concert in the Kammgarn in Schaffhausen was recorded and released on DVD in 2004. Lauterburg sings in a duet with the popular chansonnier Michael von der Heide the song \\"Madeleine\\" von Abbé Joseph Bovet (1879–1951) on Heide's album Helvetia. Lauterburg acts and sings in the very successful open-air theater play \\"Dällebach Kari\\" that was staged on the Gurten mountain at Bern during the summers of 2006 and 2007. Ten years after Paradiesvogel Lauterburg released her fourth solo album Alles bleibt anders. In this production Lauterburg further developed her musical diversity. Here she mixes booming basses with solid beats to create a light ambient floor over which she puts her distinctive voice with her characteristic Juchz (Swiss crow). \\"Alles bleibt anders\\" (engl.: Everything Remains Different) is the title of the first track the last track which is finally heard after 32 minutes of sound of a rippling mountain creek is entitled \\"Nichts bleibt gleich\\" (engl.: Nothing Remains The Same). The dance company \\"d'Schwyz Tanzt\\" is a group of folk dancers which strongly represents Switzerland a vital, open and contemporary country which is also aware of the roots its own cultural heritage. Lauterburg was invited as an actress and musician as part of the plays \\"putzt und gstrählt\\" 2006 and \\"Salz-Sel-Salina\\" (2008/2009). Jürg Steinmeier is a brilliant storyteller and connoisseur of ancient Swiss tales. He creates and brings his figures alive with great commitment with his body and spoken words. Lauterburg and Dide Marfurt play music to legends and fairy tales from the old times. \\"Chilte und Wybe\\" (2007) and \\"Pureschlau\\" (2008) are pieces which were mostly staged on the grounds of various old farm houses throughout Switzerland. In 2008 the band Aërope was formed around Lauterburg. The four band members are all well known Swiss musicians: Andi Hug, drums, Hank Shizzoe, guitar, Michel Poffet, bass and Markus Flückiger, accordion. The four musician represent different stiles of music which reinforces the playfully synthesis of the renewed old folk songs with contemporary sounds. The refined diverse music from Aërope marks another culmination of Lauterburg's work. =2010s= Lauterburg plays her Album Allein in spring 2010. The music was created on a hike Lauterburg undertook alone out of an urban landscape up to the lake Seebergsee. She carried the recorder in her backpack and recorded nine songs at different inspiring places along the trail. Some were her own songs and some are traditional Swiss folk songs from Max Huggler. Parts of the material was later supplemented by guitarist Hank Shizzoe in the studio. Hank coproduced the album. =2018= Robert Boesiger published a book in German about Christine Lauterburg in the form of encounters with nationally acclaimed individuals and persons who had a significant impact on Christine's work.

History No. 89 was originally built in February 1910 by the Canadian Locomotive Company in Kingston, Ontario, for the Grand Trunk Railway as number 1009. In 1919 it was renumbered 911. In 1923, the Grand Trunk was merged into the Canadian National Railway (CN) with 911 being one of the thousands of locomotives working for this new railroad. In 1951, 911 was renumbered 89. Most of 89's career on the CN is unknown; it appears that it spent the latter part of its working life in Quebec before being retired in the late 1950s and being stored in a deadline of locomotives in Montreal. In 1961, No. 89 was purchased by New England seafood magnate and steam locomotive collector F. Nelson Blount and moved to North Walpole, New Hampshire, in the United States. No. 89 found a home in the former Boston & Maine North Walpole roundhouse and starting in 1965, would begin operating on the Green Mountain Railroad and would be moved to across the Connecticut River to Bellows Falls, Vermont. No. 89 quickly became Blount's favorite locomotive and he would often be found at the throttle until his death in 1967. In June 1972, the Green Mountain Railroad sold No. 89 to the Strasburg Rail Road outside of Strasburg, Pennsylvania. This is a linear village along the Great Conestoga Road, stretching about two miles along path later known as the Strasburg Road. The population was 2,809 at the 2010 census. The move from Bellows Falls to Strasburg was overseen by Strasburg employee Linn Moedinger. During a stopover in Penn Central's Buttonwood Yard in Wilkes-Barre, No. 89 was stranded when Hurricane Agnes caused the Susquehanna River to flood much of the area. No. 89 spent several days submerged in the rail yard but emerged with little to no damage.The Road to Paradise Upon arrival to Strasburg, No. 89 faced east and would remain that way until the turntable at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania was installed in 1973. No. 89 frequently operated in tandem with Pennsylvania Railroad 4-4-0 No. 1223 on Strasburg's half-hour trains until it was taken out of service in the early 1980s for major repairs. During these repairs which lasted the majority of the decade, No. 89 was completely rebuilt from the ground up including major boiler and running gear work. Emerging from its rebuild in November of 1988, 89 returned to pulling the half-hour trains, being joined by former Norfolk & Western 4-8-0 No. 475 in 1993.

Campaign The campaign was the brainchild of DLKW Creative Directors Malcolm Green and Gary Betts, who had previously found fame when they launched the Gary Lineker Walkers Crisps campaign.ADVERTISING HANDBOOK By Helen Powell, Jonathan Hardy, Sarah Hawkin, Iain MacRury Auditions were held and Halifax employee Howard Brown was selected by Green and Betts to spearhead the new advertising drive for the bank in 2000. Brown was the first and most frequently featured star of these adverts. His first advert saw him sing \\"Extra\\", a song with new lyrics by Malcolm Green, set to the tune of \\"Sex Bomb\\" (originally by Mousse T featuring Tom Jones) on Boxing Day 2000. The Adverts topped Adwatch, the first time a bank had managed this feat in the survey's history.http://cws.cengage.co.uk/yeshin/students/halifax.pdf The practice continued following the merger with Bank of Scotland, with Bank of Scotland employees were also allowed to take part, which was fully taken into account In 2002 with the \\"Somethin' Stupid\\", which feature Howard and a Bank of Scotland employee. In 2005, at the height of Brown's popularity he toured the branch network giving Halifax customers the chance to meet him, as part of the \\"Giving you Extra Tour\\". That same year, the original advert was ranked the 13th best advertisement of all time by ITV in a top 20 list and in 2009 it was ranked as the 18th best advertisement of the decade in another top 20 ITV list. In December 2006, Natalie Webster and four other Halifax colleagues Richard Willoughby, Jilly Ellard, Nicola Roberts and Paul Dudley, flew to Johannesburg to film the \\"Halifax remix\\" of Aretha Franklin's Think. The advertisement was first shown in February 2007. Another advertisement featured Thomas Yau from Leeds singing a version of Herman's Hermits I'm into Something Good. It was first shown in January 2008, though was axed in August 2008. In 2008 following a review of its creative marketing campaign, company reappointed the then newly merged DLKW and Lowe agency, to revise its advert strategy to make it more serious,http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/halifax-a- history-of-ads-and-howard/3030200.article As advert styles were too upbeat for the then gloomy economic climate. With the move away from its upbeat singing ads, in April 2008, Howard Brown no longer starred in any more Halifax adverts, instead taking a role in its public relations department. Following the merger the Lloyds Bank, Halfax and Bank of Scotland took different routes for its advertisement.  Animated Version In addition to the numerous singing and non singing adverts, between 2002 and 2006 an animated version of Brown also appearing in adverts, voiced by London actor Paul Shearer and created in conjunction with Paris-based animation stars Numéro Six, which used the \\"Who Gives You Extra?\\" at the end of each advert. The real Howard Brown has continued to appear in the live-action adverts. Further adverts were Written and art directed by Richard Lovell and Martin Cox at DLKW (London). In an interview with news agency Reuters, Brown said: Bank of Scotland In 2004, the Bank Of Scotland dropped Howard from their versions of the adverts. The Bank of Scotland stated that Scottish customers could not stand him because he was \\"too in-your face, and particularly annoying\\". HBOS admitted mistakes have been made in promoting the new image north of the border, as it did not take into account the Bank of Scotland brand nor its heritage. The replacement advertising campaign instead feature Scottish members of staff, although the animated version of Howard were used north of the border.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOWARD'S+AWAY%3B+Customers+hated+the+singing+banker.-a0123984964 ; Customers hated the singing banker.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on May 21, 2014. Plot Philip and Elizabeth convince an anxious Fred to wear the special shoes into the factory, but he is challenged by a guard in the secure area and shot on his way out. He manages to leave the shoes in a dumpster as agreed and call Philip from a phone booth, but then dies of his wound. Stan learns that the Echo code is stored on a floppy disk in a safe, and after getting instructions and a promise of Nina's freedom from Arkady (Lev Gorn), he records the code with a spy camera. He drops a package at the agreed location, but it turns out to be only a note that says \\"Tell Nina I'm sorry\\". Heartbroken, Nina prepares to leave the Rezidentura to return to Moscow to stand trial for treason. While she is taken away Stan sadly watches her from a parked car. Paige returns from the protest, where Pastor Tim was one of those arrested for an act of civil disobedience. She tells her parents that she wants to live a life of self-sacrifice for a higher cause, as Jesus did. Afterward, Philip and Elizabeth agree that Paige doesn't understand the real self-sacrifice made by people like them. Philip, as \\"Clark\\", visits Martha (Alison Wright) and they continue their conversation about Clark's reluctance to have children. Philip also learns that Martha has bought a Ladysmith gun. Elizabeth calls to tell him that Larrick is AWOL in the United States. They wake the kids and rush them off for a sudden unannounced \\"vacation\\" at a motel near the cabin where Jared is staying. Philip briefly meets with the KGB exfiltration team, but he is captured by Larrick at gunpoint and put in the trunk of a car. Elizabeth goes to the cabin and talks to Jared, and they are then both captured by Larrick as well. As Larrick is about to put Elizabeth in the trunk with Philip, saying he plans to turn himself and them in to the authorities, Jared pulls a previously unseen gun and exchanges fire with Larrick, enabling the Jenningses to overpower and kill Larrick. In his dying moments, Jared confesses that he's the one who killed his parents and sister. He also reveals that he's in love with Kate and that she recruited him as a KGB agent. He killed his parents because they objected to his being recruited by the KGB. The Jenningses then meet with Claudia (Margo Martindale), who tells them that Jared's recruitment was part of a plan to develop agents with clean American backgrounds, and that The Centre wants Paige to be the next recruit, this time with their cooperation. They object, and Claudia reminds them that they are under orders. Philip finds Arkady at a magazine stand and tells him that if The Centre contacts Paige without going through them, the Jenningses will leave the KGB's employ. Later, Philip and Elizabeth discuss the idea of revealing their identity to Paige and having her follow in their footsteps; Philip is vehemently against it, but the idea seems to grow on Elizabeth, who believes after the earlier conversation about self-sacrifice that Paige needs \\"a cause\\".

The station is owned by Cox Communications. The station's studio facilities are located on the northwest end of Phoenix. The transmission signal is available to Cox cable television subscribers in central and southern Arizona, which includes the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. History Former logo as \\"Cox 7,\\" used from 2010 to 2017. =Arizona Sports Programming Network= What is today YurView Arizona was established in 1981 as the Arizona Sports Programming Network (ASPN) by American Cable, one of Cox's predecessors in Phoenix, after it signed a 13-year rights agreement with the Phoenix Suns. The channel also aired Phoenix Inferno soccer and Arizona State Sun Devils athletic events. The next year, it added a slate of high school football games on tape delay; in 1983, it then aired the first live high school football telecast in Arizona since 1964. ASPN converted from a premium service to basic cable in 1986. By 1993, however, it was not available on all Valley cable systems, prompting smaller providers with 33,000 subscribers to sue Dimension Cable—American's successor—to seek access to its 34 Suns games. =Shift in focus= In 1996, Liberty Media acquired the rights to the relocating Phoenix Coyotes NHL team and the 1998 expansion Arizona Diamondbacks baseball franchise for $90 million, launching Fox Sports Arizona with the rights. However, Fox Sports and Cox—which had bought Dimension—were at loggerheads in a carriage dispute that threatened to leave cable viewers on the largest system in town unable to see the Coyotes. Fox Sports Arizona and ASPN, which was renamed Cox Sports at the same time the new regional sports network launched, shared a channel; this meant that satellite viewers who only received Fox Sports Arizona programming did not get Suns games even though they were on one channel on cable. Cox Sports rebranded as \\"Cox 9\\" on November 1, 1998, becoming a full-time channel on channel 9. Retaining the Suns and high school football, Cox 9 became a general-interest channel airing previews of channels only available on Cox's digital service and community programming. The Suns moved to Fox Sports in 2003. A further lineup shuffle in 2004 moved Cox 9 to channel 7 as \\"Cox 7\\". =Rebranding as YurView= In March 2017, Cox Communications rebranded its local origination channels under the YurView banner, as part of a nationwide effort by Cox to bring all of their community access channels under a unified brand. In Phoenix, YurView moved to channel 4, allowing KAZT (channel 7 in Prescott) to use cable channel 7 for the first time. Production and post-production of most of YurView's original programming is produced at Cox Creative Studios. Sports programming =Arizona Rattlers= In 2012, YurView became the official broadcast partner of the Arizona Rattlers. In 2013 the partnership was renewed through the 2015 Arena Football League season. Rattlers games can be seen by Cox cable television subscribers in Central and Southern Arizona. Games are also available online on Cox7.com. The broadcast team includes Dale Hellestrae, Kevin Ray, Chris Harris and Lindsey Smith. =Grand Canyon Antelopes= In October 2013, Cox Communications and Grand Canyon University (GCU) reached an agreement to form a comprehensive partnership that made Cox7 the exclusive carrier of GCU's inaugural Division I men's basketball season. The broadcast team for the men's basketball games included Barry Buete, Rex Chapman and Matt Rosen. In addition to men's basketball, YurView coverage of GCU sports showcased many of the other Lopes programs. Additional coverage began with a women's volleyball match against Idaho on Nov. 21, women's basketball vs. Chicago State on Jan. 30, and the baseball home opener against Hofstra on Feb. 21. Prior to the 2014-15 Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball season, an extension of the contract was reached. YurView's coverage of GCU games now extended through the end of the 2015-2016 season, the Lopes' third in Division I. GCU games moved to KUTP \\"Fox 10 Xtra\\" for the 2019–20 season, expanding their distribution beyond cable viewers. Original series =STEM Journals= An Arizona-produced program hosted by Geoff Notkin, who was previously a co-host of Science Channel's Meteorite Men, and focuses on STEM-related material targeted towards middle and high school students. STEM Journals highlights recent developments in science, technology, engineering, and math and exploring STEM-related careers. Episodes showcase professionals in STEM fields and how their professions improve our communities. =Step Outside= The longest running program currently on YurView, Step Outside is hosted by Arizona landscape architect Pete Curé. The show provides viewers with gardening inspiration through tours of beautiful yards, gardens and landscape projects. Pete Curé also shares his wealth of botanical knowledge in providing tips for plant care and maintenance. =Su Vida= Su Vida hosted by Vanessa Ramirez and JR Cardenas, celebrates Southwest Hispanic culture, lifestyle, family and food. Su Vida focuses on the Hispanic community of Arizona with culturally impactful stories and information.

Work and country missions The work of ICDP is varied: letters and statements about specific cases are issued urging States not to carry out executions and condemns carried out executions. ICDP organizes and attends meetings and events to promote abolition of the death penalty. ICDP’s Members conduct country missions (so far: California and Delaware in the USA, Japan, Suriname, Tajikistan, Commonwealth Caribbean, Tunisia and Lebanon) and engage dialogue with different stakeholders working on the abolition, such as NGOs, government representatives, members of parliament. For example, Commissioner Ruth Dreifuss visited Tajikistan in 2011 and 2013 “to advocate for full abolition of the death penalty in the national law”. Several reports and opinion pieces have been published by ICDP, including a report on How States abolish the death penalty “which reviews the processes towards abolition of capital punishment by analysing the experiences of 13 States”.

Between 1935–45 he was a close aide of Henrietta Szold managing the Youth Aliyah, and from 1945 until his death in 1947 he was the leader of the organization in Palestine. Biography =Germany= The Beyth family was a well established, rooted Jewish family in the small town of Bleicherode in Prussia (today Thuringia), where they had helped to build up the local textile industry. Being located in Brandenburg-Prussia at that time, the Jewish community of Bleicherode dated back to the beginning of the 18th century, when the Prussian King encouraged Jewish settlement in town, and Jewish families ( amongst them the famous Bleichröder family, Bismarck's bankers ) contributed considerably to the economic development of that ancient Thuringian mining town at the crossroads of important trade routes. Typically for well- assimilated families with a strong German identity, during World War I, several sons of the Beyth family volunteered for the German army and at least one was awarded the \\"Iron Cross\\".Alemannia Judaica: Die jüdische Gemeinde in Bleicherode ( in German language, with several documents referring to the Beyth family ) Together with his brother Carl, and as many German \\"Bürgertum\\" kids of his generation, Hans had joined the Wandervogel, a naturalistic German Youth organisation very popular at that time, which promoted ideas like Youth Hostels. However, already before World War One, anti-semitism became quite virulent within \\"Wandervogel\\" and Jewish members were being systematically discriminated and pushed out. As a result, Jewish former members of Wandervogel, amongst them the Beyths, formed \\"Blau-Weiss\\", a Jewish Youth organisation, as early as 1912, also very early embracing Zionist ideas. After World War I, when Jewish people were blackmailed in Germany as being responsible for Germany losing the war and Walter Rathenau, a leading Jewish- born industrialist ( CEO of AEG Telefunken, then the World's leading electronics and communication company, and Foreign Minister of the First Republican government of the Reich ) was assassinated by right-wing terrorists, Zionism became a very strong force in the Jewish youth organisations in Germany.Carl Beyth, the brother of Hans, born in 1903, who also later made aliyah, has documented this comprehensively in the papers he had deposited at Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) in New York (The Carl Beyth Collection at the LBI New York - estate of Carl Beyth ( born 1903 ) - extensive material on the Beyth family and the history of the Jewish community in Bleicherode (available online)) Beyth helped very early to train young people in the so-called Hechaluz camps. He was instrumental in organising a Hechaluz camp in Wolfenbüttel . After 1933, he became a key member of the \\"Jüdische Jugendhilfe\\" (founded by Recha Freier in Germany as the core of Youth Aliyah ). He moved to the Netherlands, where he organized Hechaluz training in Harlingen, and in 1935 he made aliyah himself with his family. =Palestine= In Palestine Beyth first worked as the representative for Germany in the Youth Aliyah, initially he was hired to organize accounting of the organisation as an experienced German banker.Sylva M. Gelber: No Balm in Gilead - a personal retrospective of mandate days in Palestine: McGill-Queen's University Press - MQUP, Montreal, Canada, 1989 - 284 Seiten, S. 271, Because of his outstanding organisational competency he quickly became the closest aide of Youth Aliyah leader Henrietta Szold.p. 20 in Sara Kadosh: Heroic Acts and Missed Opportunities: The Rescue of Youth Aliyah Groups from Europe during World War II: in: Children and the Holocaust - Symposium Presentations - UNITED STATES HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM - CENTER FOR ADVANCED HOLOCAUST STUDIES - Washington, D.

One of the most spectacular successes was the rescue of the so-called \\"Teheran children\\".http://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?id=858 The Teheran Children, IsraCast.com, February 2010 =Leader of Youth Aliyah, Death= After the death of Szold in February 1945, Beyth took over the official leadership of Youth Aliyah. On December 26, 1947, he accompanied a convoy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which contained a bus with children being brought to Jerusalem in the context of Youth Aliyah activities. Beyth who initially intended to follow the convoy in a passenger car together with Golda Myerson (later Meir) from the Jewish Agency, instead took a place with the children in the bus, to allow a representative of Youth Aliyah from the USA to travel in the car. As common during that time, the convoy was fired upon close to the Arab exclaves of Latrun and later at Castel. Beyth returned the fire on the bus with his handgun and was killed in the subsequent gunfight.Hans Beyth (1901-1947) - in: Aliyat Hanoar Exhibit - History of Youth Aliyah - (Massuah - (Canadian Website on the History of the Shoah and Zionism))A detailed description of the circumstances of the death of Hans Beyth can be found in a published private letter of eyewitness Chedva Margalit (Esra Magazine, edition 144, April–May 2008, Link here ) Awards and Memorials In 1954 Albert Einstein suggested awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Youth Aliyah and its founder Recha Freier.ITS Arolsen: Youth Aliyah: Escaping Nazi Germany, Heading for Palestine - Escaping the Holocaust, Heading for Israel In Jerusalem a major through road is named after Hans Beyth.

It is the oldest Polish miner's football club. History and etymology The club's origins date back to 1914, however it was an unofficial gathering more so than a functioning sports club. After Poland re-gained independence in 1918, among the people returning from the front-lines of World War I was a man named Emil Dawidowicz. Emil with the help of his two friends, Rudolf Hot, a plumber from Moravian Ostrava, and Rudolf Gloser, a baker from Bielsko founded TSV Jaworzno (Towarzystwo Sportowe Victoria Jaworzno). They chose the name Victoria after the then popular Czech klub Viktoria Žižkov. 1918 is the club's official founding date as that is when the club charter, rules and regulations were established. In 1974 the club changed its name to GKS Jaworzno, in reference to its mining community (GKS stands for Górniczy Klub Sportowy, which means \\"Mining Sport Club\\") after a merger with Górnik Jaworzno and Azotania Jaworzno. The merger was a flop and in 1981 the historical name \\"Victoria\\" was re-incorporated once again. The club has spent the majority of its history between the third and fifth tiers of Polish football. In 2011, the club ceased to exist, due to ongoing financial troubles. The club's ground was demolished and listed for redevelopment. In June 2014, the club was re-founded and fielded a senior football team in the lowest division for the 2014/2015 season. The new Victoria has no legal ties to the previous association and was re-activated due to a handful of loyal supporters. On 23 August 2014 the club played its first league match since its rebirth away against Lew Olszyny. Fans The fan movement started in 1982/83, one of the first. The fans were unique in the fact that as well as following the football team, they also attended the team's boxing matches. In the 80's and 90's the fan group Desperados strongly identified with the skinhead movement and extreme right-wing ideology.To My Kibice magazine nr2(149), February 2014, Supporter magazine pp.40–45 The club's biggest rival are fellow locals Szczakowianka Jaworzno. They have good relations with fans of Fablok Chrzanów since 1995 and handball fans of MTS Chrzanów.To My Kibice magazine nr2(149), February 2014, pp.40–45, Supporter magazine The fans still remain loyal to the colours despite the club's disappearance, and there were frequent talks of re-establishment of the club. Those talks proved worthwhile as the fans played a crucial role in the club's rebirth, and the fans made up a majority of the squad for the inaugural 2014/15 season.

He has been serving as the Minister of Finance in the Government of Serbia since 29 May 2018. Mali previously served as the mayor of Belgrade from 2014 to 2018, and as the President of the Temporary Council of Belgrade from 2013 to 2014. The discovery of plagiarism in Mali's doctoral dissertation was one of the triggers for the anti-government protests leading to the 12-day students' blockade of the university's main building and the decision of the University of Belgrade to revoke his doctorate. Early life and education Siniša Mali was born on 25 August 1972, in Belgrade. He graduated from the primary and secondary school – the 5th Belgrade Grammar School. In 1995, he completed his undergraduate studies, while in 1998 he received his master's degree at the Faculty of Economics, University of Belgrade. During the undergraduate studies, Mali received the award as the student of the generation, and after completing his studies, he received the award for the best undergraduate dissertation. As a Ron Brown scholar, in 1999, he received his master's degree in Finance (Master of Business Administration) from the Washington University in St. Louis, United States of America. During the studies, Mali worked as an assistant on five courses in the field of business finance. After studying, Mali received the award as the best student in the field of finance, as well as the award for being among the top 10 students of the top 20 business schools in the United States that year. In 2013, Mali defended his doctoral dissertation \\"Value Creation through the Process of Restructuring and Privatisation – Theoretical Concepts and Achieved Results in Serbia\\" at the Faculty of Organisational Sciences, University of Belgrade. Business career Prior to his political career, Mali was a financial adviser in the private sector. He worked in several private companies that were engaged in advising in the field of financial services. Between 1995 and 1997, Mali worked for Deloitte &Touche; in Belgrade, and in its Prague office from 1999 to 2001. During his stay in the United States, he worked at Credit Suisse First Boston in the Mergers & Acquisitions Group in New York City. In 2001, he was appointed as the Assistant Minister of Privatisation in the Ministry of Economy and Privatisation. During his tenure, Mali was in charge of the execution of the privatisation process in the Republic of Serbia and preparation of the various laws in this field. At the end of that year, he moved to the Privatisation Agency, where he was the director of the Centre for Tender Privatisation. He remained in that position until the end of 2003. From 2005 to 2008, Mali was the chairman of the real estate company \\"NCA Investment Group Doo Beograd\\". Mali has served as a chairman of several boards of directors, including Fiat Automobil Srbija and Komercijalna banka, as well as chairman of the Supervisory Committee of Air Serbia. Additionally, he was a chairman of the Organising Committee of the 2017 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade and the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four. He is the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and member of CFA Institute, Serbian Business Angels Network, Fulbright Alumni Association of Serbia, British- Serbian Business Club, as well as a member of the Golf Club Belgrade and a holder of a golf green card. Also, he is the holder of the portfolio manager license, issued by the Serbian Securities Commission. Mali's private business was being investigated by the Serbian Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering (APML) in 2016. Earlier, during 2015, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Serbian investigative journalism outlet KRIK discovered that Mali controls 42 bank accounts, registered under himself, his wife, and his three underage children. These accounts were holding sums of money far exceeding his official salary. In addition, OCCRP/KRIK discovered and reported his purchase of 24 apartments on Bulgarian Black Sea coast in 2012 and 2013. APML suspected Mali's accounts and apartment purchases as a money-laundering scheme and reported it to the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade. The prosecutors dismissed the case, as they did not find evidence of criminal activity and therefore rejected to launch an investigation.The Mayor of Belgrade’s Multiplying Bank Accounts by S. Dojčinović, D. Peco and A. Tchobanov, 26 February 2018 Political career In 2012, Mali was appointed as the advisor for economic affairs to the First Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić. A year later, Mali was appointed as the Chief Negotiator with investors from the United Arab Emirates. He conducted negotiations on a strategic partnership between the then state-owned company JAT and Etihad Airways that resulted in the establishment of Air Serbia. Following the ousting of Mayor Dragan Đilas in November 2013, Mali was appointed as the President of the Temporary Council of Belgrade. After the 2014 election in Belgrade, Mali was elected as a Mayor on the proposal of the winning Serbian Progressive Party. From the very first moment of his appointment in 2014, Mali initiated a comprehensive financial consolidation program in order to achieve sustainable fiscal stabilisation. During his tenure as the Mayor of Belgrade, Mali managed to halve the debt of the city of Belgrade, which in 2014 amounted to 1.2 billion euros, and to reduce the budget deficit by four times. Mali conducted a debt consolidation of public utility companies, which in the first three years of his tenure resulted in the net profit of 9.5 billion dinars. He managed to galvanize a significant number of investments’ projects that contributed to low unemployment. The most significant is the new hub project “Belgrade Waterfront” (total worth 3.5 billion euros), the opening of the first IKEA store and Hilton Hotels & Resorts’ brand in Serbia, as well as the opening of the Chinese automotive parts’ factory MEI TA Europe Ltd. During Mali's tenure, Moody's Public Sector Europe (MPSE) upgraded the City of Belgrade's long-term issuer rating to Ba3 from B1; the rating's outlook has been changed to stable from positive. Mali's tenure as the Mayor of Belgrade was marked with numerous significant infrastructure projects such as completion of the Pupin Bridge over the river Danube, Košare's heroes Boulevard, water factory \\"Makiš 2\\", as well as the complete reconstruction of Slavija Square, Boulevard of Liberation, Roosevelt Street and Mije Kovačević Street. The railway station \\"Belgrade Center\\" (Prokop) started to operate after 40 years. The projects of expansion of the pedestrian zone in the city of Belgrade and facade restoration were initiated. Agreements were signed for the construction of a waste processing plant in Vinča, wastewater treatment plants in Veliko Selo and for the construction of the Obrenovac - Novi Beograd heating plant. On 29 May 2018, he was appointed as the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Serbia in the cabinet of Ana Brnabić, after the resignation of Dušan Vujović three weeks earlier. At the beginning of his tenure as the Minister of Finance, Mali has emphasised the two main goals; maintenance of the macroeconomic stability and achievement of the greater economic growth. In the first year of his tenure, the new set of laws has been passed with the aim to contribute to a better economic environment, reduce the tax burden on labour, incentive beginners in business, increase pensions and public sector salaries and the modernize Tax Administration. On 4 July 2019, Mali was appointed as the president of the Coordination Body for Combat against Money laundering and Terrorism financing, where he replaced the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Nebojša Stefanović. Concurrently, he was appointed as the Governor of the Republic of Serbia at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Mali holds the position of a member of the Presidency of the Serbian Progressive Party.  PhD thesis controversy  Mali submitted his thesis at the Faculty of Economics in Belgrade, in 2002. Titled Privatization by the Method of Enterprises Selling - Theoretical Concepts and the Case of Serbia it was rejected in 2011 on the basis of low quality and lack of scientific value. He then modified it and submitted it to the Faculty of Organizational Sciences (FON) as the Value Creation through the Process of Restructuring and Privatisation – Theoretical Concepts and the Case of Serbia, where he obtained his PhD in 2013.Tezu Siniše Malog odbio Ekonomski fakultet, pa ju je odbranio na FON-u On 9 July 2014 the website \\"Peščanik\\" claimed that Mali had plagiarized at least one third of his PhD thesis. Professor Raša Karapandža showed that Mali plagiarized his thesis with the content from other theses, authored articles, site of the Agency of Privatization of Serbia and Wikipedia by publishing several examples. The main plagiarised source was the doctorate of professor Stifanos Hailemariam, an economist from Eritrea, titled Corporate Value Creation, Governance and Privatisation: Restructuring and Managing Enterprises in Transition – The Case of Eritrea, defended at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands, in 2001. The FON founded the commission which in October 2014 concluded that Mali’s work is not a plagiarism. University rejected this decision on 10 December 2014. In November 2016 the FON formed new Ethics Commission. On 19 December 2016 it again concluded that there is no plagiarism. On 18 January 2017, citing procedural reasons, the University rejected theses findings, too. The FON failed to form the new commission until February 2019 which concluded that only 6.97% of the thesis was plagiarized, which the commission claimed is not enough to dispute its scientific contribution. On 15 July the University again returned the decision back to the FON for new deliberation, giving them 60 days to do so, stating that commission's findings were \\"incomplete, unclear and contradictory\\". The FON formed the same commission as in January, which on 23 October 2019 submitted the same report. On 21 November 2019, university's Professional Ethics Board overturned the faculty's decision and unanimously confirmed the non-academic behavior of Mali. On 12 December 2019, the Senate of the University unanimously annulled Mali's doctorate due to plagiarism. Due to the scandal outbreak, Mali was never promoted to the rank of the doctor of philosophy. Still, on the electoral list for the 2018 Belgrade elections, he even named \\"doctor of philosophy\\" as his \\"occupation\\".Electoral list for the coalition Aleksandar Vučić – zato što volimo Beograd The doctorate of Mali was one in the series of , regarding dubious diplomas, master degrees and doctorates of the politicians. It also coincided with the period of exponential growth of doctorates in Serbia, from 205 in 2007 to 2,012 in 2016. The case has been often compared, unfavorably though, to the Guttenberg plagiarism scandal of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, German Minister of Defense who resigned his post after the plagiarism was revealed. While in Guttenberg's case political epilogue came after 20 days and a legal one after 9 months, scandal with Mali's doctorate dragged on for 6 calendar years while he ultimately progressed in the political hierarchy. During this period, question of Mali's doctorate crossed the lines of academia becoming a political affair and a much wider social issue in Serbia due to the inactivity of the state and educational institutions regarding this matter, which in turn provoked public protests, university's blockade by the students and a fierce public and political division. Students blocked the Rectorate of University of Belgrade for a day on 19 July 2019, asking for plagiarism to be declared. Since the issue wasn’t resolved, they again blocked it from 13 to 25 September 2019. Mali was vehemently defended by the entire governing and party establishment in what was described as the operation \\"defend and protect plagiarism\\" with the entire \\"machinery employed to defend the doctorate\\". On the other side, this triggered protests and public performances calling for the annulment of Mali's doctorate which ultimately blended into the wider civil and political Serbian protests since 2018. This was enhanced by the perception of his tenure as the mayor of Belgrade, which was described as the \\"deluge of affairs\\" while Mali himself was labeled the \\"walking affair\\", \\"controversial\\" and \\"scandal- ridden\\".  Personal life  Mali is divorced and has two sons and a daughter.https://www.krik.rs/marija-mali-o-poslovima-bivseg-supruga-ofsor- skrivena-imovina-savamala/ He speaks English fluently, uses Greek and is studying Chinese. Mali was awarded the \\"Best European 2014\\" award for the project of development and reconstruction of Belgrade. In 2017, the European Movement in B&H; awarded him with the \\"Most Tolerant City in the Region\\" award. He is a keen sportsman, and a regular participant in semi-marathon races within the Belgrade Marathon. In November 2018 he ran the full Athens Marathon and in September next year Mali ran full marathon in Berlin. He was a member of the presidency of KK Crvena zvezda and he is the honorary holder of the black belt in taekwondo 5th dan for contribution to the development of sports. During his high school days, Mali played guitar in a heavy metal band. He was awarded the Order of the Great Martyrs of Kragujevac of the first degree. It was handed to him with the blessing of the Serbian Patriarch Irinej, in October 2019, by Bishop of the Diocese of Šumadija, Jovan.

The Copleston family is according to a traditional rhyme one of the most ancient Devonshire gentry families:Rhyme dismissed by Hoskins: \\"the hackneyed jingle has not a word of truth in it\\"(Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954) , p.76) :\\"Crocker, Cruwys and Copplestone, :When The Conqueror came were all at home\\".

Joachim Rolle's mural monument, on top of which are displayed the Rolle arms and crest, is inscribed thus: > \\"Here lyeth the body of Joachim Rolle sonne unto John Rolle of Stevenstone > Esquier deceased who married Mary the daughter of William Venner of this > parish Gent deceased and who departed this life the 30th day of January in > the faith of Christ Anno Dni 1638.

Joachim's first cousin Abell Rolle (son of Robert Rolle, 5th son of the patriarch George Rolle) also had a connection with Chittlehampton as he married Gertrude Acland, daughter of Anthony II Acland (1568-1614) of Hawkridge, Chittlehampton.Vivian, p.652 (Rolle), p.7 (Acland) Humphry Venner (died 1647) Humphry Venner (died 1647) (son), who is listed in the Chittlehampton manorial court roll of 1641. He married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Farwel (daughter of Richard Farwel of Somerset) by whom he had two daughters; secondly in 1610 to Dorothie Whiddon, daughter of Francis Whiddon of Chagford. By his 2nd wife he had 4 sons and 3 daughters. His eldest son John Venner (1612-pre-1646) died unmarried and predeceased his father, which left his younger brother William Venner (died 1690) as heir to Hudscott. William II Venner (died 1690) William II Venner (died 1690) (second son), who married Elizabeth of unrecorded family, by whom he had 1 son and 2 daughters. His son William Venner (born 1657) predeceased his father, as did his sister Susanna Venner (1652-1671), which left the surviving daughter Elizabeth Venner (born 1657) as sole heiress. Elizabeth married John II Lovering (died 1686) of Huxhill in the parish of Weare Giffard. It appears however that Hudscott had been the residence of his father John I Lovering and his wife Dorothy Dodderidge, as the arms of Lovering impaling Dodderidge exist on an escutcheon within a scroll-work plaster overmantel in the hall. Andrews (1958) suggested that John I Lovering was a nephew of William Venner, and that at some time before his death in 1690 Venner had handed over the estate to Lovering. =Lovering= escutcheon of pretence, Chittlehampton Church: Argent, on a fesse wavy azure a lion passant or John I Lovering (died 1675) impaling Dodderidge (Argent, two pales wavy azure between nine crosses croslet gulesAs shown on the monument in the Lady Chapel of Exeter Cathedral to the judge Sir John Doddridge (1555–1628)) here shown apparently with tinctures transposed.

The crest of Lovering (of unknown form) is missing from on top of the helm John I Lovering (died 1675) was a merchant of Weare Giffard. The Lovering family held at some time the north Devon manor of Bittadon.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.345 It is not clear how he came to reside at Hudscott; Andrews (1958) suggested that John I Lovering was a nephew of William Venner, and that at some time before his death in 1690 Venner had handed over the estate to Lovering. He married Dorcas Doddridge,Will of John Lovering, proved 1675, National Archives sister and co- heiress of John Doddridge (1610-1666), MP, of Bremridge, Filleigh. She was the daughter of Pentecost Dodderidge (died c. 1650) of Barnstaple, MP, by his wife Elizabeth Wescombe.Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries 1901 Pentecost Dodderidge was the brother and heir of Sir John Dodderidge (1555-1628), a Judge of the King's Bench, who had purchased for his seat the estate of Bremridge, near South Molton. Bremridge survives today, but without the demolished wings of the grand Dodderidge mansion, but the arms of Dodderidge survive above the front door. The judge's magnificent effigy survives in the Lady Chapel of Exeter Cathedral. The Dodderidge family were important merchants and ship-owners in Barnstaple and their Elizabethan mansion survived until the early 20th century in Cross Street, Barnsatple, until it was demolished to make way for a new post office. The oak panelling and chimneypiece of one room however was saved and now lines the walls of one of the rooms in the Barnstaple guildhall. The arms of Lovering impaling Dodderidge exist at Hudscott on an escutcheon within a scroll-work plaster overmantel in the hall.Andrews, 1958 It was apparently Dorcas Dodderidge who was referred to in an 1871 text on the Great Ejection of 1662:Quoted by Andrews, no. 20, January 1949 \\"Quotation from an unknown source found in a book of 1871\\" > On the road to Umberleigh, five miles from South Molton, there stands a fine > old English mansion called Hudscott, where at this time (1662) there lived a > noble puritan lady, who like Phoebe, had been a 'succour of many'. It was > her delight to entertain such men as John Flavel of Torrington and other > dejected ministers, whose writings, the labours of a forced retirement, have > become the inheritance of the whole church. This referred to about two thousand puritan clergy who after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 had refused to use the Book of Common Prayer which had been banned during the Commonwealth but then had been restored for compulsory usage by the Act of Uniformity 1662. Such clergy were then ejected from their livings and in 1664 were forbidden by Parliament, having passed the Five Mile Act, to preach within 5 miles of an incorporated town.Andrews, no. 20, January 1949 The house incorporates a small former chapel, which may have been used during this time. Another of the rare Devonshire protectoresses of ejected clergy at this time was Rachael Fane (1612/13-1680), wife of Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath of Tawstock Court, near Barnstaple, whose monument in Tawstock Church states: She was a humble and devout daughter of the Church of England and in times of persecution a mother to the ejected Fathers and in these parts almost their only protectress. John II Lovering (died 1686) John II Lovering (died 1686), of Huxhill in the parish of Weare Giffard, was a merchant trading at Barnstaple. He was the son of John I Lovering (died 1675) a merchant of Weare Giffard by his wife Dorcas Doddridge, sister and co-heiress of John Doddridge (died 1666), MP, of Bremridge, South Molton. John II Lovering in 1679/80 purchased from John Wichehalse of Ley (now Lee Abbey) in the parish of Lynmouth, and of Chard, the manors of Lynton and Countisbury. John Wichehalse was the nephew of William Venner,Chanter, p.181 John II Lovering's father-in-law. John II Lovering is described in the conveyance indenture dated 24 May 1680 as of Weare Giffard. His residence there appears to have been at Huxhill Barton.Chanter, p.245 He also purchased in 1645 from Adam Lugg of Barnstaple the manor of East Ilkerton and a moiety of Sparhanger, Radispray and North Fursehill. John II Lovering appears to have been an exporter of herring fish to Spain, as the following recorded lawsuit of 1658 suggests: \\"John Martin v. John Lovering: Consignment of fish to St. Lucar or Seville in Spain. Touching a former suit also.: Devon; Spain\\".Exchequer: King's Remembrancer: Depositions taken ... E 134/1658/East32 http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID;=4584872 He is mentioned in the historical romance Lorna Doone (1869) by Richard Doddridge Blackmore as follows: > \\"And it is a very grievous thing, which touches small landowners, to see an > ancient family day by day decaying: and when we heard that Ley Barton > itself, and all the Manor of Lynton were under a heavy mortgage debt to John > Lovering of Weare-Gifford, there was not much, in our little way, that we > would not gladly do or suffer for the benefit of De Whichehalse\\". Chanter (1906) states the account in Lorna Doone to be confused. John II Lovering married Elizabeth Venner, heiress of Hudscott. He had by Elizabeth two sons, John Lovering and Venner Lovering who both predeceased their father without progeny, and two daughters: Arms of Richard II Acland (1679-1729) of Fremington (Chequy argent and sable, a fesse gules) impaling the arms of his wife Susanna Lovering (d.1747) (Argent, on a fesse wavy azure a lion passant or).

Acland succeeded his wife's brother-in-law Samuel Rolle as MP for Barnstaple. All Susannah's sons died without progeny, and only her youngest daughter Susanna Acland left progeny, by her husband William Barbor, who inherited the manor of Fremington.Risdon, pp.423-4 Dorothy Lovering (1675-1735),Dates per Rolle monument in Chittlehampton Church heiress of Hudscott, who in 1700 married Samuel I Rolle (1669-1735), apparently her first cousin (see below). =Rolle= lion rampant of the first three bezants Samuel I Rolle (1669-1735) Rolle mural monument, Chittlehampton Church Samuel I Rolle (1669-1735) of Hudscott, MP for Barnstaple between 1705 to 1708 was a member of a cadet branch of the influential Rolle family of Stevenstone, near Great Torrington, Devon. He was the eldest son of Dennis Rolle (1638-1671) of Great Torrington, a lawyer of the Inner Temple, a younger son of Sir Samuel Rolle (died 1647), of Heanton Satchville in the parish of Petrockstowe, Devon, MP, one of three distinguished grandsons (his brothers were Henry Rolle (died 1656) Chief Justice of the King's Bench & John Rolle (died 1648), MP) of Henry Rolle of Heanton Satchville, 4th son of the founder of the Devonshire Rolles, the Tudor lawyer and property speculator George Rolle (died 1552), MP, who purchased Stevenstone. The mother of Samuel I Rolle of Hudscott is stated by Vivian (1895)Vivian, p.655 and by his biographer CruickshanksCruickshanks, biography of Samuel Rolle (1669-1735), published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1690-1715 to have been Jane Lovering \\"of Hudscott\\" which appears to place her as a daughter of John I Lovering (died 1675) by his wife Dorcas Doddridge and seems therefore to suggest that Samuel I Rolle's wife Dorothy Lovering (1675-1735) was his first cousin. Indeed by the time of Samuel's marriage to Dorothy in 1700 it was known that she was a co-heiress to Hudscott, her father having died in 1686 and her brothers before then. Dennis Rolle's elder brother was Robert Rolle (died 1660) of Heanton Satchville, MP, whose wife was Lady Arabella Clinton, co- heiress to the ancient Barony of Clinton. One of their daughters was Bridget Rolle (1648-1721), who brought the Barony of Clinton to her descendants by her husband Francis Trefusis of Trefusis in Cornwall. The last of the Rolles to own Hudscott was John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842), who married Louisa Trefusis (1794-1885), daughter of Robert George William Trefusis, 17th Baron Clinton (1764–1797). Lord Rolle having died childless, he selected as his heir his wife's nephew Hon. Mark Trefusis, who under the terms of the bequest adopted the name and arms of Rolle. (See further below). The marriage settlement between Samuel I Rolle and Dorothy Lovering is recorded as follows:Chanter, Rev.

Detail from the Rolle monument in Chittlehampton Church Samuel II Rolle (1704-1747), (only surviving son), MP for Barnstaple, who died without progeny and bequeathed his estates, including Hudscott, and the Lovering moiety in Countisbury, to his much wealthier distant cousin, Denys Rolle (1725–1797), MP, of Stevenstone.Chanter, p.166 A monument to Samuel I and his wife and to Samuel II survives on the west wall of the south transept of Chittlehampton Church inscribed as follows: :\\"To the memory of Samuel Rolle, Esq., Dorothy his wife and Samuel Rolle Esq., their son, who died: Feb. 28th 1734 aged 66; Ap. 14th 1735 aged 60; March 1st 1746 aged 43. And whose lives have left to posterity a more expressive memorial than can be perpetuated on the most durable marble\\". On the monument is shown an escutcheon with the arms of Rolle in the centre of which is an escutcheon of pretence with the arms of Lovering: Argent, on a fesse wavy azure a lion passant or, which signifies that Dorothy Lovering was an heiress. In 1737 Samuel II Rolle purchased the estate of Brightley, like Hudscott within the manor of Chittlehampton, from the executors of Caesar Giffard. The Giffards had acquired the lordship of the manor of Chittlehampton, and this too was acquired by Samuel II Rolle, and thus from 1737 Hudscott became the manor house of Chittlehampton.Andrews, no 128, 1958 Denys Rolle (1725–1797) Thomas Hudson (1701–79).

He was the 4th son of John Rolle (1679–1730), of Bicton and Stevenstone, and having three elder brothers it may have seemed unlikely in 1747 on the death of Samuel II Rolle that he would inherit the vast paternal Rolle estates. He resided at his manor of East Tytherley in Hampshire, and also at Hudscott, and all of his children were baptised at Chittlehampton.Vivian, p.656 His son's 1772 marriage settlement stated: \\"Whereas a marriage hath been lately agreed upon between John Rolle the only son of Denys Rolle of Hudscott in the county of Devon, esquire, and Judith Maria Walrond...\\"Marriage settlement for John Rolle But in 1779 following the death of the last surviving of his three elder brothers John Rolle Walter, he inherited the Rolle patrimony and became the largest landowner in Devon. He then had 5 seats at his disposal: Stevenstone and Beam, both near Great Torrington, Hudscott and Bicton near Exeter, all in Devon and East Tytherley in Hampshire.

About  Pederneira was also known as Seno Petronero , meaning Gulf of Pederneira in the Middle Ages. Situated near the mouth of the Alcoa River, on a rocky headland on the northern end of the Pederneira Bay, the town dates from the time of Dom Manuel (1469–1521), when a seaside village with 600 houses named Paredes was swallowed by sand. The local industry was fishing and the area has some of the best fisheries in Portugal, but the locals' livelihood was severely threatened by piracy, which is why the fishermen chose to live away from the beach, in Pederneira, whose location offered it protection from pirates who were active until the nineteenth century. A small battery was built at the sea end of the headland above a sheer cliff. At the highest point of the headland is the church of Nossa Senhora da Nazaré. It was attacked by a French army in 1808, who destroyed the majority of the inhabitants' houses, only four out of some 300 being left standing. Boats and fishing gear were also burnt. By the 1850s it had recovered, and had at that time about 2,000 inhabitants.

Gibbs was one of the first black commissioned officers in World War I and served as president of then North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College from 1955 to 1960. During his presidency, North Carolina A&T; became accredited by the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges.  Early life Warmoth T. Gibbs was born on April 5, 1892, in Baldwin, Louisiana, a town in the southern Louisiana region of Acadiana. Because of the lack of public education for African-Americans in the area, Gibbs received his primary education from a United Methodist Church boarding school for blacks. Gibbs earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. He later earned bachelor's degrees in political science and history, in addition to a master's degree in Education from Harvard University. Career Gibbs enlisted in the United States Army during World War I and became one of the few black officers of that time. Serving as a second lieutenant with the predominantly black 92nd Division Expeditionary Force, Gibbs saw battle in France in 1917 and 1918 before returning to the United States in 1919. In 1926, Gibbs began his career at the Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, now North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, as head of the military service unit and the school's dean of men. In 1928, Gibbs became the dean of the Department of General Services, of what is now the College of Arts and Sciences. After the death of then president, Dr. Ferdinand D. Bluford in 1955, Gibbs was appointed as the acting head of North Carolina A&T; College. He would be officially inaugurated as president of the college on November 9, 1956. During Gibbs' administration, the college acquired land to extend the main campus, A&T; was admitted to the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1959. The guidance center became a separate department, a placement office was established, athletics flourished and coaching staffs were reorganized. On February 1, 1960, one of the most dramatic events during the Gibbs administration occurred when four freshmen students, Ezell Blair, Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil, and David Richmond sat down at a segregated lunch counter at the downtown Greensboro Woolworth's store in protest of the company's policy of excluding African Americans from being served there. During the height of the protests, Greensboro's white city leaders urged Gibbs to use his authority as President to quell the student protesters who had taken to the streets to march; to which he responded \\"We teach our students how to think, not what to think.\\" This event, known as the Greensboro sit-ins, initiated a sit-in movement that was a pivotal event during the civil rights movement. On May 23, 1960, the role of President Emeritus was bestowed upon him by the college, and after 34 years of service to A&T;, Gibbs retired in 1966, at the age of 74. In that same year, he wrote the \\"History of The North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College,\\" which recounts the history of the university from its beginnings as a land grant institution to the administration of Dr. Lewis Dowdy. Death and legacy Gibbs died at Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital on April 19, 1993, at the age of 101. He was married for 49 years to Marece Jones Gibbs until her death in 1967. With his wife, they had three children: a daughter Elizabeth Gibbs Moore, and two sons Chandler and Warmoth Jr. A building on N.C. A&T;'s campus is named for Gibbs.

He is the James D. Wolfensohn Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and holds a Direction of Studies in Political and Moral Anthropology at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. He has been appointed to the Chair of Public Health at the Collège de France.  Career  Initially trained as a physician in Paris, Fassin practiced internal medicine as an infectious disease specialist at the Hospital Pitié-Salpétrière and taught public health at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie. He has been the physician of the Home for the Dying in Calcutta and the initiator of a national program of prevention of rheumatic heart disease in Tunisia where it was the first cause of death among young adults. Later shifting to the social sciences, he received his M.A. from the University of Paris, and his PhD from the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, writing his thesis on power relations and health inequalities in Senegal. After having been granted a fellowship by the French Institute for Andean Studies to investigate maternal mortality and living conditions among Indian women in Ecuador, Fassin became professor of sociology in 1991 at the University of Paris North. There, he created Cresp, the Center for Research on Social and Health Issues, working on public health problems such as the history of child lead poisoning in France and the politics of Aids in Sub- Saharan Africa. Elected in 1999 as director of studies in social anthropology at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Fassin founded and directed from 2007 to 2010 Iris, the Interdisciplinary Research Institute for Social Sciences, in an effort to bring together anthropologists, sociologists, historians, political scientists and legal scholars around contemporary political and social issues. He himself developed a long-term program exploring the multiple facets of humanitarianism in local and international policies, especially towards the poor, the immigrant and refugees, as well as victims of violence and epidemics. In parallel, he launched a research project on borders and boundaries in an attempt to articulate the issues around immigration and racialization, which were at the time dealt with in separate fields. In 2008, Fassin received an Advanced Grant by the European Research Council for his program Towards a Critical Moral Anthropology. To reappraise theoretical issues in the analysis of morals and moralities, he started an ethnographic research on police, justice and prison in France. This research gave birth to the proposal of a moral anthropology of the state. In 2009, he succeeded Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, and became the first James D. Wolfensohn Professor of Social Science. His inaugural public lecture was entitled “Critique of Humanitarian Reason”. In 2010, he also became Visiting Professor at the Universities of Princeton and Hong Kong. In 2019 he was elected at the Collège de France on the Annual Chair in Public Health. His Leçon inaugurale was on \\"The Inequality of Lives\\".Anne Chemin, “Didier Fassin entre au Collège de France : ‘L’inégalité la plus profonde est celle devant la vie même’”, Le Monde, 2020-01-11. In 2016, he received the Gold Medal of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, which is awarded every three years to an anthropologist. That same year, he gave the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at the University of California, Berkeley, on “The Will to Punish”, and the Adorno Lectures at the Goethe University of Frankfurt on “A Critical Anthropology of Life”. In 2018, he was the first social scientist to be given the Nomis Distinguished Scientist Award, which will support five years of research on crises.Kelly Devine Thomas, “Didier Fassin receives Nomis Distinguished Scientist Award”, Retrieved 2020-02-15. As part of this program, he developed in collaboration with Axel Honneth, an international program on crisis and critique.  Engagement  In France, Fassin has been involved in the politics of science, as a member of the Scientific Council of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm), and of the Scientific Council of the City of Paris. In 2006, he became the chair of the Committee for Humanities and Social Science in the French National Agency for Research, the main funding agency for scientific research in France. In 2017, he was appointed to the Scientific Council of the Contrôleur général des lieux de privation de liberté, the independent French Ombudsman for Prisons. In the United States, as a member of the Committee of World Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association from 2010 to 2013, he was committed to the global exchange of knowledge and the reduction of the gap between the North and the South in the development of social science. This concern translated in 2015 in a three-year cycle Summer Program in Social Science for Latin American, Middle Eastern and African junior scholars. In connection with his work on prison and punishment, Fassin was invited in 2018 to join the New Jersey Criminal Sentencing and Disposition Commission, which has been appointed by the Governor of the State to make recommendations about the penal and corrections system, as Guest Advisor.“New Jersey Criminal Sentencing and Disposition Commission. Annual Report”, November 2019. Retrieved 2020-02-15. Apart from his academic career, Fassin has been involved in various solidarity non-governmental organizations in France. In 1996 he founded the Medico-social Unit Villermé at the Hospital Avicenne to provide health care to uninsured and undocumented patients. He was administrator and later Vice-president of MSF, Doctors Without Borders, from 1999 to 2003, and is currently President of Comede, the Health Committee for the Exiles since 2006. A public intellectual, he frequently intervenes in the media on issues related to his research such as immigration, asylum, discrimination, social justice, law and order policies. He regards the social sciences as a form of “presence to the world” and has developed a program on the public life of ethnography.

The design was a standard trapezoidal layout, with four towers and a keep surrounding an inner courtyard, upgraded in the 14th century. It was sold to Jean de Bazoches in 1284 and successively owned by the Chastellux, Montmorillon and La Perrière families; in 1570, Jacques Le Prestre de Vauban acquired it when he married Françoise de la Perrière, an illegitimate daughter of the Count de Bazoches. In 1675, Jacques Le Prestre's grandson, the military engineer Vauban, purchased the property from his cousin with money awarded by Louis XIV for his role in the capture of Maastricht in 1673 and it was extensively upgraded.

Some philosophers equate naturalism with materialism. For example, philosopher Paul Kurtz argues that nature is best accounted for by reference to material principles. These principles include mass, energy, and other physical and chemical properties accepted by the scientific community. Further, this sense of naturalism holds that spirits, deities, and ghosts are not real and that there is no \\"purpose\\" in nature. Such an absolute belief in naturalism is commonly referred to as metaphysical naturalism. Assuming naturalism in working methods as the current paradigm, without the further consideration of naturalism as an absolute truth with philosophical entailment, is called methodological naturalism. With the exception of pantheists—who believe that Nature is identical with divinity while not recognizing a distinct personal anthropomorphic god—theists challenge the idea that nature contains all of reality. According to some theists, natural laws may be viewed as secondary causes of God(s). In the 20th century, Willard Van Orman Quine, George Santayana, and other philosophers argued that the success of naturalism in science meant that scientific methods should also be used in philosophy. Science and philosophy are said to form a continuum, according to this view.  Origins and history  The current usage of the term naturalism \\"derives from debates in America in the first half of the 20th century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars.\\"Papineau, David \\"Naturalism\\", in \\"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\" Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the natural sciences and the Anglo-American, analytic philosophical communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include Kai Nielsen, J. J. C. Smart, David Malet Armstrong, David Papineau, Paul Kurtz, Brian Leiter, Daniel Dennett, Michael Devitt, Fred Dretske, Paul and Patricia Churchland, Mario Bunge, Jonathan Schaffer, Hilary Kornblith, Quentin Smith, Paul Draper and Michael Martin, among many other academic philosophers. According to David Papineau, contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the \\"causal closure of the physical\\", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes. = Etymology = The term \\"methodological naturalism\\" is much more recent, though. According to Ronald Numbers, it was coined in 1983 by Paul de Vries, a Wheaton College philosopher. De Vries distinguished between what he called \\"methodological naturalism\\", a disciplinary method that says nothing about God's existence, and \\"metaphysical naturalism\\", which \\"denies the existence of a transcendent God\\".Nick Matzke: On the Origins of Methodological Naturalism. The Pandas Thumb (March 20, 2006) The term \\"methodological naturalism\\" had been used in 1937 by Edgar S. Brightman in an article in The Philosophical Review as a contrast to \\"naturalism\\" in general, but there the idea was not really developed to its more recent distinctions. Description According to Steven Schafersman, naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; # \\"Nature encompasses all that exists throughout space and time; # Nature (the universe or cosmos) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatio-temporal physical substance—mass–energy. Non-physical or quasi-physical substance, such as information, ideas, values, logic, mathematics, intellect, and other emergent phenomena, either supervene upon the physical or can be reduced to a physical account; # Nature operates by the laws of physics and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; # The supernatural does not exist, i.e., only nature is real. Naturalism is therefore a metaphysical philosophy opposed primarily by supernaturalism\\". Or, as Carl Sagan succinctly put it: \\"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.\\" In addition Arthur C. Danto states that Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is natural in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation. Arthur Newell Strahler states: \\"The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency.\\" \\"The great majority of contemporary philosophers urge that that reality is exhausted by nature, containing nothing ‘supernatural’, and that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas of reality, including the ‘human spirit’.” Philosophers widely regard naturalism as a \\"positive\\" term, and \\"few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'\\". Providing assumptions required for science According to Robert Priddy, all scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes; that is, that scientists must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals. These assumptions would then be justified partly by their adherence to the types of occurrence of which we are directly conscious, and partly by their success in representing the observed facts with a certain generality, devoid of ad hoc suppositions.\\" Kuhn also claims that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation. For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the \\"correct\\" paradigm, and there is no such thing as 'supernatural'. The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality, including the human spirit.Papineau, David \\"Naturalism\\", in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, quote, \\"The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily... reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'.\\" Some claim that naturalism is the implicit philosophy of working scientists, and that the following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method: #that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers. \\"The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality.\\" \\"Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed.\\" \\"Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves. As infants we made this assumption unconsciously. People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with solipsism.\\" \\"Without this assumption, there would be only the thoughts and images in our own mind (which would be the only existing mind) and there would be no need of science, or anything else.\\" #that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; \\"Science, at least today, assumes that the universe obeys to knoweable principles that don't depend on time or place, nor on subjective parameters such as what we think, know or how we behave.\\" Hugh Gauch argues that science presupposes that \\"the physical world is orderly and comprehensible.\\", \\"Expressed as a single grand statement, science presupposes that the physical world is orderly and comprehensible. The most obvious components of this comprehensive presupposition are that the physical world exists and that our sense perceptions are generally reliable.\\" #that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. Stanley Sobottka said: \\"The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish. For the most part, science is the discovering and explaining of the external world.\\" \\"Science attempts to produce knowledge that is as universal and objective as possible within the realm of human understanding.\\" # that Nature has uniformity of laws and most if not all things in nature must have at least a natural cause. Biologist Stephen Jay Gould referred to these two closely related propositions as the constancy of nature's laws and the operation of known processes., \\"You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of known processes. It works the other way around.\\" You first assume these propositions and \\"then you go to the outcrop of rock.\\" Simpson agrees that the axiom of uniformity of law, an unprovable postulate, is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate inductive inference into the unobservable past in order to meaningfully study it., \\"Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation.\\" # that experimental procedures will be done satisfactorily without any deliberate or unintentional mistakes that will influence the results. # that experimenters won't be significantly biased by their presumptions. # that random sampling is representative of the entire population. A simple random sample (SRS) is the most basic probabilistic option used for creating a sample from a population. The benefit of SRS is that the investigator is guaranteed to choose a sample that represents the population that ensures statistically valid conclusions.  Metaphysical naturalism  Metaphysical naturalism, also called \\"ontological naturalism\\" and \\"philosophical naturalism\\", is a philosophical worldview and belief system that holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the natural sciences, i.e., those required to understand our physical environment by mathematical modeling. Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers exclusively to the methodology of science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation. Metaphysical naturalism holds that all properties related to consciousness and the mind are reducible to, or supervene upon, nature. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is religious naturalism or spiritual naturalism. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the supernatural concepts and explanations that are part of many religions.  Methodological naturalism  Methodological naturalism concerns itself with methods of learning what nature is. These methods are useful in the evaluation of claims about existence and knowledge and in identifying causal mechanisms responsible for the emergence of physical phenomena. It attempts to explain and test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second sense of the term \\"naturalism\\" seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature. Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge. It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a philosophy of knowledge. Studies by sociologist Elaine Ecklund suggest that religious scientists in practice apply methodological naturalism. They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications – often moral – of their work, but not the way they practice science. Steven Schafersman states that methodological naturalism is \\"the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within the scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is.\\" In a series of articles and books from 1996 onward, Robert T. Pennock wrote using the term \\"methodological naturalism\\" to clarify that the scientific method confines itself to natural explanations without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and is not based on dogmatic metaphysical naturalism. Pennock's testimony as an expert witness at the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial was cited by the Judge in his Memorandum Opinion concluding that \\"Methodological naturalism is a 'ground rule' of science today\\":Kitzmiller v. Dover: Whether ID is Science > Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th > and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural > causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may > be important and have merit, they are not part of science.\\" Methodological > naturalism is thus \\"a paradigm of science.\\" It is a \\"ground rule\\" that > \\"requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon > what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify. Judge John E. Jones, III > Decision of the Court Expert witnesses were John F. Haught, Robert T. > Pennock, and Kenneth R. Miller. Links in the original to specific testimony > records have been deleted here. Schafersman writes that \\"while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism\\", and \\"I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled.\\" Views = Alvin Plantinga = Alvin Plantinga, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Notre Dame, and a Christian, has become a well-known critic of naturalism. He suggests, in his evolutionary argument against naturalism, that the probability that evolution has produced humans with reliable true beliefs, is low or inscrutable, unless the evolution of humans was guided (for example, by God). According to David Kahan of the University of Glasgow, in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of supernatural theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology. (See also supernormal stimuli). Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable \\"defeater for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable\\", i.e., a skeptical argument along the lines of Descartes' evil demon or brain in a vat. = Robert T. Pennock = Robert T. Pennock contends Robert T. Pennock, Supernaturalist Explanations and the Prospects for a Theistic Science or \\"How do you know it was the lettuce?\\" that as supernatural agents and powers \\"are above and beyond the natural world and its agents and powers\\" and \\"are not constrained by natural laws\\", only logical impossibilities constrain what a supernatural agent cannot do. He states: \\"If we could apply natural knowledge to understand supernatural powers, then, by definition, they would not be supernatural.\\" As the supernatural is necessarily a mystery to us, it can provide no grounds on which one can judge scientific models. \\"Experimentation requires observation and control of the variables.... But by definition we have no control over supernatural entities or forces.\\" Science does not deal with meanings; the closed system of scientific reasoning cannot be used to define itself. Allowing science to appeal to untestable supernatural powers would make the scientist's task meaningless, undermine the discipline that allows science to make progress, and \\"would be as profoundly unsatisfying as the ancient Greek playwright's reliance upon the deus ex machina to extract his hero from a difficult predicament.\\" Naturalism of this sort says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, anything that one can examine and explain scientifically would not be supernatural, simply by definition. = W. V. O. Quine = W. V. O. Quine describes naturalism as the position that there is no higher tribunal for truth than natural science itself. In his view, there is no better method than the scientific method for judging the claims of science, and there is neither any need nor any place for a \\"first philosophy\\", such as (abstract) metaphysics or epistemology, that could stand behind and justify science or the scientific method. Therefore, philosophy should feel free to make use of the findings of scientists in its own pursuit, while also feeling free to offer criticism when those claims are ungrounded, confused, or inconsistent. In Quine's view, philosophy is \\"continuous with\\" science and both are empirical. Naturalism is not a dogmatic belief that the modern view of science is entirely correct. Instead, it simply holds that science is the best way to explore the processes of the universe and that those processes are what modern science is striving to understand. However, this Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters among philosophers. = Karl Popper = Karl Popper equated naturalism with inductive theory of science. He rejected it based on his general critique of induction (see problem of induction), yet acknowledged its utility as means for inventing conjectures. Popper instead proposed that science should adopt a methodology based on falsifiability for demarcation, because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a single experiment can contradict one. Popper holds that scientific theories are characterized by falsifiability.

One common example is the rainbow, when light from the sun is reflected and refracted by water droplets. Some phenomena, such as the green ray, are so rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical.

Relatively speaking this group is unreactive. The amine center is no longer basic. The S-N bond is cleaved only with difficulty. Because of the rigidity of the functional group, sulfonamides are typically crystalline. For this reason, the formation of a sulfonamide is a classic method to convert an amine into a crystalline derivative which can be identified by its melting point. Many important drugs contain the sulfonamide group. A sulfonamide (compound) is a compound that contains this group. The general formula is RSO2NH2, where R is some organic group. For example, \\"methanesulfonamide\\" is CH3SO2NH2. Any sulfonamide can be considered as derived from a sulfonic acid by replacing a hydroxyl group with an amine group. In medicine, the term \\"sulfonamide\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for sulfa drug, a derivative or variation of sulfanilamide. The first sulfonamide was discovered in Germany in 1932. Synthesis Sulfonamides can be prepared in the laboratory in many ways. The classic approach entails the reaction of sulfonyl chlorides with an amine. :RSO2Cl + R2NH → RSO2NR2 \\\\+ HCl A base such as pyridine is typically added to absorb the HCl that is generated.

Sultams Sultams are cyclic sulfonamides. Bioactive sultams include the antiinflammatory ampiroxicam and the anticonvulsant sultiame. Sultams are prepared analogously to other sulfonamides, allowing for the fact that sulfonic acids are deprotonated by amines. They are often prepared by one-pot oxidation of disulfides or thiols linked to amines.Rassadin, V.; Grosheva, D.; Tomashevskii, A. Sokolov, V. \\"Methods of Sultam Synthesis\\" Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds 2013, Vol. 49, p39-65. 27. .

It was founded in Warrington in 1757 as a college for Unitarian students and moved to Oxford in 1893. It became a full college of the university in 1996, taking its current name to commemorate its predecessor the Manchester Academy and a benefaction by Lord Harris of Peckham. The college is one of very few mixed-sex higher education colleges in the UK whose postgraduate and undergraduate places are exclusively for students aged 21 years or over.  History  = Foundation and relocation = Warrington Academy The college started as the Warrington Academy in 1757 where its teachers included Joseph Priestley, before being refounded as the Manchester Academy in Manchester in 1786.University of Oxford: Graduate Studies Prospectus - Last updated 17 Sep 08 Originally run by English Presbyterians, it was one of several dissenting academies that provided religious nonconformists with higher education, as at the time the only universities in England – Oxford and Cambridge – were restricted to Anglicans. It taught radical theology as well as modern subjects, such as science, modern languages, language, and history; as well as the classics. Its most famous professor was John Dalton, developer of atomic theory. The college changed its location five times before settling in Oxford. It was located in Manchester between 1786 and 1803. It moved to York until 1840. It was located at 38 Monkgate, just outside Monkbar; later this was the first building of the College of Ripon and York St John (now York St John University). The key person in York was Charles Wellbeloved, a Unitarian minister, after whom a function room in the college is named. Because he would not move to Manchester, the college moved to York to have him as head. At first he taught all subjects, but hired additional tutors after a year. He always worked hard and several times his health broke. Wellbeloved did not allow the school to be called Unitarian because he wanted students to have an open mind and to discover the truth for themselves. In 1809 he wrote to George Wood, Under Wellbeloved's principalship 235 students were educated at the college: 121 divinity students and 114 laymen. Of the former, 30 did not enter the ministry and five entered the Anglican priesthood. Among the lay students were scholars, public servants, businessmen, and notable men in the arts. The majority was Unitarian. In 1840, when age forced him to retire, the college moved back to Manchester, where it stayed until 1853. In 1840, the college started an association with the University of London, and gained the right to present students for degrees from London. Between 1853 and 1889 the college was located in London, in University Hall, Gordon Square. From London it moved to Oxford, opening its new buildings in 1893. = Social reform = In its early days, the college supported reforming causes, such as the abolition of slavery (1778), and the repeal of the Test Act (1828) and the Corporation Act (1828). In 1922 the principal, L.P. Jacks, hosted Rudolf Steiner to present a conference on alternative education and the model Waldorf school at Stuttgart, Germany which led to the establishment of such schools in Britain.Paull, John (2011) Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain. European Journal of Educational Studies, 3 (1): 53–66. In the 1920s and 1930s, the college provided courses for the Workers' Educational Association. Women were permitted to attend some lectures in college from 1876, and in 1877, the college set up a series of examinations in theology, which could be taken by women as well as men.Communication from Susan Killoran, college librarian In 1901, Gertrude von Petzold graduated from her training at Manchester College to become a minister in the Unitarian church- the first woman to be qualified as a minister in England. This was possible despite the fact that Oxford University did not formally accept female students or award them degrees until 1920 because Manchester College was at that time associated with the University of London, which in 1878 became the first UK university to award degrees to women. = Modern day = College's Mansfield Road facade Manchester College became a permanent private hall of Oxford University in 1990 and subsequently a full constituent college, being granted a Royal Charter in 1996.www.hmc.ox.ac.uk At the same time, it changed its name to Harris Manchester College in recognition of a benefaction by Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham. Formerly known as Manchester College, it is listed in the University Statutes (V.1) as Manchester Academy and Harris College, and at university ceremonies it is called Collegium de Harris et Manchester. Today the college only accepts students over the age of 21, both for undergraduate and graduate studies. The college tries to continue its liberal and pioneering ethos, considering its mature student focus as a modern means of providing higher education to those that have been excluded from it in the past. The college houses several research centres, including the Commercial Law Centre, directed by Prof Kristin van Zwieten, Clifford Chance Associate Professor of Law and Finance, which engages in research in all aspects of national, international, transnational and comparative law relating to commerce and finance; and the WellBeing Research Centre, directed by Prof Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, which applies interdisciplinary research and teaching on well-being at Oxford.  Buildings  The main quad was designed by architect Thomas Worthington, and built between 1889 and 1893. It houses the Tate Library and the chapel. The Arlosh hall, designed by Percy Worthington, was added in 1913. The college also has several newer buildings to the West of the main quad. In 2013–2014 the Siew-Sngiem Clock Tower & Sukum Navapan Gate were added to the Arlosh quad. The inscription on the tower \\"It is later than you think, but it is never too late\\", refers to the role of the college in educating mature students. In 2018 a new building named Maevadi Hall was completed after two years of construction. It is situated to the west of the Arlosh Hall and contains a conference room, student accommodation and a student social area. = Chapel = Interior of chapel The chapel designed by \\"Worthington and Elgood\\" was inaugurated in 1893. The chapel is notable for its stained-glass windows by the Pre-Raphaelite artists Sir Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, as well as its ornate wood carvings and organ, which was painted by Morris and Co. Seating in the chapel consisted of individual chairs until pews were added in 1897. The oak screen was added in 1896 and the original windows were made of plain glass until the installation of stained glass windows in 1895 and 1899. Particularly noteworthy are the stained glass windows on the north wall of the chapel, which were installed in 1896 and depict the Six Days of Creation. These were donated by James and Isabella Arlosh in memory of their son Godfrey. The Unitarian-affiliated Manchester College Oxford Chapel Society meets in the college chapel on Sundays. The society is affiliated to the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. = The Tate Library = Library gallery Despite being one of the smallest colleges of Oxford University, Harris Manchester boasts the sixth largest college library and offers the best student population to book ratio. It houses a collection of books and manuscripts dating back to the fifteenth century. The Tate Library was built by Sir Henry Tate, the benefactor behind London’s Tate Gallery. The library was expanded in 2011 with the addition of a gallery, designed to blend in with the Victorian Gothic architecture. The library is well stocked in all the major subjects offered by the college including English Literature, Philosophy, Theology, Politics, Economics, Law, History and Medicine. It also holds a significant collection on the history of Protestant dissent in England and is home to the Carpenter Library of World Religions, donated to the college by its former principal, J. Estlin Carpenter. Harris Manchester College is located 200 metres from the Bodleian Library, the main research library of Oxford University, as well as the English, History, Social Sciences, and Law faculty libraries.  Student life  Despite the small student body, the college offers a wide array of courses. Many undergraduate tutorials are carried out in the college, though for some specialist papers undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges. Members are generally expected to dine in the Arlosh Hall, where there is a twice-weekly formal dinner on Mondays and Wednesdays at which students dress in jackets, ties, and gowns. = Sports = Although the college does not have its own sports ground, it consistently enters women's and men's teams into the university leagues, and members routinely join teams from other colleges. The college has a punt, The Royle Yacht, and a croquet lawn and all members of the college have access to the gym and spa at the Oxford Spires Four Pillars Hotel as well as the Oxford University pool on Iffley Road. In recent years the college's ice hockey team has been successful, once winning second place in the intercollegiate cuppers tournament, with the Basketball team winning third place in its intercollegiate cuppers tournament the year before. There is also an active pool team and a thriving squash club. Harris Manchester also has an affiliation with neighbouring Wadham College for those interested in becoming members of Wadham College Boat Club, which came in second in the 2012 Women's Torpids and Summer VIIIs, and saw both the First and Second Men's boats winning blades. = Junior Common Room (JCR) Bar = Harris Manchester has one of the three remaining student run college bars in Oxford (the others being Balliol College and St Cross College). The common room is decorated with William Morris wallpaper. The bar offers a particularly strong selection of single malt whiskies.

He was the principal investigator of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), a spectrograph and camera which was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997. Woodgate oversaw the design, development and construction of the STIS. Astronomers and other scientists have used the STIS to study and measure a wide range of light wavelengths in deep space. Woodgate's invention has been called a \\"game changer\\" in the field of astronomy, allowing scientists to discover an \\"invisible high-speed collision\\" near SN 1987A, as well as new planets and black holes. A power failure knocked STIS offline in 2004, but it was repaired in 2009. Aside his from his work as the principal investigator on STIS, Woodgate had also begun development on a new UV detector which counts protons utilizing new nano-fabrication technologies. He was active in several new technologies such as photon-counting electron multiplying CCDs and integral field spectrographs designed for the direct detection of habitable exoplanets. He was honored with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Award of Merit from the Goddard Space Flight Center. In addition to Goddard research, he was an avid sailor and an instructor in the Goddard Sailing Association. Woodgate was born and raised in Eastbourne, East Sussex, England. He lived in a home on St. Anthony's Avenue in Eastbourne as a child and attended Eastbourne Grammar School. He began his career in astronomy and engineering at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which was located at Herstmonceux Castle at the time. Woodgate then moved to London, where he earned a doctorate from University College London. He moved to the United States, where he held positions at Columbia University's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. In 1975, Woodgate joined the staff of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where he worked for the rest of his career.

The castle had a moat and drawbridge and was surrounded by a second perimeter wall beyond which were landscaped gardens. History A small castle or a fortified house certainly already occupied the place from the 12th century. Eventually, in the 14th century, the castle passed from the Barrys of Aixe to the Pérusses, a family of knights originally from Ségur-le-Château in Correze. At the end of the 15th century, Geoffrey Pérusse, built a residence at Les Cars, which became the location of the family's principal residence. with gardens installed in the 16th Century, and latter extended in the 18th century. Jacques François de Pérusse des Cars was born there in 1738. At the time of the French Revolution, the Pérusse family emigrated to England and the castle was pillaged and eventually sold to quarrymen who demolished it for re- sale as building material, sparing only the artillery tower in the south-west angle and part of the main tower.

Oil on canvas, The Arch of Titus is an 1871 oil painting on canvas. It was a collaboration between three American painters: George Peter Alexander Healy, Frederic E. Church, and Jervis McEntee. It depicts the Arch of Titus in Rome, with the Colosseum in the background, and includes portraits of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his daughter Edith, and the three artists. The painting is currently on display in the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey. Description The painting depicts a number of people under the Arch of Titus in Rome, with the Colosseum in the background. The Arch was painted by Church, and the Colosseum by McEntee. Healy, a portraitist, painted five figures in two groups. To the left, under the Arch, are Henry Wadsworth Longfellow with his daughter Edith, copied from a photograph. To the right are the three artists: Church is seated sketching, while Healy looks over his left shoulder, and McEntee stands behind them pointing at the sketch. On the death in 1926 of Jonathan Ackerman Coles, son of American doctor Abraham Coles, the painting was bequeathed to Newark Museum.  The artists  George Peter Alexander Healy, a portrait artist, was living in Italy during the time that he collaborated on The Arch of Titus. Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1813, Healy received encouragement from painter Thomas Sully to pursue his artistic career. After opening his own portrait studio at the age of eighteen, Healy realized that he did not have the professional skills necessary in order for him to reach his fullest potential as an artist. Because of this, in 1834, he went to Paris to study with artist Antoine Jean Gros at the École des Beaux-Arts, one of the most influential art schools in France. The school focused on classical styles and on preserving these ideas to be passed on to future generations. After finishing school Healy completed a yearlong tenure under Gros. By the mid-1840s, Healy's reputation had begun to grow and he began painting portrait for prominent figures such as Lewis Cass, the American minister to France and Louis-Phillipe, king of the French. Eventually, Healy gained international recognition and a broad range of clientele. With his wife and seven children, Healy alternated residence between Europe and American. He continued to paint some of the most well known people of his time. One of his commissions included a series or portraits of the American presidents. In 1866 Healy moved with his family to Rome, and it was during his time there that he collaborated on The Arch of Titus. Healy's contribution to The Arch of Titus was the figures, fittingly as he was a portrait painter. Throughout all his paintings, his sitters are always represented in a pleasant manner and evoked a certain sense of calmness, which is seen true in The Arch of Titus (Fink). Unlike Healy and many of the other American artists of that time period, Frederic E. Church did not study abroad. He was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1826, to a well-off family. His father secured him a spot to study under landscape artist Thomas Cole in Catskill, New York. Cole declared Church as \\"having the finest eye for drawing in the world.\\" After studying under Cole, Church opened his own studio in New York. In New York he established a reputation for his paintings of expansive New York and New England views. His reputation grew to international recognition for his painting Niagara. Church encountered the work of Alexander von Humboldt, a naturalist and explorer, who encouraged artists to travel and paint in South America. Inspired, Church made two trips to Colombia in 1857 and to Ecuador in 1957 respectively. After the loss of his wife and two children, Church traveled to Jamaica to help him deal with his grief. After starting a new family, Church continued traveling visiting Palestine and Jordan, and culminating in a trip to Rome in 1869. It was the memories and sketches from this visit that he drew upon for his part in the collaboration on The Arch of Titus. (Newark Museum) A student of Church's, Jervis McEntee was born in Rondout, New York in 1828. McEntee traveled through Europe in 1869, the same year the Church visited Rome. Although McEntee did not receive the same fame as Healy or Church, he is most well known for his meticulously kept journals.  References  * \\"American Art - Picturing America.\\" Newark Museum.

Fragments of his poetry survive as quotations in other ancient authors, the most extensive and well known of which is a satiric account of different types of women which is often cited in discussions of misogyny in Archaic Greece. The poem takes the form of a catalogue, with each type of woman represented by an animal whose characteristics—in the poet's scheme—are also characteristic of a large body of the female population. Other fragments belong to the registers of gnomic poetry and wisdom literature in which the Hesiodic Works and Days and the Theognidea are classed, and reflect a similarly pessimistic view of the human experience. There is also evidence that Semonides composed the sort of personal invective found in the work of his near contemporary iambographer Archilochus and the later Hipponax, but no surviving fragment can be securely attributed to such a poem. Name and biography The name \\"Semonides\\" (, Sēmōnídes) is attested by an entry transmitted in two ancient lexica—the Etymologicum Genuinum and Etymologicum Magnum—which apparently had Choeroboscus as its immediate source: Simonides: in the case of the iambic poet is written with an eta, as in \\"sign\\" (sēma); the name of the lyric poet is written with an iota, as in \\"snub-nosed\\" (sīmos). — ChoeroboscusThe entry is identical in the Et. Gen. and Et. Mag., save for the attribution to Choeroboscus which is only found in the latter (). The lyric poet mentioned herein is Simonides of Ceos (6th–5th centuries BC). Despite the testimony of the etymologica, every source that quotes the iambic poet spells his name identically with that of his more famous namesake,. and the only other author who uses the form \\"Semonides\\" is Philodemus.Philodemus, On Poems, quoted by . Whatever the poet's name actually was, modern scholarship has adopted Choeroboscus' distinction between the two forms as a means of distinguishing the two poets.. Still, the homophony of their names in ancient quotations leaves open the possibility that some fragments attributed to Simonides might actually belong to Semonides.; cf. . Two notices in the tenth-century encyclopedia known as the Suda provide most of the extant details of Semonides' life. His primary lemma reads: \\"Simonides [sic], son of Crines, of Amorgos, iambic writer. He wrote elegiac poetry in two books and iambics. He was born (or 'flourished': ) 490 years after the Trojan War [i.e. 693 BC]. He was the first to write iambics according to some.\\"Suda s.v. 446), trans. . Further information has been conflated with the entry on Simmias of Rhodes; the relevant portion is: Other contradictory dates for Semonides' birth or floruit are found in the chronographic tradition relying upon Eusebius' Chronicon (Olympiad 29.1 = 664 BC), Cyril of Alexandria (29th Olympiad = 664–661), and Clement of Alexandria (20th Olympiad = 700–697).The Eusebian date is found in Jerome's translation, the Armenian text of Eusebius gives the year 665; Cyril, Contra Iulianum 1.14; Clement, Stromata 1.21.131. Semonides' role in the colonisation of Amorgos and his identification as a contemporary of Archilochus in the ancient testimonia recommend accepting the later dates of Eusebius and Cyril, and today he is almost universally considered to have lived in the middle and latter half of the seventh century., , , . believes that the ancient testimonia represent pure conjecture and argues that Semonides lived in the late sixth century on the basis of what he perceives as modish (relatively speaking) thought in a passage of Semonides fr. 7. Based upon a perceived allusion to Archilochus at Semonides 7.51–2 some have refined the chronology further, arguing that Semonides either lived after Archilochus or was his younger contemporary.Cf. . If the Sudas testimony that Semonides participated in the colonization of Amorgos is true, he likely had a political career similar to that of Archilochus, who was among the colonists of Thasos.. Poetry Although the Suda states that Semonides composed elegy as well iambus, none of his elegiac poetry has survived.An elegiac quotation in Stobaeus was formerly attributed to Semonides by some (e.g. ), but is now known to be the work of Simonides by virtue of its overlapping the text of a papyrus fragment securely assigned to that poet. The text now stands as Simonides frr. 19 and 20.5–12 in West's edition; cf. . alone has continued to argue that, despite the papyrological evidence, this fragment is the work of Semonides. If the encyclopedia's information is to be trusted, it is probable that the first entry's \\"elegiac poetry in two books\\" refers to the Early History of Samos in the second.. This work would belong to the genre of ktisis (\\"foundation\\") poetry which Mimnermus' elegiac Smyrneis might also have represented.. Semonides' poetry, as is the case with archaic elegy and iambus in general, is composed in a literary Ionic dialect largely reminiscent of Homeric Greek and occasionally includes echoes of Homeric and Hesiodic poetry.. The extant fragments are written in iambic trimeters, a stichic verse form also employed by Archilochus which would later be the primary meter of dialogue in tragedy. To judge from the admittedly small sample of his work, Semonides was a conservative metrician: in 180 lines there is not a single certain instance of resolution..

Background  Traditional histories did not provide information on when or where Zhao Sun was born. He was from a prominent aristocratic family, with his grandfather Zhao Yin's having served as a chancellor during the reign of the late Tang emperor Emperor Xuānzong. Zhao Sun's father Zhao Guangyi, as well as his uncles Zhao Guangfeng and Zhao Guangyin all served in the imperial government in the very late Tang times, as well as during Tang's successor state Later Liang.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 62. In 908, Later Liang's emperor Zhu Quanzhong sent Zhao Guangyi and another official, Li Yinheng, to bestow the Later Liang vassal, the warlord Liu Yin, the titles of military governor (Jiedushi) of Qinghai (清海, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) and Jinghai (靜海, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) Circuits. After the ceremony, however, Liu Yin did not allow Zhao or Li to return to the Later Liang court, but kept them to serve on his staff.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 917, when Liu Yin's brother and successor Liu Yan declared himself emperor of a new state of Yue — whose name was shortly after changed to Han and therefore became historically known as Southern Han — Zhao, Li, and another official, Yang Dongqian, were made chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. Despite Zhao's service as Southern Han's chancellor, he had long longed to return to central China, as he felt that, as a member of a prominent Central Plains aristocratic family, it was shameful to serve for a regional state. Knowing this, Liu Yan wanted to comfort him, and therefore forged a letter in his handwriting style and sent a secret messenger to Luoyang to summon Zhao Sun and another son (Zhao Sun's brother) Zhao Yi (趙益) to Southern Han, and Zhao Sun and Zhao Yi subsequently took their families and went to Southern Han. Their arrivals was a pleasant surprise for Zhao Guangyi, and it was said that thereafter he wholeheartedly served Liu Yan.  Service in Southern Han  Zhao Sun himself rose in the ranks of the Southern Han imperial government, eventually becoming chief imperial scholar (翰林學士承旨, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi) and Shangshu Zuocheng (尚書左丞), one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). Zhao Guangyi died in 940.Book of Southern Han (南漢書), vol. 9. After Zhao Guangyi's death, Liu Yan commissioned Zhao Sun as chancellor (with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事)) as well as Menxia Shilang (門下侍郎, deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省)). Zhao Sun himself died in 941, while still serving as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 62. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282.

It was written for the wedding of Anne, Princess Royal and Prince William of Orange and was first performed during their marriage at the French Chapel in St James's Palace, London, on 14 March 1734. The music is set to English texts chosen from the biblical books of Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus. Background Anne, Princess Royal The German-born Handel had been resident in London since 1712 and had there achieved great success as a composer of Italian operas. He had also enjoyed the patronage of monarchs Queen Anne, George I and George II and other members of the royal family and had been commissioned by them to compose numerous pieces of music for worship services in the royal chapels as well as for other royal occasions. Handel enjoyed a particularly warm and close relationship with Anne, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of George II, who supported his opera seasons, was an accomplished musician herself, and to whom Handel even gave private lessons - although he did not enjoy teaching, he made an exception in her case. The evening before the wedding, the princess, the rest of the royal family and all their court attended the first performance of a full length operatic entertainment,\\"Parnasso in Festa\\", specially composed by Handel for the occasion at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket where he was presenting his seasons of Italian operas, and with the same star opera singers who were appearing in his current successful opera. \\"Arianna in Creta\\". The princess had herself chosen the biblical texts which Handel set to music in the anthem. It is a festive piece with double choruses, i.e., the choral writing is for eight parts rather than the usual four. During the wedding service, while the performance of Handel's anthem was taking place there were no processions or ceremonies or other activities happening; the order of service indicated this was the only time the princess and her bridegroom sat in the chairs provided for them. They and everyone else present gave Handel's music their full attention.

Pi was filmed on high-contrast black-and-white reversal film and earned Aronofsky the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Gotham Open Palm Award. The title refers to the mathematical constant pi. The film explores themes of religion, mysticism, and the relationship of the universe to mathematics. The story, about a mathematician with an obsession to find underlying complete order in the real world, contrasts two seemingly irreconcilable entities: the imperfect, irrational humanity and the rigor and regularity of mathematics, specifically number theory.Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope, Bloomsbury Academic Plot Unemployed and living in a drab apartment in Chinatown, Manhattan, Max Cohen is a number theorist who believes everything in nature can be understood through numbers. Max suffers from cluster headaches, extreme paranoia, hallucinations, and social anxiety disorder. His only social interactions are with Jenna, a young girl fascinated with his ability to perform complex calculations; Devi, a young woman living next door; and Sol Robeson, his mathematics mentor, now an invalid. Max tries to program his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. Euclid malfunctions, printing out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max throws away the printout. The next morning, he learns that Euclid's pick was accurate, but cannot find the printout. When Max mentions the number, Sol becomes unnerved and asks if it contained 216 digits, revealing that he came across the same number years ago. He urges Max to take a break from his work. Max meets Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who does mathematical research on the Torah. Lenny demonstrates some simple Gematria, the correspondence of the Hebrew alphabet to numbers, and explains that some people believe the Torah is a string of numbers forming a code sent by God. Intrigued, Max notes some of the concepts are similar to other mathematical concepts such as the Fibonacci sequence. Max is approached by agents of a Wall Street firm; agent Marcy Dawson offers Max a classified computer chip called \\"Ming Mecca\\" in exchange for the results of his work. Using the chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid displays the 216-digit number before crashing. As Max writes down the number, he realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes an epiphany, and passes out. Waking up, Max appears to become clairvoyant and visualizes the stock market patterns he had searched for. His headaches intensify, and he discovers a vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after Sol urges him to quit his work. Dawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number, having found the printout Max threw away. Attempting to use it to manipulate the stock market, the firm instead caused the market to crash. Driving by, Lenny rescues Max, but takes him to his companions at a nearby synagogue. They ask Max to give them the 216-digit number, believing it was meant for them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting that the number has been revealed to him alone. Max flees and visits Sol, only to learn that he died from another stroke, and finds a piece of paper with the number in his study. At his own apartment, Max experiences another headache but does not take his painkillers. Driven to the brink of madness, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through his pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who turns out to be a hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and blithely performs an impromptu trepanning on himself with an improvised cranial drill. Sometime later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 ÷ 238 (an approximation for pi). Max smiles and says that he does not know the answer. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace.

Through doing this, they managed to accumulate an estimated $60,000 for their production budget. The film was shot on an Aaton XTR Prod Camera, which shoots with 16mm film and a Bolex H16 Camera, used for most of the handheld shots, and the lens manufacturer used was Angenieux. The film was shot on black and white reversal film stock, Aronofsky aimed for high-contrast shots to give Pi a more \\"technically raw and spontaneous\\" look. While a \\"no-budget film\\" is challenging it allows for a more authentic display of creativity. Within Pi, stunts were replaced with ideas, action sequences with allegorical montages and special effects with a haunting redefinition of New York City. For the main set which was Max Cohen’s apartment, Scott Franklin's father lent the production his warehouse out in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY. They cleared out a backroom and used it as a sound stage. There, they built Euclid, Max Cohen's super computer and shot the majority of the film there. New York was chosen for this film due to Darren Aronofsky's upbringing and all that he was surrounded with growing up. The film gives a greater multicultural view of the city which is the way Darren Aronofsky personally viewed New York. That being said, to shoot on location the production usually needs to obtain permits. This costs money and as a low budget film, permits weren't on the top of Aronofsky's list. For that reason, a lot of the film was technically shot illegally with all of the subway and New York City scenes shot without permits. It cost more to finish the film than it did to shoot it. The post budget was $68,183 which mostly went to post-production sound, post-production film and lab work, and film editing. Throughout the entirety of shooting Pi, they shot fifty-three thousand feet of 16mm film, which amounts to about 23 hours over a 28 day period. =Budget breakdown= Pi was produced under the SAG Limited Exhibition Agreement and actors were paid $75 a day. Under this agreement the film was only allowed to be shown in limited art venues. If or when the film was to be sold for broader distribution, it would be required for actors to receive an increased payment. As for set operations which includes but is not limited to catering, different location expenses, and the grip department, Aronofsky stated that “Every member of the crew was on deferment for $200 a day. These deferred personnel also split 45 profit points. But, we couldn't find a grip or gaffer to do it for free, so we paid those guys $50 a day.” Wardrobe mainly consisted of actors wearing their own clothing with the exception of Sean Gullete. Most of his wardrobe was thrifted. There was a standard kit fee for make-up and hair dressing which amounts to around $25 per day. The producers managed to get a free lighting package. All of the money within the electric department was then shifted toward the gaffer and expendables. The Bolex H16 Camera was borrowed, but the crew ended up breaking this camera. Money came out of the budget to fix it. They also got an Aanton 16mm camera package. Vehicles used within the film included a cab and a station wagon. In order to obtain a cab for that specific shot, Aronofsky stated that they hailed a cab and paid the driver $100 in order for him to keep his car there. They also paid their consulting producer for his station wagon. Pi was shot on 16mm black and white reversal stock. They sent the film to be developed in Bono Labs in Arlington, Virginia. According to Aronofsky, this particular lab was the only one that could develop this type of stock, thus resulting in the crew only receiving dailies after a week of sending the footage in. Raw stock cost $5,414 and developing it cost $18,000. While the crew got to shoot the film in a warehouse for free, they did have to pay for the electricity bill, which increased dramatically during filming. During post-production, most of the budget went toward the negative cut which was a matchback from an AVID cut-list. The score was created by Clint Mansell on his own equipment and was paid a deferred fee. The rest of the money for music went toward rights for festival entries. There was a separate budget for film and lab for post production for the blow up release print, which cost roughly $25,571. Another $3,000 went to the 35mm optical soundtrack. The production cost a total of $60,927, and post-production costs amounted to $68,183. Along with other expenses, including insurance, the film cost a total of $134,815. Themes =Mathematics= Pi features multiple references to mathematics and mathematical theories. For instance, Max finds the golden spiral occurring everywhere, including the stock market. Max's belief that diverse systems embodying highly nonlinear dynamics share a unifying pattern bears much similarity to results in chaos theory, which provides machinery for describing certain phenomena of nonlinear systems, which might be thought of as patterns. During the climactic drill scene, a pattern resembling a bifurcation diagram is apparent on Max's shattered mirror. =The game of Go= In the film, Max periodically plays Go with his mentor, Sol. This game has historically stimulated the study of mathematics and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy. Each character uses the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a microcosm of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts its complexity gradually converges toward patterns that can be found. Both Gullette and Margolis spent many hours learning the game at the Brooklyn Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant, Dan Weiner, for the film. The film credits list Barbara Calhoun, Michael Solomon, and Dan Wiener as Go consultants. =Kabbalah= Early in the film, when Lenny begins talking with Max about his work, he asks if Max is familiar with kabbalah. The numerological interpretation of the Torah and the 216-letter name of God, known as the Shem HaMeforash, are important concepts in traditional Jewish mysticism. =Quran= Another religious reference is when Max is in the market looking for today's newspaper, there is a recitation from Quran, in the background, citing Quran 2:140: \\"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are you more knowing or is Allah?' And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.\\" =Schizophrenia= The film strongly suggests that the main character Max Cohen is actually a paranoid schizophrenic. The soundtrack uses screeching and disturbing tones that are thematic of auditory hallucinations experienced by such patients. The character of Devi, the old man in the metro, people of large corporations stalking him, visions of a human brain infested with ants in his sink could be interpreted as visual hallucinations. He sees patterns everywhere, especially the logarithmic spiral, which can be attributed to such a phenomenon. Soundtrack Pi launched the film scoring career of Clint Mansell. The soundtrack was released on July 21, 1998, via Thrive Records. AllMusic rated it 4.5 stars out of five. A music video for \\"πr²\\", using an alternative mix of the title track, is available as a special feature on the π DVD, consisting of footage from the film intercut with stock color reels of ants, harking back to one of the film's visual motifs. ;Credits *Design – Jeremy Dawson, Sneak Attack *Executive-Producer – Eric Watson, Ricardo Vinas, Sioux Zimmerman *Mastered By – Mark Fellows *Written-By [Voiceover] – Darren Aronofsky, Sean Gullette Release Produced on a budget of $134,815 (including $60,927 for production and $68,183 for post-production), the film was financially successful at the box office, grossing $3,221,152 in the United States despite only a limited theatrical release. It has sold steadily on DVD. Pi was the first ever film to legally be made available for download on the Internet. =Critical reception= The film was well received.

It has a fern-like appearance with many thin, twisted, glossy green leaves and clusters of up to six dull white or greenish flowers with a green labellum. It grows tropical North Queensland.  Description  Podochilus australiensis is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with unbranched, slightly flattened stems long and about long wide. There are many thin, glossy, dark green leaves long and wide, giving the plant a fern- like appearance. Between two and six dull white or greenish cream-coloured flowers about long and wide are borne on short flower stems. The sepals and petals spread widely apart from each other, the dorsal sepal about long and wide, the lateral sepals slightly wider and the petals shorter and narrower. The labellum is green, about long and wide and has a deep spur at its base. Flowering occurs from March to June. Taxonomy and naming The native stream orchid was first formally described in 1886 by Frederick Manson Bailey who gave it the name Eria australiensis and published the description in Occasional Papers on the Queensland Flora. In 1907 Rudolf Schlechter changed the name to Podochilus australiensis. The specific epithet (australiensis) refers to Australia, the ending -ensis being a Latin suffix \\"denoting place\\", \\"locality\\" or \\"country\\". Distribution and habitat Podochilus australiensis grows in humid forests, often on branches over streams or on rotting logs and boulders. It is found between the McIlwraith Range and the Tully River in Queensland.  Use in horticulture  Easy to grow, but needs water all year round, high humidity, and warmth (not below 10 °C). Can be grown on a slab or in a small pot with a coarse mix. References  External links  * *A good description with an excellent photo of the flower at The Internet Orchid Species Photo Encyclopedia.

The book includes oral literature from Han Chinese and ethnic minorities.Smith, p. 118. This book is intended to be an introduction to the material and was written as a university textbook.Bäcker, p. 260. Contents Folk ballads, stories, and songs are within the book's first half. Most of these are from ethnic minority groups. 11 minority groups contributed 25 folktales, and the section also houses epic literature from different ethnic groups, as well as ritual literature from the Han and other ethnic groups. Epic stories involving the Yao people Miluotuo creation myth and epic stories from the Geser and Jangar are included. The section also houses over 70 folk songs and Han Chinese dragon tales. The volume does not discuss classification or typology of the folklore. Bäcker stated that the large number of differing ethnic groups involved and the differences in the text may make the reading difficult for those not specialists in Asia. Professional storytelling excerpts are in the book's second half. Most of these are from the Han Chinese. Many of these texts have Buddhist and Confucian values and are life stories, including tragic love stories. The second half has two stories from the Bai people. The book includes introductions for every section and introductions for every chapter. The introductions about minority literature refer to the pieces as \\"cultural documents\\". These introductions are often one to two pages long. Bäcker stated that some descriptions misleadingly make some texts appear more distinctive than they really are. Bäcker argued that there are parts of the anthology which in many cases should have additional commentary and cultural notes, and others that \\"are richly and aptly annotated\\"; he puts the folktales, such as \\"The Gingseng Tale,\\" in the former group, and the Jiangsu shan ge or wu ge folk songs in the latter group.

His daughter was the second wife of Wuyue's third king Qian Hongzuo.  Background and service under Qian Yuanguan  It is not known when Yang Renquan was born, but it is known that he was from Hu Prefecture (湖州, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). During the reign of Wuyue's second king Qian Yuanguan, he became a commander of his headquarter guards, and was said to be capable and intelligent.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 86. The first historical reference to Yang was in 933, when Qian Yuanguan was dealing with his younger brother Qian Yuanxiang (), who was then the acting prefect of Ming Prefecture (明州, in modern Ningbo, Zhejiang), and was said to be arrogant and unlawful in his actions, often making inappropriate requests to Qian Yuanguan and being cruel toward his staffers. Qian Yuanguan sent Yang to Ming to summon Qian Yuanxiang back to the capital Qiantang (錢塘, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). Yang's subordinates believed that the mission might be dangerous and that he should take military precautions, but Yang, ignoring them, wore regular clothes and headed for Ming. When Yang arrived at Ming, Qian Yuanxiang became frightened and returned to Qiantang with him without incident. Qian Yuanguan then put Qian Yuanxiang under house arrest.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. (Qian Yuanguan would eventually execute Qian Yuanxiang in 937.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. In 940, Wuyue's southern neighbor Min was in civil war, as its emperor Wang Yanxi (also known as Wang Xi) and Wang Yanxi's younger brother Wang Yanzheng the prefect of Jian Prefecture (建州, in modern Nanping, Fujian) were battling each other, and Wang Yanxi's generals Pan Shikui () and Wu Xingzhen () were putting Jian under siege. Wang Yanzheng sought aid from Qian Yuanguan. Despite advice by the chancellor Lin Ding against doing so, Qian Yuanguan launched an army commanded by Yang and Xue Wanzhong () to aid Wang Yanzheng. (At that time, Yang carried the title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui — an honorary title as Ningguo was then the territory of Wuyue's northern neighbor Wu) and chancellor (同中書門下平章事, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi).) Before they could arrive, however, Wang Yanzheng had already defeated Wang Yanxi's army himself and therefore asked the Wuyue army to withdraw, offering it gifts for doing so. Yang refused, and set up camp near Jian. Wang Yanzheng, in fear, turned to Wang Yanxi and asked him for aid. Wang Yanxi sent his nephew Wang Jiye () to aid Wang Yanzheng and also sent another army to cut off the Wuyue army's supply route. With torrential rains arriving and the food supply running low for the Wuyue army, Wang Yanzheng attacked it and defeated it, forcing Yang to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282.  Service under Qian Hongzuo  In 941, Qian Yuanguan died, and his son Qian Hongzuo succeeded him as king. It appeared that Yang Renquan continued to carry the title of military governor of Ningguo. In 943, Qian Hongzuo, whose first wife Lady Du had died,Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 83. married Yang Renquan's daughter Consort Yang as his second wife.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Yang Renquan thereafter became a chancellor, but died not long after, as did Consort Yang. (It is not known which of them died first.) (However, the chronicles of Qian Yuanguan's reign in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms also, contrary to the implications of Yang Renquan's biography in the same work, indicated that Yang Renquan died in 941 prior to Qian Yuanguan's death.)Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 79.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 11, 2014. Plot The episode opens with the Belcher children trying to give out flyers of the restaurant in front of Wonder Wharf. They see the owner and their landlord Calvin Fischoeder giving out free tickets of his own to attract customers, but to no avail. The Belcher children ditch the flyers and go inside the amusement park, where they find out that several of the rides were being replaced, specifically Tina's favorite carousel with odd-looking horses in it (such as what Tina calls \\"Mr. Goiter\\"). Meanwhile, Mr. Fischoeder's brother Felix visits Bob at the restaurant. He persuades Bob into influencing his older brother into selling the amusement park in order for them to build high-end condominiums, promising Bob that he will give him a space for his own restaurant at the venue. While Linda is enthusiastic about the idea of earning more money, Bob has doubts. He is eventually convinced and proceeds to take Mr. Fischoeder to King's Head Island while Felix shows the contractors around Wonder Wharf. Tina tries to stop the demolition of the carousel. Louise locks her to Mr. Goiter with a bike lock and makes Tina swallow the key so the demolition would halt. Back in King's Head Island, Bob successfully convinces Mr. Fischoeder to sell Wonder Wharf. When they get back to the amusement park, Calvin announces that he's selling the place. Bob's kids get mad at him, with Tina telling him that the Wonder Wharf is the heart of the town. Bob realizes his mistake, which was driven by his desire to have a bistro-style restaurant. He then convinces Mr. Fischoeder to undo his decision. After talking to him, Calvin tells his brother that he will never sell the Wharf, which infuriates Felix. The episode ends with a cliffhanger—where Felix points a gun at Calvin and Bob, intending to kill the both of them to be able to inherit and consequently sell the amusement park. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"Throughout, “Wharf Horse (Or How Bob Saves/Destroys The Town—Part I)” feels like the show taking the biggest possible swing and trying to do something it’s never done before. This really is the perfect time for that. At the end of a very successful fourth season and with its future as secure as it’s ever going to be, Bob’s Burgers is in a place where it can step outside its normal structure and experiment with a slightly more dramatic form of storytelling.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 10 out of 10, saying \\"How Bob’s Burgers achieved perfection tonight was by connecting all of its strengths to make one Voltron-like whole. All the throwaway lines from the characters were sharp and funny (Eugene, about to ride a roller coaster for the first time: “I’m going to die and I never got to see Hall & Oates!”). They weaved in musical elements in ways that never felt corny or distracting, not even Tina’s heartfelt “Goodbye, Mr. Goiter … I love you so much!” And the performances by all the voice talent were spot on, especially Jon Benjamin’s ability to convey so many different sides of Bob with the slightest inflection and Galifianakis as the mentally unhinged Felix.\\" The episode received a 0.9 rating and was watched by a total of 1.97 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 4.16 million.

Early life and education Born George Rybnicek in Brno, Czechoslovakia in 1925, Brooks immigrated with his mother and sisters to Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. The text of the essay is reproduced on Brook's official website: His father was already living and working in Montreal as a tailor. After studying electrical engineering in college, Brooks chose to focus on visual arts. He attended the École des beaux-arts de Montréal, where he studied sculpture and metalsmithing, and served apprenticeships with local jewelers before opening his own shop. Career Silver brooch (1950). Forged from a single sheet. Gold & silver bracelet (1960). With turquoisesGold & silver pendant (1967). With diamond & pearl. White gold pendant (1967). With diamond & pearl. Brooks's first apprenticeship was as a goldsmith with Henry Birks and Sons in 1948. He also set up a workshop at home where he could produce his own unique designs, markedly different to the conventional jewelry produced by Birks & Sons. In 1950, he transferred his apprenticeship to Georges Delrue, a French avant-garde jeweler based in Montreal since 1947. Delrue's work was influenced by European modernism, such as the work of Jean Arp, Joan Miró, and Jacques Lipchitz, and his workshop was the first modernist jewelry workshop in Canada. Brooks worked with Delrue for seven years, where he learned from craftspeople such as the silversmith Hans Gehrig (1929-1989). Gehrig and Brooks went on to found the Montreal Gem and Mineral Club in 1957. That same year, Brooks opened his first shop, which he sold in 1961. Brooks and his wife Jean then travelled, visiting gem sources around the world, including mining for opals, in Andamooka, South Australia. Brooks became a recognised authority on opals, amassing one of the world's largest collections of this gemstone. In 1962 Brooks relocated to Santa Barbara, California, where he continued working and producing unique, one-of-a-kind pieces of jewelry until his retirement in 1991. Exhibitions and Legacy Yvonne J. Markowitz, Curator of Jewelry at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, co-wrote an essay on Brooks for a book on his work published in 2010, in which she argued that Brooks's work had been largely overlooked due to \\"an accident of geography.\\" In 1962, Santa Barbara was a small town which, although wealthy enough to enable Brooks to succeed enough that he had no need to publicise his work more widely, did not have the community to support modernist jewelers that existed elsewhere, such as San Francisco or Provincetown, Massachusetts. She also noted that the \\"pioneering modernists\\" in Canadian jewelry design had worked in relative isolation, with few links to the American or European studio jewelry movement. In 2009, the Musée des maîtres et artisans du Québec held an exhibition on modernist art jewelry in Québec between 1950 and 1970, which showcased the work of Brooks alongside that of Delrue, Gehrig, and other Canadian jewelers. Jewelry by Brooks is represented in the collections of several museums and institutions, including the Renwick Gallery, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Providing a center of worship for both Japanese- and English-language congregations the church traces its foundation to 1863, shortly after the formal opening of the treaty port of Yokohama. The church building has been rebuilt and refurbished on several occasions as a result of fires, earthquakes and the incendiary bombing experienced during the later stages of the Second World War. Christ Church has been located on its current site in Yamate since 1901 and is part of the Yokohama Diocese of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai, the Anglican Church in Japan. History Christ Church, with its prominent position overlooking the location of the former Kannai foreign settlement, was the replacement for the original Yokohama garrison church. The garrison church, also called Christ Church, was built on lot 105 in Yamashita-cho, and frequented by members of the British military garrison, the British legation as well as American Episcopalians. After the opening of the treaty port in 1859, Anglicans in the foreign community gathered for worship services in the British Consul's residence and later in the courtroom of the British Consulate. The first Consular Chaplain, the Rev. Michael Buckworth Bailey arrived in Yokohama in August 1862. After a successful fundraising campaign church services were first held at Christ Church's new building on 18 October 1863. The church survived the great fire that destroyed much of the foreign settlement on 26 November 1866. Bailey retired on April 1, 1873, and was replaced by Acting Consular Chaplain, Revd. Edward W. Syle (17 February 1817 - 5 October 1890). Syle was born in Barnstaple, England, but after emigration to the United States as a young man graduated from Kenyon College, Ohio, and the Virginia Theological Seminary. The departure of Bailey and the British military garrison marked a change in the finances of Christ Church, Yokohama; the British Government withdrawing its annual consular stipend of 400 pounds per annum at the end of 1875. A second, much larger, church building, constructed at the current location overlooking the foreign settlement in red, Glasgow brick, was designed by British architect Josiah Conder and dedicated on Trinity Sunday, 2 June 1901. This second church structure, and much of the city, was destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake on 1 September 1923. Between 1923 and 1930, a wooden church structure shipped from the United States, served as temporary sanctuary for the church congregation. The current, third, church building designed by American architect Jay Hill Morgan dates from 1931. Extensively damaged by incendiary bombing on 29 May 1945, and again by a fire in January 2005, the interior has been refurbished on several occasions. The exterior Ōya Stone cladding and tower are true to the original 1930s design.

In December 1778, General George Washington's chief of intelligence and Culper Ring spymaster, Major Benjamin Tallmadge recruited Hawkins to bring messages from the Ring's chief spy in New York City, Abraham Woodhull, to Setuaket, New York where they would be forwarded to Tallmadge. Woodhull used the code name \\"Samuel Culper\\", later \\"Samuel Culper, Sr.\\" to avoid detection if his letters were intercepted.Rose, 2007, p. 75. Tallmadge was referred to by the alias \\"John Bolton.\\" Woodhull made trips into New York, ostensibly to visit his sister, Mary Underhill, who operated a boarding house with her husband Amos Underhill.Rose, 2007, pp. 88, 90. Woodhull continued his visits to New York into the summer of 1779, although he became increasingly anxious that his continuing visits to New York City might lead to his discovery as time passed.Rose, 2007, p. 101. At first, Woodhull had to return to Setauket to pass messages to Caleb Brewster, a Continental Army officer who spent most of his time operating whaleboats on Long Island Sound for secret military purposes, to take to Tallmadge or to receive messages from Tallmdadge via Brewster. By December 1778, Tallmadge set up couriers, at first Jonas Hawkins, then in the early summer mainly Austin Roe, who would take messages the between New York and Setauket to pass them to Brewster.Rose, 2007, p. 102. Hawkins's task was to get the letters to Brewster who would pick up messages at Setauket and take them across the Sound to Tallmadge at Fairfield, Connecticut. Tallmadge would then forward the messages to Washington.Nelson, David Paul. Culper Ring in Hastedt, Glenn, P., ed. Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: A-J. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. . p. 217. In June 1779, Woodhull engaged Robert Townsend, who used the alias \\"Samuel Culper, Jr.\\" to gather intelligence in New York City.Rose, 2007, p. 132. Since Townsend was engaged in business there, his presence was expected to arouse less suspicion than Woodhull's visits would. He also had access to British officers through the authorship of a society column in a Loyalist newspaper and his tailoring business, as well as his interest in a coffeehouse with Loyalist newspaper owner James Rivington, who also was a secret member of the Ring.Nelson, David Paul. Robert Townsend in Hastedt, Glenn, P., ed. Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: A-J. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. . p. 763.Rose, 2007, pp. 150-154. After Townsend began his intelligence activities in New York City, Woodhull operated almost exclusively from Setauket. A revised communications network was then established in which Townsend would pass intelligence to a courier, at first Hawkins, then Hawkins and Roe, and after September 1779, exclusively Roe, who would take it to Setauket and pass it to Woodhull, usually via dead drop. Woodhull would evaluate and comment on it and pass it to Brewster, who would take it across Long Island Sound, occasionally adding an intelligence note of his own, and pass it to Tallmadge.Rose, 2007, p. 103. Tallmadge would usually add a cover letter with comments. According to widely accepted local and family tradition, Anna Strong signalled Brewster, who ran frequent trips with his whaleboats across the Sound on smuggling and military missions, that a message was ready. She hung a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which was easily visible by Brewster from a boat in the Sound and by Woodhull from his nearby farm after he began to operate from Setauket.Baker, Mark Allen.

Historian Richard Welch writes that the tradition of the clothesline signal is unverifiable but it is known that the British had a woman at Setauket who fits Anna's profile under suspicion for disloyal activities.Welch, Richard F. General Washington's Commando: Benjamin Tallmadge in the Revolutionary War. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, Inc., 2014. . p. 37. Tallmadge found that personally taking the message to Washington was too time-consuming. So he sent messages after the first one to Washington by a dragoon, then by a relay of dragoons, acting as couriers. Hawkins at first was bold but became increasingly anxious about British patrols. His role was reduced between April 1779 when Woodhull identified both Hawkins and Roe as couriers for the Ring and July 1779 when Tallmadge gave Roe, but not Hawkins, a code number in his code directory.Rose, 2007, p. 172. Woodhull wrote in a coded message on August 15, 1779, that Hawkins had to destroy a letter from Culper, Jr., or be captured.Kilmeade says that Hawkins destroyed Culper letters on two occasions for fear of being caught. Kilmeade, Brian and Don Yaeger. George Washington's Secret Six: The Spy Ring That Save the American Revolution. New York: Penguin Group, 2013. . p. 100. In his August 15 message, Woodhull wrote that Hawkins insisted that his next meeting with Townsend be in an out of the way location. Townsend did not like taking the additional risk and was beginning to doubt Hawkins's reliability and to regret the destroyed messages. Finally in September 1779, with Hawkins increasingly anxious, and more importantly, with Townsend refusing to deal with him any longer, Hawkins stopped his courier services for the Ring. Woodhull acted as courier on September 11 so he could explain to Townsend the loss of the earlier letters.Kilmeade, 2013, P. 100. Austin Roe then became the sole permanent courier for the Ring.

The model prescribes the creation of independent and financially self-sufficient non-profit entities for energy sustainability through conservation, efficiency, and end- user based decentralized renewable energy in an effort to address concerns about climate change, rising energy prices, inequity of energy availability, and a lack of community governance of energy development. The SEU model was developed by Dr. J. Byrne at the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy, University of Delaware. The Foundation for Renewable Energy and Environment (FREE) is implementing versions of the model. In the U.S., the SEU model was first implemented by the State of Delaware, followed by the District of Columbia, Sonoma County in California, the California Statewide Communities Development Authority (CSCDA), and the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program. which is a partnership initiative between Pennsylvania Treasury and FREE. The SEU model is recognized by the U.S. White House, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Energy Agency as a viable platform to spur sustainable energy investment while driving local economic development. History of the SEU Model The SEU model was a result of efforts by Dr. J. Byrne to realize a model of energy-environment-society relations which could reflect Amory Lovins’ promise of the negawatt and the philosophical tenets of Amulya K. N. Reddy’s DEFENDUS. While working as an author with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Byrne was influenced by the philosophical framework of the discourse on political ecology and environmental justice. He and his team worked on calculating the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which eliminate climate change, leading to an energy- sustainable future. Their study concluded that a target of 3.3 tons of emissions per capita per year would be sustainable emissions. In response to this finding, Byrne’s team worked on designing an energy system model that would use a commonwealth economy and community trusts to achieve this goal; the result was the SEU. Principles =Paradigm shift= The SEU aims to achieve a four-fold paradigm shift: * shifting from carbon intensive energy sources to carbon free energy sources, * from viewing energy as a commodity to viewing energy as a service provision, * from supply oriented energy architecture to demand oriented energy architecture, and * from a centralized energy system to a more distributed energy infrastructure. To achieve this paradigm shift, the model is guided by three main principles: establishing civil society based energy governance, increasing reliance on savings and environmental benefits of SEU investments to build out a sustainable energy future, and continued evaluation of performance determined by environmental factors, affordability, and local economic impact. =Departure from traditional utilities= An SEU departs from the traditional model of energy supply and expansion, as well as the traditional efficiency models for power plants and utilities. An SEU is focused on permanently lowering overall energy use and limiting supply to renewable energy sources. Rather than slowing the rate of energy market expansion or improving the efficiency of energy services, the SEU cuts energy requirements based on sustainability defined constraints; notably, the need to adhere to an annual 3.3 ton per capita emission budget for greenhouse gases released, expressed in a CO2 equivalent. =Community utility= An SEU functions as a 'community utility' directly accountable to the local community it serves as it seeks to deliver sustainable energy services. SEUs do not report to stockholders or utility regulators. SEUs can be organized by communities of almost any scale (towns, cities, or regions) seeking to gain independence and agency in their energy development pathway. As a community utility, the success of the SEU rests on the participation of local stakeholders, namely individuals, businesses, farms, localities, etc., and is directly answerable to these entities. The SEU itself remains independent. Sustainable Energy Bond (SEB) Program =Concept= The Sustainable Energy Bond (SEB) Program was pioneered by Dr. Byrne to build a clean energy infrastructure from guaranteed savings earned by participants. The SEU uses bonds at a scale which allows a city or a region to treat conserved and renewable energy as primary sources rather than the current situation in which fossil and nuclear energy sources dominate. Historically, tax-exempt bonds were used to underwrite investments in public goods and services and, for this reason, SEBs are seen as a critical tool for SEUs to serve their communities. An SEU can be given bond issuing capacity which allows it to sell tax-exempt bonds in order to treat sustainable energy as an infrastructure scale investment. =First implementation= In 2011, the Delaware SEU issued a statewide tax exempt bond for SEUs, the first of its kind in the U.S., acquiring $72.5 million for capital investments in sustainable energy measures. Targeting about 4% of Delaware's total state owned or managed building stock, the SEU bond issue included contractual guarantees of $148 million in savings which cut energy use in participating buildings by more than 25% for 20 years. The 2011 bond issue average payback period was almost 14 years and the longest maturity was 20 years, while average performance guarantees were greater than 20 years. Challenges SEUs present a different paradigm in energy governance, and they can present unique challenges. One of the greatest challenges SEUs face is empowering communities to break away from the existing paradigm of top-down energy supply. Sometimes local initiatives have wide support at the outset, but as time passes, active participation is limited to a smaller core group. Adding to this situation is the problem of limited resources at the local level, making it challenging for the SEU movement to institutionalize and maintain momentum. Another area of concern is solvency: financial sustainability of the initiative is vital to its long term success, and the appropriation and allocation of funding can determine the longevity of the SEU itself. Depending on its organizational structure and funding source, the SEU can encounter problems when some of its dedicated funds are re-allocated to fill general obligation gaps in, for instance, the state budget. An example of a sustainable energy focused organization encountering such a difficulty is the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, a third-party demand side management administrator operating in New Jersey. Sustaining a long-term program that seeks to implement transformative change further can encounter difficulties when operated in parallel with shorter-term projects. For example, shorter-term projects can capitalize on \\"low-hanging fruit\\" with quick returns, limiting funding allocation to multi- year projects. Support from local government and the possibility of collaborating with other available government programs can substantially increase success. Practical operation of SEU models encountered some of these challenges. For instance, in 2016, after an investigation into one of the Delaware SEU projects, the Delaware State Auditor issued a report indicating several problems with the Delaware SEU 2011 bond program.https://auditor.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2017/01/SEU- Inspection-Report.pdf A former Delaware State Senator published an opinion piece on Delaware Online in support of the State Auditor report.https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/15/misconceptions- sustainable-energy-utility-plan/85937410/ A presiding Senator, a member of the Delaware SEU's oversight board, disagreed with the findings of the Auditor, calling them \\"mystifying\\". Delaware SEU Executive Director defended the program by arguing that the State Auditor did not counsel with experts in the field of energy engineering and, as such, misrepresented the actual workings of the program. The Delaware Office of Management and Budget similarly questioned the validity of the Auditor's report. In 2018, the Delaware SEU was named Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2018 Energy STAR Partner of the Year and received the EPA Energy STAR Excellence Award. The Delaware SEU has Standards for Excellence accreditation by the Standards for Excellence Institute for its ethics, accountability, and transparency. Early evaluation of the 2011 bond program shows first-year savings exceeded the 25% savings guarantee by 3%.Chu, Bruner, & Byrne (2015). DESEU Energy Efficiency Revenue Bonds Series 2011. Project Savings Analysis. Document available at: https://evogov.s3.amazonaws.com/media/50/media/17699.pdf The Delaware SEU is registered as a non-profit, tax-exempt 501 (c)(3) entity. The Delaware SEU is operating and planning new rounds of the bond program.  Diffusion of the Model  SEUs currently in practice in the U.S. are the Delaware SEU., the Washington D.C. SEU, the SCEF Program by the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) in California, California’s Sustainable Energy Bond Program by CSCDA and FREE and the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance program (PennSEF) by the Pennsylvania Treasury and FREE. International application of the SEU model is being investigated by the City of Seoul (South Korea) and the City of Thane (India). Development of the Delaware SEU began in 2006. The Delaware General Assembly convened a bipartisan task force to research and recommend a course for sustainable energy in Delaware. The 2007 report published by the task force (\\"The Sustainable Energy Utility: a Delaware First\\") introduced the SEU as an approach that would move away from utility administered efficiency and renewables to an independent management system. Passage of the State Senate Bill 18 in 2007 created the Delaware SEU. In 2007, the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy (University of Delaware) contributed to the design of the DC SEU by providing \\"technical support in analyzing options for effectively administering and implementing energy efficiency/conservation programs in the District of Columbia\\" and publishing a report detailing the findings (see end of report for contract details) The Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (D.C. Code §8-1773.01 et seq.) created the DC SEU as a private entity tasked to \\"administer sustainable energy programs in the District, including the development, coordination, and provision of programs for the purpose of promoting the sustainable use of energy in the District\\". The DC SEU management contract was awarded by the DC Council to Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC) in March 2011.https://www.energy.gov/savings/sustainable- energy-trust-fundhttp://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/108 In 2012, the Sonoma County Water Agency launched the Sonoma County Efficiency Financing (SCEF) program following the SEU model. The SCEF program offered participating organizations a contractual dollar savings guarantee. The SCEF program intends to use tax-exempt bonds to finance the projects. In 2013, no- cost preliminary audits were conducted for nine organizations that expressed interest. To date, no efficiency retrofit project contracts have been executed under this program. Applied Solutions, a partner organization of the program, notes that this is due \\"to participants' hesitancy to move forward based on unfamiliarity with the program approach and competing funding mechanisms that offer grant (not just loan) funding such as Proposition 39 - the California Clean Energy Jobs Act.\\" In 2014, the California Statewide Communities Development Authority (CSCDA) and FREE partnered together to provide public agencies throughout California with access to tax exempt financing for sustainable energy investments.CSCDA, 2014. Brochure by CSCDA outlining the planned program. Document available at:http://cscda.org/other/Documents/2014_SEBP_brochure.aspx The project was recommended to the members of the California League of Cities and the California State Association of Counties. Created in 2014, the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance Program (PennSEF) is a partnership between the Pennsylvania Treasury Department and FREE with financial start-up support from the West Penn Power Sustainable Energy Fund. In 2017, PennSEF organized its first financing pool, called the Regional Streetlight Procurement Project (RSLPP) and brought to PennSEF by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC), the pool brings together 35 municipalities around the city of Philadelphia in order to replace and retrofit 28,000 exterior lights, street lights, and traffic signals. The project guarantees gross energy savings of $30.6 million and, after deduction of all costs, deliver $15.6 million in net savings. The mayor of the Seoul, South Korea, Park Won-soon, launched a citizens’ campaign in April 2012 to reduce city greenhouse emissions 25% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. The city has embarked on a One Less Nuclear Power Plant (OLNPP) strategy to realize these goals. The city cut its emissions by 11.9% in two years, and was designated as the Global Earth Hour Capital 2015. The Seoul Metropolitan Government signed a memorandum of understanding with FREE on June 16, 2015, where both parties pledged to cooperate to design climate-sensitive, sustainable, and equitable energy policies for Seoul using the SEU model. Following the advice of a Seoul International Energy Advisory Committee (SIEAC), Seoul established a Seoul Energy Corporation in December 2016.

The pilot follows AJ, whose new job during the summer drives him crazy with power. It is loosely based on Jones' 2006 film, AJ Goes to France. Both the film and the pilot star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character. Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. The pilot was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014. Plot Summer vacation starts for AJ and his friends Danny and Morgan, who live in the city of Downer. When AJ wants to be spontaneous for his plans to spend the vacation, he impulsively decides to get a job. The trio comes across a corporate office. AJ wants to apply for the corporation that owns it, but Danny and Morgan suggest that he prepares for the interview. AJ turns to his father, Peter, for advice. He equips AJ with an oversized business suit, and afterward the trio enter the office to help AJ apply. AJ shows his resume, and immediately he is hired by the Instructor of First Impressions. Workers of the office welcome AJ, who wears the same style of business suit as they do. When he sees that each worker has their own assistant, AJ hires Morgan as his \\"secretary\\" and tells her to fetch papers. Meanwhile, he asks \\"towel boy\\" Danny to wipe the sweat off his brow. After this demonstration of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank with a private office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats to the top of the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer. Production AJ's Infinite Summer was created by Toby Jones. Produced by Nate Funaro at Cartoon Network Studios, the pilot had Robert Alvarez as timing director, Sue Mondt as art director, and Phil Rynda as creative director. AJ Thompson provided the voice for the eponymous character, Wallace Langham for Danny, Mae Whitman for Morgan, Chris Parnell for Peter, and David Hill for various characters. Secret Cities provided the score of the pilot. Members of the band are friends of Jones from his hometown of Fargo. Jones had previously codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live- action independent film that also has Thompson as the leading actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, as well as the comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot. Jones moved to Los Angeles in 2011 to work for Cartoon Network. He has written and storyboarded for Regular Show, another production on the network. His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want. Initially unsure if he was ready to pitch AJ's Infinite Summer, the network rejected the pilot the first time he did but approved it on the second, after he had reworked it throughout a few months. Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this. Release and reception AJ's Infinite Summer was released without announcement on May 16, 2014, on the official website of Cartoon Network. Long Live the Royals, another pilot, was released on the same day. This pilot was created by Sean Szeles, who has also worked on Regular Show. Jason Krell of io9 found that the plot for AJ's Infinite Summer was simple yet flexible. He described its take on life during summer vacation as \\"charming\\" and comparable with an \\"aged-up Phineas and Ferb\\". He said that he was amazed by both and that his viewership will be granted for both, should they be picked up as full series. John Lamb of The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead recognized features of Fargo in the pilot, namely the high school, which he found analogous to Fargo South where Jones attended. Meanwhile, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew expected that the pilot would not have continuity from AJ Goes to France. After the pilot was released, Jones found that people back in Fargo were amused to spot the differences in landmarks between their city and Downer. Jones told Lamb that since he worked in animation, he has been \\"surrounded by these people that I've looked up to for years as a fan, and having them tell me they enjoyed it is the greatest thing ever\\". , Jones is still mainly working on Regular Show but said that he would like it very much to have the network commission it as a series. He expressed interest in submitting it at the Fargo Film Festival. The pilot was listed in the ballot for \\"Outstanding Short-Format Animated Program\\" at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, although it did not win. The Long Live the Royals pilot did win in this category, however, and the network later commissioned it as a miniseries of the same name.

He was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, the de facto embassy of the Philippines in Taiwan, by President Rodrigo Duterte on June 30, 2016. Formerly the Postmaster General under Cory Aquino and then head of the Philippine Tourism Authority during the Joseph Estrada administration, he later became administrator of the National Food Authority under Secretary of Agriculture Proceso Alcala during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III. He resigned from the latter post in September 2012 to run for the House of Representatives, but then withdrew from the race in December of that same year. Personal life Banayo grew up in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte where his family had moved in the 1960s. He studied economics at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila, and then went on to the Ateneo Graduate School of Business and the University of the Philippines College of Public Administration. As Postmaster General In the aftermath of the February 1986 People Power Revolution which ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, incoming president Cory Aquino appointed Banayo as Postmaster General, succeeding Roilo Golez who had resigned to run for the Senate in the 1987 elections. As Postmaster General, Banayo instituted reforms aimed at reducing employee pilferage, in particular installing one-way mirrors at the Manila International Airport Airmail Distribution Center. He resisted calls to conduct a purge of Marcos-era employees, though he did aim to make executive cuts while expanding the number of mail carriers, mail sorters, and other base-level employees. He also investigated corruption and malfeasance as part of a \\"big cleanup\\", in some cases finding that allegations of corruption against certain people were in fact false rumors spread by political opponents, while in other cases finding genuine wrongdoing such as a mail- pilfering syndicate operating in the Ilocos and Cagayan Valley regions. Banayo was also responsible for the push to establish the Philippine Postal Corporation, a government-owned company, to replace the old Bureau of Posts. However, his predecessor Golez' Senate campaign was unsuccessful, and in July 1987 Golez was appointed back to Banayo's post. Late 1990s and 2000s During the Joseph Estrada administration, Banayo served as a presidential political advisor, as well as general manager of the Philippine Tourism Authority. In 2004, Banayo went on to become a columnist for the daily newspaper Malaya, a post which he held until 2010. He spoke out against murder allegations leveled at Senator Panfilo Lacson in 2010, after Lacson had fled the country for Hong Kong. Administrator of the National Food Authority Banayo was appointed to head the National Food Authority by President Benigno Aquino III, amidst accusations of over-importation by outgoing president Gloria Arroyo's administration. In response to President Aquino's complaints of rice stocks \\"rotting in government warehouses\\", he appointed a private- sector auditor to investigate the NFA's rice procurement and importation system. Banayo also called on the National Bureau of Investigation to help combat rice smuggling. By January 2011, Banayo had produced a report with his findings, alleging overpricing of rice imports during the Arroyo administration, which he submitted to Aquino for further investigation; Arroyo-era agricultural officials including Arthur Yap disputed Banayo's price data. During the rest of his tenure, Banayo aimed to decrease the agency's role in rice importation, stating that the private sector should take the lead in this regard, and instead focus on local procurement; he would later warn of the financial dangers of the NFA \\"monopoly\\" on imports. In 2014, the National Bureau of Investigation filed graft charges before the Ombudsman against Banayo and five others in connection with the alleged irregular rice importation program of the agency during his Tenure House of Representatives campaign In September 2012, Banayo resigned from his NFA post to prepare to contest the May 2013 House of Representatives mid-term elections in Agusan del Norte. Orlan Calayag was appointed to succeed him in January 2013. In December 2012, 4 SM Agri Venture Multi-Purpose Cooperative head Simeon Sioson claimed in testimony before the Senate that Banayo and Nixon Kua had been involved in rice smuggling. At the time, Banayo had just undergone heart surgery, and did not appear at a Senate Agriculture and Food Committee hearing about the smuggling allegations; chairman Francis Pangilinan stated in media comments that the committee would schedule another hearing. He withdrew from the race at the end of his month, citing health reasons. Fellow party members denied reports that his withdrawal was related to unpopularity or the rice smuggling inquiry against him. In February 2013, the Senate committee recommended that Banayo and Gilbert Lauengco of the NFA's special bids and awards committee be charged under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019). Their findings were later referred to the Ombudsman of the Philippines, which by March 2014 had declined to pursue the matter further. References External links *So I See ...

Starting with the nineteenth century, when Sanskrit was first taught at the University of Pennsylvania, the Libraries have collected material for the study of South Asia. Bibliographers The first bibliographer dedicated to South Asia Studies in the library was Kanta Bhatia.Bhatia, Kanta. A Journey Alone Raleigh, N.C. : Lulu Books, 2012. She retired in 1994, and was replaced by Dr. David Nelson. From 2011 onwards, Dr. Pushkar Sohoni served as the bibliographer and librarian, while teaching in the Department of South Asia Studies. In 2016, he left to teach at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. History of the South Asia Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries Prof. Morton W. Easton, Professor of Comparative Philology (1883–1912), taught Sanskrit courses at the University of Pennsylvania. He had studied Sanskrit at Yale under W.D. Whitney (1827–1894). Upon completing his dissertation on the evolution of language, Easton was awarded the first American doctorate in Sanskrit in 1872. The University of Pennsylvania was one of the first American academic institutions to offer courses in Sanskrit; already during the 1880s, the university offered a major and a minor in Sanskrit. Easton retired in 1912 and was replaced the following year by Franklin Edgerton. After Edgerton left in 1926, W. Norman Brown was appointed in his place. Brown was responsible for the creation of the Department of South Asia Studies and expanded well beyond his own Indological interests. From 1916 to 1919, Brown had held the position of the Harrison Research Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. He organized the American Oriental Society in 1926. By the summer of 1947 Brown's summer program, \\"India: A Program of Regional Studies\\" was being offered at Penn. In 1948, he established the Department of South Asia Regional Studies, the first area studies department in North America. Offerings continued to be expanded until a full program was available in the 1949-1950 academic year. He brought together a number of eminent scholars such as Holden Furber, Stella Kramrisch, and Ernest Bender, ensuring that the Department of South Asia Studies at Penn became, and continues as, one of the most important places in the world for serious research on South Asia in general and Sanskrit in particular. Scholars such as George Cardona, Ludo Rocher, Rosane Rocher, and Richard D. Lambert worked at Penn throughout their careers, and ensured a rich collection was developed for the libraries. W. Norman Brown was also responsible for helping to establish the well known PL 480 program which in its various permutations over the decades supplied us (and many other institutions) with literally hundreds of thousands of volumes from South Asia. During the course of the PL 480 program from 1954 to 1998, the library acquired material actively through the Library of Congress field offices (New Delhi and Islamabad), and also through various vendors in South Asia, Europe and North America. Since 2013, the South Asia Librarian also manages acquisitions from the Library of Congress Field Office in Jakarta. The Library of Congress still continues as a major vendor to supplement the activities of collecting all material including monographs, serials, film, and digital formats. Because of the history of the University of Pennsylvania Museum in the field of archaeology, the Penn Libraries also have one of the largest collection of material for archaeology in South Asia. The American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS) was founded by W. Norman Brown, and it operated out of the Van Pelt Library till it moved to its present location in Chicago. Since 1958, the University of Pennsylvania has had a Title VI National Resource Center for South Asia (South Asia Center). In 1992, the Center for Advanced Study of India (CASI) was launched. The two centers and the Department of South Asia Studies are supplemented by faculty with interests in South Asia, in various departments and schools across campus such as Anthropology, Architecture, Comparative Literature, Economics, Education, English, History, History of Art, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Scope of Collection =Geographical coverage= The primary geographical coverage is South Asia which includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka with some coverage of Tibet. Materials are also acquired which cover the diasporic community of South Asians in the U.S., UK, and elsewhere in the world outside of South Asia proper. Countries in South-East Asia and Inner Asia, such as Burma and Thailand, or Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, are covered selectively, only as they relate to inter-regional research interests. =Subject coverage= The primary focus is on the humanities and the social sciences with particular strength in the areas of anthropology, archaeology, art history, classical Indology, linguistics, literature, religion, philosophy and political science. There are no chronological limits to the collection, which covers material from the prehistoric period to the present. The Libraries acquire current publications in the disciplines mentioned above as well as actively seek to collect retrospectively in areas of research interests. =Languages= The languages covered by the South Asia Collections include Sanskrit (Vedic and Classical), Prakrit, Pali, Hindi and Urdu, and has large holdings, with an emphasis on belles-lettres, folklore, history, and linguistics, in Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Mongolian, Nepali, Punjabi, Persian, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Sinhalese, Tamil, and Telugu. The Penn Libraries also acquire publications in several of the lesser-known languages of the Subcontinent such as Baluchi, Brahui, Meitei, Newari, Pushto, and various tribal languages and dialects. The Libraries do not actively collect in Assamese and Oriya. The Libraries also acquire materials pertaining to the study of South Asia in English, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and Russian. Special Collections These are materials acquired by various departments of the Penn Libraries that are housed in the Kislak Special Collections Center because of their unique, rare, or fragile nature. The number of items from or about South Asia in the Kislak Special Collections Center is difficult to estimate, as it comprises ephemeral materials, manuscripts, and rare or special books; the varied formats and contents do not easily lead to quantification, and many of them do not have call numbers. Some of the significant South Asia-related collections within the purview of the Kislak Special Collections Center are mentioned. =Indic Manuscripts= The Indic manuscripts collection (Ms. Coll. 390, and Ms. Coll Indic 1 to 17) is the largest in North America, and one of the largest in the western hemisphere. Over 90% of these manuscripts are in Sanskrit. Scholarship about the collection itself has been substantial, not to mention the texts and illustrations within the actual manuscripts, which have been used by scholars. The history of the manuscripts has been narrated in many of these publications, and can be summarized thus: \\"Some of the manuscripts had been acquired in chance fashion by the Library and the University Museum before 1930, but in that year, at the request of Professor W. Norman Brown (1892-1975), Provost Josiah Penniman provided a sum of money to purchase Indic manuscripts. Shortly thereafter he obtained a donation from the late Mr. John Gribbel. Substantial contributions from Dr. Charles W. Burr, the Faculty Research Fund, and the Cotton Fund soon followed. The bulk of the manuscripts are the result of purchases made using these funds in India, between 1930 and 1935, under the direction of Professor W. Norman Brown.\\" The manuscripts are regularly used in classes, and together with other manuscript and paper holdings of the University Museum and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, constitute an important corpus of texts in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other languages of South and South-East Asia. The manuscripts are currently undergoing enhanced cataloging and being digitized to be made available online. The project is being added to the digital library at Penn through the portal Penn in Hand . As of November 2014, almost half the collection, that is 1,424 manuscripts had been fully cataloged, and 216 of those had facsimiles available online. Under a renewed NEH grant, the project continues. =George Macartney Papers and colonial material= The Penn Libraries possesses an important collection of manuscripts and documents relating to the British East India Company and governance in South Asia, most notably the Macartney Papers, comprising letters and documents that belonged to Lord George Macartney during his time as the Governor of Madras (1780-1786).Furber, Holden. \\"A Preliminary Report on the Macartney Manuscripts\\" in University of Pennsylvania Library Chronicle vol. 21 no. 2 (1955), pp. 43-50 The Libraries also holds a series of manuscripts on 18th- and 19th-century East India politics collected by the historian Holden Furber (Professor, South Asia Studies, 1948 -1973). The manuscript collections for South Asia are enriched by additional travel narratives, ships’ logs, letters, and material on the military history of the East India Company, including the sieges of Seringapatnam and Bharatpur. There are also several other colonial items such as a letter from Wajid Ali Shah’s secretary to the East India Company, early diaries of English officials and their wives in British India, and a series of 19th- and 20th-century photograph albums of Indian landscapes and city life, as well as rare prints and drawings of Indian scenes, buildings, and everyday life offers scholars from diverse disciplines a unique perspective into South Asia. The voluminous private papers of Kanji Dwarkadass, an important labor organizer and political leader, are also in the Kislak Special Collections Center, and will soon be cataloged. There are several dozen photographic albums from the years between the wars that have just been cataloged and all of them now have finding aids. =Miscellaneous Material= In addition to well-defined collections, the Kislak Special Collections Center also has eclectic material from South Asia, such as some of the early lithographed and printed books in various scripts, early bibles in multiple languages, and postcard sets published by the Archaeological Survey of India. Amar Chitra Katha comic books are also housed in Special Collections. There is also a valuable collection of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Judaica from India, some of which is housed in the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies of the University of Pennsylvania. These materials include books in English, Hebrew, Judaeo-Arabic, and Marathi, and represent the Baghdadi, Bene-Israel and Cochin Jewish communities of India. Electronic Resources =Databases= In the past decade, the number of databases purchased by the Penn Libraries has increased as more archives and products become available. Journals are the other area where electronic formats are convenient and easy to use. Several journals which were offered online and in print are now purchased only in electronic form. The purchased or subscribed databases pertinent to South Asia alone are: * Empire Online * Foreign Office Files: India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan * The Times of India (1838-2005) * History of Afghanistan Online * India from Crown Rule to Republic, 1945-1949: Records of the U.S. State Department * CMIE States of India * India Stat * India Raj and Empire These are in addition to the common platforms such as JStor or EBSCOHost, which provide access to many of the common English-language journals and serials, such as South Asian Studies, Modern Asian Studies, or Economic and Political Weekly. In November 2010, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries joined Hathi Trust, and approximately 2 million downloadable books in the public domain have been made available through the Penn Libraries since November 2014. =Newspapers= Daily newspapers used to be received in the South Asia Reading Room from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but are now are mostly available online. For some historic newspaper collections, the World Newspaper Archive provides access: Ceylon Observer (1864-1922), Indian People (1903-1909), Kaysar-i Hind (1886-1890), Leader (1909-1922), Madras Mail (1868-1889), Pioneer (1865-1903), Tribune (1881-1922). The Proquest Historical Newspapers platform provides access to The Times of India (1838-2002). Microform A very important, but often underutilized, source of information for South Asia is the microform collection which is located on the first floor in the Van Pelt Library. The formats are microfilm and microfiche. These sets are important because they represent important primary sources in the study of South Asia. Materials in microformats can be saved as PDFs or printed. Some of the highlights of the South Asia collections in these formats are listed below. This list is by no means exhaustive, but a quick sampling of the kinds of contents that are located in the microformat area. A detailed list of microform materials is to be found in the research guide Major Microform Sets in the Penn Library under the sub-heading of South Asian Studies. These are but a few of the thousands of titles available in our microformat collections, and till these resources are reprinted or republished online, this format remains unique and valuable. =Biographies= For biographical materials, there is the very large set, the Indian Biographical Archives (Microfiche 1062). This collection is a single alphabetic cumulation of approximately 170 sources published from the mid-19th to the late 20th century. These sources, gathered from around the world, provide biographies on approximately 100,000 individuals. Geographically, it covers the whole of undivided India as it was in the pre-colonial and colonial period, thereby including the countries now known as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It covers the period from early times to the late 20th century, and includes the lives of sages, early rulers, missionaries, civil servants from all the colonial nations, lives of nationalists and freedom fighters, and many others. Biographies of individuals from other nations, such as British, French, and Portuguese individuals, whose lives were bound up in some way with the subcontinent, are also included. =Administrative Documents= There are several important sets in microprint, the British Parliamentary Papers (1713-1913) (Microfiche 110) [For details, see research guide for British Parliamentary sources and Government Documents], and the Early American Imprints (Microfiche 821 and Microprint 21). This later publication contains many interesting accounts of the early American interactions with India and South Asia. =Census Data= For critical historical statistical data, the census materials are important. The Indian Census sets from 1872-1951 (Microfiche 15). =Missionary Records= The records of Christian missionaries in South Asia, and their engagement with education and healthcare, can be accessed through microform sets from the Church Missionary Society (Microfilm 4469) and other similar missions. =Manuscripts= The important Sanskrit manuscript collection, The University of Pennsylvania Indic Manuscripts (Ms. Coll. 390), was microfilmed in the 1970s, and is available in a microformat (Microfiche 965). However, later acquisitions are not part of this catalog. =Newspapers= Many historic newspapers from South Asia are kept in the microtext area. The Penn Libraries, by virtue of being a member of the Center for Research Libraries (CRL), does not duplicate their holdings, as they are available to patrons by a special arrangement. If any of the CRL newspaper holdings are required for research, they can be requested. For details of their collection, please see CRL South Asia Holdings. Here is a list of some of the commonly used newspapers at the Penn Libraries: *Aaj (1963-1996 ) Varanasi (Microfilm news 80) *Anandabazaarapatrika (1963-1995) Calcutta (Microfilm news 4) *Andhrapatrika (1963-1991) Madras (Microfilm news 5) *Amrita bazar patrika (1962-1991, 1993-1996) Calcutta (Microfilm news 3) *Bharat jyoti (1962) Bombay (Microfilm news 8) *Blitz (1952-1971) Bombay (Microfilm news 219) *Bombay courier (1793 - 1846) Bombay (Microfilm news 431) *Business recorder (1966 - 1971) Karachi (Microfilm news 157) *The Civil and Military Gazette (1886-1889, 1949-1950, 1960-1962) Lahore (Microfilm news 14) *CrossRoads (1951 - 1953) Bombay (Microfilm news 313) *Cutecamittiran (1963 - 1971) Madras (Microfilm news 66) *Dawn (1949 - 1996) Karachi (Microfilm news 24) *Daily jang (1954, 1961-1993) Karachi (Microfilm news 428) *Deccan herald (1962-2005) Bangalore (Microfilm news 25) *The Deccan Times weekly (1944-1950) Madras (Microfilm news 553) *The Economic times (1962 - 1995) Bombay (Microfilm news 26) *Free press journal (1962- 1971) Bombay (Microfilm news 2) *The Hindu (1963 - 1997) Madras (Microfilm news 216) *The Hindu weekly review (1962 - 1968) Madras (Microfilm news 218) *The Hindustan Standard (1942-1982) Calcutta (Microfilm news 554) *The Hindustan times (1962 - 1997) New Delhi (Microfilm news 30) *Imroz (1963-June1971) Lahore (Microfilm news 149) *The India gazette, or, Calcutta public advertiser (1780 - 1782) Calcutta (Microfilm news 429) *The Indian express (1962-1997, 2002-2004) New Delhi (Microfilm news 306) *The Indian mirror (1886 - 1889) Calcutta (Microfilm news 144) *The Indian spectator (1886-1889) Bombay (Microfilm news 142) *The Lahore chronicle (1850-1868) Lahore (Microfilm news 432) *Malayalam manorama (1963-1964,1966-1996) Kottayam (Microfilm news 41) *National herald (1962-1994) Lucknow and Delhi (Microfilm news 45) *Navashakti (1963-1971 ) Bombay (Microfilm news 46) *New age (1952 - 1994) New Delhi (Microfilm news 238) *Pakistan observer (1963-1971) Dacca (Microfilm news 86) *Pakistan Times (1963-1996) Lahore (Microfilm news 231) *People's age (1945 - 1949) Bombay (Microfilm news 313) *People's war (1942 -1945) Bombay (Microfilm news 313) *Pioneer (1886-1889, 1933-1948 ) Allahabad (Microfilm news 91) *Pioneer mail and Indian weekly news (1911-1931 ) Allahabad (Microfilm news 92) *Star of India (1942 - 1949) Calcutta (Microfilm news 64) *The Statesman (1962-1970 1981-1995) Delhi (Microfilm news 65) *Statesman, or, Friend of India (1941-1943) Calcutta (Microfilm News 649) *The Statesman weekly (1964-1965) Calcutta (Microfilm news 237) *The Times of India (1949-1966, 1990-1991, 1992-1995) Bombay (Microfilm news 71) *The Times of India(1966-1989) New Delhi (Microfilm news 71) Audio and video material Audio and video collecting have changed dramatically since the internet has made access to such media material extremely easy. There is no fixed policy on collecting audio or video from or about South Asia, but it is now largely dictated by student and research interests among the university community. =Video collection= While there is an effort to purchase many of the critically acclaimed titles in cinema, that interest is also largely driven from Cinema Studies. In terms of audio, gifts and approval plans are largely responsible for an increase in collections. All titles in the collection are available through the Penn Libraries Video Catalog (VCat). The video collection has been growing steadily over the past decade. We continue to actively collect documentary films and cinema that is difficult to access, particularly if requested by faculty and students. A small fraction of our titles continue to be on VHS tape. As of 2015, the languages most represented in the video collection by title are Hindi (1,258), Bengali (186), Kannada (162), Urdu (150), Tamil (127), Telugu (88), Marathi (42), Malayalam (40), and Pushto (40). The Penn Libraries also have video holdings in languages such as Vietnamese (24), Bahasa Indonesia (21), Sanskrit (19), Bhojpuri (6), Kashmiri (5), among others. =Audio collection= The audio collection is largely on audio tapes, and is not actively collected, even though Dr. Allyn Miner continues to lead the first and only performing arts component attached to a South Asia Studies department in the United States. We do acquire material largely on request. Till the landscape of copyright regulations and reformatting is understood, and until issues of stability and reliability of media formats in South Asia are addressed, video and audio acquisitions continue to be ad hoc and driven by demand only. South Asia Art Archive The South Asia Art Archive at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries was set up in W. Norman Brown's office in 1979 as a national facility, open to all who are interested in the study of Indian art. The holdings of the South Asia Art Archive currently consist of around 115,000 black-and-white photographs (classified by period and region), site and museum indexes, and ca 4,000 color slides. (In addition, the University has a teaching collection of more than 15,000 South Asia slides, most of which are online at the Fine Arts Image Collection. By agreement with the American Institute of Indian Studies and the Smithsonian Foreign Currencies Program which funded the AIIS Gurgaon Center, photographs added to the Gurgaon archive are also added to the archive in Philadelphia, keeping the archive current. South Asia Reading Room The reading room for South Asia is located in the Van Pelt Library, and has a small reference section containing approximately 2,500 titles. Current atlases and maps are also maintained in the reading room. An area within the room is dedicated to serials, and contains about 50 popular and academic journals in 12 languages. The space is regularly used for classes pertaining to South Asia, and also for special events and lectures. The Reading Room is also used for accessing Special Collections material under supervision for groups of students, by special arrangement. The reading room also has 10 carrels, which are charged to faculty and graduate students who work on South Asia, with permission of the South Asia Librarian. Similarly, classes can be scheduled with permission. Partnerships and Consortia The South Asia Bibliographer is a member of the Committee on South Asia Libraries and Documentation (CONSALD), and the South Asia Materials Project (SAMP). The University of Pennsylvania Libraries are in several regional and national consortia, including Borrow Direct and E-Z Borrow. The South Asia Center at Penn, and the Center for Advanced Study of India have a large number of affiliated fellows, academics from the region and around the globe, who use the South Asia collection for their research.

Life Born about 1790, Talboys established himself as a bookseller in Bedford. He subsequently moved his business to Oxford, where he became known for his knowledge of the book trade. In 1823 he went into partnership with James Luff Wheeler, the university bookseller, who married his daughter Anne Ophelia. Talboys & Wheeler then began to publish the \\"Oxford English Classics\\" series, with William Pickering of Chancery Lane, London. On 1 December 1827 Talboys was admitted to the privileges of a member of Oxford University. He took a leading part in the affairs of the city of Oxford, was a councillor of the east ward, and served the office of sheriff. After the election of 1835, Talboys was seen as the leader of the radical reformers in Oxford municipal affairs; together with Charles Sadler, a moderate reformer, he was able to make some changes in charity organisation. He was then attacked by the Oxford Herald, controlled by Philip Bliss, who attempted to have his business boycotted. Talboys died at Oxford on 23 May 1840, leaving a widow and seven children. Works Talboys was the author of Oxford Chronological Tables of Universal History, 1835 and 1840. He referenced James Bell's Compendious view of universal history and literature, in a series of tables (1820) and adopted some of the typographical conventions of Bell. Together Bell and Talboys are considered to have innovated influentially, in the use of bold type for cueing, in a way that carried over into textbook design. Talboys made translations of Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren's Researches into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Carthaginians, Ethiopians, and Egyptians (1832) (from the Ideen of Heeren) and Manual of the Political System of Europe (1834). He translated also Friedrich von Adelung's Historical Sketch of Sanscrit Literature (Oxford, 1832), making additions and corrections.

He is popularly called the father of Iran's nuclear program. After the 1979 Iranian revolution, he left Iran and established office in Paris and worked there as a nuclear energy consultant. As of 2009, he was the co-chair of Iranians for Peace. Early life and career Etemad was born on February 3, 1930, in Hamadan. He got a diploma in electrical engineering from Lausanne University in 1957. He received an M.Sc. in 1958 and a Ph.D. in reactor physics from Lausanne University in 1963. He worked for Brown-Boveri ( Brown, Boveri & Cie.) in Switzerland as a research engineer for one and a half years. He also worked for the Swiss Federal Institute for Reactor Research as the chief of its nuclear shielding group for five and a half years. He returned to Iran in 1965. In 1968 he joined the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Iran as Deputy minister for research. In 1973 he was appointed chancellor of the French language Bu Ali Sina University. In a meeting with the prime minister of Iran Amir Abbas Hoveida, Etemad proposed that an independent national organization for scientific research needed to be established. Hoveida approved the proposal and Etemad was made the head of Iran's Institute for Planning and Research in Science. On April 10, 1974, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Iran and the first president of its atomic energy organization. After becoming the president he ensured that all decision-making powers were given to him, right from the budget to the selection of staff. The AEOI did not have to report its expenditure to the government instead a single report was submitted to the treasury at the end of every year. The Shah had set the target of producing 23,000 Megawatts of electrical energy from nuclear sources within the next twenty years. In July 1974, a nuclear deal worth US$130 million was signed between Iran and United States. He had once asked the Shah if he wanted to build a nuclear bomb, to which the Shah replied that doing so would only isolate Iran from the rest of the world. In October 1975, he refused that Iran had signed a uranium deal worth US$7 million with South Africa. After he was accused of mismanagement and embezzlement in October 1978, he resigned from the post of the president of the Atomic Energy Organization. After the 1979 Iranian revolution that led to the formation of a new government, Etemad left Iran for Paris. The new leaders asked him to return but he refused. During the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein attempted to persuade him to work for Iraq but he refused saying \\"'as long as you are fighting my people I wouldn't come to Iraq. You are my enemy\\". Interview by Maziar Bahari In September 2008, the transcript of his interview conducted by Maziar Bahari was published in the New Statesman entitled \\"The Shah's plan was to build bombs.\\" Maziar Bahari wrote that Etemad had confided in him that the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran intended to make nuclear weapons with Iran's civilian nuclear program. After the interview was published, Mr. Etemad wrote a letter to the New Statesman which appeared in the print edition of the Dec 1, 2008 issue of the magazine, in which he vociferously denied the claim attributed to him by Maziar Bahari: > The title \\"The Shah's plan was to build bombs\\" is misleading. I told Mr > Bahari that I had to know what the Shah had in mind regarding the nature of > the nuclear programme. I also said that during a long discussion, the Shah > told me that Iran did not need nuclear weapons, because our strong > conventional forces would guarantee our security and national interests.

They are the principal deterrent force against any aggression that could be shown against the sovereign state of Ukraine. All military and security forces, including the Armed Forces, are under the command of the President of Ukraine, and subject to oversight by a permanent Verkhovna Rada parliamentary commission. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are composed of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, the Ukrainian Navy, the Ukrainian Air Force, and the Ukrainian Airmobile Forces. Ukraine's naval forces maintain their own small Ukrainian Naval Infantry force as well as their own Ukrainian Naval Aviation force. The Ukrainian Sea Guard is the coast guard service of Ukraine, however, it is part of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine and is not subordinate to the Navy. As a result of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine from 2014, the president commissioned governors of oblasts of Ukraine to create volunteer units under the government program \\"Territorial Defense\\". Initially these units received minimal funding coming from regional budgets and mostly relied on donations. In November 2014 most of the territorial battalions were integrated into Ukraine's Ground forces. The National Guard of Ukraine serves as the main reserve component of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Due to ongoing hostilities with Russia, Ukraine has greatly increased the size of its military forces to 204,000 soldiers (+46,000 civil servants) in 2014, not counting paramilitary forces such as the border guards (53,000), the newly formed National Guard of Ukraine (60,000) or the security service. The size of Ukraine's armed forces, which maintains a 255,000 man force, is the third- largest in Europe after the Russian and French Armed Forces. It was reported that Ukraine's military swelled to 280,000 personnel. This was largely achieved by the repeated waves of mobilization bringing in new recruits while older soldiers had not yet been demobilized, the state budget for 2015 ultimately called for a force of 230,000. Hryhoriy Pedchenko reported that 51% of Ukraine's enlisted personnel were contracted soldiers. Military units of other states participate in multinational military exercises with Ukrainian forces in Ukraine regularly. Many of these exercises are held under the NATO co-operation program Partnership for Peace. Since 3 June 2016, women have been allowed to serve in combat units of the Armed Forces.War has a female face , UNIAN (4 August 2016)  History  = Origins of the post-1992 Ukrainian Armed Forces = , the Ukrainian Armed Forces were completely inherited from the Soviet Union, in which Ukraine had been a member state (a union republic). Like other Soviet republics, it did not possess its own separate military command, as all military formations were uniformly subordinated to the central command of the Armed Forces of the USSR. Administratively, the Ukrainian SSR was divided into three Soviet military districts (the Carpathian Military District, Kyiv Military District, and Odesa Military District). Three Soviet air commands and most of the Black Sea Fleet naval bases were located on the coast of Ukraine. When the collapse of the Soviet Union took place in 1991 (see Novo-Ogaryovo process), the newly independent state of Ukraine inherited one of the most powerful force groupings in Europe. According to an associate of the Conflict Studies Research Centre, James Sherr: \\"This grouping, its inventory of equipment and its officer corps was designed for one purpose: to wage combined arms, coalition, offensive (and nuclear) warfare against NATO on an external front\\".James Sherr, 'Ukraine's Defense Reform: An Update', Conflict Studies Research Centre, 2002 At that time, the former Soviet armed forces in the Ukrainian SSR included a rocket army (43rd Rocket Army), four air-force armies, an air-defense army (8th Air Defence Army), three regular armies, two tank armies, the 32nd Army Corps, and the Black Sea Fleet.Стан Збройних Сил України на момент створення (Status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the time of creation) . Ukrainian Military in 20-21st centuries. Altogether the Armed Forces of Ukraine included about 780,000 personnel, 6,500 tanks, about 7,000 combat armored vehicles, 1,500 combat aircraft, and more than 350 ships. Along with their equipment and personnel, Ukraine's armed forces inherited the battle honors and lineage of the Soviet forces stationed in Ukraine. However, due to the deterioration of Russian-Ukrainian relations and to the continued stigma of being associated with the Soviet Union, in 2015 the President of Ukraine ordered the removal of most of the citations awarded to the Ukrainian units during the Soviet era. On 26 February 1991, a parliamentary Standing Commission for Questions of Security and Defense was established. On August 24, 1991, the Ukrainian parliament (the Verkhovna Rada), in adopting the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, also enacted a short resolution \\"About military formations in Ukraine\\".Law of Ukraine N 1431-XII. \\"About military formations of Ukraine \\". Verkhovna Rada. August 24, 1991. This took jurisdiction over all formations of the armed forces of the Soviet Union stationed on Ukrainian soil and established one of the key agencies, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. On 3 September 1991, the Ministry of Defence commenced its duties. On 22 October 1991 units and formations of the Soviet Armed Forces on Ukrainian soil were nationalized.James Sherr, DEFENCE & SECURITY REFORM IN UKRAINE: A FRESH START? (Survival, Spring 2001) Subsequently, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted two Laws of Ukraine on December 6, 1991,Official document . Law of Ukraine \\"About Defense of Ukraine\\". December 6, 1991Official document . Law of Ukraine \\"About Armed Forces of Ukraine. December 6, 1991 and Presidential Ukase #4 \\"About Armed Forces of Ukraine\\" on December 12, 1991. The government of Ukraine surrendered any rights of succession to the Soviet Strategic Deterrence ForcesStrategic Deterrence Forces at encyclopedia.mil.ru (see Strategic Missile Troops) that were staged on the territory of Ukraine. Recognizing the complications of a smooth transition and seeking a consensus with other former members of the Soviet Union in dividing up their Soviet military inheritance, Ukraine joined ongoing talks that started in December 1991 regarding a joint military command of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Inherent in the process of creating a domestic military were political decisions by the Ukrainian leadership regarding the country's non-nuclear and international status. Among these were the definition, agreement, and ratification of the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) which not only established the maximum level of armament for each republic of the former USSR, but also a special ceiling for the so-called CFE \\"Flank Region\\". Included in this region were Ukraine's Mykolaiv, Kherson and Zaporizhia Oblasts, and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Another key event in the development of the Ukrainian military was the 1992 Tashkent Treaty, which laid out aspirations for a Commonwealth of Independent States military. This collective military proved impossible to develop because the former republics of the USSR all wished to go their own way, ripping the intricate Soviet military machine into pieces. Ukraine had observer status with the Non-Aligned Movement of nation-states from 1996. However, due to the 2014 Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada repealed this status on 23 December 2014. = Arms Control and Disarmament = A Tu-22M being dismantled through assistance provided by the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program implemented by the DTRA, 2002 Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited two divisions of the Strategic Rocket Forces' 43rd Rocket Army (HQ Vinnytsia): the 19th Rocket Division (Khmelnytskyi) (90 UR-100N/SS-19/RS-18) and the 46th Rocket Division at Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast, equipped with 40 SS-19 and 46 silo-mounted RT-23 Molodets/SS-24s.Source old early 1990s notes, but corroboration available for example at traveltoukraine.org and Feskov et al. 2004 While Ukraine had physical control of these systems, it did not have operational control. The use of the weapons was dependent on Russian-controlled electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system. A SS-20 on display at the World War II Museum in Kyiv Ukraine voluntarily gave up these and all other nuclear weapons during the early 1990s. This was the first time in history that a country voluntarily gave up the use of strategic nuclear weapons, although the Republic of South Africa was dismantling its small tactical nuclear weapons program at about the same time. Ukraine has plentiful amounts of highly enriched uranium, which the United States wanted to buy from the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology. Ukraine also has two uranium mining and processing factories, a heavy water plant and technology for determining the isotopic composition of fissionable materials. Ukraine has deposits of uranium that are among the world's richest. In May 1992, Ukraine signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons and to join the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state. Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and as of January 1, 1996, no military nuclear equipment or materials remain on Ukrainian territory. On 13 May 1994, the United States and Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Transfer of Missile Equipment and Technology. This agreement committed Ukraine to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) by controlling exports of missile-related equipment and technology according to the MTCR Guidelines. Other disarmament – strategic planes & other missiles Ukraine and NATO estimate that 2.5 million tons of conventional ammunition were left in Ukraine as the Soviet military withdrew, as well as more than 7 million rifles, pistols, mortars, and machine guns. The surplus weapons and ammunition were stored in over 180 military bases, including in bunkers, salt mines and in the open. As of 2014, much of this surplus had not been scrapped. = Attempt at Reforms and Constant Fund Shortages = Ukraine's first military reforms began on December 26, 1996, with the adoption of a new \\"State Program for the Building and Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\\". One of the aspects was to shrink the standard combat unit from division size to brigade size which would then fall under the command of one of the three newly created military district; the Western Operational Command, the Southern Operational Command, and the largest – the Northern Operational/Territorial Command.Wolchik, p.75, 91, original newspaper sources include Kyivska Pravda, 10 November 1992, in FBIS-SOV, 2 December 1992, 18, and Narodna Armiia , 18 January 1997. Only Ukraine's 1st Airmobile Division was not downsized. This downsizing occurred purely for financial reasons with Ukrainian economy in recession this was a way to shrink the government (defense) expenditure and at the same time release hundreds of thousands of young people into the private sector to stimulate growth. During this time Ukraine's military-industrial complex also began to develop new indigenous weapons for the armed forces like the T-84 tank, the BMP-1U, the BTR-3, KrAZ-6322, and the Antonov An-70. All these reforms were championed by Leonid Kuchma, the 2nd President of Ukraine, who wanted to retain a capable military and a functioning military-industrial complex because he didn't trust Russia who he believed might one day become Ukraine's enemy, stating once \\"The threat of Russofication is a real concern for us\\".Kuzio Taras, p.457, Praeger Security International, Ukraine: Democratization, Corruption, and the New Russian Imperialism , 2015. Kuchma was also eager to modernize the equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, however, after learning of the price tag of such a move, he backtracked, preferring to rely on the sizable Soviet supply of weapons which he made sure were well maintained. But the cancellation of the modernization program left a question of how to provide jobs in the military industrial complex which then comprised a double-digit percentage of the GDP. Export of new and modernized weapons on the world's arms markets was settled on as the best option, where Ukraine both tried to undercut the contracts of the Russian arms industry – offering the same service for a cheaper price, and was willing to sell equipment to whoever was willing to pay (more than once to politically unstable or even aggressive regimes), causing negative reactions from both Western Europe and the United States federal government. During this time 320 T-80 tanks would be sold to Pakistan and an unfinished Soviet aircraft carrier the Varyag which today is known as the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning. Though the military was well equipped it still experienced lack of funds particularly for training and exercises, which led to a number of incidents with one notable one being the Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 of 2001 the other Sknyliv airshow disaster of 2002. Still, the military's effectiveness was demonstrated during the Tuzla Island Conflict – when (brief description). In 2003 Ukraine completed its first set of reforms which were judged largely successful, with the personnel numbers stabilizing at 295,000 of which 90,000 were civilian contractors. * Second phase 2004–2010  downsizing further  training  maintenance and new equipment  NATO and Russia  2008 financial crisis * The Yanukovich Catastrophe (2011–2014)  appointment of Russian citizens to the ministry of defense and intelligence  downsizing  lack of funds for exercise, vehicle maintenance, and even monthly paychecks  scrapping and sale of equipment  incompetence in, and destruction of the military industrial complex Ukrainian military tactics and organization are heavily dependent on Cold War tactics and former Soviet Armed Forces organization. Under former President Yushchenko, Ukraine pursued a policy of independence from Russian dominance, and thus tried to fully integrate with the West, specifically NATO. Until the Euromaidan crisis of 2014, Ukraine retained tight military relations with Russia, inherited from their common Soviet history. Common uses for naval bases in the Crimea and joint air defense efforts were the most intense cooperative efforts. This cooperation was a permanent irritant in bilateral relations, but Ukraine appeared economically dependent on Moscow, and thus unable to break such ties quickly. After the election of President Victor Yanukovych, ties between Moscow and Kyiv warmed, and those between Kyiv and NATO cooled, relative to the Yushchenko years. = Conflict in Southeastern Ukraine (2014 – present) = T-64BMs in Eastern Ukraine In March 2014, after the Crimean crisis began, it was announced by the reformist government that a new military service, the National Guard of Ukraine would be created. Previously a National Guard had existed up until 2000, thus the 2014 NG is a reformation of the one raised in 1991, but this time formed part of personnel from the Internal Troops of Ukraine. In May 2014 with war happening in eastern regions, a helicopter with 14 soldiers on board including General Serhiy Kulchytskiy, who headed combat and special training for the country's National Guard, was brought down by militants near Sloviansk in East Ukraine. Outgoing President Olexander Turchynov described the downing as a \\"terrorist attack,\\" and blamed pro- Russian militants. In the early months of the War in Donbass, the Armed Forces were widely criticised for their poor equipment and inept leadership, forcing Internal Affairs Ministry forces like the National Guard and the territorial defence battalions to take on the brunt of the fighting in the first months of the war. In late July 2015, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry revealed new Ukrainian Armed Forces uniform designs, later a revised rank insignia system was created. These made their national debut on August 24, 2016, at the National Independence Day Silver Jubilee parade in Independence Square, Kyiv. By February 2018 the Ukrainian armed forces were larger and better equipped than ever before, numbering 200,000 active-service military personnel and most of the volunteer soldiers of the territorial defence battalions have been integrated into the official Ukrainian army.Ukraine’s Toughest Fight: The Challenge of Military Reform , Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (FEBRUARY 22, 2018) A late 2017-early 2018 United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported that human rights abuses allegedly committed by Ukrainian security forces and armed groups remain an ongoing issue of the War in Donbass that erupted in 2014. The nature of the alleged crimes ranges from unlawful or arbitrary detention to torture, ill-treatment and/or sexual violence. Within the reporting period of 16 November 2017 to 15 February 2018 the OHCHR monitoring mission documented 115 cases of credible allegations of human rights violations committed by both sides of the conflict since 2014.Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine 16 November 2017 to 15 February 2018 , OHCHR (page 6) = Ukraine & NATO Membership = SSO operators during exercises Ukraine's stated national policy is Euro-Atlantic integration, with the European Union. Ukraine has a \\"Distinctive Partnership\\" with NATO (see Enlargement of NATO) and has been an active participant in Partnership for Peace exercises and in peacekeeping in the Balkans. This close relationship with NATO has been most apparent in Ukrainian cooperation and combined peacekeeping operations with its neighbor Poland in Kosovo. Ukrainian servicemen also serve under NATO command in Iraq, Afghanistan and in Operation Active Endeavour. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych considered the level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient.NATO confirms readiness for Ukraine's joining organization , Kyiv Post (April 13, 2010) His predecessor Viktor Yushchenko had asked for Ukrainian membership by early 2008.Bush to back Ukraine's Nato hopes , BBC News (April 1, 2008)NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine held off , BBC (April 4, 2008) During the 2008 Bucharest summit NATO declared that Ukraine will become a member of NATO whenever it wants and when it meets the criteria for accession. Former Ukrainian President Yanukovych opted to keep Ukraine a non-aligned state. This materialized on June 3, 2010, when the Ukrainian parliament excluded, with 226 votes, the goal of \\"integration into Euro-Atlantic security and NATO membership\\" from the country's national security strategy.Ukraine drops NATO membership bid, EUobserver (June 6, 2010) Amid the Euromaidan unrest, Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February 2014. The interim Yatsenyuk Government which came to power, initially said, with reference to the country's non- aligned status, that it had no plans to join NATO.Deschytsia states new government of Ukraine has no intention to join NATO , Interfax-Ukraine (29 March 2014) However, following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and parliamentary elections in October 2014, the new government made joining NATO a priority.

Xinhua News Agency. Published on 2014-12-24. The Ukrainian military is since transforming to NATO standards. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk stated early February 2016 that de facto the Armed Forces must, soon as possible, begin its transition for Ukrainian entry into NATO and towards NATO-capable armed forces.Yatseniuk: Ukrainian army to switch to contract service, de facto become part of NATO , Interfax-Ukraine (11 February 2016)  Organization  President Volodymyr Zelensky with the senior leadership of the Ukrainian military in May 2019 In late 2010 the total personnel (including 41,000 civilian workers) was 200,000. Conscription was ended in October 2013; at that time the Ukrainian armed forces were made up of 40% conscripts and 60% contract soldiers. In April 2014 acting President Oleksandr Turchynov reinstated conscription in May 2014.Ukraine reinstates conscription as crisis deepens , BBC News (1 May 2014) In early 2014, Ukraine had 130,000 personnel in its armed forces that could be boosted to about one million with reservists. There is a reported total of 250,800 personnel in the Armed Forces in 2015. Ukraine maintained until 2016 a number of Guards units, tracing their traditions to the Soviet Armed Forces. A list can be seen at List of guards units of Ukraine. There were reports in 2015 that all Guards units had been either disbanded or reformed to regular units, this was proven false as all their Soviet decorations were removed from their titles and regimental colours by 15 November the same year due to the decommunization process in Ukraine which ceased promotion and glorification of the Soviet symbols. (On August 22, 2016, the Guards titles were removed from the unit titles.) Only one brigade, the 51st, a former Guards unit, had been dissolved the year before. Following the Russian aggression, Ukraine has adopted a new military doctrine (third edition) which made the Russian Federation its main opponent and announced Ukraine's intentions for closer relations with NATO armed services, most especially if it will join the organization in the future.Ukase of the President of Ukraine #555/2015: About decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine of 2 September 2015 \\"About new edition of the Ukrainian military doctrine\\" (УКАЗ ПРЕЗИДЕНТА УКРАЇНИ №555/2015: Про рішення Ради національної безпеки і оборони України від 2 вересня 2015 року \\"Про нову редакцію Воєнної доктрини України\\") . President of Ukraine. = Chief of the General Staff = The Chief of the General Staff oversees the Armed Forces of Ukraine. = Ukrainian Ground Forces = KRAZ Spartan As of 2016, there were a reported 169,000 personnel in the Ukrainian Ground Forces. The Ukrainian Ground Forces are divided into Armoured and Mechanized Forces, Army Aviation, Army Air Defence and Rocket and Artillery Troops. There are 13 mechanized brigades and two mountain warfare brigades in the Mechanized Forces. Ukraine also has two armoured brigades. There are seven rocket and artillery brigades as well as five airmobile brigades. Until 2013, the Ground Forces were divided into three army corps. These were disbanded in 2013 and reorganized as Operation Command West, Operation Command North and Operation Command South. Operation Command East was formed in 2015 to coordinate forces in the War in Donbass. Ukrainian Su-25 = Ukrainian Air Force = In 2016, the Ukrainian Air Force was reported to have included 36,300 personnel. = Ukrainian Navy = Krivak III-class frigate ; the current flagship of the Ukrainian Navy According to an August 2015 Kyiv Post report, the Ukrainian Navy consisted of 6,500 personnel. = Air Assault and Airborne Forces = The Ukrainian Air Assault Forces are composed of 8 air assault brigades and support units. = Special Forces = Ukraine's special forces are reported as 4,000 strong. = Personnel and conscription = The Soviet Union required all able-bodied male citizens to serve two years in the armed forces (three years if drafted into the navy), although the draft could be postponed due to continued higher education. It was possible to be drafted into non Ministry of Defense military forces such as the KGB Border Guards, the Militsiya, or the Internal Troops. When Ukraine gained its independence it retained the policy of conscription, although the time in service was reduced to 18 months in the navy and one year in all other services. Ukraine also gradually began recruiting professional soldiers, although in almost all cases a person had to serve as a conscript prior to becoming a professional soldier. The Ukrainian Naval Infantry was the first service to convert to being staffed by fully professional marines. In October 2013 President Yanukovich ended conscription in Ukraine, at the time 60% of Ukraine's forces were composed of professional soldiers. However, due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine conscription, as well as a partial mobilization, was reinstated in 2014. Ukraine has modified the age group of males eligible for conscription for 2015 from 18–25 to the 20-27 age group. After serving out the term of service Ukraine's conscripts become part of the inactive reserve and are eligible to be recalled for mobilization until they reach age 55, age 60 for officers. Due to the War in Donbass Ukraine has instated a partial mobilization to fill needed positions in its armed forces, recalling conscripts who have served before, because of the war many conscripts have also been forced to serve longer than their original 18-month term of service. It was planned that in 2015 Ukraine would undergo three waves of partial mobilization, this would have allowed new troops to replace those serving longer than their original term of service. As a result, the number of defections from Ukrainian Armed Forces has risen substantially cause the Ukrainian conscripts had no wish to put their life at risk in combat. An advisor of Ukrainian president described the quality of forcibly mobilized Ukrainian soldiers as \\"alcoholics and dodgers, drug addicts and morons\\". According to many reports the increased consumption of drugs and alcohol on duty has become a serious issue in Ukrainian Armed Forces. As a response the Ukrainian government launched a military police service and deployed National Guards in war zone. Due to the reintroduction of conscription, and partial mobilization, Ukraine's armed forces is expected to nearly double from approximately 130,000 personnel in December 2014 to approximately 250,000 personnel in 2015. All medical workers in Ukraine, regardless of gender, are eligible to be called up for service in case of a national emergency. Draft dodging is present in Ukraine as with most nations using the draft. It was reported that between April and August 2014, over 1,000 criminal inquires into draft evasion were opened in Ukraine. Draft evasion can be problematic because unless a male citizen was unable to serve for medical reasons, an application to receive an international passport of Ukraine may be denied due to a lack of military service, thus preventing the individual from traveling abroad. As of autumn 2016, conscripts were no longer deployed in the so-called \\"ATO\\"-operations in the east of Ukraine. = Contract service = In 2017 more than 14 thousand people signed up for contract service with the Armed Forces. For participating in the War in Donbass (in May 2017 7.5 thousand) soldiers on the front line receive an average salary of 16 thousand Ukrainian Hryvnia. The minimum maintenance for a contract soldier is 7000 Hryvnia. West Ukraine supplies the fewest people for contract service. The Defense Ministry told which areas of shortage of recruits , Ukrayinska Pravda (30 May 2017) = Paramilitary forces = Ukraine's Armed Forces outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense consist of: * Internal Troops → National Guard (Ministry of Internal Affairs): 46,000  Special operation formations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, i.e. Omega, Scorpion (nuclear sites security), Tytan, and others. Most of Felidae-named formations (such as Bars, Jaguar, others) along with Berkut were reformed. * Border Guard: 42,000 (including 8,000 civilian workers)  Ukrainian Sea Guard – the coast guard within the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine * Various military troops of the SBU (no generic name): 30,000 * Civil Defence Forces (State Emergency Service of Ukraine): 10,218 (including 668 civilian workers) Law of Ukraine about structure of Civil Defence Forces 22 December 1998 № 328-XIV * Special Transportation Service of Ukraine – (Ministry of Transportation and Communications) Law of Ukraine about Special Transportation Service of Ukraine 5 February 2004 № 1449-IV Although not components of the Armed Forces, these militarized institutions are supposed to come under the Armed Forces' command during wartime. = Role of women = On 3 June 2016, Defense Ministry's Order No. 292 allowed women to serve in combat units. According to Defense Ministry figures early June 2016 some 49,500 women served in and worked in the Ukrainian military; more than 17,000 were military servicewomen, of which more than 2,000 officers. Women have also joined the various volunteer Territorial defense battalions before the order for women's integration in the armed forces was enacted. Women are eligible to be drafted into the military as officers. In 2009 women comprised almost 13% of the armed forces (18,000 personnel) but with few females holding high rank (2.9% or 1,202 women). Contractual military service accounted for almost 44% of women. However, this being closely linked to the low salary of such positions: men refuse to serve in these conditions while women accept them. Nadiya Savchenko is perhaps one of the most well known female Ukrainian soldiers and was held as a prisoner in Russia from July 2014 until May 2016. According to President Petro Poroshenko, in October 2016 about ten thousand women served in combat units.Poroshenko congratulates Ukrainian defenders, tells how many soldiers killed in Donbas , UNIAN (14 October 2016) In September 2018 legislation made women and men equal in the military and law enforcement agencies.

The armed forces' military high school is located in Kyiv – the Ivan Bohun Military High School.  Recent operations  Members of the Ukrainian Army's 19th Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Battalion in Kuwait Ukraine has been playing an increasingly larger role in peacekeeping operations. Since 1992, over 30,000 soldiers have taken part in missions in the former Yugoslavia (IFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNPROFOR and UNTAES in Croatia, KFor in Kosovo), the Middle East (Southern Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq), and Africa (Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia). Deployments outside Ukraine since 1991 Since 1997, Ukraine has been working closely with NATO and especially with Poland. A Ukrainian unit was deployed as part of the multinational force in Iraq under Polish command. Ukrainian troops are also deployed as part of the Ukrainian-Polish Battalion (UKRPOLBAT) in Kosovo. The total Ukrainian military deployment around the world as of 1 August 2009 was 540 servicemen participating in 8 peacekeeping missions. The first battle of a regular formation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces happened on April 6, 2004, in Kut, Iraq, when the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent was attacked by militants of the Mahdi Army. The Ukrainians took fire, and over several hours held the objectives they had been assigned to secure. Ukrainian troops riding alongside US Marines in IraqUkrainian troops as part of the former Soviet Armed Forces contingent participated in UNPROFOR in 1992, and in the summer of that year were involved into the civil war in Yugoslavia. On July 3, 1992, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a resolution committing the Ukrainian Armed Forces to UN peacekeeping missions. The Minister of Defense, Kostyantyn Morozov, ordered the creation of the 240th Separate Special Battalion (UKRBAT-1) which was based on the 93rd Guards Motor Rifle Division (now the 93rd Mechanized Brigade). Soon after arrival in Sarajevo on July 31, 1992, the battalion's artillery ended up in the middle of a mutual mortar fight between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. One of the Serbian shells hit the Ukrainian position, seriously wounding seven soldiers, one of whom died after hospitalization in Germany. Since gaining independence Ukraine has deployed troops to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, as well as dedicating peacekeepers to UN missions to Africa (including helicopter units). Ukrainian naval units also participated in anti piracy operations off the coast of Somalia prior to being recalled due to the 2014 Russian intervention in Ukraine. On 19 January 2015 Ukraine's 18th separate helicopter detachment along with other MONUSCO troops carried out a successful operation eliminating 2 camps belonging to illegal armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. = Deployment outside Ukraine = * : ISAF (PRT CHAGHCHARAN) – 13 Officers (3 medical officers) * : (MONUSCO) – 12 Experts on Mission and four Mi-24 helicopters * (NTM-I): – 10 officersParticipating nations * : (KFOR) – 128 Soldiers * : (UNMIK) – 1 Military Liaison Component Chief of Staff, 1 liaison officer * : (UNMIL) – 277 Contingent Troops, 2 Experts on Mission * : (Transnistria) – 10 Military Observers * : (UNMIS) – 9 Experts on Mission * (20) = 2014 Crimean crisis = On 2 March 2014, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were placed on full alert following a Russian military intervention in Crimea.

Budget  Ukraine's National Security Strategy foresees that its National Security and Defense budget should be at least 5% of Ukraine's GDP.Ukraine to allocate $6.3 bln for security, defense in 2018 – Poroshenko , UNIAN (14 September 2017) Parliament approved the 2018 state budget , Ukrayinska Pravda (7 December 2017) On 21 December 2016 the Ukrainian parliament adopted its 2017 National Security and Defense budget worth $5.172 billion; that being 5% of Ukraine's GDP. In 2016 defense expenditures amounted to $4.4 billion in 2016, or 5% of the GDP.Ukrainian military budget to reduce likelihood of separatist attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk, improve infrastructure security , IHS Jane's 360 (2 December 2015)\\"Ukraine to spend 3% of GDP on defense in 2017: Finance minister\\", UNIAN (13 August 2016) This (2016 figure) was a 23% increase from 2013 and a 65% increase from 2005. From the total, 60% was budgeted to be spent on defence and 40% on security and policing. 2016 also saw a 30% increase in weapons development spending. Corruption, which was practically institutionalized in Ukraine, combined with small budgets left the military in such a depleted condition that their ability to confront the crisis in Crimea and the Donbass was minimal. All Ukrainian defence sector is heavily affected by the systemic corruption which is hindering its capacity to perform the tasks of national security. In addition, it is also undermines popular trust in the military as an institution. Despite a great number of efforts to resolve the issue there are signs that enough is not being done.Adriana Lins de Albuquerque and Jakob Hedenskog Ukraine A Defence Sector Reform Assessment FOI-R-4157-SE Ukrainian government has launched major structural reforms of the army to meet NATO standards by 2020, but not too many believe that it can successfully meet a deadline. Most part of the problems remain intact, for example: lack of civilian and parliamentary control of the armed forces, lack of internal coordination between different departments, poor integration of volunteers into the regular army, impunity and abusive behavior of military personnel in the conflict zone and systemic corruption and nontransparency of financial resources, especially in the Ukroboronprom defense-industry monopoly. In 2018 the military budget has grown dramatically, to nearly 5% of GDP. Corruption remains a serious problem operating at all levels of Ukrainian society, and the lack of modern military organizational structure has confounded efforts at reform. = Budget per year (Defense budget only, not \\"Security and Defense\\" combined) = *2003: $1.01 Billion (UAH 5.06 billion @5.0 exchange rate)https://pidruchniki.com/16011013/finansi/sklad_struktura_vidatkiv_derzhavnogo_byudzhetu_ukrayini *2004: $1.29 Billion (UAH 6.46 billion @5.0 exchange rate) *2005: $1.23 Billion (UAH 6.16 billion @5.0 exchange rate) *2006: $1.47 Billion (UAH 7.35 billion @5.0 exchange rate) *2007: $2.12 Billion (UAH 10.6 billion @5.0 exchange rate) *2008: $1.78 Billion (UAH 8.926 billion @5.0 exchange rate)https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/107-17 *2009: $0.93 Billion (UAH 7.4 billion @8.0 exchange rate)https://tyzhden.ua/Publication/2322 *2010: $1.63 Billion (UAH 13.1 billion @8.0 exchange rate) *2011: $1.82 Billion (UAH 14.6 billion @8.0 exchange rate)http://vkurse.ua/ua/society/stimulirovat-voennykh- premiyami.html *2012: $2.05 Billion (UAH 16.4 billion @8.0 exchange rate)http://www.economy.nayka.com.ua/?op=1&z;=922 *2013: $1.88 Billion (UAH 15.3 billion @8.1 exchange rate) https://news.finance.ua/ru/news/-/293024/voennye-rashody-ukrainy-v-2013-godu- uvelicheny-na-1-15-minfin *2014: $1.37 Billion (UAH 15.1 billion @11.0 exchange rate) https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/business/2014/12/141224_budget_spendings_project-2015_vc *2015: $1.91 Billion (UAH 40.2 billion @21.0 exchange rate) *2016: $2.11 Billion (UAH 56 billion) https://www.depo.ua/ukr/war/proekt-viyskovogo- byudzhetu-2017---skilki-kudi-y-navishcho-26092016090000 *2017: $2.65 Billion (UAH 69 billion) https://mil.in.ua/uk/d0-b1-d1-8e-d0-b4-d0-b6-d0-b5-d1-82-d1-96-2019-d0-bd-d0-b0-d0-be-d0-b1-d0-be-d1-80-d0-be-d0-bd-d1-83-d0-bf-d0-b5-d1-80-d0-b5-d0-b4-d0-b1-d0-b0-d1-87-d0-b5-d0-bd-d0-be-538-d0-b2-d0-b2-d0-bf/ *2018: $3.20 Billion (UAH 83.3 billion) *2019: $4.08 Billion (UAH 102 billion) *2020: $5.2 billion (UAH 130 billion) https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2019/11/14/7231954/ \\"Security and Defense\\" combined budget apart from Department of Defense (Defense Ministry) for Armed Forces of Ukraine, also includes expenses for Police, Customs, and Border Control.

Ukrainians who served in WWII, the Soviet–Afghan War, or as liquidators at the Chernobyl disaster are eligible for benefits such as monthly allowances, discounts on medical and pharmacy services, free use of public transportation, additional vacation days from work, retention priority in work layoffs, easier access to loans and associated approval processes, preference when applying for security related positions, priority when applying to vocational schools or trade schools, and electricity, gas, and housing subsidies. Veterans are also eligible to stay at military sanatoriums, space permitting. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has deployed troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, gaining a new generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the Soviet forces. Most recently, the government passed a law extending veteran benefits to Ukrainian troops responding to the War in Donbass. Moreover, veterans from other nations who move to or reside in Ukraine may be eligible for some of the listed benefits, this provision was likely made to ensure WWII, Chernobyl, and Afghanistan veterans from other Soviet states who moved to Ukraine received similar benefits, however as Ukraine has participated in numerous NATO-led conflicts since its independence, it is unclear if NATO veterans would be extended these benefits. Veteran groups are not as developed as in the United States which has numerous well known national organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars. World War II veterans, and even persons who have lived through the war are generally treated with the highest respect. Other veterans are not as well known. Ukrainian veterans from the Soviet War of Afghanistan are strikingly similar to the Vietnam veterans of the United States. The Soviet Union generally kept the public in the dark through the war, unlike in Vietnam where coverage was very high, Afghanistan is often labeled as a mistake by the Soviet Union and its successor states, the lack of media coverage and censorship through the war also ensured that many still remain unaware of their nations involvement in the conflict. Despite Ukraine having the 3rd largest contingent of troops in Iraq in 2004, few also realize that their nation has many veterans of the Iraq war. Due to the ongoing conflict with pro-Russian separatists, another generation of veterans appeared in Ukraine. These veterans would be eligible for the same benefits as all others. However, as there was no official declaration of war it was difficult to determine the cut-off date for veteran benefits, leaving many that participated at the beginning of the conflict without benefits. At first, Ukraine only gave benefits posthumously to family members as there was no legal framework to account for the veterans, moreover, members of territorial defense battalions were not eligible for benefits at all. In August, a law was passed granting all service members participating in Ukraine's Anti-Terror Operation the status of veterans, five months after first hostilities broke out in Crimea, the territorial defense battalions were integrated into the National Guard making them part of Ukraine's forces, thus allowing their volunteers to receive veteran status. Veterans of the so-called \\"ATO\\"-operations in Donbas are eligible for receiving apartments (if staying in active duty) or a land plot for building purposes of 1000 sqm. in the district of their registration.

It is typically created as a preprocessing step to support NLP tasks such as text condensation term disambiguation (topic-based) text summarization, relation extraction and textual entailment. Representation The semantics of what a text graph's nodes and edges represent can vary widely. Nodes for example can simply connect to tokenized words, or to domain-specific terms, or to entities mentioned in the text. The edges, on the other hand, can be between these text-based tokens or they can also link to a knowledge base. TextGraphs Workshop series The TextGraphs Workshop series is a series of regular academic workshops intended to encourage the synergy between the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and graph theory. The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications that focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and semantic role labelling, got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections. The 11th edition of the workshop (TextGraphs-11) will be collocated with the Annual Meeting of Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017) in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Areas of interest * Graph-based methods for providing reasoning and interpretation of deep learning methods  Graph-based methods for reasoning and interpreting deep processing by neural networks,  Explorations of the capabilities and limits of graph-based methods applied to neural networks in general  Investigation of which aspects of neural networks are not susceptible to graph-based methods. * Graph-based methods for Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, and Text Mining  Graph-based methods for word sense disambiguation,  Graph-based representations for ontology learning,  Graph-based strategies for semantic relations identification,  Encoding semantic distances in graphs,  Graph-based techniques for text summarization, simplification, and paraphrasing  Graph-based techniques for document navigation and visualization  Reranking with graphs  Applications of label propagation algorithms, etc. * New graph-based methods for NLP applications  Random walk methods in graphs  Spectral graph clustering  Semi-supervised graph-based methods  Methods and analyses for statistical networks  Small world graphs  Dynamic graph representations  Topological and pretopological analysis of graphs  Graph kernels, etc. * Graph-based methods for applications on social networks  Rumor proliferation  E-reputation  Multiple identity detection  Language dynamics studies  Surveillance systems, etc. * Graph-based methods for NLP and Semantic Web  Representation learning methods for knowledge graphs (i.e., knowledge graph embedding)  Using graphs-based methods to populate ontologies using textual data,  Inducing knowledge of ontologies into NLP applications using graphs,  Merging ontologies with graph-based methods using NLP techniques.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Coleman joined the United States Marine Corps in 1941. During the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, he was a fighter pilot flying dive bombing missions. After the war, he received an aeronautical engineering degree from UCLA. From 1948 to 1950, he oversaw the operation of the now-defunct Del Mar Airport in San Diego, California. He would go on to work in sales and marketing for aviation companies, such as North American Aviation and Fairchild Aircraft. Coleman (left) preparing to enter the Convair XFY Pogo. In 1951, Convair, an airplane manufacturer, was one of two companies contracted by the U.S. Navy to construct and test a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) fighter. Convair created the tail-sitter XFY Pogo. Coleman, a Marine reservist and Convair employee, was chosen to be its test pilot when it was ready in 1954. Although the Pogo's liftoffs and transitions went smoothly, Coleman and other pilots had difficulty landing it, which had to be done visually from the cockpit. The Pogo project would prove to be unwieldy and was discontinued.Test & Research Pilots, Flight Test Engineers: James F. 'Skeets' Coleman 1918- About the project, Coleman stated, \\"It was a developmental power plant, it was a developmental airplane, a developmental concept. It's pretty hard to tie all of those together without having a lot of risk\\". For being the first pilot to successfully maneuver a VTOL fighter, Coleman was awarded the Harmon Trophy in 1954. Coleman resigned from Convair, it was announced on 3 April 1956.Associated Press, \\"First of Pogo Stick Pilots Resigns Post\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 4 April 1956, Volume LXII, Number 186, page 20.

Baelz & Sohn GmbH & Co. is a family-owned company located in Heilbronn with a tradition of more than 100 years. One of its focuses is on saving energy and simplifying steam and hot-water installations. The company headquarters is in Heilbronn. Subsidiaries are located in larger towns in Germany as well as in Vienna, Paris, and Beijing. History W. Baelz was founded in Düren by Wilhelm Bälz in 1896 and is still today under direction of the family. Before establishing the company, Wilhelm Bälz had manually produced products of copper for domestic and industrial needs in the workshop of a retail store. He founded the company W. Baelz in Düren. Wilhelm Bälz moved to Heilbronn in 1914 with his part of the company. In the first decades, the company specialized in planning and constructing steam installations for the manufacturing industry. As a result, in addition to copper production of iron and steel was added. Due to the aftermath of World War II, Wilhelm Bälz was obliged to abandon almost all businesses of the company. During the air attack on Heilbronn on December 4, 1944, the company buildings on the Koepffstrasse were totally destroyed. After the end of World War II, business was slowly restarted and the destroyed buildings were gradually raised again. With the aid of Wilhelm's son, Helmut Bälz, the company developed heat exchangers and electrically and pneumatically operated valves mainly for steam and thermal oil applications, developing the closed steam/condensate circuit back then. Among other products and technologies, the vertical heat exchanger in combination with the closed steam/condensate circuit was conceived by Baelz and patented. In the early 1960s, the ejector with a controllable nozzle and actuator was developed and introduced in HVAC plants. Baelz has continued to file numerous patents on elements of ejector technology and on their specific applications in installations. In the 1970s, Baelz received several commendations from the government of the German state Baden-Württemberg for ejector technology as a product of special economic value. In 1978, the Baelz FoundationBeuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin: Baelz-Stiftung from 9. October 2009 was established in order to sponsor engineering education at universities in Germany in the field of practical control engineering, especially of building technology.

The school was founded in 1893 as University Military School, and in 1988 it combined with Julius T Wright School for Girls (founded 1956) to form UMS-Wright Preparatory School. UMS-Wright is the oldest private school in the state of Alabama. History  = University Military School = UMS-Wright Preparatory opened as University Military School on October 2, 1893, at 559 Conti Street. The school's founder and first headmaster was Dr. Julius T. Wright (1871–1931). The school’s opening day coincided with the 1893 Cheniere Caminada hurricane. The school had a single teacher and twenty-five pupils at a tuition of $8 a month. Dr. Wright served as the headmaster of the school until his death in 1931. William Pape took over after Dr. Wright. Pape died in 1943 and his family turned control of the school over to a nonprofit corporation, the UMS Alumni and Parents Association, Inc. UMS moved the school to its current location on North Mobile Street in 1956 to accommodate the growing number of students. = Girls Preparatory School = Thirty years after the opening of University Military School (an all male school) Julius T Wright opened Girls Preparatory School in 1923 to provide a similar education to the young women of the Mobile community. It only lasted eight years as it closed after the death of Dr. Wright in 1931. = Julius T Wright School for Girls = Julius T Wright School for Girls opened in 1956 at the same location as Girls Preparatory School at 1315 Dauphin Street, which had been newly renovated. It came after a long campaign by alumni of the original Girls Preparatory School to have a female equivalent to University Military School. The school moved to 1400 S University Blvd in 1972. It remained there until its merger with University Military School in 1988. = UMS-Wright Preparatory School = In 1988, University Military School and Julius T Wright School for Girls followed the trend of many other single-gender schools around the country and combined to form the co-educational UMS-Wright Preparatory School. Dr. Tony Havard, a member of the UMS English faculty, was named the headmaster and is now the current president of the school. Description  = Structure = The school has a three-level structure: the Lower School (K-3 through 4th grade), the Middle school (5th grade through 8th grade), and the Upper School (9th grade through 12th grade). = Campus = Located on Campus are five Lower School buildings, two middle school buildings, and one high school building. All three have separate offices and principals. The campus also houses two full-size gymnasiums, a weight training facility, and an athletic training facility.
