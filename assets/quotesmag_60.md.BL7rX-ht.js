He is believed to have been a royal guard dog who lived in the Sixth Dynasty (2345‚Äì2181 BC), and received an elaborate ceremonial burial in the Giza Necropolis at the behest of a pharaoh whose name is unknown. An inscribed stone listing the gifts donated by the pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw's funeral was discovered by Egyptologist George A. Reisner in October 1935. It was apparently part of the spoil material incorporated into the structure of a Sixth Dynasty mastaba (pharaonic-era tomb) after the demolition of the funerary chapel belonging to Abuwtiyuw's owner, where the stone likely had originally been installed. The white limestone tablet measures 54.2√ó28.2√ó23.2 cm (21.3√ó11.1√ó9.1 in). The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated by vertical lines. Abuwtiyuw appears to have been a sighthound, a lightly built hunting dog similar to a greyhound, with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was discovered is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops). Background Statue of Anubis Herodotus documents that in ancient Persia dogs were protected animals, held in the highest esteem during their lifetime. According to the ancient Greeks, dogs in ancient Egypt were treated with the same respect as they were in Persia, and were commonly mummified after death before being buried in family tombs. The ancient Egyptians and others of the Near East believed that dogs were spiritual beings, similar to humans, and they were \\"often associated with particular deities and the powers they wield\\". A number of the early dynastic royal burial grounds contain the graves of dogs, along with women and servants of the royal household. Ashkelon cemetery in the Southern District of Israel is perhaps the best-documented dog cemetery in the ancient world, but dog mummies have been unearthed en masse in sites across Egypt including Rhoda in Upper Egypt, Thebes, Abydos, and near Maghagha. The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from cats and gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds. Typically, many animal species were consumed as meat after death, but it is highly unlikely that dogs would have been eaten. Radiographs of exhumed dogs in the ancient world have revealed that the mummification process involved wrapping the embalmed bones together with bandages and placing them within a wooden statue of Anubis, the jackal-headed deity associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion. Discovery The only source from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone inscription tablet that may have come from the funerary chapel of the dog's owner. The tablet was apparently among spolia used to build another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty mastaba, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later. The find was recorded by the main expedition photographer, Mohammedani Ibrahim, who took more than 9,321 large-format glass-plate images on Reisner's expeditions. The tablet is now held by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (inventory number JE 67573). Neither the dog's grave nor mummy have been recovered. The tomb in which the tablet was unearthed is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops). The white limestone tablet measures 54.2√ó28.2√ó23.2 cm (21.3√ó11.1√ó9.1 in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of a leash is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner. The text of the inscription translated by Reisner describes the gifts offered by the pharaoh in tribute at Abuwtiyuw's funeral: Interpretation Image of a Tesem dog from the grave of Intef II, c. 2065 BC Although it was common to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour normally reserved for upper-class humans. The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, in the belief that the Ka of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial. Although no images of Abuwtiyuw have been found, the text characterizes him as ·πØzm (Tesem), a lightly built hunting dog similar to a greyhound, with erect ears and a curly tail. The Tesem dog features in predynastic depictions, making it one of the oldest known breeds of dog, and images of it are common throughout Ancient Egyptian history. According to Reisner, the name \\"Abuwtiyuw\\" is not fully translatable, but he surmised that Íú•bw (\\"abuw\\") is an onomatopoeic representation of a dog's bark, as this component often is found in Ancient Egyptian dog names. Edward C. Martin Jr. claims that the name means \\"With Pointed Ears\\", which would fit the description of the Tesem.

The motorcycle to the left with the 'M' plate is a rally marshal A competitor takes a hairpin bend around Gourette Competitors gather at the start in Pau having been awarded their starting numbers. The Rallye des Pyr√©n√©es, also known as the Circuit des Pyr√©n√©es and formerly as the Pau-San Sebasti√°n Rally,Johnny's French Lettres (Bike 9/81) p. 40‚Äì44 was a two-day international motorcycle competition in late June set in the Pyrenees mountains of France and Spain, consisting of about of timed trials and hill-climbs.Mountain Excitement (Bike 9/83) p. 78‚Äì81 The competition, started in 1951 by the Union Motorcycliste Paloise,Beyond Racer Road: Circuit des Pyrenees (Cycle 11/74) p. 73‚Äì77,90, 92‚Äì93 attracted a high proportion of competitors from European police and military units.

(Motor Cycle Sport 9/78) p. 347‚Äì348, 352 Description The route initially took in the Spanish Pyrenees and French Pyrenees from Pau in the South of France to San Sebasti√°n in Northern Spain. However, by 1978 due to concerns of the Spanish police, and the French police's own security concerns in the Basque region,Circuit des Pyrenees (Motor Cycle Sport 5/83) p. 223 the competition was instead held exclusively in France. The competition route in 1981 for instance consisted of a loop to the south-east of Pau on one day and a loop to the north-west of that city the following day. The motorcycles had to be street legal and, except for six special timed sections, the competitors shared the route, consisting mainly of narrow winding rough mountain roads, with the public and kept to the legal speed limits. Prizes were awarded for winners according to the motorcycle engine size (125 cc, 175 cc, 250 cc, 350 cc, 500 cc, 750 cc and over) with special prizes for sidecar combinations, teams and individual special merit with categories for institutional and civilian entrants. The French part of the route starting and finishing in Pau (where the motorcycles would take part in a formal procession beforehand) would take in the mountain passes of Ferri√®res, Arb√©ost, Aubisque, Soulor and Gourette whilst the Spanish side, when run, took in Jaizkibel and Oyarzun. Less mountainous venues would include the Foret D'Issaux, L' Hopital D'Orion, and Bois Du Bager.Licensed Lunacy (Motor Cycle Sport 9/81) p. 451‚Äì452, 495 Competitors were allowed to navigate the route for familiarisation prior to the actual competition itself. End of the Rallye des Pyr√©n√©es The competition was strongly associated with the organisation, engineering skills and hospitality of Roland and Ginette Roussel of the Union Motorcycliste Paloise, and with their retirement and the withdrawal of long-time sponsor, French oil company Elf, by the end of the 1980s, the competition was no longer viable and closed. In 1974 and 1975, a British government Central Office of Information film called Pattern of People, designed to promote British industry, was set at the Circuit des Pyr√©n√©es.

They are typically unguided weapons and are a threat to armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft (especially helicopters), and field fortifications. Generally, MANPATS fall into three distinct categories. The first consist of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead operated by a single soldier. The second is a firing system onto/into which a rocket is loaded, operated by a single soldier. The third are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use. Modern MANPATS have their roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive shaped charge.Shaped Charge The development of practical rocketry provided a means of delivering such an explosive. Research occasioned by World War II produced such weapons as the German Panzerfaust followed by the American bazooka which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, fortifications and buildings. Anti-tank rifles Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr 13.2x92mm anti-tank rifle at the Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e in Paris. Arguably, the first MANPATS could be Anti-tank rifles developed during World War I. An anti-tank rifle is a rifle designed to penetrate the armour of vehicles, particularly tanks. The usefulness of rifles for this purpose ran from the introduction of tanks in World War I and until the Korean War. While medium and heavy tank armour became too thick to be penetrated by rigid projectiles from rifles that could be carried by a single soldier, anti-tank rifles continued to be used against other targets. Anti-materiel rifles of today, such as the Barrett M82, are a development of the Second World War technology. Although no longer capable of penetrating even the side armour of the main battle tanks, they are capable of causing serious damage to their external fittings such as periscopes and machine guns, and in disabling or even destroying less well armoured and support vehicles, helicopters, low-flying UAVs and personnel. Bazooka M20 Super-Bazooka (mislabeled as \\"SAM-7 shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile\\") in Batey ha-Osef Museum, Tel-Aviv, Israel. Bazooka is the common name for a man-portable, tube launched, recoilless rocket antitank weapon, widely fielded by the United States Army. Also referred to as the \\"Stovepipe\\", the innovative bazooka was amongst the first generation of rocket propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid rocket motor for propulsion, it allowed for high- explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The Bazooka also fired a HESH, effective against buildings and tank armour. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a \\"bazooka\\" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns. Rocket-propelled grenade An RPG-7 with warhead A rocket-propelled grenade (often abbreviated RPG) is a shoulder-fired, anti-tank weapon system that fires rockets equipped with an explosive warhead. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable, while others are single-use. RPGs, with the exception of self-contained versions, are loaded from the muzzle. RPGs are very effective against armored vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers (APCs). The Soviet RPG-7 is the most widely distributed and used RPG in the world.Rocket Propelled Grenades about.com Its basic design was developed by the Soviets shortly after World War II in the form of the RPG-2, which did not itself use rockets ‚Äì RPG is the Russian abbreviation for Ruchnoy Protivotankovy Granatomyot, which translates as \\"hand-held antitank grenade launcher\\". Recoilless rifles US Special Forces soldier fires a Carl Gustav recoilless rifle during a training exercise conducted in Basrah, Iraq A recoilless rifle (RR) or recoilless gun is a type of lightweight artillery system or man-portable launcher that is designed to eject some form of countermass, such as propellant gas, from the rear of the weapon at the moment of firing, creating forward thrust that counteracts most of the weapon's recoil. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are recoilless rifles. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles.Julio S.. Las Armas Modernas de Infanter√≠a, Abril de 1953 Though similar in appearance to a rocket launcher, a recoilless weapon fires shells that use conventional gun propellant. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle is initially launched using conventional explosive propellant rather than a rocket motor. While there are rocket-assisted rounds for recoilless launchers, they are still ejected from the barrel by the detonation of an initial explosive propelling charge. Anti-tank missile Baktar-Shikan Man portable Anti tank Guided Weapon An anti-tank missile (ATM), anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), anti- tank guided weapon (ATGW) or anti-armor guided weapon is a guided missile primarily designed to hit and destroy heavily armored military vehicles. ATGMs range in size from shoulder-launched weapons, which can be transported by a single soldier, to larger tripod-mounted weapons, which require a squad or team to transport and fire, to vehicle and aircraft mounted missile systems. The introduction of smaller, man-portable ATGMs, such as the Dragon and Javelin, with larger warheads to the modern battlefield has given infantry the ability to defeat light and medium tanks at great ranges, though main battle tanks using composite and reactive armors have proven to be resistant to smaller ATGMs. is tested against ATGMs.British tank sustains damage overseas. Earlier infantry anti-tank weapons, such as anti-tank rifles, anti-tank missiles and magnetic anti-tank mines, had limited armor-penetration abilities and/or required a soldier to approach the target closely.

Life He was the son of Rev. Frederick Ramsey (1790‚Äì1879) and Sarah (Van Schaick) Ramsey (1799‚Äì1892). On March 17, 1835, he married Sarah S. Boyce, a granddaughter of Assemblyman John Rice, and they had two sons. Ramsey studied law in the office of Assemblyman Jedediah Miller, was admitted to the bar in 1840, and practiced in Lawyersville. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Schoharie County, 2nd District) in 1855; and of the New York State Senate (14th D.) in 1856 and 1857. While in the Senate, Ramsey secured a law to finance the construction of the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad by authorizing the towns along the line to subscribe to the stock of the company, and he was chosen Vice President of the railroad in 1858. Litigation ensued, but the New York Court of Appeals upheld the law. In 1859, the Legislature authorized the State to help the railroad with $200,000 but the law was vetoed by Gov. Edwin D. Morgan. He was again a member of the State Senate (13th D.) from 1860 to 1863, sitting in the 83rd, 84th, 85th and 86th New York State Legislatures. He introduced three more bills to grant State funds for the completion of the railroad which also were all vetoed by Gov. Morgan. Finally, a bill appropriating $500,000 passed the Legislature and was signed by Gov. Horatio Seymour in 1863, and Ramsey was chosen President of the railroad. In 1868, Gov. Reuben E. Fenton allowed another $250,000 of State funds to complete the construction, and the railroad began operating the completed line from Albany to Binghamton in 1869. Shortly afterwards Ramsey opposed the hostile take-over of the railroad by Jay Gould and James Fisk, and the next year the railroad was leased to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.

Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) is a suite of instruments on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. The SAM instrument suite will analyze organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples. Overview of the SAM instrument suite It was developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Laboratoire des Atmosph√®res Milieux Observations Spatiales (LATMOS) associated to the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Syst√®mes Atmosph√©riques (LISA) (jointly operated by France's Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Parisian universities), and Honeybee Robotics, along with many additional external partners. Instruments The SAM suite The SAM suite consists of three instruments: #The quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) detects gases sampled from the atmosphere or those released from solid samples by heating. #The gas chromatograph (GC) is used to separate out individual gases from a complex mixture into molecular components. The resulting gas flow is analyzed in the mass spectrometer with a mass range of 2‚Äì535 Daltons. #The tunable laser spectrometer (TLS) performs precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin. Subsystems The SAM also has three subsystems: the 'chemical separation and processing laboratory', for enrichment and derivatization of the organic molecules of the sample; the sample manipulation system (SMS) for transporting powder delivered from the MSL drill to a SAM inlet and into one of 74 sample cups. The SMS then moves the sample to the SAM oven to release gases by heating to up to 1000 ¬∞C; and the pump subsystem to purge the separators and analysers. The Space Physics Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan built the main power supply, command and data handling unit, valve and heater controller, filament/bias controller, and high voltage module. The uncooled infrared detectors were developed and provided by the Polish company VIGO System. Timeline * 9 November 2012: A pinch of fine sand and dust became the first solid Martian sample deposited into the SAM. The sample came from the patch of windblown material called Rocknest, which had provided a sample previously for mineralogical analysis by CheMin instrument. *3 December 2012: NASA reported SAM had detected water molecules, chlorine and sulphur. Hints of organic compounds couldn't be ruled out as contamination from Curiosity itself, however. * 16 December 2014: NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a \\"tenfold spike\\", likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Sample measurements taken \\"a dozen times over 20 months\\" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging \\"7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere.\\" Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level. In addition, high levels of organic chemicals, particularly chlorobenzene, were detected in powder drilled from one of the rocks, named \\"Cumberland\\", analyzed by the Curiosity rover. * 24 March 2015: NASA reported the first detection of nitrogen released after heating surface sediments on the planet Mars. The nitrogen in nitrate is in a \\"fixed\\" state, meaning that it is in an oxidized form that can be used by living organisms. The discovery supports the notion that ancient Mars may have been habitable for life. * 4 April 2015: NASA reported studies, based on measurements by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Curiosity rover, of the Martian atmosphere using xenon and argon isotopes. Results provided support for a \\"vigorous\\" loss of atmosphere early in the history of Mars and were consistent with an atmospheric signature found in bits of atmosphere captured in some Martian meteorites found on Earth.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on August 1, 2012. The episode was written by Dan Vebber and directed by Stephen Sandoval. Plot Professor Farnsworth takes the Planet Express crew to Germany for Oktoberfest. Fry is disappointed to discover that the celebration has become much more refined since the 20th century, and he gets intoxicated and performs \\"The Chicken Dance\\", embarrassing his fellow workers, particularly Leela, who breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Bender discovers that Elzar is there, ready to win the sausage-making challenge using pork that has been aged over 3000 years. Bender is determined to win the event, and takes a despondent Fry with him in the Planet Express ship to look for woolly mammoths frozen in a nearby glacier within Neander Valley, believing that meat aged over 30,000 years should certainly win. Bender is successful at finding a woolly mammoth, and with Fry's help, proceeds to grind the woolly mammoth into sausages. Bender is unaware when Fry appears to fall into the grinder. Later, as the rest of the crew tastes Bender's sausages, they find traces of Fry's hair and clothing, and assume he has been killed and made into sausage meat. Leela is so upset that she decides to have all of her memories of Fry removed from her explicit memory. The Planet Express crew do their best to avoid mentioning Fry to Leela after this process. A flashback shows that Fry had managed to pull himself out of the shredder in time, losing his clothes and some hair in the process. He then falls down a deep pit, hits his head, and is partially frozen. Fry is soon discovered by a lost society of Neanderthal cavemen and other prehistoric animals that have lived within the glacier for more than 30,000 years. These Neanderthals were long ago driven into exile by the then emerging Homo sapiens. The fall, having given Fry both amnesia and an enlarged Neanderthal- like brow, leaves him unaware of his past, and he joins the tribe. He and Leela see certain objects that remind them both of each other, though they still cannot remember who the other is. Fry soon convinces the Neanderthals to return to the surface through a hole found in the ice. At Oktoberfest, Bender is dissatisfied that his mammoth sausage only won third place. Fry leads the Neanderthals out of the pit, and they attack the attendees of Oktoberfest with woolly mammoths, a woolly rhinoceros, and a Megatherium (which moves slowly towards Hermes). Bender uses the chaos of the attack to secretly dispose of the chefs that won first and second place, so that he can be the first-place winner. Zapp Brannigan tries to attack from his ship only for the Neanderthals to catapult a saber-toothed cat into the ship, causing it to crash. The battle culminates with Fry and Leela having a face-off on the deck of the Planet Express Ship. The pair, still lacking memories of each other, nevertheless make peace with each other and embrace in a kiss. The two warring sides are inspired by this act of affection and decide to end the conflict before Fry and Leela's memories are fully restored. A new and much-less-refined Oktoberfest celebration is restarted and the episode ends as Fry sits back while Leela performs the \\"Chicken Dance\\", allowing her to embarrass him for a change.

He was involved with numerous Polish Catholic parishes during his lifetime including the now closed troubled Parish of Saints Peter and Paul in Duluth, Minnesota and the parish of Holy Cross in Minneapolis. Biography He was born in the Kaszubian village of Borzyszkowy, near Bytow. He was the first of ten children born to Franciszek and Maryanna Darzyn Cieminski, who emigrated from Prussian Poland (Kashubia) to the United States in 1881 aboard the paddle steamer Grimsby, which made him a participant in the Kashubian diaspora. The humble peasant boy's fifty-one years as a Roman Catholic priest would take him from the post of archdiocesan Secretary to the rectory of a Polish colony on the Minnesota frontier, and from Minneapolis troubleshooter to respected patriarch of Winona's Kaszubian Polish community.

The strong-minded Archbishop Ireland was no admirer of Eastern Europeans, or of Poles in particular. But Father Cieminski's talents were soon needed elsewhere. His first parish assignment transferred him to Saint Stanislaus Kostka in the newly established Diocese of Winona, where he served as assistant to the pastor, Father Jakub W.J. Pacholski. The fact that Archbishop Ireland dispatched his secretary out of the diocese to work alongside the extremely capable Father Pacholski suggests that the disturbances at Saint Stanislaus were more substantial than the available information would indicate. =Wilno, Minnesota= Father Cieminski's next assignment, in Wilno, Minnesota, returned him to the Archdiocese of Saint Paul. The Polish colony in Wilno had been established in 1883 under the auspices of the Archdiocese and the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. It represented an attempt to steer underemployed Polish-American urbanites into the Archdiocese of Saint Paul's wide-open western spaces; a recent article by John Radzilowski treats Wilno as an exemplar of Polish-American farm life. Radzilowski also chronicles Archbishop Ireland's ham-fisted attempt to control Wilno's Saint John Cantius Parish by replacing a popular Polish-speaking priest with an unfortunate Bohemian priest who (due solely to his ethnicity) was run out of the parish in some time.John Radzilowski, \\"Out on the Wind: Life in Minnesota's Polish Farming Communities\\" From 1896 to 1902, Father Jan Andrzejewski had labored to build for St. John Cantius what Father Waclaw Kruszka describes as \\"a new, spacious, and magnificent temple,\\"Father Waclaw Kruszka, \\"A History of The Poles In America\\" (English translation) volume 4, p. 122. only to depart just before the building's consecration in a confrontation (according to the 1983 Parish Jubilee Book) over the church organ. Arriving in 1902, Father Cieminski brought the parish back into line despite the fact that Father Andrezejewski remained in Wilno for quite some time. In 1906, Father Cieminski also engaged the School Sisters of Saint Francis from Rochester (otherwise known as the Rochester Franciscans) to staff Saint John Cantius's elementary school. In 1907 Father Cieminski was recalled by the Diocese of Winona as pastor of Saint Casimir's Church in Wells, Minnesota; his three years in the little Faribault County town appear to have been free of any major troubles. =Duluth= In 1910, Father Cieminski transferred to Duluth, Minnesota, to serve as pastor to the troubled parish of Saints Peter and Paul (now closed). Duluth's second Polish Catholic church had become a battleground between the Diocese of Duluth and a group of \\"independent\\" parishioners determined to bring it into the Polish National Catholic Church.Acta et Dicta of the Saint Paul Catholic History Society (1917 vol. 2, page 262) Already a group of \\"independents\\" had seceded from Duluth's first Polish Catholic church, Saint Mary Star of the Sea, resulting in the 1907 foundation of Saint Josephat's Polish National Church. The legal battle over Saints Peter and Paul had been won, but Father Cieminski had to spend the next five years putting the parish of Saints Peter and Paul back in order. =Minneapolis= 1915 saw Father Cieminski moving to another trouble spot, the parish of Holy Cross in Minneapolis, founded in 1886 by his mentor and friend, Father Pacholski. Holy Cross had been in turmoil for several years, due to a scandal which possibly involved its longtime pastor, Father Henryk Jazdzewski. Sensing an opportunity, a faction of \\"independents\\" had already broken away from Holy Cross and founded Sacred Heart Polish National Church. Another such faction had arisen and was trying to take over Holy Cross itself. Msgr. Cieminski, circa 1945. Courtesy, Polish Museum, Winona MNOn March 4, 1916, Father Cieminski's task became further complicated when Father Jazdzewski was shot and killed in the rectory of Saint Casimir's Parish in Minneapolis by a former Holy Cross parishioner.History of the Church of Saint Casimir Again, Father Cieminski successfully healed a congregation and brought it safely back into the fold. =Winona= In 1932, Father Cieminski, now aged 65, replaced the late Father Pacholski as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka in Winona. For the first time in his career as a priest, Father Cieminski had the enviable task of building upon an already rock solid foundation. Having succeeded in the most difficult positions that three separate Minnesota dioceses could find for him, he had no difficulty following in Father Pacholski's giant footsteps. Instead, he went on to become a beloved pastor and a respected figure in the Winona community, no doubt helped by the fact that he was Kashubian born and Winona raised, serving in the \\"Kashubian Capital of America.\\" In 1943, his exemplary efforts were rewarded when Pope Pius XII raised him to the rank of Monsignor. In 1946, his retirement after fifty-one years in the priesthood was celebrated with an outpouring of gratitude of respect from his parishioners, his fellow priests, and the Winona community. Father Joseph F. Cieminski died in a Saint James, Minnesota, retirement facility on November 19, 1959. Over his ninety-two years he had experienced - and taken an integral part in - dramatic changes for both the Roman Catholic Church in Minnesota and the Kashubian community of the Upper Mississippi Valley. He lies buried in Winona, among other members of the Cieminski family, in Saint Mary's Cemetery.

The campaign features the fictional Dr. Rich Mahogany, described by Adam Newman in the New York Times as ‚Äúan affable, mustachioed, middle-aged man whose personality might be described as Dr. Phil meets Ron Burgundy, Will Ferrell‚Äôs fictional anchorman.‚Äù Man Therapy was created by Cactus, a Denver-based ad agency, in conjunction with the Carson J Spencer Foundation and the Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. About the campaign The purpose of the Man Therapy campaign is to provide men approaching crisis, and their loved ones, a place to go and learn more about men's mental health, examine their own and consider a wide array of actions that will put them on the path to treatment and recovery. The message is that all men should be aware of their mental health, treat it like they would a broken leg and strive to get better. Man Therapy is built around the fictional Man Therapist, Dr. Rich Mahogany. He's a man's man who is dedicated to cutting through the denial with a fresh approach using his rapier wit, odd sense of humor, no BS approach and practical, useful advice for men. There exists an age-old stigma that says mental health disorders are unmanly signs of weakness. Dr. Rich Mahogany and Man Therapy, is dedicated to smashing that. The centerpiece of the campaign is the ManTherapy.org website, where men and their loved ones will find they have a virtual appointment with Dr. Mahogany. He greets visitors, makes them feel at ease and then provides an overview of what they will find and explore during their visit. From there, visitors can navigate through Dr. Mahogany's office where they can find useful information about men's mental health including guy's guide to Gentlemental Health. Men can also choose to take an 18-question quiz to evaluate their own mental health, access resources and explore a wide range of actions from accessing do-it-yourself tips, seeking therapy referral sources, links to local support groups and organizations as well as a crisis line. The integrated communications campaign also includes a 30-second TV PSA, viral videos, social media, outdoor boards and outreach materials such as posters, coasters and Dr. Mahogany's business card. History In 2006, as a part of their partnership with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Cactus was introduced to Jarrod Hindman, Director of the Office of Suicide Prevention (OSP). He was running an underfunded program to address the critically important issue of suicide in Colorado. Cactus agreed to do some pro bono work for the program. Through that process the agency learned a great deal about this issue and was introduced to the Carson J Spencer Foundation (CJSF), a local non-profit dedicated to suicide prevention. CJSF was founded in 2005 after its namesake, Carson Spencer, a 34-year-old Denver businessman, died by suicide following a difficult battle with bipolar disorder. Together, the three ‚Äì‚Äì Cactus, OSP and CJSF ‚Äì‚Äì formed a partnership to try to reach working aged men who were potentially high risk for suicide and unlikely to seek help on their own. With a $25,000 contribution from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and $5,000 allocated from a larger Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Prevention grant, Cactus developed a comprehensive public education plan while conducting some very insightful and thrifty research studies. Fortunately, the Office of Suicide Prevention landed some untapped state dollars for a one-time, $400,000 campaign. Cactus competed for the contract in a competitive, state-bid process and was awarded the contract in 2009. However, a week after the contract was signed, we were informed that due to state budget cuts the entire grant and contract was cancelled. We were once again left with nothing but a really great plan and zero budget to implement it. Not to be deterred, the partnership forged ahead to launch this vital campaign. Serendipitously, Cactus heard that the Anschutz Foundation was looking to invest in a suicide prevention program. Cactus jumped on the opportunity and submitted a grant proposal on behalf of a private/public/non-profit partnership between Cactus, Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Carson J Spencer Foundation. Additionally, Cactus was awarded a grant from The Anschutz Foundation to develop a campaign while establishing a sustainable effort in Colorado and beyond. Results Man Therapy has received numerous awards for its innovative approach to mental health, including the Gold Addy Award for Public Service: Digital Advertising and Advertising Age awarded Man Therapy the Pro Bono Campaign of the Year. In addition, Man Therapy was recognized by the Safe States Alliance as the 2013 Innovative Initiative of the Year. An Australian version of Man Therapy launched in May, 2013 in partnership with beyondblue.

The undercroft is built with sandstone with a stone-ribbed vault for added security and strength. It is a Grade I listed building.  History  The area of Bayley Lane that the building was located in was occupied by wealthy merchants in the late medieval period. Following the earlier levelling of Coventry Castle, the area would have been undeveloped. Bayley Lane likely emerged as a route through the former castle bailey or outer court. The status of the area grew after the establishment of St Mary's Guildhall, followed by the construction of Drapers Hall. The property belonged to the Benedictine Priory and the earliest-known tenant was Robert Allesley, a girdler.  Undercroft  Looking towards the window in the north wall of the undercroft. The cellar of 38‚Äì39 Bayley Lane is much smaller than the similar undercroft beneath St Mary's Guildhall, further along Bayley Lane which is used as a restaurant. The undercroft consists of two square bays making a rectangular room (just over ). There are two separate entrances, one by which the cellar is entered from Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in the west and another, which is blocked after a few steps, in the east. There are niches in the northern and southern walls which were used to store valuable goods. The local topography allowed the cellar to be lit on the northern side with a window.

It has 206 bedrooms, some of which offer views of Big Ben.  History  233x233pxThe County Hall was designed by Ralph Knott in 1909 and work on the building began in 1912. In 1922 County Hall was officially opened by King George V and Queen Mary as the headquarters of the local government in London. The entire complex of seven buildings was completed in 1932 and the northern section of the building was built in 1933. The premises continued to expand, and became under control by the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1965. By the 1980s, the Labour controlled GLC was in conflict with the British Conservative Government. Since the Parliament buildings were just across the river from County Hall, the latter sported a large banner recording the total number of unemployed in London. Subsequently, the GLC was abolished by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in 1986. The London County Council (LCC) was established in 1889 by elected members of each London Borough in order to control public services within each borough. They focused on issues such as education, roads, city planning and council housing. For 64 years, County Hall served as the headquarters for local governments in London. Following the end of the GLC, the county hall sat vacant. It was purchased by the Shirayama Shokusan Corporation in 1993 and converted into a hotel in 1998.  Building  The building is constructed of Portland Stone from the Isle of Wight, and its foundation is a plinth composed of Cornish granite. The oak covered walls are nearly 100 years old and are marked by the English Heritage Foundation. The bronze doors that decorate the entrance were made by Crittals, with enrichments modelled by George Alexander. The plaque on the right side of the entrance commemorates the official opening by King George V in 1922. On the left is displayed a bronze relief of Ralph Knott, designed by Gilbert Bayes and unveiled in 1932. The sculptures of the four pavilions at the far end of County Hall were produced by A. F. Hardman. Visible at the cornice level are eleven coats of arms representing London Boroughs. This was completed in 1933 and overseen by E. Stone Collins after Ralph Knott's death. The County Hall building is six stories high and has seven miles of corridors. Deluxe Room at the London Marriott County Hall  Hotel Rooms and Designs  London Marriott Hotel County Hall was officially opened by Mr. J.W Marriott Jr, Chairman and president of Marriott International Inc. on 23 September 1998. The current owner of County Hall is Japanese company, Shirayama Shokusan Ltd. The hotel currently has 206 bedrooms, 12 meeting rooms, The Library, Gillray's Steakhouse & Bar & the Club at County Hall including a 25m indoor swimming pool located on the 6th floor. All the meeting rooms in the hotel have been created from offices dating back to 1922. All of the Hotel meeting rooms are named after distinguished individuals with significance to County Hall's history. The King George V & Queen Mary Room is named after the Royal couple who laid the foundation stone to County Hall in 1912 and also officially declared County Hall open in 1922. William Wordsworth Room is named after a major English Romantic poet. He penned his immortal sonnet on the Westminster Bridge in 1805. Four of the meeting rooms are named after Council leaders and chairmen: Francis Anderson (1922-1923), Herbert Morrison (1939-1940), Lady Nathan(1947-1948) and Horace Cutler (1977-1981) who was the pre-war leader of the old London County Council and also the most formidable figure since Herbert Morrison. The Noes Lobby has 2 fireplaces of Black Belgian Marble on each side. The walls are panelled with polished Indian laurel wood. It is illuminated from both a skylight and several lamps above the main chamber . The Council Chamber of County Hall is preserved right behind glass doors. When a government proposal was outlined, the Council Chamber members would adjourn to the Ayes Lobby if they voted yes. If they voted no, they would stand by the Noes Lobby. This system is still being used in Westminster today. The Council Chamber is under the landlord's demise and is not accessible to the general public. All of the corridors are wallpapered with a bowler hat and brolly design, complementing the pocket watch print curtains, to allude to London's business culture. Every lift lobby in the six-story hotel features a wall decorated with book covers of English publisher Penguin Books, while quirky colourful artworks by local London artists adorn the corridor and guest room walls. The guest rooms all have wallpaper featuring a historic map of London from the era of the building's infancy, as well as mosaic flooring harking back to the best of early 20th century style.  Gillray's Steakhouse & Bar  left Gillray's Steakhouse & Bar is situated on the banks of the River Thames with views of the London Eye, Houses of Parliament & Big Ben. This London-based restaurant is located directly below the London Marriott Hotel and features locally sourced and seasonal produce. They source the majority of their products from within 150 miles of the restaurant using Kent and Essex based farms. Known for bespoke butchering and ageing, Gillray's is proud to work with 8th generation Butchers Darragh and Michael O'Shea. Gillray's butchers select free range organic beef, from both South West Ireland and their own farm in Perthshire, Scotland. The restaurant is named after James Gillray, a well-known English caricaturist born in Chelsea in 1757. He started out as a letter engraver but later started to draw caricatures and cartoons of current politicians causing him to be reviled by the political establishment of his time. He became loved by the public due to his amazing caricatures and two of his prints can be spotted in Gillray's today. 208x208px Jamie Welch joined Gillray's as an Executive Chef in 2016.

Life He graduated M.A. at the University of Salamanca in 1457. He was professor of theology there from 1463. A follower of Alonso el Madrigal (el Tostado), from 1476 he defended theses on indulgences and confession resembling those of John Wyclif and Jan Hus, and anticipating issues from the Protestant Reformation. Among his pupils was Antonio de Nebrija. The views of Martinez encountered opposition, particularly from Juan L√≥pez de Salamanca. In 1478, as the Spanish Inquisition was being instituted, the Inquisition of Saragossa passed judgement, Martinez was summoned in 1479 before Alfonso Carillo de Acu√±a, archbishop of Toledo, and other theologians. His ideas were declared heretical, a judgement backed by a papal bull of Pope Sixtus IV. After his views were condemned, the book De confessione, written by Martinez on the occasion of the plenary indulgence of 1475, was burned; and he submitted. Martinez died at Alba de Tormes in April 1480. Works In Martinez Thomism was combined with Renaissance humanism; he opposed the philosophical style of nominalism. He wrote commentaries on ethics and metaphysics. Martinez, through also his follower Diego de Deza, reformed the Salamanca syllabus to include Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, and influenced teaching at Seville. * Ricardo Garc√≠a Villoslada - Bernardino Llorca, Historia de la Iglesia Cat√≥lica, vol.

The congregation dates back to the 1830s. This building is their fifth, built from 1912‚Äì21. Architectural scholars consider this to be one of the best of its type in the state. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1985. History The First United Methodist Church is the oldest religious congregation in Jasper. It was formed on June 14, 1833 when the first log church, formerly a community school, was deeded to the congregation. This building was used until they built a new frame structure at the current site circa 1858‚Äì59. The congregation went through two additional buildings before building the current church. The congregation established a building fund for a new structure in 1912. Construction started sometime afterwards. Lycurgus Breckenridge Musgrove was a major source of funding. A local banker and businessman, he donated two dollars for every one dollar raised by other means. He also donated the marble used in construction and the pipe organ. The construction was interrupted by World War I, but resumed afterward. The new building was dedicated on November 3, 1921. A tornado struck the building on April 3, 1974, causing extensive damage to the cupola and roof. It also ripped the main sanctuary doors apart, damaged or destroyed 34 of the 38 stained glass windows, and caused water damage in the interior. The damage was repaired from 1975‚Äì76. Destroyed stained glass windows were restored with sympathetically-designed modern replacements. Architecture Architectural historians with the Alabama Historical Commission consider the building to be \\"among Alabama's most outstanding examples of Beaux-Arts neoclassicism as interpreted for an ecclesiastical structure.\\" Oddly, for a 20th-century building, the architect is unknown. Some scholars have suggested William Leslie Welton, a leading Birmingham architect of the period. It is also possible that it was adapted from designs in the Methodist publication Catalog of Plans of Down to Date Twentieth Century Churches, published in 1912. It closely resembles plans 58 and 59 by George Kramer, an architect in New York City. Another possibility is that the design was largely by the church pastor at that time, the Reverend William Winfield Scott. The interior, view of the sanctuary with its stained glass dome. The building is masonry, faced with Georgia marble. The two-story building is rectangular, set atop a raised basement. With the building situated on a corner lot, the principal facades are on the north and east sides. The projecting porticoes on the principal facades are hexastyle with monolithic columns. The Ionic column capitals are a type used by Vincenzo Scamozzi. An off-center pavilion on the south side of the building contains the choir. The porticoes on the two principal facades are flanked by large arched stained glass windows. A shallow hipped roof of terracotta tiles covers the building, surmounted by an octagonal cupola. The primary space in the interior of the church is the sanctuary. It is a large square auditorium. Panelled pilasters and other elaborate woodwork in Honduran mahogany encircles the two-story room. A circular diameter art glass dome, high, provides illumination in the room. It is made up of 109 sections and contains 30,000 individual pieces of glass. It is lighted from above by electric light bulbs.

March 8, 1932) were brothers who put up armed resistance against the communist regime in Czechoslovakia during the period 1951-1953. Their father was the late general Josef Ma≈°√≠n.  The resistance group and its actions  Following World War II, Ma≈°√≠n's sons, who were both born in Prague, attended a high school in Podƒõbrady. After the Communists seized power, they witnessed how some of their family's friends‚Äîopponents of the regime‚Äîwere silenced, vanished without a trace or were sentenced to death in public show trials. For instance Milada Hor√°kov√°, a famous early judicial murder victim, had been a friend of their mother. Both ladies spent time in Nazi Theresienstadt concentration camp during the WWII. The Ma≈°√≠ns shared the idea that the Americans, who had helped to establish the Czechoslovakian state, would soon come and \\"wipe out Communism\\". The radio stations \\"Radio Free Europe\\" (RFE) and \\"Voice Of America\\" (VOA) seemed to promise an imminent invasion. Therefore, they formed a military resistance group with a few friends. The Ma≈°√≠n brothers' uncle Ctibor Nov√°k, a former Secret Service Officer, became an adviser of the group. One source says that Novak had actually put up with the fact of Communist rule and was satisfied if the Communists didn't bother him. He engaged in the group mainly because he hoped he could control his hot-tempered nephews and prevent them from doing the most dangerous actions. But that was just his defense strategy when he was on trial in 1954. Indeed, he was very supportive and encouraged the brothers' actions. The brothers and Novak were the only ones in the whole \\"no-name group\\" who knew all other members by name. The following actions of the group are documented: In 1951 the group raided two police stations in order to get weapons and ammunition. In both cases one policeman was killed (one of them previously chloroformed and handcuffed). Since it was becoming increasingly difficult to conduct actions, the brothers decided to go West. Their goal was to get some real training in partisan warfare techniques from the Americans. They believed a shooting war was imminent, and they wanted to return to Czechoslovakia in the vanguard of the \\"liberating\\" western armies. A first escape attempt failed when a CIC agent who was supposed to accompany them was arrested by the Czechoslovak Secret Service StB. During interrogation, he named Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n. Shortly thereafter, both brothers and Nov√°k were arrested by the StB and were tortured. The StB never found out that they had seized the men responsible for the police station raids. Josef Ma≈°√≠n and his uncle were released after a few months. Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n was sentenced to two years of slave labor for knowing about someone else's planned escape but failing to denounce them, and was sent to work in a uranium mine near J√°chymov, noted for its high death rate. Ma≈°√≠n states that his time in the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Gulag made him even more determined to fight the regime. During Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n's imprisonment the others attacked a payroll transport and obtained 846,000 Czechoslovak crowns. One of the car's occupants raised his pistol against Josef Ma≈°√≠n and was shot by him. After Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n's release, the group stole four chests totaling 100 kg of donarit explosives from a quarry. They planned to blow up a uranium train with these explosives, or possibly President Gottwald's personal train. The last action before their escape was the \\"Night of Great Fires\\". In several Moravian villages V√°clav ≈†v√©da and Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n placed incendiary composition with time fuses into straw stacks. They all lit up in the middle of the night. The action was a protest against the Socialist collectivization of agriculture. At that time, even straw was in short supply, so the Ma≈°√≠ns' intention was not only spreading \\"shock and awe\\" but really harming the economy of the agricultural collectives. A firefighter was gunned down. While one source states he died with one bullet in his eye and one in his lungs, most others mention only three casualties in Czechoslovakia which means he must have survived.  Through the curtain  Luckau-Uckro station V√°clav ≈†v√©da Ctibor Nov√°k In October, 1953 the group made a second attempt to escape to the West. Radio Free Europe broadcasts made it sound like World War III was imminent, and the Ma≈°√≠ns and their friends wanted to take part in the invasion. They claimed that the police still had no leads on their actions, therefore the danger of being arrested was not a reason for their escape. In the night from the 3rd to the 4th of October , , Milan Paumer and the Ma≈°√≠n brothers crossed the border to East Germany near Hora Svat√© Kate≈ôiny (Deutschkatharinenberg) in order to get to the western part of Berlin. West Berlin was the last gap in the Iron Curtain. The Berlin Wall had not yet been erected, and numerous streets and footpathes, trams and suburban trains connected the parts of the divided city. The border guards could not manage to check the identity of every passenger. So there was a chance for the five to reach their destination without being discovered, especially because their names and their activities were not yet known to the East German police. After three days of walking through the cold they tried to hijack a car. The attempt failed, but now the police started searching for \\"five armed foreigners\\". The fugitives made another mistake taking a train which they thought would bring them closer to Berlin. But on the train they misunderstood an announcement that the train would go back to where they had started from. The next time they took a train ended in a disaster: the women who sold the tickets informed the police about some \\"suspicious foreigners\\". At Uckro station (today: Luckau-Uckro) the police waited for the train and checked the passengers. When challenged the group started shooting, killing one policeman and injuring two others. The policeman in charge, hit by 6 bullets, quit his job when the head of the East German police (Volkspolizei) held him responsible for the Ma≈°√≠n brothers finally escaping to the West. Shortly after that incident Zbynƒõk Janata, separated from the others, was caught. Only after interrogating him and consulting the Czechoslovak authorities did the East German police know who they were dealing with. Now the biggest manhunt of the Volkspolizei started. After finding and losing the track of the refugees several times, more and more troops were ordered to support the manhunt. East Germany did not have an army at that time. There was only a predecessor of the East German Army, the so-called \\"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\\" (Baracked People's Police). Those troops and eventually even Soviet Red Army troops based in the GDR were asked for assistance. Eventually thousands of people hunted the four anti-Communists. Right after their arrival in West Berlin, western newspapers wrote of \\"20,000 Vopos\\" (Vopo stands for \\"Volkspolizei officer\\"). (1939‚Äì2006), a true crime author and former member of the Volkspolizei states that according to the final report there were only 5,000 policemen involved in the manhunt, plus troops of the Secret Service plus troops of the Red Army. Their number does not appear in the police files. Barbara Ma≈°√≠n assumes that the number of 5,000 was a first attempt by East German officialdom to minimize the manhunt and the scope of the humiliation. Altogether three pursuers were shot by the group. At least three more bystanders died in friendly fire. At Waldow, about from Berlin, the group was encircled. They waited for the night and then managed to run through the encirclement. The next day , hurt by a stray bullet, surrendered and was eventually found by the police. He was executed in Czechoslovakia in 1955. Several times the police were called because of rumours that someone had seen the Czechs. Many of the troops were inexperienced young men who had joined the armed forces only weeks or months before. They did not get any official information from their officers, and therefore rumours spread in which the Czechs were depicted as savages who had killed countless pursuers. Therefore, the troops, whenever assuming the fugitives were near, shot at \\"anything and everything that moved\\" and afterwards wrote into their reports that they had fired at the Czechs but missed. As a result, one can find gun battles at places that the fugitives never passed near in the police files. Moreover, the Ma≈°√≠ns, after arriving in the West, consciously changed some details of their story in order to protect people who had helped them. For instance they claimed they had crossed the autobahn between Berlin and Dresden after the Waldow battle and found refuge with a family in \\"Sch√∂nwalde\\". Though later there were people in Sch√∂nwalde who \\"remembered\\" the Ma≈°√≠ns' visit, several researchers found out that they never made it there: the highway was under permanent surveillance; passing it was simply impossible. On 2 November 1953 the Ma≈°√≠ns and Paumer reached their destination: Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n under the floor of a suburban train, Milan Paumer and Josef Ma≈°√≠n somehow managed to cross the border on foot.  The follow-up  \\"Ray\\" Masin Back in Czechoslovakia, people who had any association with the Ma≈°√≠ns received harsh treatment. V√°clav ≈†v√©da, Zbynƒõk Janata and Ctibor Novak were sentenced to death and executed. Their bodies were not delivered to their families but buried in anonymous common graves. Farewell letters to their families were found 45 years later, only after the Velvet Revolution. Other friends and relatives were sentenced to many years of imprisonment. The Ma≈°√≠ns' mother, Zdena Ma≈°√≠nov√°, who was not involved at all in the military resistance of her sons, died in prison on June 12, 1956. According to the family, their mother received no medical aid, nor were the scandalous conditions of detention improved when she was terminally ill. Even the Ma≈°√≠ns little sister‚Äîher name also Zdena Ma≈°√≠nov√° (born 1933)‚Äîwas jailed. Today she is seen as an icon by the Czech anti-Communist movement. In East Germany, whose armed forces had been humiliated, the manhunt was swept under the rug. In Czechoslovakia, communist propaganda made full use of the Ma≈°√≠n's actions, describing them as looters and brutal murderers of innocent passersby. Their actions were used to justify tight control over the society and brutal treatment of any opponents. The fugitives moved to the United States and served in the U.S. Army Special Forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for five years. Milan Paumer fought in Korea. In the '60s, Josef Ma≈°√≠n Jr. settled down in Cologne, West Germany. The Czechoslovak Security Service StB several times planned to kidnap or kill him. Later he moved to the U.S. again. Both the brothers continued to live there and refused to enter Czech soil again unless they were fully rehabilitated. In 2001, Milan Paumer sold his home in Florida and moved back to Podƒõbrady, where he died in 2010. Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n died in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2011.  Books and documentaries  \\"Joe\\" Masin Various fictional and documentary versions of the Ma≈°√≠n Brothers' story exist. The authors of most cannot be considered neutral. Therefore, an overview of the existing literature shall be given. According to Barbara Ma≈°√≠n, three books on the Ma≈°√≠ns were published in Czechoslovakia. The last one, \\"Mrtv√≠ nemluv√≠\\" (Dead do not talk) was translated into German and published in the GDR in 1989, a few months before the end of Socialism. It was the only book in the GDR mentioning the story at all. Surprisingly, the book does not claim the Ma≈°√≠ns were American spies. Their activities are described as a kind of personal retaliation upon the Communist government by frustrated high-society kids. The book doesn't mention the penalties against the Ma≈°√≠ns' family and friends. Besides the Ma≈°√≠ns had to serve as culprits in one episode of the infamous detective series \\"Major Zeman\\". In contrast to reality, \\"Major Zeman\\" caught them. The Ma≈°√≠ns themselves, after losing the illusion that the West would wage a war to end Communism in Eastern Europe, were reluctant to talk about their past. Eventually another expatriate made them tell their story again: Ota Rambousek (1923‚Äì2010) had been a political prisoner in Czechoslovakia. While many people sat in East European jails accused of being American spies, Rambousek was one of the few who were not innocent: He had indeed been an agent of the US Counter Intelligence Corps. First he was sentenced to death, later his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In jail he heard about the Ma≈°√≠ns In 1968 he was released and moved to the USA. Only in 1984 did Rambousek manage to meet the brothers in New York and wrote his novel \\"Jenom ne strach\\" (Just No Fear). The Czech expatriate publishing house 68 Publishers in Toronto refused to publish the book. Eventually it was published in Prague after the Velvet Revolution. 1987 Radio Free Europe broadcast a series of interviews with Ctirad Ma≈°√≠n by Ota Rambousek. As Eastern archives were not yet open, the book and the interviews were based only on the Ma≈°√≠ns' memories and on what they read about the manhunt in the newspapers after arriving in West Berlin. They contain the \\"Sch√∂nwalde Fake\\" (see above) and wrongly claim the group shot four instead of three Volkspolizei officers: Western press had copied the East German propaganda account which had added one of the friendly fire casualties to the Ma≈°√≠n's victims. In East Germany, Wolfgang Mittmann (1939‚Äì2006), policeman and true crime writer, rediscovered the manhunt in the 90s. He states that he found the names of four killed policemen, killed near the town where he lived, which were not mentioned in the official chronicle of the Volkspolizei. He started interviewing local people and found them reluctant to talk about the \\"Czechs' War\\". As long as the GDR existed, files on the manhunt were top secret. Mittmann went to Prague where he acquired a leaked copy of the RFE interviews, made by employees of Prague Broadcasting Service, studied exhibits of the Prague Police Museum, which included the Czechoslovak police records on the Ma≈°√≠n's police station raids and also viewed the papers of the late author of \\"Mrtv√≠ nemluv√≠\\" (Dead do not talk). Only after the Reunification of Germany‚ÄîMittmann had retired and writing had become his full-time occupation ‚Äîcould he read the German files as well as Rambousek's book. For Mittmann the Ma≈°√≠ns were killers. He accused Rambousek and the Ma≈°√≠ns to consciously play down the actions in the Czechoslovak Republic. Mittmann's critics say, he never questioned the account he found in police files. Also he failed to see the political reasons for the vast number of troops involved in the manhunt. For him this overreaction was due to the ambitions of a single person, Chefinspekteur (Lieutenant General) Willi Seifert, proxy of the head of the Volkspolizei, who wanted to catch the \\"fascist bandits\\", no matter what the cost. After reading Mittmann's report, two German journalists decided to find and interview the Ma≈°√≠ns . Their documentary \\"Der Luckauer Krieg\\" (The Luckau War) met with severe criticism because they \\"displayed murderers as heroes\\". In 2004 the Czech-American writer Jan Nov√°k (not related to Ctibor Novak) wrote a biographical novel on the father's and the sons' stories. Its title: \\"So far so good\\" (Zatim Dobry). It won the coveted Magnesia Litera Prize in the Czech Republic. Although Novak wrote in English, only the Czech Edition is available so far. The Czech film maker Ivan Passer (a former classmate of Josef Ma≈°√≠n and of film director Milo≈° Forman) announced he is going to make a movie based on the book. Eventually, Barbara Ma≈°√≠n, Josef Ma≈°√≠n's daughter spent several years researching to reconstruct the story of her father and uncle. She had spent most of her childhood in Germany before her family moved to the USA. Later she studied Czech and was thus able to read all the relevant documents in Germany, the Czech Republic and the USA. \\"Gauntlet\\", the result of her research was published in September 2006 and has become the most important source for non-Czech speakers.  Controversy  After the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia (1989), the communist era was officially condemned by the new regime, and those sentenced during the communist era for political crimes were generally recognised in law as innocent victims. The Ma≈°√≠ns became the most disputed exceptions. Armed resistance after 1948 was very small (compared to that of neighbouring countries in the Eastern Bloc) and killings were uncommon. Ota Rambousek's book \\"Jenom ne strach\\" (see below) was published in Czechoslovakia in 1990 and realistic descriptions of how the brothers killed a cashier or how they cut the throat of an unarmed policeman rendered incapable by chloroform did not fit well into \\"velvet\\" mood of Czechs. Even fifty-five years later the case of Ma≈°√≠ns is able to deeply divide the Czech public into two groups: one seeing them as heroes, the other abhorring their sometimes brutal killings. Politicians in the Czech Republic face uneasy difficulty when trying to take a clear stand on the Ma≈°√≠ns. In 2005, the Czech and Slovak Association of Canada gave the Thomas Masaryk Award to the Ma≈°√≠n Brothers and Milan Paumer. On 28 February 2008 the Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek awarded the Ma≈°√≠ns with the new \\"Prime Minister's Medal\\" at a ceremony at the Czech Embassy in Washington. At a later ceremony in the Czech Republic on 4 March 2008, he also decorated Milan Paumer. As its name suggests, the award is a personal decoration, not one given in the name of the Czech state. Topol√°nek wishes to start a new discussion on the \\"third resistance\\", as the anti-Communist struggle is sometimes, but controversially termed (the first and second resistance being the fight against the Austro- Hungarian empire in 1914‚Äì1918 and Nazi occupation in 1939‚Äì1945). He hopes that as a result of such discussion the Ma≈°√≠ns will eventually receive official state recognition.

History On 30 June 1972 the Land Development Planning Committee decided that the site of the landslide should be reserved for the construction of an open space to serve as a memorial rather than a school, for which the site had previously been earmarked. The collapsed slope was rebuilt with a gentler gradient and improved drainage infrastructure to ensure stability. The Urban Council originally planned to build a garden along with some recreational facilities on the site, including a badminton and basketball court. But owing to the gentler gradient, the reconstructed slope occupied more space than the previous one that collapsed and the recreational elements of the memorial were dropped in favour of a simpler garden. The park was completed in 1976. A stairway and pathway climbs the slope and links up with Hiu Kwong Street and a rest garden.

The proposition rests upon a no arbitrage argument similar to that of the Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem. Policy implication is that, whenever Wallace neutrality applies, conventional open-market purchases of securities by the central bank won't be an effective monetary policy. History The concept of Wallace neutrality was first introduced by Neil Wallace (Wallace (1981)). However the irrelevance proposition proved by Wallace is restricted to a simple environment, leaving the question open of how broad the class of environments is in which the conclusion holds. A series of similar results, under different environments, were obtained in the 1980s. However, these results remain in contexts where money is not dominated as a rate of return. Sargent and Smith (1987) studied an environment and a structure of restrictions on trades in which government-issued currency is dominated as a rate of return and do conclude that open market operations are irrelevant. Early analysis is often supposed to be of little practical relevance for actual monetary policy because money being dominated as a rate of return by short-term Treasury securities is routinely observed, which invalidates Wallace's result. However, as noted in Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), in the case of open-market operations that are conducted at the zero bound, the liquidity services provided by money balances at the margin have fallen to zero, so that an analysis of the kind proposed by Wallace is still correct. They also applied the Wallace irrelevance proposition to government purchases of long term debt in a representative-household model. C√∫rdia and Woodford (2011) argued that only two assumptions are needed for Wallace neutrality to hold * the assets in question are valued only for their pecuniary returns * all investors can purchase arbitrary quantities of the same assets at the same (market) prices. They also found that the Wallace irrelevance proposition weakly holds under certain relaxed assumptions. There are also recent works which invalidate Wallace irrelevance based on different relaxed assumptions and novel mechanisms. For example, in Andrew Nowobilski's (2012) paper, open market operations powerfully influence economic outcomes due to the introduction of a financial sector engaging in liquidity transformation. In Stefan Homburg's (2015) superneutrality article, open market operations leave real variables unaffected but influence nominal variables in a non-trivial fashion. In a recent paper, Wei Cui and Vincent Sterk (2018) showed that Wallace neutrality does not hold in HANK models with assets with different degrees of liquidity, as the marginal propensity to consume out of liquid wealth is way larger than the marginal propensity to consume out of illiquid wealth.

The Ortiz include Placer Peak, the highest peak in the range at 8,858 feet, Lone Mountain at 7,310 feet, Cedar Mountain at 7,041 feet, Cerro Chato at 6,965 feet, and the foothills known as the Los Lomas de la Bolsa. Geology The Ortiz Mountains are on the east side of the Rio Grande Rift, with the Santa Domingo Basin and Hagan Basin of the rift to their west, with the Sandia uplift to the southwest, and the Espanola Basin and the Estancia Basin to the east. They form part of the watershed boundary between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The Ortiz Mountains are part of the larger Ortiz porphyry belt of Santa Fe County, and consist of late Eocene to early Oligocene intrusive igneous rocks and their sedimentary host rock. Other members of the Ortiz porphyry belt are South Mountain, the San Pedro Mountains and the Cerrillos Hills. These porphyry intrusions were followed by movement on the Tijeras-Canoncito fault and later mid Oligocene (31.4-27.9 ma) intrusions of stocks and dikes with mineralization including both base and precious metals. History Placer mining for gold in the Ortiz Mountains was carried out by the early Spanish using Indian slave labor, but the first significant placer workings began in 1821. The underground Ortiz Mine was opened in 1822. By 1832, several gold-bearing veins had been discovered. The first gold lode mine in the West was in the Ortiz, as well as the first railroad in New Mexico. The gold separation mill was the work of Thomas Edison. But following World War I, mining costs had risen and the low grade ores and relative lack of water resulted in the last mines being closed. In 1973, Consolidated Gold Fields opened an open pit on the Cunningham Hill deposit, the same deposit that the Ortiz Mine had worked. Using the heap and leach method, they extracted approximately 250,000 ounces of gold before closing in 1986. A joint venture of LAC Minerals and Pegasus Gold Corporation did exploratory work beginning in 1989 primarily investigating the Carache Canyon and Lucas Canyon deposits. They did open a new adit into the Carache Canyon deposit, but stopped after 1719 feet due to regulatory issues, lawsuits and a declining gold price. Ecology Precipitation averages twelve inches per year. The lowest elevations are Artemisia shrublands, known as sagebrush steppe, which give way to pi√±on-juniper woodlands at higher elevations. =Ortiz Mountains Educational Preserve= The Ortiz Mountains Educational Preserve (OMEP) opened to the public in 2003. The 1,350-acre reserve was created as settlement of a lawsuit by residents against Lac Minerals. It is owned by Santa Fe County and managed by the Santa Fe Botanical Garden.

Ideal Cement Co., 369 U.S. 134 (1962), is a United States Supreme Court case which vacated a lower appellate court decision, holding that federal courts should abstain from ruling on the constitutionality of a state tax issue that state courts should determine.. Background The United Gas Pipe Line Company operates three interstate natural gas pipelines that connect to a station located in Mobile, Alabama, where the gas is reduced in pressure and is distributed using a system operated by the Mobile Gas Service Corporation. United Gas had contracts to provide gas to two industrial facilities owned by the Ideal Cement Company and the Scott Paper Company, each with clauses that the customer would reimburse United Gas for any taxes it paid for providing gas. The City of Mobile has an ordinance requiring a license to conduct a business for the sale of natural gas within the city involving a payment of 1.5% of gross receipts. United Gas, which is incorporated in Delaware, reimbursed Mobile Gas for the amount it paid to the city for the gas deliveries made to Ideal Cement and Scott Paper, and then filed suit in federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction for recovery of that amount from Ideal Cement and Scott Paper. At issue in the case was whether the city license represented a tax and whether it constituted a precondition to conduct interstate trade in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of United Gas based upon the tax provision of the contracts, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court based upon the constitutional issue. The Supreme Court granted certiorari. Opinion In a per curiam decision, the Supreme Court vacated the opinion of the court of appeals, noting that the Alabama Supreme Court had never provided a construction of the city ordinance. Since the state court was the authoritative forum for interpreting the ordinance and determining whether it was a tax, the Court ruled that adjudication of the federal constitutional issue should wait while the construction of the city ordinance could be sought by the parties in state court. In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas indicated that the ordinance was a tax on intrastate activities and he would reverse the court of appeals decision on that basis. Justice Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion which stated that the interpretation of the city ordinance in state courts would not determine the federal constitutional issue. He stated that he would adjudicate that issue instead now. Analysis Although unstated or cited in the Supreme Court opinion, this case involves an application of the Pullman abstention doctrine from Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941).. That case holds that federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of an ambiguous state statute fairly open to interpretation until courts in that state have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to rule on the proper statutory construction. Pullman abstention applies even when there is no pending state case, which was the situation here in Ideal Cement since there was no active Alabama state court case involving the city ordinance.Pullman, 312 U.S. at 501-02; and The provision of natural gas to the Ideal Cement plant was also the subject of a prior Supreme Court case, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956).. The issue in that case was whether United Gas could increase the contract rate for natural gas to the cement plant by unilaterally filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission. The Supreme Court in that case held that the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) did not authorize the abrogation of contracts, so the new rate schedule could not change the rate for the gas for the cement plant. This case, along with Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956). established the Mobile-Sierra doctrine in U.S. administrative law, which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be \\"just and reasonable\\" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act.

As of 2019, in addition to founding member, lead singer, guitarist and harmonica player Appino, the band consists of Massimiliano \\"Ufo\\" Schiavelli (bass guitar and backing vocals), Karim Qqru (drums and backing vocals), and Francesco \\"Il Maestro\\" Pellegrini (guitar, backing vocals). After releasing the self-produced album About Thieves, Farmers, Tramps and Policemen in 1998 as The Zen, the band changed its name to Zen Circus, a mashup between the titles of the albums Zen Arcade and Metal Circus by American rock band H√ºsker D√º. Their first official album, titled Visited by the Ghost of Blind Willie Lemon Juice Namington IV, was released in 2001 by Iceforeveryone Records. As of 2019, they released eight additional albums, reaching the top ten of the FIMI Albums Chart with Canzoni contro la natura (2014), La terza guerra mondiale (2016) and Il fuoco in una stanza (2018). History In 1994, Andrea Appino (guitar and vocals) and Marcello 'Teschio' Bruzzi (drums) formed a punk rock band. They lived in the Historic Social Center, and it was there that they created a rehearsal room called \\"Black Spot.\\" In 1998, they debuted as The Zen with a self-produced album called About Thieves, Farmers, Tramps and Policemen. This first album resulted in the creation of a personal label, Iceforeveryone Records, through which the band released their second album. Appino was living and performing as a one- man band in the Netherlands, where most copies of the CD were subsequently sold. Appino was forced to return home because of civil service obligations. Teschio's friend convinced him to involve a third collaborator, Massimiliano 'UFO' Schiavelli. The band was the renamed \\"The Zen Circus.\\" A real turning point for the band was winning the regional selection of Arezzo Wave and participating in Arezzo Wave On The Rocks. They bought a camper van, Nello, which accompanied them through Italy. In 2001, they released their first album, Visited by the Ghost of Blind Willie Lemon Juice Namington IV. In 2003, Teschio, left the band and was replaced by a fan of Zen Circus, Karim Qqru. After the arrival of the new member, they released their third album Doctor Seduction in 2004 and thanks to their superlative live performances, the band become one of the paramount names in the Italian rock scene. The album contains the ballad \\"Sweet Me,\\" produced in collaboration with the Rivoli Group, and \\"Sailing Song,\\" often shown in video rotations on music TV. The album was well received by fans and critics and the Doctor Seduction Tour was a success. Other highlights for the year included appearances on TV programs with Pel√π, Modena City Ramblers and Pierpaolo Capovilla. However, the success was marred with financial problems. In 2005, the band published and recorded Vita e opinioni di Nello Scarpellini, gentiluomo in analog, with the first few tracks sung in Italian. After a trip to Paris to record the video of Les poches Sont Les Gens Sont Fous Vides, The Zen Circus Tour departed for Scarpellini in 2005 and 2006. In January 2006, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a mega-concert at Club Metarock in Pisa. Immediately after the celebrations, Appino undertook a four-day mini-tour to present his solo songs. During the tour, Appino shared the stage with the Violent Femmes. After this meeting, Brian Ritchie (bassist for the Violent Femmes) decided to produce their next album, and joined as a fourth member. This collaboration led to Villa Inferno (2008, Unhip), an album that included guest performances by Kim and Kelley Deal (Pixies, Breeders), Jerry Harrison (Modern Lovers, Talking Heads), and Giorgio Canali (CSI, Rossofuoco ). In 2008, Appino appeared in the video promo for Linea 77's \\"The New Italian Music\\". The subsequent tour involved more than 100 gigs in Italy and other parts of Europe and even Australia. In 2009, the band released their sixth album titled Andate tutti affanculo (Unhip / Storm), which contained songs sung entirely in Italian. Andate tutti affanculo was acclaimed as one of the best albums of the year, and appeared on the cover of September's monthly musical The Wild Bunch. The album also took part in the song \\"Nada Blanks\\". Appino, UFOs and Qqru collaborated with the singer Tuscany in the recording of his last solo album [2]. UFO and Qqru also participated in the 2009 project \\"Il paese √® reale\\" designed by Manuel Agnelli of Afterhours, which involved their unreleased track \\"Gente di merda\\" included in the compilation\\" Afterhours presents: \\"The Country is Real (19 artists for a better country?).\\" At the 2010 Italian Independent Music Awards, Zen Circus won the award for \\"Best Tour\\", due to their 110 tour dates. On 2 March 2011, the band loaded a documentary by Annapaola Martin on their YoutTube channel celebrating the 10 years of the Zen Circus. The documentary announced to fans the band's decision to re-release their first four albums. Villa Inferno and Vita e opinioni di Nello Scarpellini, gentiluomo were re-released by La Tempesta Records, while Doctor Seduction and Visited by the Ghost of Blind Willie Lemon Juice Namington IV were re-released by Black Candy Records. On 11 October 2011, the band released the album Nati per subire. After a week, the album rose to number 31 on sales ranking official FIMI. The Zen Circus performed live in Florence on 14 April 2012, during their \\"Busking Tour\\". The Busking Tour ran from 16 March 2012 to 5 May 2012, during which the band played acoustic versions of their songs. On 21 April 2012, the band released Metal Arcade Vol 1, the first of four punk rock EPs.

Family and education Charles Hutchinson was the son of Richard Scholes Hutchinson, a medical doctor from Nottingham and his wife Innes Hadden. In 1880 he married Ellen Soames of London. They had one son, St John Hutchinson who also became a Liberal politician, contesting his father's old seat for the Liberals at both the January and December 1910 general elections.The Times, House of Commons 1910, Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p82The Times, House of Commons 1911, Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p90 Hutchinson was educated at Elstree School, Uppingham and the University of Edinburgh where he got his MD.

Rye could by this time be considered a safe Conservative seat.

Instead, they argued for a \\"clean slate\\" with the old, classical Liberalism giving way to the new ideas of \\"National Efficiency\\" and imperialism.H. C. G. Matthew, The Liberal Imperialists. The Ideas and Politics of a Post-Gladstonian √âlite; Oxford University Press, 1973 =1900 general election= Brookfield, who had been a professional soldier until his retirement in 1880, had been away in South Africa commanding a battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry in the Second Anglo-Boer War. He did not get back to England until 8 October 1900 by which time Hutchinson had been able to start campaigning.The Times, 9 October 1900 p8 Polling took place in Rye on 12 October and despite Brookfield's absence, the general mood of support for the government at time of war (especially given Colonel Brookfield's own participation in the conflict) proved too great a hurdle for Hutchinson. At the last election which had been contested, that of 1892, Brookfield had a majority of 711 votes. This time he turned that into a majority of 2,489, taking 65.1% of the poll to Hutchinson's 34.9%.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p407 =1903 by-election= Three years later however the political situation was transformed. The war was over, the government was unpopular and the 1902 Education Act was proving a disaster for the Tories and a rallying cause to Liberals, especially those in the nonconformist tradition.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 pp12-14 Brookfield resigned from the House of Commons to take up an appointment as HM Consul at Montevideo thus causing a by-election and Hutchinson was again called on by the local Liberal Association to be their candidate. In the changed political climate Hutchinson won a narrow victory at the election held on 17 March 1903, defeating the new Conservative candidate Edward Boyle, a barrister, by 534 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p407 =1906= The 1906 general election was a Liberal landslide, exceeding the most optimistic Liberal hopes.

It is a simplified toy theory based on Yang‚ÄìMills theory that does not describe the real world, but is useful because it can act as a proving ground for approaches for attacking problems in more complex theories. It describes a universe containing boson fields and fermion fields which are related by 4 supersymmetries (this means that swapping boson, fermion and scalar fields in a certain way leaves the predictions of the theory invariant). It is one of the simplest (because it has no free parameters except for the gauge group) and one of the few finite quantum field theories in 4 dimensions. It can be thought of as the most symmetric field theory that does not involve gravity. Lagrangian The Lagrangian for the theory is : L = \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\frac{1}{2g^2}F_{\\\\mu u}F^{\\\\mu u}+\\\\frac{\\\\theta_I}{8\\\\pi^2}F_{\\\\mu u}\\\\bar{F}^{\\\\mu u}- i \\\\overline{\\\\lambda}^a\\\\overline{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu D_\\\\mu \\\\lambda_a -D_\\\\mu X^i D^\\\\mu X^i +g C^{ab}_i \\\\lambda_a[X^i,\\\\lambda_b] + g \\\\overline{C}_{iab}\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}^a[X^i,\\\\overline{\\\\lambda}^b]+\\\\frac{g^2}{2}[X^i,X^j]^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where F^k_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial_\\\\mu A^k_ u-\\\\partial_ u A^k_\\\\mu+f^{klm}A^l_\\\\mu A^m_ u and indices i,j = 1, ..., 6 as well as a, b = 1, ..., 4. f represents the structure constants of the particular gauge group. C_i^{ab} represents the structure constants of the R-symmetry group SU(4), which rotates the 4 supersymmetries. As a consequence of the nonrenormalization theorems, this supersymmetric field theory is in fact a superconformal field theory. Ten-dimensional Lagrangian The above Lagrangian can be found by beginning with the simpler ten-dimensional Lagrangian : L = \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{g^2} F_{IJ} F^{IJ} - i \\\\bar{\\\\lambda} \\\\Gamma^I D_I \\\\lambda \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where I and J are now run from 0 through 9 and \\\\Gamma^I are the 32 by 32 gamma matrices ( 32=2^{10/2} ), followed by adding the term with \\\\theta_I which is a topological term. The components A_i of the gauge field for i = 4 to 9 become scalars upon eliminating the extra dimensions. This also gives an interpretation of the SO(6) R-symmetry as rotations in the extra compact dimensions. By compactification on a T6, all the supercharges are preserved, giving N = 4 in the 4-dimensional theory. A Type IIB string theory interpretation of the theory is the worldvolume theory of a stack of D3-branes. S-duality The coupling constants \\\\theta_I and g naturally pair together in the form: : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2\\\\pi}+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi i}{g^2}. The theory has symmetries that shift \\\\tau by integers. The S-duality conjecture says there is also a symmetry which sends : \\\\tau \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{-1}{n_G\\\\tau} as well as switching the group G to its Langlands dual group. AdS/CFT correspondence This theory is important also in the context of the holographic principle. There is a duality between Type IIB string theory on AdS5 √ó S5 space (a product of 5-dimensional AdS space with a 5-dimensional sphere) and N = 4 super Yang‚ÄìMills on the 4-dimensional boundary of AdS5. However, this particular realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence is not a realistic model of gravity, since gravity in our universe is 4-dimensional. Despite this, the AdS/CFT correspondence is the most successful realization of the holographic principle, a speculative idea about quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft, who was expanding on work on black hole thermodynamics, and was improved and promoted in the context of string theory by Leonard Susskind. Integrability  There is evidence that N = 4 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory has an integrable structure in the planar large N limit.Martin Ammon, Johanna Erdmenger, Gauge/Gravity Duality: Foundations and Applications, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 240. As the number of colors (also denoted N) goes to infinity, the amplitudes scale like N^{2-2g}, so that only the genus 0 (planar graph) contribution survives. Planar Yang‚ÄìMills theory is a theory with a very large (infinite) number of colors. A planar limit is a limit in which scattering amplitudes are dominated by Feynman diagrams which can be given the structure of planar graphs.planar limit in nLab Beisert et al. give a review article demonstrating how in this situation local operators can be expressed via certain states in \\"spin\\" chains, but based on a larger Lie superalgebras rather than SU(2) for ordinary spin. These are amenable to Bethe ansatz techniques. They also construct an action of the associated Yangian on scattering amplitudes. Nima Arkani-Hamed et al. have also researched this subject. Using twistor theory, they find a description (the amplituhedron formalism) in terms of the positive Grassmannian. Relation to 11-dimensional M-theory N = 4 super Yang‚ÄìMills can be derived from a simpler 10-dimensional theory, and yet supergravity and M-theory exist in 11 dimensions. The connection is that if the gauge group U(N) of SYM becomes infinite as N\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty it becomes equivalent to an 11-dimensional theory known as matrix theory.

It is on the corner of Niddry Street and the Cowgate, about south of the Royal Mile. The hall dates from 1763 and was the first purpose-built concert hall in Scotland. It is a Category A listed building. The hall belongs to the University of Edinburgh, and houses part of the university's collection of musical instruments, including the Russell Collection and the collections of Rodger Mirrey and Anne Macaulay. It is used for a classical chamber music concerts and, during summer, as a venue of the Edinburgh International Festival. History The distinctive elliptical Sypert Concert Room St Cecilia's Hall was originally commissioned by the Edinburgh Musical Society (EMS) and designed by the Scottish architect Robert Mylne, who also designed Blackfriars Bridge in London. The EMS was founded in 1728, and for its first 35 years its members met in the upper hall of St Mary‚Äôs Chapel, a small church that formerly stood to the north of the present hall. In December 1763, after completion of Mylne's new hall, the EMS held an inaugural concert in honour of Saint Cecilia, patron saint of musicians. St Cecilia's was the first purpose-built concert hall in Scotland when it was completed in 1763, not far behind the first in Europe, the Holywell Music Room in Oxford, built in 1748. Mylne designed the building with an oval concert hall on the first floor level with a rehearsal room on the ground floor. Originally, the main entrance opened out to a small courtyard off Niddry‚Äôs Wynd, and a portico was added to the entrance around 1787. In 1785 the City of Edinburgh commenced a major civil engineering project ‚Äî the construction of South Bridge, a road bridge above the Cowgate to link the Old Town to the University in the south of the city, which was completed in 1787. The new bridge resulted in the loss of several ancient closes, including Niddry‚Äôs Wynd; St Cecilia's Hall lost its original entrance courtyard. With South Bridge and its high tenement buildings looming over St Cecilia‚Äôs, the Cowgate became a dark and undesirable location for Edinburgh's concert-goers, who by now were flocking to the newly built Assembly Rooms in the more fashionable New Town on the other side of the city. Audiences at St Cecilia‚Äôs Hall dwindled and eventually the EMS discontinued performances; the last EMS concert was held in 1798. By 1801, the EMS had quietly disbanded and sold the hall to a Baptist congregation. The building was later used as a Freemasons' lodge, a warehouse, a school (headed by Andrew Bell), and as Magdalene Cairns's Excelsior Ballroom. It was purchased by the University of Edinburgh in 1959. Architecture The exterior is in plain Neoclassical style, with ashlar facing. On the upper floor is the Sypert Concert Room, an elliptical room with a moulded plaster cornice, and a domed ceiling topped with a central elliptical cupola. William Adam (1738‚Äì1822) visited the hall and wrote to his brother John Adam that he had found it \\"ugly and squat\\". In 1966, the University commissioned the architect Ian Lindsay to reconstruct the interior of the concert hall. He built a new eastern elevation and made a new entrance to the hall. In 2016, St Cecilia's Hall underwent a ¬£6.5m restoration and renovation in order to improve the concert hall and museum facilities. The project was partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, as part of its work to support historical buildings of cultural importance. It re-opened to the public in 2017. Music museum As well as a concert venue, St Cecilia's Hall houses a musical instrument museum. It is one of two branches of the university's collection of historic musical instruments, and displays items from the Rodger Mirrey and Russell Collections of early keyboard instruments, as well as the Anne Macaulay Collection of plucked string instruments. The museum holds more than 400 instruments and has an active programme of conservation and restoration. The collections include harpsichords, virginals, spinets, organs, fortepianos, harps, lutes, citterns and guitars. In 1967, a chamber organ built by John Snetzler for the Earl of Normanton in about 1750 was bought for the hall. It was installed in the Sypert Concert Room by the Nottinghamshire organ builder firm Goetze and Gwynn. Immediately after installation, the mechanism was damaged by dry air and was rendered unplayable until it was restored in 2017.

Spanning the River Liffey and joining Marlborough Street to Hawkins Street, it is used solely by public transport, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. It is 26 metres wide and 48 metres long, and is a single span, smooth concrete structure, with the underside of the bridge designed to be as high above the water as possible so that river traffic is not impeded. It was built to carry the extended Luas Green line, and was budgeted at ‚Ç¨15 million. It is named for trade unionist Rosie Hackett. Use The bridge carries the Luas Green line, which connects via an extension with the Luas Red line, and opened in December 2017. The bridge is also used by other public transport services, including Dublin Bus routes 14, 15, 27, 27x, 33x, 33d, 142 and 151, certain Bus √âireann services, taxis, bicycles and motorbikes. Planning and construction The bridge was proposed by Dublin City Council to carry the southbound line of the Luas Green line, to allow for the reorganisation of certain Dublin Bus routes, and to ease congestion by providing additional capacity for buses and taxis crossing the Liffey. Commentators argued that, being just 90 metres downstream from the very wide O'Connell Bridge, the new bridge could not bring much benefit, and any benefit would be cancelled out by the negative impact on the city's classical Georgian urban plan - especially to the symmetry of spacing between existing Liffey bridges. Ultimately, following an environmental impact assessment and Bord Plean√°la approval in 2009, the project was approved without any changes to the planned location. Roughan and O'Donovan Consulting Engineers and Sean Harrington Architects were appointed by Dublin City Council to design and plan the bridge, and Graham Construction (who also constructed the Samuel Beckett Bridge) were awarded the construction contract. Preparatory works commenced in late 2011, with bridge construction beginning in early 2012. The bridge was officially opened on 20 May 2014, with Luas services officially commencing on 9 December 2017. Name In its planning and construction phases, the bridge was designated by the working name of The Marlborough Street Public Transport Priority Bridge. Dublin City Council invited nominations from the public for the bridge's final name. Ten nominations were referred to the council's naming committee, which used a Borda count to shortlist five names for a plenary meeting of the council, where another Borda count on 2 September 2013 chose to name it after Rosie Hackett, a trade unionist and republican revolutionary. Hackett had been nominated by three women members of Labour Youth. The other four shortlisted were Willie Bermingham, Frank Duff, Kathleen Mills, and Bram Stoker. The De Borda Institute asserted that the name selection process was the first time an Irish elected chamber used a non-majoritarian decision-making methodology. Some media reports characterised it as the first Liffey bridge named after a woman, though other bridges used to be.

He specialized in the longest track distances, 5000 and 10,000 metres, as well as cross-country running and from around 1960 the marathon, in which he also competed at that year's Olympic Games. On the track he became national champion in two events in 1959, with an additional four titles taken outside the track. He was later a national team coach in swimming. Career Torgersen was born in Drammen. During his career, he represented the clubs IF Torodd, Sarpsborg IL and IK Tjalve. His personal best times were 8:11.0 in the 3000 metres (1959), 14:13.8 in the 5000 metres (1959), the former Norwegian record 29:30.8 in the 10,000 metres (1959) and 2:27:30 hours in the maraton (1960). In middle distance races he had 3:56.6 in the 1500 metres (1958) and 4:19.8 in the mile run (1955). Internationally he placed eleventh in the 10,000 metres at the 1958 European Championships and 26th in the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. On the track he became Norwegian champion in the 5000 metres in 1959 ahead of Reidar Andreassen and P√•l Benum. He also won silver medals in 1956, 1958 and 1960 and a bronze in 1955. In 1959 he also won the national 10,000 metres title. He broke a Trondheim dominance of more than decade, with Martin Stokken, √òistein Saksvik and Ernst Larsen having won all titles but one since 1947. In this event, Torgersen also won a national silver medal in 1957. Torgersen also overcame Saksvik's Norwegian record in the 10,000 metres, set in 1955, when he in July 1959 at Bislett stadion ran the distance in 29:30.8 minutes. The record stood until 1964, when it was beaten by Thor Helland. Aged 31 years and 3 months when he set the record, Torgersen is still the oldest ever 10,000 metre record setter in Norway. Torgersen with IK Tjalve sat a new Norwegian club record in the 4 √ó 1500 metres relay in 1958, but it was broken by IL i BUL's team three months later. Torgersen also broke the Norwegian record in the one-hour run in 1960, but this was an intermediate time in a longer distance race, and since Torgersen did not finish that race the intermediate time was not sanctioned as a record. On the road, Torgersen became national marathon champion in the Olympic season 1960; his only medal in the event. He won one title in the cross-country forest course, in 1957, and took bronze medals in 1956 and 1958. In 1957 and 1959 he won the 8 kilometre cross-country championship, with a silver in 1960, and in the 3 kilometre cross-country championship he took bronze medals in 1958, 1959 and 1960. He also won the road relay Holmenkollstafetten with IK Tjalve.Aftenposten, 12 May 1958, p.12 Torgersen was a teacher and coach in Larvik, and has been credited for discovering the talent of middle-distance runner Lars Martin Kaupang. He was also a Norwegian national team coach in swimming until 1981, when he was hired in the Danish swimming club AGF Aarhus. Here he coached Olympic medallist Susanne Nielsson.

Based on the \\"New Tech model\\"http://www.newtechnetwork.org which originated in Napa, California, Kent Innovation uses project (and problem) based learning to encourage inquiry and inspire creativity. In 2012‚Äì2013, Kent Innovation added approximately another 100 freshmen and 4 facilitators. This pattern will continue through 2014‚Äì2015 when the school reaches the maximum of around 400 students, 9‚Äì12. Students describe the environment as a \\"family\\" and that there is very little bullying. Kent ISD and their Superintendents have opened an exciting New Tech High School, Kent Innovation High, that is very different from traditional high schools. With a focus on project-based learning and collaboration with both students and teachers, Kent Innovation High will demonstrate some of the best thinking in the country about teaching and learning. Success for all students is a driving goal of this \\"lab\\" school, which will serve as a learning laboratory for teachers and administrators who want to innovate back in their own schools. The high school's mission is to cultivate a learning environment that will prepare students to enter the professional environments that follow high school. Whether a student is thinking about pursuing higher education or entering the workforce, the school is looking to further assist students beyond the standardized module of education. With the incorporation of Project Based Learning (PBL), students learn and grasp communication, collaboration, authenticity, critique & revision, and reflection.http://www.bie.org The start of project-based learning is to be able to ask a question and allow students to ask for clarification and get a better grasp of the assignment and task. From there, facilitators in the classroom will try to have as much exposure or connection with real-world scenarios and involvement. This gives access for students to bond with their community- whether that consists with something local, or broader. http://www.newtechnetwork.org The school helps to initiate professional work environment atmospheres and mediums, such as group work, presentations, and critical feedback sessions. Kent Innovation also gives experience to students with tangible job offers, internships, and resume building activities. From the glass walls and integrated presence of technology to the ongoing teamwork of students and just-in-time facilitated learning, the physical and cultural environment will be designed to: * Personalize learning for all students * Increase the relevance of academics to foster student engagement * Cultivate the student voice so students will \\"own\\" their education Courses GLOBAL STUDIES Global Studies is an integrated English and Social Studies class focused on world history, literature, culture, religion, and geography from 300 AD to present.

A femto- photograph is equivalent to an optical impulse response of a scene and has also been denoted by terms such as a light-in-flight recording or transient image. Femto-photography of macroscopic objects was first demonstrated using a holographic process in the 1970s by Nils Abramsson at the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden). A research team at the MIT Media Lab led by Ramesh Raskar, together with contributors from the Graphics and Imaging Lab at the Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain, more recently achieved a significant increase in image quality using a streak camera synchronized to a pulsed laser and modified to obtain 2D images instead of just a single scanline. In their publications, Raskar's team claims to be able to capture exposures so short that light only traverses 0.6 mm (corresponding to 2 picoseconds, or 2 seconds) during the exposure period, a figure that is in agreement with the nominal resolution of the Hamamatsu streak camera model C5680,Information from alldatasheet.com on which their experimental setup is based. Recordings taken using the setup have reached significant spread in the mainstream media, including a presentation by Raskar at TEDGlobal 2012. Furthermore, the team was able to demonstrate the reconstruction of unknown objects \\"around corners\\", i.e., outside the line of sight of light source and camera, from femto-photographs. In 2013, researchers at the University of British Columbia demonstrated a computational technique that allows the extraction of transient images from time-of-flight sensor data without the need for ultrafast light sources or detectors. Other uses of the term Prior to the aforementioned work, the term \\"femto-photography\\" had been used for certain proposed procedures in experimental nuclear physics.

Career A successful playwright from 1987 to 1998, Hood wrote the plays Beached, Astronomer's Garden, Sugar Hill Blues, Hammett's Apprentice, and So Special. During this period, Hood delved into television. He wrote episodes of Medics and Grange Hill, a popular school drama for BBC. Later he co-devised the crime drama Silent Witness, writing four episode scripts. Hood also penned the screenplay for the 1998 television film The Echo, a thriller starring Clive Owen, as well as the serial In a Land of Plenty featuring Robert Pugh and Man and Boy with Ioan Gruffudd. In 2004, Ecosse Films hired Hood to aid in the development of a screenplay for Becoming Jane, a 2007 film depicting the early life of Jane Austen. Screenwriter Sarah Williams had completed several drafts at the time of Hood's entry to the project. Robert Bernstein, a producer with Ecosse, believed that Hood's past work contained \\"a romantic sensibility. There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane.\\" Hood agreed to join the production because he believed \\"the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice.\\" He worked on the script with director Julian Jarrold over a two-year period. In 2011, Hood was reported to be attached as the screenwriter for Reykjav√≠k, a drama film about the Cold War. Media sources reported that it was to be directed and produced by Ridley Scott, though they also questioned whether his schedule would fit such a film. The film is set to star Michael Douglas as Ronald Reagan and Christoph Waltz as Mikhail Gorbachev, and was to begin shooting in March 2013.

Incident On the night of 9 April 2008, 121 Burmese workers were transported illegally by fishing boat from Song Island in Myanmar to a landing near Ranong, Thailand. All were illegal migrant workers seeking transport to Phuket, where they planned to seek jobs as day laborers. Each had paid smugglers 6,000 baht (US$190) or 10,000 baht (US$316) for the journey. All 121 people were herded into an airtight seafood refrigeration unit on the back of a truck. It measured 6 metres by 2.2 metres (20 feet by 7 feet), meaning standing room only for the passengers. Thirty minutes into the journey, conditions in the container became stifling. The workers banged on the sides of the container to alert the driver, but he failed to stop and warned everyone to remain quiet so as to avoid alerting the Thai Police as they passed through checkpoints. He turned on the air conditioning, but it failed after a few minutes. When the driver finally stopped on a quiet road running along the Andaman Sea 90 minutes later many, mostly women, had already collapsed. After seeing the bodies, the driver fled. The dead were 36 women, a 8-year-old girl, and 17 men. Aftermath Relatives of those killed received 35,000 baht compensation for each relative who died, Suwanna Suwanjutha, director-general of the Rights and Liberties Protection Department, announced in July 2008. On 28 December 2012 four Thais found guilty of human smuggling were sentenced to between three and ten years imprisonment for their involvement. The four were convicted of gross negligence resulting in death and of breaking immigration laws. The truck owner, Damrong \\"Run\\" Phussadee, of Rungruengsup Ltd, was sentenced to 10 years for his involvement. Jirawat \\"Ko- Chun\\" Sopapanwaraku, who owned Choke Jaroen Pier where the migrants arrived by boat, was jailed for six years. Chalhermchai \\"Joe\\" Waritjanpleng was sentenced to nine years in prison. Ms Panchalee \\"Pueng\\" Chusung's six-year sentence was halved after she confessed. \\"Three of them were granted bail of between US$13,000 [about 400,000 baht] and US$6,500 [about 200,000 baht] while they file appeals\\", the official said, adding that the fourth defendant was held in custody after failing to meet bail terms. The truck driver, Suchon Bunplong, fled the scene, but was later arrested and then confessed to his involvement. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2008, but his confession to trafficking illegal immigrants saw that jail term being halved to six years, Maj Gen Apirak Hongthong, Phuket Police Commander at the time, told the Phuket Gazette in June 2008.

In a racing career lasting from May 1969 until September 1970, the filly ran eleven times and won eight races. As a two-year-old she was rated the best of her age and sex in Britain after winning the Lowther Stakes at York and the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket. In the following season she won five races, all over one mile, including the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. She was retired to stud at the end of that season, but had little chance to make an impact as a broodmare, dying in 1975 at the age of eight. Background Humble Duty was a grey filly bred at the Owenstown Stud at Maynooth in County Kildare, Ireland by Frank Tuthill. Her sire Sovereign Path, from whom she inherited her colour, was a top class miler who won the Lockinge Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Humble Duty's dam, Flattering was placed in the Cheveley Park Stakes and was out of Flatter, a moderate race mare but a half- sister to The Derby runner-up Gay Time. As a yearling, Humble Duty was sent to the Newmarket sales where she was bought for 17,000 guineas by the British Bloodstock Agency, acting on behalf of Jean, Lady Ashcombe, the widow of Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe. Humble Duty was sent into training with Peter Walwyn at his Seven Barrows stable at Lambourn. Racing career =1969: two-year-old season= Humble Duty's first appearance on a racecourse came in May 1969 when she won the Ann Boleyn Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park. Although the winning margin was only a length and the opposition moderate, Humble Duty was immediately moved up in class to contest the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. She led for most of the race before being overtaken a furlong from the finish and took third place behind Farfalla. After a break of two months, during which she was affected by a cough, she returned in the Lowther Stakes at York in August in which she was matched against Mange Tout, a filly who had won the Prix d'Arenberg and the Molecomb Stakes. Humble Duty won by three quarters of a length from Pisces, with Mange Tout in third. Her final appearance of the year came in the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket in October. Humble Duty led from the start and won by two and a half lengths from Farfalla and Black Satin. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to have run in Britain in 1969, Humble Duty was the top-rated filly, seven pounds below the leading colt Nijinsky. She was also made the ante-post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. =1970: three-year-old season= On her first appearance of 1970, Humble Duty ran at Newbury in the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas. She appeared less than fully fit and was given a very gentle race by her jockey Lester Piggott in finishing second to Highest Hopes. In the 1000 Guineas two weeks later, Humble Duty started 3/1 joint-favourite in a field of twelve runners. Ridden by Piggott Humble Duty took the lead inside the final quarter mile and drew well clear of her opponents. She won very easily by seven lengths from Gleam, with Black Satin two lengths further back in third and Highest Hopes unplaced. The winning margin was the widest in the race in the 20th century. Humble Duty was sent to Epsom in June, but bypassed the one and a half mile Oaks, running instead in the Ebbisham Stakes over eight and a half furlongs and winning by four lengths. At Royal Ascot in June, Humble Duty started at odds of 1/6 in the Coronation Stakes and won very easily from Black Satin, who had won the Irish 1000 Guineas since her defeat at Newmarket. Having beaten the best of her own age and sex, the filly was then tried against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in July. Ridden by Duncan Keith, Humble Duty won decisively by three-quarters of a length from Gold Rod, Joshua and Welsh Pageant. In August, Humble Duty added another major victory over Goodwood's mile course when she won the Wills Mile by a length from Prince de Galles (Cambridgeshire Handicap) and Yellow God (runner-up to Nijinsky in the 2000 Guineas). In her final race, Humble Duty failed to reproduce her best form, finishing fourth behind Welsh Pageant, Gold Rod and Prince de Galles in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in September. Retirement Humble Duty's breeding career was brief and disappointing. She produced two known foals, neither of whom proved to be of any use as racehorses. In 1974 she miscarried a foal sired by Mill Reef. Humble Duty died in 1975 at the age of eight. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Humble Duty a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and the forty-seventh best filly trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century. Humble Duty was given a rating of 127 by Timeform in 1970.

The seat of the municipality is the city of Koƒçevje. Today it is part of the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. In terms of area, it is the largest municipality in Slovenia. History In 1247 Berthold, Patriarch of Aquileia granted the area around Ribnica within the imperial March of Carniola to the Carinthian counts of Ortenburg. When the counts received further estates on the wooded plateau down to Kostel on the Kolpa River in 1336 from the hands of Patriarch Bertram, they called for German-speaking settlers from Carinthia and Tyrol. These Germanic people became known as the Gottscheers, and their dialect, Gottscheerish. Thousands of Gottscheers, and others, were accused of sympathy for or collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II (such as the Slovene Home Guard), after the war. They, and typically their entire families, were summarily executed, thrown into various pits and caves, which were then sealed with explosives.

The association with the colors blue and white dates to the 1470s, when Emperor Frederick III approved the design of the coat of arms, along with civic rights, on 19 April 1471. The flag during that time varies from the one seen today. The old flag was a bicolor of blue and white, defaced with the coat of arms, which was also different at the time.

Its Sentinel works number is 6515. It was equipped to work train vacuum brakes and to provide steam heat for passenger trains. Initially, it was based at Swindon and used to work trains on the Malmesbury branch. Later, it worked at Brentford Goods Yard. These trials were not a great success and the locomotive was withdrawn in December 1926 and returned to Sentinel in January 1927. Rebuilding The locomotive was rebuilt by Sentinel with a larger boiler in 1927. It then underwent further trials as follows: * 1927, Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway * 1927, Further trials on the GWR * 1927‚Äì1929, Works shunter for Sentinel at Shrewsbury * 1929, Trial on the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) at Shrewsbury * 1929‚Äì1934, Works shunter for Sentinel at Shrewsbury again * 1934, Sold to Thomas E. Grey Ltd, Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire. Here, it was given the number 2 and the name Isebrook. Withdrawal In 1958, the locomotive was withdrawn. The boiler and parts of the engine were removed and it was used as a brake van. In 1972, it was condemned and was then bought for preservation and moved to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton. Restoration Restoration took seven years and included fitting a reconditioned boiler and engine. The engine was first steamed in preservation on 26 August 1979. In 1981, vacuum brake equipment was refitted for passenger train working. Visits The locomotive has visited other sites since restoration. In May 2001, it moved to Rosemary Vineyards on the Isle of Wight, and then on to the Lavender Line. In June 2008, it returned to Quainton. Since July 2012, it has been working on the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway, where it is expected to stay until September 2012. On 15/16 September 2012 it will make a brief visit to Didcot Railway Centre for the \\"All in a Day's Work\\" steam gala.

The police investigation and criminal trials that followed the murders lasted for more than a decade and resulted in the execution of one man, David Wayne Spence, as well as life prison sentences for two other men allegedly involved in the crime, Anthony and Gilbert Melendez. A fourth suspect, Muneer Mohammad Deeb, was eventually let out after spending several years in prison. Murders On July 13, 1982, two fishermen discovered the bodies of Jill Montgomery, 17, Raylene Rice, 17, and Kenneth Franks, 18, in Speegleville Park, near Lake Waco. Franks' body was found propped against a tree, with sunglasses over his eyes. All three victims had been repeatedly stabbed, and both of the women's throats had been slashed. There was also evidence that the women had been sexually assaulted.Pain echoes 10 years after grisly deaths (Houston Chronicle, July 26, 1992) Investigation The investigation was initially headed by Lieutenant Marvin Horton of the Waco police department, with assistance from Detective Ramon Salinas and Patrolman Mike Nicoletti. Truman Simons, who was with the Waco police department at the time and had been one of the first respondents on the scene of the crime, also assisted the investigation in an informal capacity. Initially, the investigation revealed a number of different possible suspects, including James Russell Bishop and Terry Harper, local residents who had been tied to the area at the time of the crime. However, both men were found to have credible alibis (Harper's was later proven false when Spence's attorneys investigated it), and in September of that year, the investigation began to stall and was marked as \\"suspended.\\" Simons, who had taken a significant personal interest in the case, requested that he be given permission to continue investigating the case, which he was subsequently granted. Within a few days, the first arrest in the case was made. Muneer Mohammad Deeb, the owner of a local gas station, was known to have had a contentious relationship with Kenneth Franks. The two had engaged in verbal confrontations on multiple occasions. Following the murders, he had even commented to two young women that he committed the murders. After one of the women reported this comment to the police, Deeb was quickly arrested and submitted to a polygraph test, which he passed. Subsequently, Deeb was released for lack of evidence. The case languished for nearly a year, until the work of Simons and others had produced enough evidence to again arrest Deeb and three alleged accomplices in the plot. Deeb had had a life insurance policy for one employee at his convenience store who bore a striking resemblance to Jill Montgomery. Simons hypothesized that Deeb had hired David Wayne Spence to murder her, and that Spence and two friends, Anthony and Gilbert Melendez, had seen the victims and mistaken Montgomery for the target. They speculated that the other two victims had been murdered because they were witnesses. Trials Deeb, Spence, and the Melendez brothers were all indicted late in 1983. District Attorney Vic Feazell, whose office had been instrumental in continuing to pursue new evidence in the case, would manage the prosecution against the accused. Spence and both Melendez brothers were, at the time, already serving prison sentences for various crimes. The evidence against the men largely consisted of testimony provided by other inmates, who claimed that the defendants had admitted to their involvement in the killings in private discussions, as well as confessions made by Anthony and Gilbert Melendez. Also considered was the confession Deeb had made to the two young women about his involvement in the killings, as well as the life insurance policy he had taken out for his employee. Bite marks on the victims were also presented as evidence of Spence‚Äôs involvement. The trials began in May, with testimony from dental specialists supplementing the evidence that had been provided by the prison witnesses. In June, Anthony Melendez pleaded guilty to the crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Spence‚Äôs case was badly damaged by Melendez‚Äô confession, which played a key role in his eventual conviction in July 1984. Unlike Melendez, Spence was sentenced to death for his involvement in the killings. In January 1985, Gilbert Melendez also pleaded guilty to the murders, and agreed to testify against Deeb. Like his brother, he received a term of life imprisonment in exchange for this confession. Gilbert Melendez died in prison in 1998 from AIDS-related complications. Anthony Melendez died in prison on January 13, 2017. Deeb, who had continued to protest his innocence, was found guilty of instigating the murders, and on March 14, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. Appeals Both Spence and Deeb continued to maintain their innocence following their convictions, and both men sought appeals in their cases. In 1991, Deeb‚Äôs appeal was granted when the Court of Criminal Appeals ‚Äúruled that the testimony of a jail inmate should not have been allowed‚Äù in his initial trial. Deeb won his new trial in January 1993, and was subsequently released from prison. Those who had been involved in the initial prosecution were stunned. Former McLennan County District Attorney Vic Feazell, who had prosecuted Deeb, stated following the trial, \\"I am perplexed and bewildered, as I'm sure a lot of people are. But in my mind, this doesn't change anything as far as Mr. Deeb's culpability goes.\\" David Wayne Spence‚Äôs appeals were not successful, and in April 1997 he was executed for his role in the killings. Book and film In 1986, true-crime writer Carlton Stowers published his account of the murders and police investigation surrounding the Lake Waco murders, Careless Whispers. The book focused heavily on Truman Simons‚Äô involvement in producing the evidence which led to the convictions. The incident also inspired a made-for-TV adaptation, Sworn to Vengeance, starring Robert Conrad as a fictionalized version of Simons. The film aired on CBS in 1993. Controversy Following the convictions of Spence and Deeb, some began to question the substance of the evidence on which the convictions had been based and the methods through which it had been obtained. Forensic odontologist Homer Campbell was proven to have made false assessments at around the same time, and when a blind panel examined the alleged bite marks and a mold of Spence's teeth, two matched them to a Kansas housewife, and the other three could not match them to anyone's teeth. Three of the seven people who said Spence confessed later stated that Simons had offered them privileges in order to secure their testimony, including one that said he had fed her info on what to say. Spence's lawyers also discovered an alternate suspect in Terry Harper, a local thug with a history of knife-related offenses. Witnesses testified to seeing Harper in the park on the night of the murders, and others claimed that he had boasted of committing the murders. Also, one of the victims, Kenneth Franks, was later alleged to have been an associate of Harper's in the drug trade. When Harper was interviewed by Spence's lawyers, he claimed that he was at home watching Dynasty; records showed that Dynasty did not air that night. Brian Pardo, a wealthy Texas businessman, met Spence a few months prior to his execution and, on becoming convinced of his innocence, launched a campaign to delay his death sentence so that a new trial could be commenced. His efforts were unsuccessful, but they brought attention to the case following Spence‚Äôs execution. Bob Herbert wrote a series of articles for The New York Times in 1997, with headlines such as ‚ÄúThe Wrong Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Impossible Crime,‚Äù in which he claimed that the case had been ‚Äúcobbled [‚Ä¶] together from the fabricated and often preposterous testimony of inmates who were granted all manner of favors in return.‚Äù Further reading Michael Hall, \\"The Murders at the Lake\\", Texas Monthly, April 2014 References External links  Category:History of Waco, Texas Category:Murder in Texas Category:1982 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Texas Category:1982 in Texas Category:July 1982 events in the United States ","title":"1982 Lake Waco murders"},{"id":"36625715","text":"Martino Goretti (born 27 September 1985) is an Italian representative lightweight rower, a current (2019) world champion and a dual Olympian. He has represented at senior World Rowing Championships and World Rowing Cups consistently from 2005 to 2019. He is a four time world champion at the senior level who won three titles in Italian lightweight eights from 2005 to 2009 and then in 2019 won the lightweight single scull world title. He had previously won underage world championships as a junior and an U23. International representative rowing =Early career= Goretti's international representative debut for Italy was in 2003 when he was selected in the coxless four to compete at the 2003 World Junior Rowing Championships in Athens. That crew won gold and a world junior title. The following year he competed in the Italian lightweight coxless four at the U23 World Rowing Championships in Poznan and won silver. In 2005 Goretti broke into the Italian senior lightweight squad. He raced in the lightweight coxless four at the World Rowing Cup II in Munich and then was seated in the Italian lightweight eight when they won gold at the WRC III in Lucerne. He remained in the eight for the 2005 World Rowing Championships in Gifu where the Italian's took the world championship title. At the U23 World Championships in Amsterdam that year he stroked the Italian lightweight U23 coxless four to a bronze medal. Goretti and four other members of the world champion lightweight eight stayed together into 2006. They took gold at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne and then successfully defended their world championship title at the 2006 World Rowing Championships at Eton Dorney. Goretti and the other eligible U23 members of the eight raced as a coxless four at the U23 World Rowing Championships that year in Hazewinkel and won gold as a four. In 2007 Goretti was in the Italian lightweight eight when they took silver at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne but he was not retained in the crew for their bronze-medal winning campaign at the World Championships in Munich. He was selected in the Italian coxless four who finished fifth at the U23 World Championships in Glasgow. Those circumstances repeated in 2008 when Goretti won a gold medal in the Italian lightweight eight at the World Cup III in Poznan but was not selected for the 2008 World Rowing Championships. In 2009 Goretti stroked half of the lightweight eight when they raced as coxless fours at the WRC I in Banyoles and was back in the eight for their silver medal win at WRC III in Lucerne and then continuing to the 2009 World Rowing Championships in Poznan. With Goretti in the four seat the Italian lightweight eight rowed to a gold medal, the third world championship title of Goretti's career. =2010 to present= 2010 saw Goretti secure the stroke seat in the Italian lightweight coxless four as they prepared their long lead up campaign for the 2012 London Olympics where the lightweight 4- would be contested. In 2010 they raced at the World Rowing Cup I in Bled (bronze), the WRC III in Lucerne (bronze), the European Championships (fourth) and at the 2010 World Championships in New Zealand to an overall sixth place finish. He led that same crew throughout 2011 when they won silver at the WRC III, gold at the European Championships, and silver at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled. In the Olympic year of 2012, Italy's lightweight coxless four with Goretti at stroke, found themselves out of top contention. They placed twelfth at the WRC I and seventh at WRC II and then at the London Olympics the Italian lightweight four rowed consistently to that form and finished in overall twelfth place. The Italian lightweights had better luck in the non-Olympic eights event at the 2012 World Rowing Championships in Plovdiv where they took the silver medal with Goretti rowing in the six seat. Goretti rowed on in Italian lightweights sweep crews after the 2012 Olympics. He stroked a lightweight pair to a silver medal at the 2013 World Championships in Chungju and then in 2014 he was back in the coxless four which contested all the European World Rowing Cups, European Championships and the World Championships. At the World Rowing Championships of 2014 and 2015 Italian lightweight coxless fours with Goretti rowing at bow finished respectively twelfth and sixth. Their 2016 campaign in the run down to the 2016 Rio Olympics saw them out of medal contention in two World Rowing Cups but in Rio they showed better form winning their heat and semi-final and holding down third spot at the first two 500m marks of the final only to be rowed down by France and finishing in fourth place and off the medal podium. In 2017 saw Goretti now aged 31, make the switch form sweep-oared to sculling boats. He was selected in the Italian lightweight quad scull which placed fourth at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in Sarasota and then in 2018 he moved into a single scull. He took silver at the European Championships and finished in seventh place at the 2018 World Rowing Championships. In 2019 he timed his World Championships campaign to perfection, taking a silver at the European Championships, taking fifth place at the WRC II and then at the World Championships in Ottensheim Goretti was unbeaten in the three preliminary races and then led in the final from start to finish to win his fourth career world championship title and his first as a single scull boatman. Goretti is well known for his willingness to try new innovations and the 2019 World Championships was no different. Goretti was the first to use the Randall Foil blade design at an international level. The hydrofoil blade design was first introduced by Ian Randall at the 2018 FISA International Coaches Conference, Berlin.

He was forced into exile, and was unable to return to his country until 1991, when he returned to the political fray. After his death he was honored by an official burial. Early career Ndeh Ntumazah was born in Mankon, Bamenda in 1926. He joined the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) in the early 1950s. In 1955 the UPC was banned in the French-controlled Eastern Cameroon. Ntumazah then founded the One Kamerun movement in the British-controlled Southern Cameroons, with himself as president, a disguised version of the UPC. From this temporarily secure base he assisted UPC militants such as Ruben Um Nyob√© and Ernest Ouandi√© who conducted guerrilla warfare in the French-controlled zone. Life in exile The two Cameroons were unified in 1961. In 1962 Ntumazah slipped out of Cameroon and moved to Accra, Ghana. On 6 September 1962 the UPC leadership in exile met in Accra at Ndeh Ntumazah's house, and decided to exclude the \\"criminal clique of Woungly\\" from the administrative secretariat. At ten that evening, when the attendees were about to leave, a bomb exploded without causing any injury. The Ghana authorities were not amused and threw the entire UPC leadership in jail. In October they freed Massaga, Tchaptchet and Ntumazah, but kept Abel Kingu√© in prison. On 13 September 1962 the UPC organized its first Assembl√©e populaire sous maquis in Mungo, where the Revolutionary Committee was named. The committee was presided over by Ernest Ouandi√©. Other members were Abel Kingu√©, Michel Ndoh, Ndongo Diy√©, Osend√© Afana, Nicanor Njiawe and Woungly-Massaga. A two-headed leadership was theoretically in place, with Abel Kingu√© leading the exiles from Ghana and Ernest Ouandi√© in the maquis. The organization functioned poorly due to communication problems and also to the Sino-Soviet split. The next year it split, with Abel Kingu√© and Osend√© Afana allied with Ntumazah and opposed to the other leaders. Ntumazah lived in political exile in Ghana, Guinea and Algeria before settling in the United Kingdom. During his time of exile he continued to try to make the West pay attention to what was going on in Cameroon. Later years With the re-introduction of multi-party democracy in 1991, Ntumazah returned to Cameroon and reentered politics as one of the leaders of the reborn UPC, still a radical. The UPC was divided by internal disagreements during the 1990s. Augustin Fr√©d√©ric Kodock's moderate faction, which was allied to the RDPC, emerged from the intraparty struggles as the dominant faction, although it was opposed by the party's more radical members. In 1996, the UPC split into different factions, one of which was led by Kodock and another by Ndeh Ntumazah. Kodock's faction held a congress at Makak in 1996, at which he was re-elected as Secretary-General. Kodock was also re- elected to the National Assembly from Nyong-et-Kelle constituency in the 1997 parliamentary election Ndeh Ntumazah died in St. Thomas‚Äôs Hospital in London, United Kingdom, on 21 January 2010. President Paul Biya decreed that his body should be brought back to Cameroon and would receive an official burial in Bamenda.

The film stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as recently laid-off salesmen who attempt to compete with much younger and more technically skilled applicants for a job at Google. Rose Byrne, Max Minghella, Aasif Mandvi, Josh Brener, Dylan O'Brien, Tobit Raphael, Tiya Sircar, Josh Gad, and Jessica Szohr also star. The Internship is the second film with Vaughn and Wilson in the lead roles, after the 2005 film Wedding Crashers; the two had also both appeared in the 2004 film Starsky & Hutch. This is also the second collaboration of Levy, Vaughn, and Stern after the 2012 film The Watch, and the third of Levy and Wilson after the first two Night at the Museum films. Released on June 7, 2013, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $93 million worldwide. Plot Salesmen Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell's employer goes out of business, and Billy applies for Google internships on their behalf. They are accepted due to their unorthodox interview answers, despite a lack of relevant experience. They are the only interns not of traditional collegiate age. They will spend the summer competing in teams against other interns in a variety of tasks, and only the members of the winning team will be guaranteed jobs with Google. Billy and Nick are teamed with other interns seen as rejects: Stuart, who is usually engrossed in his smartphone; Yo-Yo, who was home-schooled by his tiger mother; and Neha, an enthusiast of nerd-related kink. The team leader Lyle constantly tries to act hip to hide his insecurities. Another intern, Graham, bullies Billy and Nick's team. Roger Chetty, the head of the internship program, also expresses his doubts about the older men's abilities. Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha see Billy and Nick as useless during a task focused on debugging and send them on a wild-goose chase for the fictional Charles Xavier at Stanford University. But later, during a game of quidditch against Graham's team, Billy rallies his team to a comeback that unifies them as a team, despite ultimately losing after Graham cheats. When the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince the team to indulge in a wild night out. At a strip club, Neha admits to Billy that, despite her rich fantasy life, she has no real world experience and is nervous. With his support, she decides to stay. Nick gets Yo-Yo to break out of his shell by drinking and receiving lap dances. Encouraged by Billy, Lyle approaches one of the dancers, Marielena, who is also a dance instructor at Google on whom he had developed a crush. She is charmed by him, but another customer challenges Lyle for her attention and they fight, getting the team kicked out. Before sunrise, Stuart learns to appreciate his surroundings while overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and Lyle's drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while drunk. They win the task by earning the most downloads. Meanwhile, Nick has been flirting with an executive, Dana, with little success. When he begins attending technical presentations to impress her, he develops an interest in the material. While the teams prepare to staff the technical support hotline, only Billy feels at a loss. A Google employee, \\"Headphones,\\" who always wears headphones and never socializes, approaches Billy and tells him that the way he interacts with people is special. He tutors Billy on the technical information. Dana agrees to go on a date with Nick, and she invites him in at the end of the evening. During the task, Billy is comfortable with the material, but his team receives no score because he failed to properly log his calls for review. Dejected, Billy leaves Google to pursue a new sales opportunity with his former boss. The final task is announced as a sales challenge. Teams must sign the largest possible company to begin advertising with Google. The team is stunned when Nick tells them that Billy has left, and they declare that they do not want to do the task without him. Nick convinces Billy to return, and Billy leads the team to show a local pizzeria owner how Google can help him interact with potential customers and thereby expand his business, while remaining true to his professional values. Chetty is about to announce that Graham's team have won, when Billy, Nick, and their team arrive to give a dynamic presentation about their new client. Chetty recognizes that although the pizzeria is not a large business, its potential is limitless because it is expanding via technology. Graham protests and is dressed down by Headphones, who turns out to be the head of Google Search. Nick and Billy's team win the challenge and the guaranteed jobs. Graham berates his team, who finally reject him. As the students depart, Nick and Dana are still seeing each other, as are Lyle and Marielena. Stuart and Neha have formed a romantic connection as well with Stuart promising to see her in person rather than texting her, and Yo-Yo asserts himself to his mother. Billy and Nick toast their success.

Vaughn came up with the idea after watching a 60 Minutes segment on Google's work culture, and subsequently brought the idea to director Shawn Levy. Google agreed to work with the film producers, with founder Larry Page noting that \\"computer science has a marketing problem.\\" Google also felt it would help further explain their \\"Don't be evil\\" mantra. Although Reuters reported that as part of the deal Google asked for \\"creative control\\", Levy denied the company was involved with the script, insisting that Google only assisted from a \\"technical\\" perspective. CNN reported that the studio did give \\"some control\\" to Google over the depiction of its products. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 169 reviews and an average rating of 4.84/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Internship weighs down Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson's comic charisma with a formulaic script and padded running time that leans far too heavily on its stars' easygoing interplay.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. A majority of the reviewers have derided it for being a feature-length Google commercial. In his review, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe commented: \\"Here‚Äôs why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy\\". Stephen Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote on his review, \\"The Internship itself would be kind of charming, too, if this Google-recruitment film, this 119-minute commercial for Googliness, weren't so downright creepy\\". The Guardians David Cox described the movie as a \\"two-hour corporate video,\\" while British film critic Mark Kermode called the film \\"the longest advert I've seen in the cinema\\". He dismissed it as \\"one of the most witless, humourless, vomit- inducing horribly self-satisfied, smug, unfunny comedies I have ever seen\\"., The Guardian (UK), 1 July 2013. Another critique was that combining Vaughn and Wilson with Google was poorly timed, and that the film would have been much more successful, had it been released on the heels of Vaughn and Wilson's success in 2005's Wedding Crashers. This fact of timing was satirized by a video news story run by The Onion, a satirical newspaper, titled \\"The Internship Poised to be Biggest Comedy of 2005\\".\\"'The Internship' Poised To Be Biggest Comedy Of 2005\\", The Onion, 6 June 2013. Many former Google interns and Google employees noted the accuracy of the company environment depicted in the movie, but also pointed out that the internship process is nothing like that shown in the movie. Home media The Internship was released in \\"Unrated\\" form on DVD and Blu-ray Combo Pack on October 22, 2013.

Before (from the 11th century) the administrative seat of the former Modru≈° County (later renamed Modru≈°-Rijeka County), it is today a ruin in the Josipdol Municipality in the southern part of the Karlovac County. Having been built on a ridge of a steep hill above sea level on the eastern slopes of the Velika Kapela mountain, the castle was at a strategic place overlooking the road that connected the Adriatic Sea and the Pannonian Basin since ancient times. The road in question connected the Roman towns of Senia (present-day Senj) and Siscia (present-day Sisak). It was later, during the 18th century, reconstructed, improved and renamed as Josephina road. History According to the famous Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaiƒá (1849‚Äì1928), a kind of a castle or stronghold most probably existed above Modru≈° already at the beginning of the 9th century, during a war between Borna, Duke of Dalmatian Croatia, and Ljudevit Posavski, Duke of Pannonian Croatia. Almost ideal position, dominating over the surrounding area, made Tr≈æan Castle never to be conquered by anyone in its history, although the town of Modru≈° below the castle was plundered and burned by the Ottomans in 1493, just before the battle of Krbava Field. From 1193 the castle was property of the Knezes (Princes) of Krk, (later, from around 1430, known as the Frankopans), a distinguished Croatian noble family. Bartol II Krƒçki /Bartholomew II of Krk/ was given the whole vast Modru≈° estate, including the castle, by the Croato- Hungarian king Bella II (III) for his merits in the wars he fought. The next more than 350 years Tr≈æan was owned by the Frankopans, not only as one among the many castles in their property, but as the main seat and stronghold of the family in the whole continental part of Croatia. From thence ruled, among others, Ivan V Krƒçki /John V of Krk/ (born before 1343, died 1393) and his son Nikola IV /Nicholas IV/ (born around 1360, died 1432), the most powerful man in Croatia at the beginning of the 15th century, both Bans (Viceroys) of Croatia. They reconstructed and enlarged the old, irregular shaped castle, which was from around 1437 called Tr≈æan or Tr≈æan-grad, because of an increased trade that was going on there (). The walls, bastions and towers were built of hewn stone (ashlar) in the ‚Äûfishbone‚Äú style and represented a kind of masterpiece of the contemporary building skill. There are some signs which indicate that the foreign building masters took part in the works, most probably those from the Republic of Venice. The castle itself consisted of central part with a large guard tower and a palace as residence for members of the princely family with its supporting staff, northern part with outbuildings for economic services, various workshops, warehouses, water tanks and rectangular defending tower, and southern part containing mostly facilities for retail trade, accommodation for traders and travellers etc. Following the walls and bastions of the castle, there were defensive walls, about long, around the town of Modru≈°, descending the slope of the hill. In 1449 a well- known partition of the huge Frankopan estates, spread throughout central and western Croatia, took place, as the eight sons of Nikola IV Frankopan agreed to split and share their father\`s property (legally valid) among themselves. In the course of this, the whole Modru≈° estate belonged to Stjepan III /Stephen III/ (born before 1416, died around 1481‚Äì84); in the sharing inheritance document it was written: ‚Äû...to Stjepan belongs the market town Modru≈° with the Tr≈æan Castrum‚Äú... It was a time of constant and steady rise, a ‚Äûgolden age‚Äú of Modru≈°, that reached its peak in 1460, as the town became a seat of a bishop. Bernardin Frankopan (1453‚Äì1529), the only son of Stjepan III, successfully managed the whole of his property further from the Tr≈æan Castle, although there was increasing threat of the Ottoman raids from the already conquered Bosnian territory, east of Modru≈° County. This led to decrease of importance of Tr≈æan by the end of the 15th century, and the population of the whole area started to move away more and more from its old places of residence to the other, safer parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries, not willing to live in endangered territory. In the first half of the 16th century the castle was always less maintained and repaired than needed, and after 1553 came under control of the military authorities of the Croatian Military Frontier. A relatively small military deployment unit was permanently stationed there. After several unsuccessful attempts to renovate or rebuild the more and more severely damaged parts of the castle during the 17th and 18th century, the military authorities decided in 1791 to abandon it. Following the negligible Ottoman danger at that time, they presumed that it was not necessary to keep soldiers in Tr≈æan and it was left to its own destiny, becoming a badly damaged castle ruin today.

It was also known as the . In 1940, these nations and others stopped selling iron ore, steel and oil to Japan, denying it the raw materials needed to continue its activities in China and French Indochina. In Japan, the government viewed these embargoes as acts of aggression; imported oil made up about 80% of domestic consumption, without which Japan's economy, let alone its military, would grind to a halt. The Japanese media, influenced by military propagandists,Kokushi Daijiten :ja:ÂõΩÂè≤Â§ßËæûÂÖ∏ (Êò≠ÂíåÊôÇ‰ª£) (\\"Historical Dictionary\\"), 1980: \\"It was not an official term, but a term of incitement used by the Japanese media, under the guidance of the military, in order to stir up the Japanese people's sense of crisis...\\" (Cited by Christopher Barnard, 2003, Language, Ideology and Japanese History Textbooks, London & New York, Routledge Curzon, p.85.) began to refer to the embargoes as the \\"ABCD (\\"American-British-Chinese-Dutch\\") encirclement\\" or \\"ABCD line\\". Faced with the possibility of economic collapse and forced withdrawal from its recent conquests, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters began planning for a war with the Western powers in April 1941. This culminated in the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941.  Name  The name ABCD Line is of Japanese origin, having been disseminated by the Japanese government in propaganda and textbooks in the late 1930s. It is an example of Japanese propagandists portraying Japan as the protector of Asia, as in the name of the Japanese Empire's colonial holdings, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This wartime narrative portrayed Japan fighting against Western Colonialists and Chinese Communists primarily, overlooking the primacy of resource rich areas of Asia in Japan's annexing of lands. Japanese historian Sabur≈ç Ienaga writes that a key aspect of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere as propaganda was \\"liberating Asians from American and British imperialism\\".  Political background  Japan in the early 1930s pursued an expansionist foreign policy, starting with the Manchurian Incident in 1931 and continuing with further military actions throughout the decade. In 1937, this broke out into full-scale war between Japan and China when the two nations' armies skirmished near the Marco Polo bridge, eventually leading to a full scale Japanese Army invasion of China. These incidents, especially the Nanking Massacre, were heavily reported in the international media. In the United States, reporting on the Japanese bombing of Chinese cities was particularly negative. This, combined with the general perception of Japanese threats to peace in Asia, contributed to 73% of general public in the United States opposing the export of military supplies to Japan in June 1939. This would result in the United States freezing Japanese assets on July 26, 1941 (alongside England and the Dutch), effectively ending the export of raw materials and petroleum to Japan.  Economic impact  Meetings between the military leadership of Australia, Britain, and the Netherlands in Singapore, in February 1941, only reinforced Japanese fears of an ABCD encirclement. Similar meetings took place between British leadership and Chinese forces actively fighting Japan, with the eventual goal being coordinated military aid. Japan would go on to occupy islands in the South Pacific for oil after invading the Dutch East Indies, sending over 70% of Japanese petroleum workers to rehabilitate facilities destroyed by the retreating colonial powers. Through a combination of exploiting formerly Dutch oil deposits in the East Indies and making synthetic fuel domestically, the Japanese oil production was able to peak, in the first quarter of 1943, at 80% of the oil that had been imported from the \\"ABCD\\" countries in 1940. Japan was never able to fully match pre-embargo petroleum production figures while at war.

It marked the film debut of Fabrizio Bentivoglio. Plot  Renzo Dominici is an accountant for a company in Genoa, apparently lame and in poor health; in reality he is pretending to be in order to be able to carry out a robbery in the company without being recognized, and to disguise himself he uses a wedge in his shoe to limp, a brown wig and brown contact lenses to hide his blue eyes. In the days before the blow, Renzo first comes into contact with Riccardo, a homosexual boy who works in a sauna, and after he has discovered him stealing in his wallet, he falls in love with him and follows him, being able to recognize him by the scent, and later with Stella, the young and attractive maid of the canteen of the company where he works, bored by the m√©nage he entertains with the head of the canteen and with another assistant, who tries to seduce him but is rejected however. Renzo organizes the robbery in all the details, including the escape from Italy, also bribing a port employee to board a transport ship that will sail to Panama. The day when there is a large amount of money in the company, Renzo carries out the robbery with his face covered, stealing the sum of two billion lire from the safe, dropping his sunglasses and uncovering his eyes, which due to their peculiarity become a sort of legend for the media and the bandit has since been called \\"the blue-eyed bandit\\". The police at first groped in the dark, but, due to some unforeseen events, some people who know Renzo begin to suspect him and endanger his cover: during the escape through the dungeons, where Stella is flirting with her lover , he falls a lighter which is picked up by her, and, remembering having seen him in his office when she went to bring him lunch, she reports it to the head of the canteen; together they go to look for clues in his office but are seen by Renzo who from that moment will try to eliminate them: the first will die locked up in the cold room, while the girl will be spared after being stunned. Two other people are aware of his responsibility in the robbery: one of the company's security guards, who identified him thanks to the cufflinks of his shirt that he also wore during the action, who, after having searched his home, claims a part of the loot but Renzo will kill him before going to recover the money. The second is Riccardo who recognized him after seeing him take off his glasses in the sauna, without however reporting it to the police, who stopped him as a suspect, and also attempting, with the help of two accomplices, to steal the stolen goods but Renzo will be able to neutralize them before escaping. The last unexpected event is represented by the mother, hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic and whom he occasionally visits, who seeing the identikit of the bandit in the newspaper, immediately recognizes him as the son in front of the nurse nun, who immediately warns the police. giving the man's name and surname but Renzo, using a secret passage in his house, manages to get away before being captured, managing to board the ship for Panama and, in the last scene, waking up on the deck, receives breakfast by a sailor, rewarding him with a generous tip.

Lissner, S.M.A. (Alsatian: Ignace Francious Lissner, ) (1867‚Äì1948) was a French-born Catholic priest who was instrumental in developing the ministry of the Catholic Church in the United States to the African American population. He established there the missionary society to which he belonged, the Society of African Missions. He was called the \\"Apostle of the Negro\\" at the time of his death. Early life He was born on 6 April 1867 to Nicholas Lissner and Anna Marie Spehner, the youngest of nine children, in Wolxheim, Bas-Rhin, in the region of Alsace in France. His father, a descendant of Jews from Poland, had converted to Catholicism, and he was raised in a devoutly Catholic home, from which five children were to enter service in the Church.Society of African Missions \\"The Life of Fr. Ignatius Lissner\\" Lissner was drawn to the priesthood at an early age and entered the diocesan minor seminary to start his education. By 1888, he felt called to serve in the African missions and entered the Society on 21 December of that year. He did his studies to prepare for ordination, first at the Society's school at Clermont-Ferrand, completing his theological studies at their Major Seminary in Lyon. He was ordained in the seminary chapel on 25 July 1891. Africa After his ordination, Lissner was assigned to serve in Whydah in the Kingdom of Dahomey, which was then undergoing increasing control by France. It is now part of the nation of Benin. In the summer of 1892, several months after his arrival, an insurrection among the native population broke out and many of the missionaries in the region fled the town. Lissner, however, chose to stay and was taken captive by King B√©hanzin for several months. Managing to escape, he returned to the city on 2 December 1892 with French military forces who were able to retake it from rebel hands. Lissner remained in Dahomey for another five years. The details of his work among the people there are lost, other than his founding the Parish of St. Joseph in Grand-Popo. In March 1897 Lissner was assigned to travel to North America to raise funds for the work of the Society. After his arrival in the United States, he traveled widely throughout the nation to make the work of the Society known and to beg for financial support for its works. He also traveled to Canada, preaching throughout the Province of Quebec. In 1899 he was assigned to work in Egypt, where he stayed until 1901. At that point he was sent back to the United States to resume his work of raising funds and recruiting for the Society. America For the next five years, Lissner worked as a minister to the poor of the country, which was itself still considered mission territory by the Church Church, with an infrastructure slowly growing to serve the growing number of immigrants from Europe, and was still under the supervision of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. He became aware of the lack of organized care for the small population of African-American Catholics. The expectation that there would be organized outreach to the general population of ex-slaves after the American Civil War had not been met, as the system of recruiting specialists for the \\"Colored Mission\\", as it was called, had little success. The Holy See was aware of the situation and decided to take action. In 1906, Bishop Benjamin Keily of the Diocese of Savannah-Atlanta received instructions from Rome that he was to use the services of the Society of African Missions to provide pastoral care to the blacks of the diocese. On the following 17 December Lissner received a letter from the bishop offering the Society the exclusive charge of this population. In January 1907, under Lissner's direction, two priests of the Society took charge of the Parish of St. Benedict the Moor in Savannah, Georgia. Lissner himself went to Rome to present his plans for the missions entrusted to his care, receiving the blessing of Pope Pius X for this work. He returned to the United States that following November,FamilySearch.com accompanied by several other members of the Society, all of whom were from his native Alsace. Over the next six years, Lissner went on to found a series of parish and parochial schools to serve the blacks of rural Georgia. The members of the Society carried out this work in the face of a lack of support from their colleagues among the local Catholic clergy and of hostility from the Ku Klux Klan. Founder =Handmaids of Mary= In 1915 a bill came before the Georgia legislature which would have outlawed the education of black children by white teachers. The schools which Lissner had established in Savannah were served by Franciscan Sisters, who were all white. In an effort to head off the closing of these schools, he proposed to Bishop Keily that a religious congregation of black Religious Sisters be founded to take over the charge of these schools. The bishop agreed to the proposal, saying \\"Yes, colored Sisters for colored people.\\" As a result, Lissner recruited the help of Elizabeth Barbara Williams, a longterm member of a former congregation of Franciscan Sisters which had disbanded, to help in this work. Williams, under Lissner's authority and guidance, was joined by other black women to found the Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary, a congregation open to receiving members regardless of race. Under the name of Mother Theodore, she headed the new congregation. The bill which sparked their founding, however, did not pass in the Legislature and the white Sisters remained at two of the schools. The Handmaids took control of one of Lissner's schools. Having no real financial resources, however, they resorted to running a laundry and begging to support themselves, and faced a daily struggle for their survival as a community. In 1922, Lissner made a business trip to New York City, where he met with Cardinal Patrick Hayes, the Archbishop of New York. Hayes was aware of the small community of Black Sisters which Lissner had helped found and was guiding. He asked Lissner for their help in caring for black children in Harlem. This led to their eventual relocation to New York.Franciscan Handmaids of Mary \\"Our History\\" =St. Anthony's Seminary= At this period, there was no seminary in the United States which would accept an African American candidate. Lissner saw as part of the mission of his Society the formation of a black clergy to serve their people. He envisioned establishing a seminary which would accomplish this. He received the support and funding for this project from the Philadelphia heiress, Mother (now Saint) Katharine Drexel, S.B.S., who had dedicated her life and fortune to this same population and had formed a strong friendship with him from the time of his initial visit to America. Relying largely on funds she provided, Lissner purchased property in Tenafly, New Jersey. He opened there St. Anthony's Mission, the first seminary of the Society in the nation in 1921, and one which was open to candidates of all races. He recruited six African American men to attend, all of whom graduated and received ordination. All of them, however, found so much prejudice in the congregations they tried to serve that they wound up leaving the country to serve elsewhere in the world. The seminary was forced to close in 1927. A new province With the expansion of the Society's work to the West Coast of the United States through the foundation of a mission in Los Angeles in 1926, Lissner recognized that the work of the Society could not be reliably maintained by Europeans. This was true whether relying on the Alsatians who had accompanied him or the influx of members of the Society from Ireland which had also taken place, and thus needed native members. He therefore began to work on establishing a fully functioning region of the Society. In this way, the institutions could be developed to recruit and train American men for missionary work and to establish sources of financial support. To this end, with the approval of his religious superiors in Europe, he began to lay the groundwork for an American province of the Society. In 1938, Lissner organized the construction of a novitiate and seminary for the Society in Silver Spring, Maryland. The following year, the Superior General of the Society established the Pro- Province of the United States, just short of full status. Lissner was named Pro-Provincial Superior. This work progressed to the satisfaction of the superiors of the Society, and a new mission in Tucson, Arizona was opened. As a result, on 7 March 1941, the status of the Missionaries of Africa in the United States was raised to that of a full Province. Lissner was appointed as the first American Provincial Superior. The new Province was soon severely tried with the entry of the United States into World War II. Recruitment of young men became almost impossible due to the military draft and travel restrictions interfered with the ability of the new Provincial Council to meet and coordinate the work of the Province. Additionally, the seminary was destroyed by fire in 1943. Lissner, however, had gained such stature for his work that he was able to raise the funds needed to rebuild the seminary by end of the War, and even built a House of Studies for college-age seminarians in Boston. Under his leadership there was a successful melding of the differing cultural groups of Alsatians and Irish into a united organization. Last years Overcome by age and poor health, Lissner retired as Provincial Superior in April 1946. He retired to the house of the Society in Tenafly, where a niece helped to nurse him and handled his correspondence. Falling ill, he was taken to Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, New Jersey, where he died on 7 August 1948.Staff. \\"Very Rev. I Lissner, Missionary, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, August 8, 1948.

In 2001, the historical musical instrument collections of the city of Nice were transferred from the Mus√©e Mass√©na to the Palais Lascaris with the project of transforming it into a music museum. In 2011, the permanent exhibition of musical instruments was finally opened to the public.  Current use  Today the palace devotes its exhibition space to the permanent exhibit of the collection of historical musical instruments, built around the bequest of Antoine Gautier (1825-1904).

The following year, Antoine Gautier died at his home, at the age of seventy-nine, leaving to the city of Nice his musical collections consisting of more than 225 instruments and a rare musical library.Henri Bernardi, ¬´ Antoine Gautier, sa vie et ses activit√©s musicales ¬ª, dans Mus√©e du palais Lascaris, Aspects des collections d'un amateur √©clair√© ni√ßois Antoine Gautier, exhibition catalogue (Nice, Palais Lascaris, 18 June - 22 November 1998), p. 17 The Gautier collection was bequeathed to the city of Nice in the testament of 26 May 1901 and by a codicil dated 8 June 1901. It was accepted by the city of Nice in a special session of the city council, on 19 September 1904. The article of the testament that treats the bequest is succinct : :Wanting to encourage the creation in Nice, the city of my birth, of a well-organised institution of musical education, I leave to the city of Nice sixty-thousand (60.000) francs, as well as my collections of musical instruments and accessories, scores and books music, on the sole condition of allotting six hundred (600) francs per year to a luthier charged with the maintenance of the instruments ; I believe that Mr. Francois Bovis, luthier, would be the most fitting for this task. Following the Antoine Gautier bequest, the city of Nice has continued to enrich this collection, which has been successively exhibited or preserved at the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Nice, the Mus√©e Mass√©na, the Conservatoire de Nice, and today at the Palais Lascaris. = Highlights of the Collection = Naderman harp (1780) Among the most important instruments are : * a tenor sackbut by Anton Schnitzer (Nuremberg, 1581);Henry G.

Looney Tunes cartoon short directing Bob Clampett. The short was released on August 9, 1941, and stars Porky Pig. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc, Sara Berner, Billy Bletcher and Michael Maltese. This short is a parody of the 1930s radio program, \\"We the People,\\" an early reality program where people would share unusual stories with the audience. Porky Pig is the program's moderator. Plot The cartoon begins with the radio program, \\"We, the Animals Squeak!\\" in progress, and a hare finishing his story about how he got revenge on a hunter that had been stalking him. Porky Pig, the program's host, introduces the Irish-accented Kansas City Kitty, a champion mouse catcher. Kansas City Kitty tells her life's story, including her marriage to Tom Collins and the birth of her son, Little Patrick. The main thrust of her story is how her reputation as a mouse catcher was nearly ruined by the mice, who ‚Äì tired of being harassed by Kansas City Kitty and being kept away from the food ‚Äì plot their revenge. In the catacombs of the house's walls, the lead mouse (Ratt McNalley) plots a scheme to kidnap Little Patrick while his mother is asleep. The mice carry out the plan and successfully flee the angry Kitty. The mother cat desperately claws at the wall, but Ratt stands up to her and threatens to brutally kill Little Patrick if their demands are not met. Those demands ‚Äì allowing free rein of the house ‚Äì are played out in the next scene. A series of spot gags follow, where the mice carry food from the refrigerator, get drunk on milk and generally harass Kitty. Meanwhile, one of Ratt's henchmen decides to tease Little Patrick, but Patrick proves to be very resourceful and quickly turns the tables on his captor. Patrick escapes and reunites with his mother; Ratt, who is taunting Kitty, quickly knows what this means and tries to flee, but Kitty quickly catches all the mice and \\"shows those little devils they couldn't harm kit nor kin (a play on words of \\"kith nor kin\\") of Kansas City Kitty!\\" The story brings loud cheers from the audience, and an impressed Porky gives her a present: a wimpy little mouse that scares her. \\"Well, faith'n me jabbers,\\" intones the mouse, just as the Irish-shaped iris out ends the cartoon.

Podcast  The show is usually hosted by former Slate editor David Plotz with regular contributors Emily Bazelon and John Dickerson, likewise Slate alums. It covers three political topics in the week's news. Each topic is discussed from various viewpoints, and the podcast runs about 40 minutes to an hour. Ads are incorporated into the show between topics, with Plotz or one of the other contributors describing the product in a casual way, similar to the manner of early radio and television shows. The group typically treats Dickerson as their expert on Washington politics and presidential campaigns. Bazelon is turned to for her legal expertise as well as for her experience reporting on online bullying and child sexual abuse. Notable guests of the show have included Stephen Colbert, John Hickenlooper, David French, Jamelle Bouie and Farhad Manjoo. Plotz, Bazelon, and Dickerson reportedly do not discuss topics with each other before going live.  History  The Slate Political Gabfest was launched in December 2005. Andy Bowers, executive producer of the podcast, initially read articles from Slate for the podcast, but he said he was struck by how much he enjoyed the magazine's editorial meetings and thought that listeners would also enjoy the banter and analysis if he could capture it on audio. He provided Plotz, Bazelon and Dickerson with the basic structure of the gabfest and a small studio at Slate's Washington headquarters. From 2012 until 2014, an abridged version of the show was also broadcast on the radio alongside the Culture Gabfest. On November 10, 2009, the panel held its first live show at the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington, D.C. That event was the first of what has become a key arm of Slate's podcasting business: live shows. According to Faith Smith, executive producer for Slate Live, live shows are profitable financially, inspire audience loyalty and encourage listeners to join Slate Plus, the website's paid membership program. This live Gabfest is also considered the earliest example in a growing trend of live events from podcast producers including WNYC and Gimlet Media.  Reception  In 2012, it was reported to be Slate's most popular podcast. In October 2013, the showed peaked at #4 on the US iTunes podcasts charts. As of February 2012, Political Gabfest has over 75,000 weekly listeners. Some fans have reportedly driven hours or flown from several states away to attend live shows. Chris Campling of The Times (London) named it his podcast of the week for February 2, 2008. In 2011, the entire Slate series of podcasts received an Advertising Age \\"Media Vanguard Award\\" for Digital Native/Best Podcast Series with a specific mention of the Political Gabfest. In November 2012, the Slate Political Gabfest won iTunes informal Facebook poll for the best political podcast.

History The Gilchrist House was built by Edmon (also spelled Edmond, Edmund) Gilchrist, who migrated to Alabama from Edgefield, South Carolina. He first settled in Lowndes County, but relocated to Walker County and built the house in 1812 on land granted to him by the Federal government. The house was still owned by his descendants when it was listed on the National Register during the early 1970s. Architecture The house was a two-story wooden timber frame structure, elevated on piers. The original portion was rectangular, with one upstairs room over one downstairs room. Bookend chimneys were present on each side of the two-story structure. A one-story side wing and a full-width porch were added in the late 1880s and early 1900s.

In a racing career lasting from July 1967 until June 1968, the filly ran six times and won three races. After winning once as a two-year-old she showed improved form in the spring of 1968 to win the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. Caergwrle was beaten in her only subsequent race and was retired to stud where she had limited success as a broodmare. Background Caergwrle was a chestnut filly bred at the Cliff Stud in Yorkshire by Gwen Murless, the wife of the leading British trainer Noel Murless. Her sire Crepello won the 1957 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful sire of winners. Caergwrle's dam, Caerphilly, was a sprinter who won three races and finished third in the 1962 edition of the five furlong King George Stakes. Apart from Caerwrle, Caerphilly also produced St Chad, a colt who won the Wills Mile in 1967. As descendants of the broodmare Malapert, Caerphilly and Caergwrle were closely related to the 2000 Guineas winner Pall Mall. Caerwrle, who was named after a Welsh village, was trained by Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Caergwrle made her first racecourse appearance in the Star Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park in May. She ran promisingly to finish second to Fairy Path. In July Caergwrle started 2/5 favourite for the Findon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. She was regarded as a near certainty to win and was the subject of heavy betting on The Tote but lost her chance when she bolted before the race and galloped several furlongs at top speed before being caught. She eventually finished well beaten behind Fridoline. In September she recorded her first win when she won a five furlong maiden race at Chester. On her three-year-old debut, Caergwrle showed vastly improved form when she won the seven furlong 1000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Kempton Park by four lengths. In the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile, Caergwrle was made 4/1 favourite in a field of fourteen fillies. Ridden by the nineteen-year-old Sandy Barclay, she won by a length from Photo Flash, with Sovereign a neck away in third. A month later, Caerwrle was sent to Epsom for the Ebbisham Stakes over eight and a half furlongs. She was beaten a length by Ileana, who was carrying four pounds less. Caergwrle never ran again and was retired to stud. Retirement Caergwrle remained in the Murless family's ownership throughout her breeding career. She produced several winners, but none at a high level. Her most successful offspring, foaled when she was twenty-one years old, was St Ninian who won seven races, including the Jubilee Handicap at Kempton Park. The descendants of Caerwrle's daughter Cricceith had some success in New Zealand, the most notable being Batavian, who won the Great Northern Foal Stakes and the Hawke's Bay Guineas.

Minaj, Garibay and Hit-Boy wrote it and Fernando Garibay & Hit-Boy produced it. Musically, it is a hardcore hip hop song that uses electronic beats. Lyrically, the song is rumored to be another diss song to Lil' Kim, following \\"Roman's Revenge\\" and \\"Stupid Hoe\\". \\"Come on a Cone\\" received mainly positive reviews from contemporary critics, while others criticized the chorus, calling it the main problem of the song. Background Minaj and Chauncey Hollis wrote \\"Come on a Cone\\" and Hollis produced it. Despite not discussing a particular musical style that the pair wanted to employ beforehand, Hollis had made both \\"Come on a Cone\\" and \\"I Am Your Leader\\" to suit the album's \\"bipolar\\" sound, and sent them in as the first two songs: \\"I kind of did these records [and] just blindly sent her some beats. It was out of the first batch of beats that I sent.\\" Initially, Minaj rejected the song because it was conceived with a space-age sound, but later Hollis explained that she had suggested changing the tempo, \\"The tempo was a bit slower so she was like, 'Can you speed this up?' I sped it up, and she hit me back like, 'Yo, this is crazy, I'm writing to it,' and [she] just kept having me send beats.\\" Although Hollis was not present during the recording of \\"Come on a Cone\\", he was impressed with the final product, saying, \\"I just went in blindly, I just sent beats, which is like the stars aligning. She picked the right joints and blacked out on them.\\" The song was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California and Jungle City Studios in New York City, New York by Ariel Chobaz, who received assistance from Jon Sher, who also assisted Chobaz in mixing \\"Come on a Cone\\" at Conway Studios. Composition \\"Come on a Cone\\" is a three-minute and five second hardcore hip hop and electro-hop song. It contains a simple, bass-heavy beat, and features percussive \\"synth-stabs\\", which according to Marc Hogan of Spin, showcases \\"Nicki's phenomenal rapping ability\\". The song features Minaj as Roman Zolanski and is rumored to be another diss song to Lil' Kim, following \\"Stupid Hoe\\". Minaj makes references to Ellen DeGeneres (\\"When you see me on Ellen / Just admit that I'm winning\\"), Oscar de la Renta (\\"Front row with Oscar / De la Renta posture\\"), Anna Wintour (\\"When I'm sitting with Anna / I'm really sitting with Anna / Ain't no metaphor punchline / I'm really sitting with Anna\\"), Versace (\\"Do a show for Versace / They request me by name / And if they don't get Nicki / It just won't be the same\\"), and Cee Lo Green (\\"7 Up went and gave my commercial to Cee Lo...\\") In the chorus, Nicki as Roman repeats the title in a cartoonish voice, which was compared to \\"Stupid Hoe\\". Critical reception \\"Come on a Cone\\" received comparisons to the works of rapper Missy Elliott (pictured). Jayson Greene of Pitchfork selected the song as a \\"best new track\\", and said: \\"Her performance on this song is something else entirely: demented. Chaotic. Gloriously unpredictable. Fearless. One of the most creatively unhinged vocal takes in pop-rap history ‚Äì or at least an immediate contender for the top ten. Whatever cheap hyperbole you could fling at this performance, Nicki bats down with one of her palmetto-sized eyelashes\\". Emily Mackay of NME praised the song's composition for being engaging, but found its lyrical content hard to listen to. In her review of \\"Come on a Cone\\", Emily Exton of PopDust had a mixed response, praising its \\"convincing\\" delivery and \\"monstrous\\" beat and compared the song to Minaj's best guest work, but ended the review by saying: \\"Things begin 'normal' enough, but Roman's full control over the chorus makes what could be a smooth banger an unstable head-scratcher, where it's difficult to keep track of Nicki versus Roman's intentions.\\" Henry Yanney of SoulCulture called the song's production \\"bizarre\\" and \\"mind numbing\\", but said Minaj \\"still conjures up some verses to again ensure listeners of her rap allegiance.\\" Writing for Slant, Matthew Cole praised \\"Come on a Cone\\" as being \\"brilliant\\", and called it \\"one of the most hilarious and genuinely unexpected moments I've heard from a rapper\\" since Missy Elliott. Joe Rivers of No Ripcord noted the song to be among the least commercial on the album, saying: \\"Here, beats are sparse, and frills and instrumentation are minimal. It‚Äôs all geared up to make Minaj‚Äôs rhymes the focal point, and it gives the record something of a mixtape feel.\\" Chris Willman of The Wrap said \\"Come on a Cone\\" delivered the album's best moments, saying it is \\"probably the only track that's slightly less salacious than it sounds.\\" Promotion =Music video= Although the song was not released as a single, Minaj did release a music video for the song on October 22, 2012, as a teaser to the re-release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. It was directed by Grizzlee Music and released through his YouTube channel. It resembles the theme from Minaj's previous single from her debut album, Pink Friday, \\"Did It On'em\\". The video features footage from Minaj's concerts and the 2012 BET Awards, as well as appearances by Tyga, Blac Chyna, Gucci Mane, Birdman, Waka Flocka Flame, Safaree \\"SB\\" Samuels, Jay-Z, Beyonc√©, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and American Idol judge Randy Jackson. =Live performances= Minaj has performed \\"Come on a Cone\\" on the European and North American legs of her debut concert tour, the Pink Friday Tour.

Prior to the landmark cases Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2020), employment protections for LGBT people were patchwork; several states and localities explicitly prohibit harassment and bias in employment decisions on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity, although some only cover public employees. Prior to the Bostock decision, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) interpreted Title VII to cover LGBT employees; the EEOC's determined that transgender employees were protected under Title VII in 2012, and extended the protection to encompass sexual orientation in 2015.  Federal employees and law Presidents have established certain protections for some employees of the federal government by executive order. It was not for years that a president did in fact establish an executive order in order to protect LGBT discrimination in the work force. In 1995, President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12968 establishing criteria for the issuance of security clearances included sexual orientation for the first time in its non-discrimination language: \\"The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.\\" It also said that \\"no inference\\" about suitability for access to classified information \\"may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.\\" Clinton's Executive Order 13087 in 1998 prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce. It applied to employees of the government of the District of Columbia and the United States Postal Service and to civilian employees of the armed forces, but not to certain excepted services, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clinton acknowledged its limitations in a statement: At the start of 2010, the Obama administration included gender identity among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). It was Obama's wish to further attend to LGBT civil rights not only through legislation, but also the executive branch. In 2012 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow gender identity- based employment discrimination because it is a form of sex discrimination. In 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concluded that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow sexual orientation discrimination in employment because it is a form of sex discrimination. In March 2018, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in EEOC v. RG & GR Harris Funeral Homes that transgender people are protected by federal sex discrimination laws. By August of that year, 16 states had joined an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the ruling. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case as R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the 2019-2020 term. On March 31, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled in the case of TerVeer v. Billington, that Peter TerVeer can sue for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, that bans sex discrimination, claiming that he faced discrimination after his boss found out that he was gay. Title VII does not explicitly protect against sexual orientation discrimination, but Judge Kollar-Kotelly's ruling leaves that a person could bring a claim under Title VII's ban on sex discrimination because an employer views an employee's sexual orientation as \\"not consistent with acceptable gender roles.\\" On July 21, 2014, President Obama signed Executive Order 13672, adding \\"gender identity\\" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring in the federal civilian workforce and both \\"sexual orientation\\" and gender identity\\" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring and employment on the part of federal government contractors and sub-contractors. On July 31, 2014, Obama also signed Executive Order 13673, \\"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces,\\" requiring companies with large federal contracts to prove their compliance with labor laws; this executive order, however, was revoked by President Trump on March 27, 2017. In 2017, the Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, reversed the Obama-era policy which used Title VII to protect transgender employees from discrimination. A bill to ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), was introduced repeatedly in the U.S. Congress since 1994. Under the ENDA, it was illegal for an employer to discriminate against their employees due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Unlike the Equality Act of 1974, the main focus of the ENDA was to end employment discrimination. In 1994, the ENDA only made it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their sexual orientation. By 2007, discrimination based on gender identity had been added to the law as well. In 2015, a broader bill, the Equality Act, was introduced in place of this. In March 2019, a group representing the Department of Justice's LGBTQ employees addressed a letter to Attorney General William Barr, complaining about the increasing hostility and discrimination towards the LGBTQ employees. The group also claimed that LGBTQ employees had left the department due to alleged mistreatment and that the department did nothing to recruit and retain top LGBTQ employees.  State law prior to Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia  400pxthumbMap of states that have sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination prohibited in public and/or private employment via statute, executive order, regulation, and/or case law (prior to the _Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia_ ruling): Pennsylvania became the first state to ban public sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1975. Wisconsin became the first state to ban both public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982. Minnesota became the first state to ban employment discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity when it passed the Human Rights Act in 1993. Currently, twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, and at least 400 cities and counties have enacted bans on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Twenty one states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have statutes that protect against both sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in employment in the public and private sector: California,Cal Civ Code sec. 51 Colorado,C.R.S. 24-34-402 (2008) Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire,HB 1319 New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington. Two states Michigan and Pennsylvania, have acquired such protections through executive orders, court rulings or binding decisions by their respective civil rights commissions. In addition, two states, Indiana and Wisconsin prohibit discrimination on account of sexual orientation only; gender identity is not addressed. Indiana, in accordance with Hively v Ivy Tech Community College, a ruling by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and Wisconsin through a statute enacted in 1982, which made Wisconsin the first state to have private employment protections for sexual orientation. Similarly to Indiana, the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, covering Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, have found sex protections in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include the category of gender identity.

The 2015 report found 366 businesses achieved a top rating of 100 percent. The report also found 89% of Fortune 500 businesses have non-discrimination policies on the basis of sexual orientation, while 66% of Fortune 500 businesses have non-discrimination policies on the basis of gender identity.Corporate Equality Index 2O15 Each year, corporations send thousands of employees to the Out & Equal Regional Summit, a conference that aims to create a more inclusive work environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. There are workplace resources for how allies can create a more inclusive work environment, including programs available through PFLAG. Widespread adoption of private workplace policies may be motivated by good business sense, the Williams Institute suggests. Its conclusion is based on a set of studies that show that lesbians and gay men who have come out at work report lower levels of anxiety, less conflict between work and personal life, greater job satisfaction, more sharing of employers' goals, higher levels of satisfaction with their co- workers, more self-esteem, and better physical health.

Ravesteyn studied history at the University of Leiden and was involved in setting up the local branch of the Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) in 1898. With David Wijnkoop and Jan Ceton he was on the editorial board of the left-wing Marxist newspaper De Tribune when it was set up in October 1907. However, Pieter Jelles Troelstra and Willem Vliegen, the reformist leaders of the SDAP, found this unacceptable and organised a special congress to discuss throwing out De Tribune from the party. They were able to get a clear majority for this at the congress held on February 14, 1909. The De Tribune group founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on March 14, 1909. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1918 and was an MP until 1926, although he left the Communist Party Holland (the successor of the SDP) in 1925. He was also a local councillor in Rotterdam from 1919 to 1927. He was curator of the Rotterdam Municipal Library.

The game was originally released exclusively in Japan on October 21, 2004. The F-Zero franchise went on hiatus after its release. Players race in vehicles on numerous courses while navigating past obstacles. While the game is a 2D racer, its Mode 7 graphical effect allows the track to be scaled and rotated around the vehicle to simulate a 3D environment. Climax let players store rewarded speed boosts to use with energy-draining speed boosts. Energy is a reflection of the craft's health, and can be restored by driving over specific areas on the track. Nintendo World Report and Siliconera lauded the game for its track editor and Survival mode. Nintendo World Report praised the game's extensive Survival and Zero Test challenges, but complained about the Grand Prix's short duration and unbalanced difficulty. While Nintendo World Report and Official Nintendo Magazine thought it was a graphical improvement over preceding 2D F-Zero games, both the former critic and Siliconera lamented over its reused graphics and musical assets. Gameplay head-up display and racing craft. Matthew Castle of Official Nintendo Magazine called it \\"easily the best-looking of the SNES-type [F-Zero] games\\".alt=Vehicle racing on a track high above ground. In the corners of the screen are head-up display information detailing race standings, energy-level, time, and speed. F-Zero Climax is a racing game that plays similarly to its immediate predecessor (F-Zero: GP Legend) and the original F-Zero game. Players select their vehicles and race around fifty- three courses while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs. Each racing craft contains air brakes for drifting around tight corners by pressing the L and R shoulder buttons. A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an energy meter. Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used in tandem with the energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost. Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy. Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former is new to the 2D F-Zero series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost to inflict extra damage. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations. Climax has numerous gameplay modes and options, some of which were carried over from F-Zero: GP Legend. In the Grand Prix mode, the player races against twenty-three opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. Each of the four cups available (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum) has multiple difficulty levels. Track selection per cup may vary based on difficulty level chosen. Time attack let players choose any track to complete it in the shortest time possible. Zero Test is a selectable option in Time Attack where players may complete in thirty-six time trials on a small section of track. Survival consists of mission-based objectives such as navigating courses with depleted health, and racing an opponent on a short guardrail-less track without flying off-course at the finish line by braking. Completing a series of survival challenges unlocks a character biography with a brief episode summary from the TV Tokyo anime series F-Zero: GP Legend. The multiplayer mode is where two to four players can compete simultaneously. Edit mode allows the creation of tracks. Players can lay track pieces that come in an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points. Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be inputted on any Climax cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.  Development and release Information on F-Zero Climaxs existence and title was leaked by Japanese retailers weeks before its official announcement by Nintendo. The game was developed by Suzak and published by Nintendo for the GBA handheld console. Climax continues to use the Mode 7 graphical effect seen in previous GBA F-Zero games. Mode 7 allows the track to be scaled and rotated around the vehicle to simulate a 3D environment. It was originally used as a showcase feature for the Super NES F-Zero game. Like GP Legend before it, Climax is tied into the TV Tokyo anime series. It was originally released exclusively in Japan on October 21, 2004 and sold 5,049 copies during its first three days on sale. The game was re-released on the Japanese Wii U Virtual Console on December 16, 2015.  Reception  Nintendo World Report's Daniel Bloodworth thought the Grand Prix mode, which should be the focus of the game, is \\"woefully lacking\\". Bloodworth criticized track length of the first 3 cups; he clocked-in at per lap and finished three cups within 20 minutes on standard difficulty. He concluded \\"combined with the low difficulty and re-used environments and music, it all ends up feeling rather unsatisfying.\\" While the fourth cup is more difficult, Bloodworth was taken back by its sudden spike in difficulty‚Äîeven when playing every cup on Expert or Master. Also, many of its courses were rehashes from the first F-Zero game and GP Legend. During Siliconera's playtest, they praised Climaxs track design and varying levels of difficulty between courses‚Äîeasier courses are relatively straight compared to later ones which require honed drifting skill. They mentioned the game demanded players to have quick reflexes and master the track layout on difficulties beyond novice since the AI-controlled opponents are unforgivable. Siliconera noted players have to be proficient at both types of speed boosting. Bloodworth explained a properly timed double speed boost can substantially alter the momentum of a race. Compared to GP Legends controls, Siliconera thought the spin attack \\"is a neat trick to use, that adds a new element to the game.\\" Bloodworth liked the personalized button configurations, especially since vehicles feel stiffer and the game does not allow players to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Bloodworth said Climax is \\"probably the most polished of the 2D iterations of this franchise.\\" The game features expanded backgrounds, improved track detail, and a more distinguishable separation between the course and ground below. Siliconera thought Climax could've looked better, but the game \\"reuses many of the tile sets from GP Legend and Maximum Velocity.\\" Furthermore, Bloodworth was disappointed with the music tracks being mostly rehashes from the original game and F-Zero X‚Äîa sentiment Siliconera agreed with. The voice work of the announcer fell short to Bloodworth. He explained the announcer is sometimes helpful, but also report events inappropriately or too frequently. Siliconera criticized Climax for feeling more like an expansion pack than a sequel. They compared the game's Survival mode to GP Legends story mode and consider it not as deep, \\"but the challenges are much tougher.\\" Siliconera thought the track editor and its ability to be shared with other players as the game's greatest feature. Bloodworth concluded Climax has plenty of Survival and Zero Test challenges, and slots to save created courses, but the lackluster Grand Prix holds back the game. Nintendo World Report and Siliconera felt that the game was a likely candidate for localization in regions outside Japan due to GP: Legends recent nondomestic release, but this never happened. F-Zero: GP Legend was released in Japan in late 2003, but the US version was delayed into late 2004 to coincide with the anime's release. Climax was the third F-Zero game on the GBA and the last to be released in the franchise before its hiatus.

Background Richard Murray is an inventor of school operating models and a developer of school facilities. Murray's most notable work was the invention of the school model upon which Cristo Rey Jesuit High School of Chicago is based. Cristo Rey is an urban, college preparatory school for low-income students that features an internship program in which students work one day per week in professional, entry-level positions in Chicago‚Äôs central business district. Many media have featured the school including the television news program \\"60 Minutes\\", national publication Newsweek, and a book about the school‚Äôs development. 25 other schools in the United States have been based on this model, also known as the Equity School model. Many of these schools are affiliated with the Cristo Rey Network which promotes and supports replication of the model. He has a patent pending on the model as a business method, including applications as charter schools. He also is known for creating the public-private operating model in 2005 used by Wartburg College and Waverly, Iowa, for the wellness center there known as ‚Äúthe W,‚Äù one of the largest NCAA Division III centers in the country. In 2007 Murray invented another high school operating model for The Neighborhood Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, providing that college preparatory high school for low-income students with the means to develop a new campus.

Shires, Jr. (born November 22, 1932) is an American physician, research scientist, and inventor. He was a member of the research team that did the work leading to the invention of Gatorade. He is the co-founder and former CEO of LifeLink Foundation, an organization created to promote, support and assist in the transplantation therapy of organs and tissues.  Early life  Dana Shires was born in Coral Gables, Florida. His childhood was spent in Virginia and West Virginia. After the end of the Second World War, his family moved back to Florida, where he attended Lee High School, in Jacksonville. With the start of the Korean War, Shires spent three years in the Marine Corps, including a year as part of a Marine aviation squadron on a U.S. aircraft carrier. Following his stint in the Marines, Shires returned to Florida, and in 1954 started his undergraduate studies at the University of Florida. He graduated in 1957, and, inspired by an uncle who was a doctor, continued with medical school in Gainesville, graduating in 1961.  Involvement in the Invention of Gatorade  In 1965, Dana Shires was a research fellow at the University of Florida working in the nephrology lab under Dr. Robert Cade. During a lunchtime discussion with then Gators assistant coach Dewayne Douglas, Shires became interested in the issue of the players' suffering from dehydration during practice. Douglas had described to Shires how players lost weight and experienced problems with urination. At the time, the prevailing thinking was that players should be discouraged from replenishing liquids lost to sweating during a game. Shires, who had played football in high school, had familiarity with the issue and found the problem interesting, and brought the matter to the attention of Dr. Cade. They, along with Jim Free and Alex de Quesada (two other postdoctoral fellows working in the nephrology lab under Cade), began research on dehydration during physical exertion. During freshman football practice that year, the researchers collected and tested sweat samples. Their testing revealed that each player lost 2.5 to 4.2 liters, or up to 9 pounds, during each practice session. Under Cade, the team's research ultimately led to the formulation of a beverage that would replenish the sodium, sugar and water lost during strenuous exercise. Originally nicknamed Cade's Cola, the beverage was eventually marketed as Gatorade, and was the first product in what is now the multibillion-dollar sports beverage industry. Dr. Shires has stated, \\"...perhaps the most important thing that we did was alert people to the necessity of rehydrating in the midst of exercise.\\"  Founding of LifeLink Foundation  In 1982, Dr. Shires and Alex de Quesada, a colleague in the research and development of Gatorade, started the LifeLink Foundation in Tampa, Florida. According to the organization's mission statement, LifeLink is \\"dedicated to the recovery of life-saving and life-enhancing organs and tissue for transplantation therapy.\\" ea As of 2001, LifeLink had a staff of 21 doctors, and performed more than 300 heart, kidney, liver and pancreas transplants per year. The recipients of these organs are often patients who are indigent. Dr. Shires has said, \\"We've done a lot of good things for people with the [Gatorade] money, and we're grateful for that.\\" In 2012, Dr. Shires serves as LifeLink's Chairman of the Board. His son, Dan, serves as Executive Vice President of LifeLink Tissue Bank, one of six divisions operating under the LifeLink Foundation umbrella. ea  Family  Dr. Shires has eight children and sixteen grandchildren.

He was considered, along with Sir Denis Mahon, to be one of a handful of important collectors who was also a respected scholar. The bulk of his collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art and most is on display at the Courtauld Gallery in London.  Early life  Count Antoine Edward Seilern und Aspang was born on 17 September 1901 at Frensham Place, Farnham, in Surrey, England. He was the youngest of the three sons of Count Carl Seilern und Aspang (1866‚Äì1940) and the American heiress Antoinette \\"Nettie\\" n√©e Woerishoffer (1875-1901). He therefore enjoyed citizenship of both Austria and the United Kingdom. His ancestors had been ennobled after successful involvement with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. His father's sister Ida was married to Phillip Hennessy, whose sister Nora was the wife of the Royal Academician Lord Methuen. He had two older brothers, Count Charles Hugo (\\"Chappie\\"), born 1899, and Count Oswald Seilern, born 1900. His mother died five days after he was born. Thereafter the three Seilern boys divided their time between their grandmother, Anna Woerishoffer, in New York City, and their father in London and Vienna, in the company of nannies and governesses (and frequently chaperoned by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury), though until America entered the First World War Mrs Woerishoffer spent 1912 to 1916 with her grandsons in Vienna. Anna Woerishoffer's wealth derived mainly from the German-language New York newspaper, the Neue-Yorker Staats-Zeitung, and her late husband's success on Wall Street. Seilern, like his older brothers, grew up with a passion for horse-racing and shooting.  Further education and business career  Peter Paul Rubens, Landscape by Moonlight, oil on panel 1635‚Äì1640, 64 x 90 cm; now in the Courtauld Gallery After the First World War Seilern relinquished his Austrian citizenship. However, despite this, he graduated in 1920 from the Realgymnasium in Vienna before attending the Wiener Handelsakademie (1920‚Äì1921) and then, at the start of 1922, he enrolled at the Technische Hochschule in order to study for an engineering certificate until 1924. He then worked briefly for a Yugoslavian lumber company, and in Vienna in finance.  Early collecting and the study of art history  Seilern Triptych: The Entombment of Christ, paint and gold leaf on panel, painted circa 1425, attributed to Robert Campin (1375/1379-1444), Courtauld Gallery Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery by Pieter Bruegel, Courtauld A friend in Vienna, the old Count Karol Lanckoro≈Ñski (Karl Lanckoronski) a large man of huge charm, who had a fine collection of art at his palace in Vienna, persuaded Seilern he should collect also, and in 1931, after the death of his grandmother, when he received his share of an enormous inheritance, he was able to devote himself to the study of art history and to serious collecting. During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies that could be seen at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though his bags were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin. However, in 1933, Count Karl Wilczek, another family friend who was also an art historian, recommended Seilern take private lessons with the great Hungarian art historian Johannes Wilde, very soon a mentor who was to become a lifelong friend. Seilern shortly afterwards enrolled at Vienna University to study the history of art with Karl Maria Swoboda, Julius Schlosser and Hans Sedlmayr. Unusually, perhaps, his subsidiary subject at university was Kinderpsychologie (Child Psychology), taught by a lady who was a pupil of Sigmund Freud and who was vouched for by his friend Jan van Gelder. Seilern wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Venetian influences on the ceiling paintings of Sir Peter Paul Rubens (Die venezianischen Voraussetzungen der Denkenmalerei des Peter Paul Rubens) which he completed in 1939. Rubens remained a lifelong passion and he later remarked, \\"Everything connected with Rubens interests me.\\" Meanwhile, Seilern had started to collect seriously, and was being advised by Wilde, and Ludwig Burchard, the great Rubens scholar. His collection of Rubens' paintings would soon include Landscape by Moonlight (which was once the possession of Sir Joshua Reynolds), and large numbers of paintings, drawings, copies and modelli also by Rubens, as well as oil sketches by Tiepolo and other masters. Between the wars and whilst studying in Vienna he had kept his art collection in an apartment at Brahmsplatz 1.  The Second World War  Portrait of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh (1582-1643), oil on canvas, painted 1633 or 1634 by Anthony van Dyck (1599‚Äì1641), donated by Antoine Seilern to the National Gallery in 1945 At the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, and because of his British citizenship (he had apparently hung the Union Jack from his house in Vienna), Seilern decided in 1939 to return to England, bringing with him his already large art collection and his library. Based in England now he was able to provide finance to support to another art historian fleeing from Nazi-occupied Austria, Ludwig M√ºnz, as well as helping Johannes Wilde and his Jewish wife to leave Vienna. The Director of the National Gallery, Sir Kenneth Clark, sponsored Wilde who was reunited with Seilern at Aberystwyth in Wales where his collection was important enough to be hidden with works of art from the National Gallery and Royal Collection. Seilern then enlisted in the ranks of the British army (though aged thirty-eight), serving in the Royal Artillery, and in 1940 immediately volunteered for the disastrous Russo-Finnish campaign, only escaping from occupied Norway. It was at the end of the Second World War, whilst acting as a German interpreter in the Intelligence Corps, that he appeared at the door of Professor Jan van Gelder in Amsterdam to pick up three oil sketches by Rubens he had bought for Seilern from the Koenig collection in 1940 and had deposited as 'Swedish property' at an Amsterdam bank. It was when the war was at its height that Seilern purchased The Entombment with Donor and the Resurrection (now called the Seilern Triptych) by the \\"Master of Fl√©malle\\", now usually identified as Robert Campin, one of his finest purchases, which he bought at Christie's as a work attributed to Adriaen Isenbrandt in 1942.  Collecting and cataloguing art 1945‚Äì1978  Bernardo Daddi, Triptych: The Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints, tempera and gold leaf on panel, dated 1338; Courtauld Gallery (shown both closed and open) Seilern returned to London at the end of the war to live in a great gloomy house he had acquired at 56 Princes Gate, South Kensington, where he rarely opened the blinds and electric light was largely eschewed as he said it distorted colours in pictures. At Princes Gate the ground floor was devoted to his enormous art library, and therefore pictures were hung mainly on the first floor, well-spaced, as in a museum. Other rooms in the house, of course, also held pictures: for example, on the second floor there was a charmingly decorated room called the card-room, which was apparently rarely shown to visitors but in which, eventually, he hung his Tiepolos, and behind this was a private study, hung with a group of Impressionist pictures including a fine late C√©zanne. The war over, he resumed collecting works of art, buying them privately for the most part rather than at auctions, never from a photograph, and never when pressed by a dealer, pictures left 'on approval' frequently being returned. He devoted time to studying them in depth and cataloguing them accurately, though he was also a generous anonymous benefactor of public collections; for example, he lent to exhibitions held at the British Museum (he lent his Michelangelo drawings to the 1975 exhibition there - which he would otherwise not have done except that it was being held in honour of his friend Johannes Wilde), and in 1945 he gave the National Gallery anonymously a very fine full-length portrait of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh by Sir Anthony van Dyck [NG5633] as well presenting anonymously to the British Museum in 1946 the majority of the important collection of Old Master drawings (some 1250 in number) belonging to Mr. Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, which had been assembled by Sir Thomas Phillipps, 1st Baronet in the library at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, and which had been catalogued by Arthur E. Popham of the museum in 1935 and bought by Seilern en bloc (Seilern retained about two dozen drawings). The proceeds of the sale of the catalogue of his own collection, when it appeared, would be given to the National Art-Collections Fund (now The Art Fund) and the National Trust. Eventually his collection would come to include masterpieces not just by Rubens (32 paintings - oil sketches and modelli mainly, but also some of the artist's copies of Old Masters like Raphael's portrait of Baldassare Castiglione - and 20 drawings); 14 small copies by David Teniers the Younger after pictures in the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria during his Governorship of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647‚Äì56, commissioned to make a series of prints for the book known as the Theatrum Pictorium first published in 1660; and 12 by Tiepolo (including six oil sketches for paintings for the Monastery Church of Aranjuez, south of Madrid), and pictures by Claude Lorrain, Degas, Van Dyck, Quentin Massys, Lorenzo Lotto, Magnasco, Manet, Francesco de Mura, Palma Vecchio, Parmigianino, Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, and Tintoretto. There were also drawings by Giovanni Bellini, Pieter Bruegel (one of the most important collections of his landscape drawings in existence), Hugo van der Goes, Fra Bartolommeo landscape drawings, Michelangelo, Parmigianino, Stefano della Bella, 30 drawings by or attributed to Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Watteau, Degas, C√©zanne and Picasso, and drawings and engravings by Albrecht D√ºrer. Surprisingly perhaps, he commissioned a ceiling painting in triptych form of The Myth of Prometheus for the entrance hall of his home in Princes Gate by his friend Oskar Kokoschka. He also possessed fine Chinese bronzes, Greek vases, Limbourg brothers manuscripts, Holbein manuscripts, and German and Austrian paintings. He is recorded as owning a three-quarter length pastel of his mother by (1894) as well as a signed and dated bust-length portrait of himself as a boy by Muller-Ury, which was unframed and stored in a cupboard. Starting in 1955 Seilern began the publication of a catalogue in seven volumes assisted by Fritz Grossmann of the most important parts of the collection, though he waited in vain for Wilde to produce catalogue entries on his important Michelangelo drawings.  Death  Seilern died in hospital in London in the early hours of 6 July 1978; he was 76. He was buried on 13 July in the churchyard in Frensham, Surrey. His family later had the body exhumed and had it re-interred in the family vault at Schloss Sch√∂nb√ºhel, approximately 80 km west of Vienna.  Bequest to the Courtauld Gallery  Whilst he lived he was persuaded by Johannes Wilde, who had quickly been appointed by Anthony Blunt deputy director of The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, to leave the majority of the paintings and drawings in his collections to the Courtauld Institute Galleries, which already had bequests given by Samuel Courtauld, Viscount Lee of Fareham, Roger Fry, Mark Gambier-Parry and other benefactors. This bequest was made after his death with the condition that it be made anonymously, and be called The Princes Gate Collection. His friend Michael Kitson, another art historian, was given the responsibility under his will of ensuring that the collection was moved to the Courtauld and appropriately displayed. This included his Michelangelo drawings, his Rubens collection, his Tiepolos, the Kokoschka ceiling and Bernardo Daddi's masterpiece Virgin and Child with Saints from 1338, which Seilern had purchased in 1956, as well as modern works by Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others, and two pictures by Daubigny and Narcisse Virgilio D√≠az he had retained from his grandmother's collection in New York. The Courtauld also received his papers relating to the collection. Not everything at Princes Gate was bequeathed to the Courtauld as the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was bequeathed two paintings: a copy by Van Dyck of a Titian called 'Madonna and Child with St Dorothy' and a painting by Domenico Fetti called 'The Return of the Prodigal Son' and Seilern's nephews and nieces received substantial bequests of groups of art works in the collection, like the D√ºrer engravings, Greek vases, German and Austrian paintings not in the published catalogue (that hung principally on the bedroom floor at Princes Gate), and the pictures at the farm in Buckinghamshire.  Personal Life and Character  Seilern never married, was extremely reserved, and his private life is undocumented although he had many women friends, and was evidently fond of his brother Charles's four children, his cousin Paul Methuen (whose pictures he bought occasionally, apparently never keeping them but giving them away as presents), and enjoyed long friendships with scholars like Wilde, Ludwig Burchard, Anthony Blunt, Michael Kitson, and unusually, as he was perforce also a dealer, James Byam Shaw. After the war he also acquired Hog Lane Farm close to Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where he bred pigs (Courtauld Institute students of the 1950s sometimes alleged to have seen him outside 20 Portman Square in a sports car with a pet pig beside him) and grew orchids and fruit which he enjoyed giving to his friends. For convenience he often rode a moped when in London. He was a large man with quite a booming voice, and according to James Byam Shaw possessed something of a dual character, being business-like and intellectual with his male friends, but with women of all ages had all the charm and manners of an aristocrat from the former Austro- Hungarian Empire.  Portraits  He was painted at least twice as a boy by Adolfo M√ºller-Ury, who was a close friend of his mother and father and who had acted as an usher at their wedding in New York in February 1898, and who, along with the other ushers, had been given a gold cigarette box by 'Carlo' Seilern by way of thanks. The first portrait was in a group portrait with his two brothers which was certainly painted in London in the summer of 1906 and was exhibited at Knoedler in New York in December that year. The New York Herald, 5 December 1906, called the group 'graceful' and on 8 December 1906 commented that '...The boys are about 4, 6, and 7 years in age, and they have been painted out of doors.' The second was in late 1906, a full-length dressed in ermine with a rabbit on a string (first exhibited in January 1907 at Knoedler and in February 1908 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC). Both are unlocated. A head and shoulders of Antoine peeping out from behind a red curtain and dated 1909 was in his possession at Princes Gate at his death in 1978 and is now in a private collection in Austria; what appears to be a reduced version of the full-length portrait survives in a private collection in Lucerne, Switzerland; the group portrait is only known through photographs. Muller-Ury also painted portraits [all lost] of his mother in 1898, two of his aunt Carola Woerishoffer aged 13 in 1898 and posthumously as an adult (like her sister she died young, but in a car crash), and his much beloved grandmother, Mrs Charles Woerishoffer, seated in a lakeland, around 1912. Publications Between 1955 and 1971 Antoine Seilern published an illustrated catalogue of his collection in seven parts; he was assisted by Fritz Grossmann. He dedicated the catalogue to his grandmother, Mrs Charles Woerishoffer. The catalogue consists of: * Flemish Paintings & Drawings at 56 Princes Gate, London SW7, 2 volumes.

Concept and creation Fi is a spirit that resides within a sword called the Goddess Sword, which eventually became the Master Sword. She was first seen in promotional art for The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword alongside Link. Her function originally was different than it was in the final game. The designers created Fi to serve as a counterpart to a silent protagonist in order to provide hints, navigate, and storytelling. Appearances Fi appears in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. She leads protagonist Link to a statue of the goddess Hylia with the intention of leading him to the Goddess Sword, which she intends him to use it to defeat the villain Demise. She continues to guide him to various settings to accomplish this, where the Goddess Sword is upgraded into the Master Sword. It is revealed that Fi was created to assist the chosen hero, and Link later has to put Fi into an eternal slumber after their adventure is at its end. While Fi does not appear in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, her character is strongly alluded to in various cutscenes, including playing the sound effect that plays when she speaks, although it is not confirmed if they intentionally refer to Fi or not. Reception Since being revealed, Fi has been met with mostly mixed to negative reception. In a preview of Skyward Sword, Audrey Drake of IGN found her to be a \\"fun change of pace\\" compared to Navi and Midna, two other companion characters in The Legend of Zelda series. She found her emotionless manner of speech \\"endearing.\\" Fellow IGN contributor Richard George found her to be good comic relief due to her lack of understanding of human emotions. Sebastian Haley of Venture Beat similarly enjoyed her, finding her to be the best aspect of Skyward Sword. He felt she was less annoying than previous companion characters and that her dialogue helped fill the void left by Link being a silent protagonist. Game Informer staff criticized Fi for harming the pace of Skyward Sword and criticized her for not letting players figure things out for themselves. David Roberts of GamesRadar+ referred to her as the \\"perpetual annoyance\\" of Skyward Sword, while fellow GamesRadar+ contributor Anthony John Agnello noted the ability to skip Fi's tutorials would have been seen as a drastic improvement for the game. Chris Carter of Destructoid criticized her, noting that her design and role in Skyward Sword were good, but added that he could not stand her interrupting the gameplay as much as she did. He felt that her tutorials were potentially damaging for Skyward Swords dungeons. Keza MacDonald of IGN expressed appreciation for how The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds lacks characters such as Fi who do not interrupt the gameplay and tell players what to do. Despite finding her interruptions annoying, Chris Schilling of Vice felt that the ability to ignore some of the tutorials made it better than it seemed. He added that her leaving was one of the saddest moments in the series, a sentiment on which Griffin Vacheron of Game Revolution felt similarly. Jess Joho of Killscreen negatively compared Fi to the character Turing from Read Only Memories, criticizing Fi as an \\"information dumpster\\" and stating that she was nearly \\"game-breaking\\" due to this. John Teti of Gameological criticized Fi as part of an initiative by Nintendo to \\"condescend and over-explain\\" to players. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation was highly critical of Fi, going as far as to say, \\"besides a twitchy, enraged badger that points out important quest items by breaking wind at them, I cannot imagine a worse assistant.\\" References Category:Female characters in video games Category:Nintendo protagonists Category:The Legend of Zelda characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2011 ","title":"Fi (The Legend of Zelda)"},{"id":"36626938","text":"Damankuh Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Damghan County, Semnan Province, Iran.

Hill is a right-handed batsman who regularly fulfills the role of wicketkeeper. He was born at Leicester, Leicestershire. Educated at Hastings High School and John Cleveland College in Hinckley, Hill has played Second XI cricket for Leicestershire since 2009. During the 2012 season, Hill was selected as part of the Unicorns squad for the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40. He made his List A debut during the competition against Northamptonshire at Sir Paul Getty's Ground, Wormsley. He was dismissed for a golden duck in the match by Lee Daggett, with Northamptonshire winning by 8 wickets. However in his next outing for the Unicorns against Warwickshire he made an impressive 35 before being dismissed by Chris Wright. In the 2013 cricket season he was part of the Unicorns squad, and he experienced one of the most memorable games of his career against Middlesex at Lord's. After the Unicorns were put into bat Hill came in at number 5 and swept the pants of Ollie Raynor to make a comfortable 31. But then what he did with the gloves was extraordinary, taking a good catch and then an unbelievable catch that was one handed down to his right hand side much to the delight of Parsons at 1st slip. Unfortunately the Unicorns lost the game right at the death when the umpire had no bottle to give a clear run-out. During the winter of 2013 he went to Australia and in just his 3rd game made a delightful 228n.o for Brighton Cricket club vs. Unley. Brighton declared on 308 for no loss, smashing all sorts of records. In May 2015, Hill made his first-class d√©but at Canterbury for Leicestershire vs Kent. He made 57 and 3 respectively. Although not being in the squad for Leicestershire's trip to Surrey, Boyce failed a late fitness test, meaning Lewis Hill was once again selected. He was chosen to open the batting. He made 126 off just 147 balls, hitting 18 fours and 2 sixes in the process. In June 2015, Lewis Hill hit the winning runs to secure Leicestershire's first county championship victory in nearly three years.

This is where players get their baseball cleats muddy for the first time on standard 90' diamonds under Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball. In this division, teams are eligible to enter tournament competition and move along the tournament trail, culminating in a World Series. Three World Series are held in this division: one for 13 Year-Old players, one for 13 and 14 Year-Old Players, and the renowned 13-15 World Series. In 2019, the 13-15 World Series was held in Bismarck, ND and was attended by several former participants from the 1969 winning team, including Scott MacGregor.  13 Year-Old Prep  Players often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.  16-18  The highest and most accomplished level in Babe Ruth Baseball. A favorite among high school players and coaches, this division prepares players for collegiate recruiting and the professional draft. This division allows players a chance to compete through a tournament trail to reach the 16-18 Year-Old World Series.  16 Year-Old Prep  Logo for Babe Ruth SoftballThe primary objective of the 16-Year-Old Prep program is to provide players the opportunity to stay involved in organized baseball while sharpening their skills against competition in their own age group.

It was opened by chef Gordon Ramsay, with David Dempsey operating the restaurant on a daily basis for the celebrity chef. It was awarded a Michelin star in 2002, which it held until the restaurant's closure in 2004. History Gordon Ramsay launched Amaryllis, his first Scottish restaurant Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was inspired to launch a Scottish restaurant in his home town of Glasgow on behalf of his protege David Dempsey, who became the first chef de cuisine in 2001. Dempsey had previously been sous chef under Ramsay at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London. Angela Hartnett helped to launch the restaurant. It took Ramsay two years to find an appropriate venue in Glasgow, and set up the restaurant in the One Devonshire Gardens hotel towards the west of the city. It was Ramsay's first restaurant in Scotland. Seven months after opening, it was awarded a Michelin star. In April 2003, Dempsey moved on from the restaurant to become head chef at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. On 3 May 2003, Dempsey fell to his death from a second floor flat window after apparently breaking into the property. It closed the day before the new Michelin star list was announced in 2004, which presented Ramsay as the most starred chef in the world with seven stars despite the loss of the star from Amaryllis. Ramsay was on a family holiday at the time. At the time of closing, the restaurant was fully booked on Friday and Saturday nights for the following six weeks with some 770 bookings, but was reportedly quiet the rest of the week, resulting in Ramsay's concern that the service was at risk of losing the restaurant's Michelin star. It had closed for two days a week because of falling numbers of bookings. During the course of its three years, it lost ¬£480,000, and had lost around ¬£200,000 in the previous year. Ramsay admitted he later felt relieved to close the restaurant following the death of Dempsey, stating, \\"I am just glad that I am not involved in the saga of David‚Äôs family any more and I can finally lock the door.\\" Ramsay filmed the first series of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares for Channel 4 after the closure of Amaryllis. This led to some confrontations with the restaurateurs on the show regarding Ramsay's ability to advise them on the show. The space was taken over by John Pallagi and Simon Wright, who opened their restaurant Room. Ramsay offered to help the pair as part of the second series of Kitchen Nightmares, but they declined. Ramsay would later reference the closure of Amaryllis on the Kitchen Nightmares season 1 episode, \\"The Olde Stone Mill.\\" =Menu= Scottish produce was highlighted in the menus and included signature dishes from Ramsay's range, such as lobster ravioli and langoustine poached in a lobster bisque with a pur√©e of fennel. Scottish spring lamb was also on the menu, served with aubergine caviar, tomatoes and a rosemary jus. On launch, the restaurant offered two fixed-price menus at ¬£25 for three courses or six courses for ¬£40. Prior to closing, it offered a reduced-price menu to customers in the main dining room but kept a more expensive menu for customers in the adjoining drawing room. Reception Lucy Bannall visited the restaurant ten days after it first opened. After a mix up with orders, she was disappointed with the amuse-bouche, but thought the food was \\"marvellous\\" by the time she reached her main course. Overall, she felt like it was a bit \\"erratic\\" but couldn't pinpoint exactly why she felt that way. The restaurant was criticised as being too sophisticated for Glasgow, something which Ramsay responded to after the closure by saying \\"I'd relish the challenge to open up in Glasgow again but I wouldn‚Äôt do fine dining, not a three or four course dinner. We were setting the criteria too high and that‚Äôs my fault\\". =Awards and ratings= Amaryllis was awarded a Michelin star in 2002, which had been previously awarded to another restaurant at One Devonshire Gardens since 1995.

The Megaupload legal case concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. On 20 January 2012 Hong Kong Customs froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company. Arrests in New Zealand Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the New Zealand Police arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at Coatesville near Auckland on Friday, 20 January 2012 (NZDT, UTC+13). This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering. The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom. Assets worth $17 million including art works and cars were seized. The four men arrested were Kim Dotcom (founder; 38 years old, from Germany), Finn Batato (Chief marketing officer (CMO); 38, from Germany), Mathias Ortmann (Chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder; 40, from Germany) and Bram van der Kolk (29, from the Netherlands). The number of police officers involved in this operation was about 80 according to Dotcom or 20 to 30 according to the New Zealand police. On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions. The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that \\"he was denied due to the risk [that] Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn't be extradited to face the charges\\". On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the High Court of New Zealand upheld the decision to deny bail. On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom, saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized. On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the extradition to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court. On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG and Toyota Vellfire that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody. A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated \\"I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter,\\" as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US. On 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the search warrants used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying \\"The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.\\" On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard. In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013. In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012. On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing was set for July 2014. On 8 September 2014, the Court of Appeal ruled that the New Zealand Police is to return seized electronic devices unencrypted back to Dotcom and those involved. Basis of indictment The first page of the indictment, listing the defendants The indictment alleged that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses. Media reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's operating model as being evidence of criminal intent: # In practice, the \\"vast majority\\" of users do not have any significant long term private storage capability. Continued storage is dependent upon regular downloads of the file occurring. Files not downloaded are rapidly removed in most cases, whereas popular downloaded files are retained. (items 7 ‚Äì 8) # Because only a small portion of users pay for storage, the business is dependent upon advertising. Adverts are primarily viewed when files are downloaded and the business model is therefore not based upon storage but upon maximising downloads. (items 7 ‚Äì 8) # Persons indicted have \\"instructed individual users how to locate links to infringing content on the Mega Sites ... [and] ... have also shared with each other comments from Mega Site users demonstrating that they have used or are attempting to use the Mega Sites to get infringing copies of copyrighted content.\\" (item 13) # Persons indicted, unlike the public, are not reliant upon links to stored files, but can search the internal database directly. It is claimed they have \\"searched the internal database for their associates and themselves so that they may directly access copyright-infringing content\\". (item 14) # A comprehensive takedown method is in use to identify child pornography, but not deployed to remove infringing content. (item 24) # Infringing users did not have their accounts terminated, and the defendants \\"made no significant effort to identify users who were using the Mega Sites or services to infringe copyrights, to prevent the uploading of infringing copies of copyrighted materials, or to identify infringing copies of copyrighted works\\" (item 55‚Äì56) # An incentivising program was adopted encouraging the upload of \\"popular\\" files in return for payments to successful uploaders. (item 69e et al.) # Defendants explicitly discussed evasion and infringement issues, including an attempt to copy and upload the entire content of YouTube. (items 69i-l. YouTube: items 69 i,j,l,s) = Counter arguments advanced = Schmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout. Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as \\"novel theories\\" of the law) and could be challenged in court. An L.A. Times analysis stated that the author was \\"struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious\\"; likewise a TechDirt analysis concluded that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of \\"flaunting the law\\", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could \\"come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services\\". Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included: :* Indictment cites lack of a site search as evidence supporting criminality, but in other copyright cases having a site search has been described as evidence in support of criminality and in Atari v. RapidShare _not_ having a site search was agreed by the court as evidence of responsible activity given that some infringing content might exist and be searched for if one existed. In the case of Isohunt, the presence of a search feature was interpreted as evidence of inducement. TechDirt commented that \\"To use the lack of a feature, that previously was shown to be a problem, as evidence of a conspiracy is crazy. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\\" :* The \\"top 100\\" list excluded copyrighted titles, but the indictment claims this was evidence of concealing, rather than avoiding downloads of, infringing materials. :* The indictment asserts as evidence that no effort was made to identify infringing files or users, in other words by acts of omission. But federal court rulings repeatedly agree that no duty exists to search these out. In particular, in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. the Supreme Court looked at \\"substantial noninfringing uses\\"; mere lack of monitoring was not by itself sufficient to show wrongdoing or inducement. It may not be possible (or reasonable to require) the host to know and identify what activity is legitimate or not, as file sharing may be used by many content creators. :* Deletion after a limited period of non-download is suggested as evidence of a motive. But many legitimate sites such as Imgur remove unused content after a while to free up server space. If files were routinely deleted after a short period it could equally suggest legitimate use - because it serves users who share legitimately for a short while, and enforces removal afterwards. :* Much of the indictment, in the words of one analysis, \\"seems to be based on the simple assumption that encouraging more usage means they must be encouraging infringement\\", in other words there should be evidence of actual wrongdoing, not merely evidence of popular use. Many legitimate files are popular and popularly shared, and an assumption that paid use largely equates to infringing use would need evidence. :* Failure to remove all links following a takedown request is often legitimate. For example the same content may be uploaded by legitimate and illegitimate users. Removing the infringing link does not affect legitimate uploaders. Removing the infringing file would wrongfully cause it to be deleted for legitimate users too. Similarly, once child pornography is identified, it is always illegal for all users. But other material may be legal for some users and not for others. So the fact one case requires file removal and the other only requires link removal may well be correct conduct. :* The indictment includes money laundering charges. But these include \\"basic payments\\" for web hosting, suggesting \\"lumping in\\" ‚Äî adding matters that are in no way illegal to make a case look bad. :* Megaupload had indicated willingness to attend court in the U.S. already, and answer civil cases. =Safe harbor provisions= The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has actual knowledge and does nothing about it. In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy ‚Äì the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives: > ... are willfully infringing copyrights themselves on these systems; have > actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing (or > alternatively know facts or circumstances that would make infringing > material apparent); receive a financial benefit directly attributable to > copyright-infringing activity where the provider can control that activity; > and have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright infringing > material from servers they control.Paragraph 20, page 9 of the indictment Prosecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as \\"VV.\\" Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted. In a television interview with 3 News, Kim Dotcom denied being a \\"piracy king\\", and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload. Criminal defense action Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of Ira P. Rothken, an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case. Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Bennett, who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case. On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client. As of 23 January, barrister Paul Davison QC was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand. At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm Quinn Emanuel, retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the United States Department of Justice to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this \\"conflict of interest\\" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments. Techdirt argued that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of \\"flouting the law\\", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could \\"come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services\\". Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, described the Megaupload case as \\"a depressing display of abuse of government authority\\". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the \\"deeply unconstitutional effect\\" of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data. Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, \\"If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over.\\" The defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial. In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement. In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful. A second brief points out numerous legal errors in the indictment, declaring it \\"an experiment in stretching U.S. criminal law well past the breaking point.\\" p. 2 Data retention Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users. On 20 January 2012, the Justice Department stated that \\"It is important to note that Mega clearly warned users to keep copies of any files they uploaded\\" adding that \\"Megaupload.com expressly informed users through its Frequently Asked Questions ('FAQs') and its Terms of Service that users have no proprietary interest in any of the files on Megaupload's servers, they assume the full risk of complete loss or unavailability of their data, and that Megaupload can terminate site operations without prior notice.\\" On 27 January 2012, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride wrote: > The Mega Servers are not in the actual or constructive custody or control of > the United States, but remain at the premises controlled by, and currently > under the control of, Carpathia and Cogent. Should the defendants wish to > obtain independent access to the Mega Servers, or coordinate third-party > access to data housed on Mega Servers, the issue must be resolved directly > with Cogent or Carpathia. In response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release stating > Carpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on > MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing > on such servers to MegaUpload's customers.

Please do not contact Carpathia > Hosting. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data. On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over 9,000 USD a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that 35 million USD had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement. Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the United States Department of Justice and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks attributed to Anonymous. Gizmodo concurred that it was \\"almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled DDoS [Distributed Denial of Service] attack‚Äîand easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time\\", commenting that \\"if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more\\". Links posted in chatrooms and on Twitter, when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon. On 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others. According to the Russian state-runBurton, C., Drake, A. Hitting the Headlines In Europe, A Country-By-Country Guide to Effective Media Relations.

Other reactions Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping \\"criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works\\". \\"The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states\\" in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement. Web organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of file sharing, cloud storage, and Internet commerce.Antipiracy Case Sends Shivers Through Some Legitimate Storage Sites (New York Times, 20 January 2012) Various commentators including John C. Dvorak, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Sanchez have written on the topic as well, particularly as it relates US government powers to take down a web site without a trial, even without new laws like SOPA. In fact, the U.S. Dept of Justice was able to rely on PRO-IP, a law passed back in 2008, in order to shut down Megaupload. People who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service. Examples cited in the media included staff at public interest group Public Knowledge who used it for large files, and Android cellphone software writers who described it as \\"one of the best ways to distribute [software] ... There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest\\". In response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating \\"All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally.\\" Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded. Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States-based IP addresses. BTJunkie, a website indexing torrent files, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012. The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors, and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering streaming video links, closed on 7 February 2012. However, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with MediaFire's CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because \\"Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don't have a business built on copyright infringement.\\"22 January 2012, MediaFire CEO: Unlike Megaupload, our business model isn‚Äôt built on piracy, CloudBeat A spokesperson for RapidShare similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that \\"file hosting itself is a legitimate business\\", pointing out that Microsoft's OneDrive operates on a similar basis.20 January 2012, RapidShare \\"not concerned\\" about Megaupload takedown, Ars Technica References Category:2012 in law Category:2012 in New Zealand Category:Kim Dotcom Category:New Zealand case law Category:Law enforcement in New Zealand Category:2012 in New Zealand law Category:New Zealand‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Megaupload legal case"},{"id":"36627339","text":"Eli S.

The game was played at the Memorial Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi between Mississippi Valley State and Jackson State. Early life Ron Pinkney was born to Robert Pinkney and Catherine Staton at Freedmans Hospital in Washington, DC on Sunday, May 26, 1935. He was raised in Annapolis, Maryland and attended Stanton Elementary School and graduated from Bates High School in Annapolis. He attended Morgan State University in Baltimore and later the Baltimore School of Engineering. Journalist and radio career Pinkney's first journalist job was an Annapolis correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper in 1955. His first broadcasting job was on radio station WANN in Annapolis, MD. He was a Dee Jay at WEBB in Baltimore, MD from 1960‚Äì1962.WEBB In 1963, while a deejay in Maryland, he began a career in sportscasting at his alma mater, Bates High School. He hosted two daily sports shows and did play by play at football and basketball games. He did his first college broadcasts at Maryland State (University of MD-Eastern Shore) and Delaware State University in 1964. Coaching legend Vernon \\"Skip\\" McClain's MSU Hawks teams were aired twice on WANN Radio in Annapolis. The Hawks were Black College Football National champions during this era. Pinkney became the Drive Time morning newscaster at WOL, the top rated station in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. He later was promoted to the News Director and employed three other on-air newscasters. From 1968 to 1970, he was the voice of Morgan State football on WEBB, when the Golden Bears were coached by the legendary head coach Earl Banks, and featured future NFL stars Raymond Chester (Oakland Raiders), CB Mark Washington (Dallas Cowboys) and prominent alumnus William Rhoden, a track star, and New York Times columnist. The Bears enjoyed a 33-game winning streak from 1967-1970 when Sam Lacy, Afro-American newspapers, sportswriter George Taliaferro, a former star halfback and Big Ten All-American at Indiana (NFL Baltimore Colts), and Ralph Jones (son of Grambling president R.W.E. Jones) were color commentators in the broadcasting booth. Television years Pinkney was the first black sportscaster to work a televised broadcast when he covered the famed Orange Blossom Classic, the Black college football spectacular set in Miami, Florida in the Orange Bowl arena. It was a closed circuit television production pitting the host Florida A&M; University versus Jacksonville State University, Alabama. The FAMU Rattlers Hall of Fame head coach and then athletic director Alonza \\"Jake\\" Gaither handpicked him to work with another popular Atlanta broadcaster, Chico Renfro. The game was piped into the campus of the Florida A&M; and Jacksonville State University, Alabama (the first white school to play in the All-black classic). Pinkney was hired as a weekend sportscaster at WTTG, channel 5 (Washington, DC) and teamed with Connie Chung, the weekend news anchor and Maury Povich, who anchored the week night sports show. Pinkney hosted a weekly half-hour black news program on Saturday nights from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm. He later became the weekend sportscaster on the 10:00 pm newscast from 1970-1973. From 1971-1974, Pinkney was brought in to perform play by play duties for the syndicated Grambling University football games. He worked with the iconic sports information director Collie Nicholson, who masterminded the Tigers rise to national prominence. Grambling football was under the guidance of the legendary Hall of fame coach Eddie Robinson, who went on to become one of the top all-time winningest coaches in all of football. He replaced another famous athlete and actor Fred \\"The Hammer\\" Williamson who was the lone announcer in 1970. Pinkney assumed the solo role in the Grambling booth in 1971. In 1972, former Dallas Cowboys runningback Don Perkins was added as a color commentator. Los Angeles sports writer Betty Smith, considered the first woman sideline reporter was brought on board. Grambling football games were seen in ninety-four markets on a one-hour taped delay. In 1974, Pinkney became the Sports Director of the Mutual Black Network in Washington, DC. He was the play by play voice of the MBN Black College Game of the Week. The fourteen- game package was a historic first for Black college sports coverage. Joining the broadcast team were former NFL star Roger Brown in 1975 and Tom Gatewood (Notre Dame)in 1977. The games were aired through 1979. Pinkney was the Sports Director for National Black Network (NBN) from 1979-1991. Edd Hayes with Ron Pinkney at CIAA Tournament ABC TV broadcast three HBCU games with Pinkney and Don Perkins handling the play by play and color commentary, thus earning Pinkney the distinction of being the first African American play by play announcer on a major television network. That game pitted Mississippi Valley State versus Jackson State in Jackson, Mississippi. Pinkney was selected to head the MBN coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, and he covered the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles for National Black Network. (Dr. Leroy T. Walker, North Carolina Central University was named head coach of the US contingency). In 1978, Pinkney was the color commentator for the CIAA Invitational Tournament held at the Norfolk Scope in Virginia (Les Keiter did play by play). In 1979, NBC-TV was in the second year of coverage of the Black college historic tournament when he did play by play. It was the first regional television broadcast for the Peacock Network and the CIAA. Joining Pinkney in the broadcast booth were ex-North Carolina Central great and Boston Celtics Hall of Famer Sam Jones. The tournament highlight was Virginia Union's men's victory over Norfolk State. Dave Robbins, a white coach, won his first CIAA title which came at the expense of the Spartans under Hall of Fame coach Lucious Mitchell (he guided Kentucky State's men's team to the second three- peat championships in the NAIA history (1970‚Äì1972)). Pinkney finished his fifty-five-year career at Hampton University as the play by play commentator for basketball and football games.

He played professional football for the Chicago Staleys. Barker served as the head football coach at Cornell College and Franklin & Marshall College as well as starting the wrestling programs at Michigan and Cornell College. College career At Iowa State University, Barker was a star both on the football field and wrestling mat. Under head football coach Charles Mayser, Barker anchored the offensive line from the guard position. Career highlights were being named first team All-Missouri Valley in 1917 and All- American, All-Western team, and All-Missouri Valley in 1919. In his collegiate wrestling career, Barker went 10‚Äì1‚Äì1, including five pins. In 1920 and 1921 he won the intercollegiate championship in the 175-pound weight class; this is the predecessor to the NCAA championship.1925 Michiganensian, page 193. Professional career After graduation Barker received a telegram from George Halas with an offer to play football for the Chicago Staleys, who would eventually become the Bears, of the American Professional Football Association. Barker, without a job or money, accepted the offer and played the 1921 season for the Staleys. This made Barker the first Cyclone to ever play football professionally. That season marked two major landmarks for the team, the inaugural Bears‚ÄìPackers rivalry game and the Staleys winning the league championship. After his one season in the professional ranks Barker realized there was no money or future in playing football, so he moved back to Ames to be an assistant coach at his alma mater, Iowa State under Sam Willaman. Coaching career Barker began his coaching career as a football assistant at Iowa State for the 1922 season. The following season he was hired to form the inaugural wrestling program at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa in addition to being an assistant football coach. In 1923 Barker was hired by the University of Michigan to repeat the same process, form a wrestling program and serve as an assistant football coach. In 1925, Barker was again hired by Cornell, this time to serve as head football coach, head wrestling coach, as well as athletic director. Cornell wrestling saw tremendous success under Barker. As a team, the Rams went 73‚Äì48‚Äì2 with six top 20 NCAA finishes during his 36 seasons.http://www.cornellrams.com/stats/Records/Wrestling/Wrestling%20Records.pdf He also coached several wrestlers to great individual success with one NCAA champion in Dale Brand and four future olympians in Kenneth Truckenmiller (1924), Lloyd Appleton (1928), Lyle Morford (1932), and Dale Brand (1936). Appleton won a silver medal at the 158.5 weight class in the freestyle division. Additionally, Barker helped draft the first collegiate wrestling rules and helped plan the first NCAA tournament in 1928. He was also an assistant coach of the 1928 U.S. Olympic Wrestling team.

In 1862 he published his most important work Thought and Language, and in the same year he went on a trip abroad. He attended lectures at the University of Berlin, he studied Sanskrit and visited several Slavic countries. In 1874 he defended his doctoral dissertation entitled Notes on Russian Grammar (). In 1875, he became a professor at the Imperial University of Kharkov. He also presided over the Kharkov Historical- Philological Society (1877‚Äì90) and was a member of the Bohemian Society of Sciences (from 1887). =Work= As a linguist Potebnja specialized in four areas: the philosophy of language, the historical phonetics of the East Slavic languages, etymology, and Slavic historical syntax. His major works on the philosophy of language are Thought and Language ((, 5 edns, 1862, 1892, 1913, 1922, 1926); On the Relation among Some Representations in Language ((, 1864); his doctoral dissertation, From Notes on Russian Grammar (, vol 1, 1874; repr 1958); and the posthumously published Language and Nationality (, in Vestnik Evropy, 1895). He was particularly interested in the relations among language, thought, and reality. Language for him was primarily the means by which the mind ordered the influx of impressions and stimuli. Words carry not only a meaning, but also the past experience of the individual and the nation, through which all new experience is filtered. Thus a word usually has three aspects: an external form, a meaning, and an internal form. It is through the internal form that the objective world is subjectivized. In many cases the internal form is rooted in myth and, hence, acts as a bridge between language and folklore (with its symbols). These ideas constitute the framework of Potebnja's master's thesis, On Some Symbols in Slavic Folk Poetry (, 1860; expanded edn 1914), and his monumental work Obiasneniia malorusskikh i srodnykh narodnykh pesen (Explanations of Little Russian and Related Folk Songs}}, 2 vols, 1883, 1887). With time the consciousness of a word's internal form fades, and one of the tasks of literature is to restore this consciousness. According to this theory, literature is a hierarchy of genres; the simplest ones (the proverb, riddle, and fable) directly recall or renew the word's internal form, and the other genres do so in a more complicated, sometimes hardly detectable, way through a complex system of subjective (in poetry) or seemingly objective (in the novel) images. Potebnia's principal works on this subject were published posthumously: From Lectures on the Theory of Literature: The Fable, the Adage, the Proverb (, 1894; repr 1970; Transl. into Ukrainian in 1930), From Notes on the Theory of Literature: Poetry and Prose, Tropes and Figures, Poetic and Mythical Thought (, Addenda, 1905; repr 1970), and Preliminary Remarks ... on L. Tolstoy and F. Dostoevsky (, in Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva, vol 5, 1914). Regarding language as an individual's or a nation's only possible means of perceiving the world and of thinking, Potebnja protested vehemently against denationalization in general and the Russification of Ukrainians in particular, and equated this process with spiritual and intellectual disintegration. Potebnja's philosophy of language is rooted in Wilhelm von Humboldt's romantic idealism, but he was also influenced by J. Herbart's and H. Lotze's associative psychology, and particularly by Heymann Steinthal's psycholinguistic writings. Potebnja viewed the history of a language as the history of its dialects and used the concept of phonetic law, although he often tried to find a psychological basis for the concept. He recognized the existence of a proto-Rus‚Äô language, but located the beginning of its disintegration into dialects back in prehistoric times. He made many discoveries in Ukrainian historical phonetics, such as the primordial d≈æ < dj alteration, the so-called second pleophony, and the conditions for the alternation e:o. He was the first to propose the theory that diphthongs were a transitional stage between Old Ruthenian o, e, and Little Russian (i.e. Modern Ukrainian) language. As an etymologist, Potebnja paid much attention to semantic development and the history of words against an expansive historical, folkloric, and psychological background. His major etymological writings were collected in K istorii zvukov russkago iazyka (Toward a History of the Sounds in the Russian Language, vols 2‚Äì4, 1880‚Äì1, 1883). His annotations to Slovo o polku Ihorevi (1878; repr 1914) are a brilliant synthesis of the etymological, folkloristic, and historical approaches. From the 1870s Potebnja concentrated on the study of the historical syntax of the Slavic languages against a comparative Indo-European background. His Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike contains his writings on predicate forms and the participle (vol 2, 1874; rev edn 1888; repr 1958), the noun and the adjective (vol 3, 1899; repr 1968), and the verb and indeclinable words (vol 4, 1941; rev edn 1978). Before his work the field of Slavic historical syntax consisted mostly of inventories of constructions collected from literary monuments of various periods. He revised it to create a broadly drawn picture of category and construction changes tied to changes in ways of thinking, by integrating historical, dialectal, and folkloric materials. His comparative analysis uncovered remnants of prehistoric syntax in later constructions and reinterpretations of archaic constructions in later syntactic systems; that is, it demonstrated the historical character of syntactic categories and parts of speech. Anton Budilovich equated Potebnia's contribution to the field of historical syntax with C. Darwin's contribution to the study of the origin of species. Potebnja was far ahead of his contemporaries and not very popular during his lifetime. In the field of historical syntax his only immediate followers were A. Popov and, to a certain extent, Dmitrii Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky (in his outline of Russian syntax). His ideas on literature were adopted as a theoretical framework by the ‚ÄòKharkiv school‚Äô (B. Lezin, Vasyl Khartsiiev, A. Gornfeld, T. Rainov, Oleksa Vetukhiv, and others) grouped around the serial Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (8 vols, 1907‚Äì23). They also had a significant impact on the aesthetics of the Russian Symbolists (particularly A. Bely) and an indirect influence on the Ukrainian Symbolists. In 1945 the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (now NANU) was named after Potebnia. Collections of his works on accentology (1973) and esthetics and poetics (1976, 1985) have been published.

She was built by Cammell Laird in England in 1956 and attacked and sunk by the CIA in Borneo in 1958. San Flaviano had a sister ship, , built by Cammell Laird in the same year. The two ships were part of a substantial investment programme to renew Eagle Oil's fleet with larger and more modern tankers. Between 1950 and 1960 the company took delivery of at least 16 new tankers. Bombed and sunk by the CIA San Flavianos career was cut short in 1958. On 28 April San Flaviano was in Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo, when a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, bombed and sank her. San Flaviano had nearly finished discharging a cargo of crude oil, leaving her tanks full of highly flammable gas. The CIA aircraft hit San Flaviano with one or more 500-pound (227-kg) bombs amidships on her starboard side. Fire and explosions spread rapidly along that side of the ship, either destroying her starboard lifeboats or making them inaccessible. Nevertheless, her officers and crew launched both port lifeboats within four minutes, successfully evacuating everyone including a passenger, the Chief Officer's wife. San Flaviano sank near the entrance of Balikpapan harbour. In response, Royal Dutch Shell suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan and evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore. Most of San Flavianos complement were also evacuated to Singapore, travelling on two oil tankers of Anglo-Saxon Petroleum, another of Royal Dutch Shell's British subsidiaries. The first 26 from San Flaviano left that same day on , which had had a narrow escape in the same air raid. Another 24 from San Flaviano followed a few days later on , leaving the Master (Captain Jack Bright) and his senior officers as the only people from San Flaviano still in Balikpapan. In June 1958 both the Indonesian and UK governments claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels. In fact only the radio operator was from the Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi. The B-26, its bombs and its pilot, former United States Army Air Forces officer William H. Beale, were sent by the CIA as part of US covert support for the rebellion. The CIA pilots had orders to target commercial shipping to drive foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and destabilising the Indonesian government of President Sukarno. Shell's suspension of operations and partial evacuation of personnel was exactly what the CIA attack was intended to achieve. For some months previously, UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd had supported US policy to aid Permesta. On 6 May 1958, more than a week after the CIA sank San Flaviano, Lloyd secretly told US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that this was still his position. On 18 May, Indonesian forces shot down a different Permesta B-26 and captured its CIA pilot, Allen Pope. Nevertheless, in June 1958 both Indonesia and the UK publicly claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels, concealing the CIA involvement of which both governments were well aware.

Ott also had an elder sister and a sister Margaret who died in 1870 aged four months. He trained as an accountant and became a fellow of the New Zealand Accountants' and Auditors' Association. Ott's family came from the German village of D√∂rnach which is these days part of Pliezhausen in T√ºbingen. His uncle (Johan Jacob) Jacob Ott came to Dunedin in the early 1850s. Jacob was a shoemaker and came out employed by the Lutheran Mission under Johann Friedrich Heinrich Wohlers. Not a missionary himself, Jacob later owned the Whitehouse Hotel in Waikiwi. Jacob financed two of his siblings to follow him out to New Zealand; his sister Maria Barbara who appears on the shipping list as Elizabeth as well as William's father (Johan Georg) George. The pair arrived in Dunedin from London on the Maori on 16 April 1857. William Ott was elected onto the Invercargill Borough Council in 1900. In April 1910, he was elected unopposed to the Invercargill mayoralty. A year later, he was re-elected unopposed. Ott did not contest the 1912 mayoral election; it was won by William Benjamin Scandrett, who defeated Andrew Bain. Mayor William Ott seated in the centre of the front row During his mayoralty, he opened the electric Invercargill tram network, with the Prime Minister Joseph Ward in attendance.

It was destroyed by Israeli bombing during the attack on Gaza in 2014. The mosque was located along Baghdad Street near the main western entrance of the Shuja'iyya district in Gaza City, Palestine.Sadeq, Mu'en. Madrasa of Amir Bardabak (el-Mahkama Mosque) . Excerpt from Sadeq's Pilgrimage, Sciences and Sufism: Islamic Art in the West Bank and Gaza provided by Museum With No Frontiers. 2004-2012. History The mosque was built in 1455 on the orders of Sayf al-Din Birdibak al-Ashrafi, the dawadar of the Mamluk sultan Sayf al-Din Inal. Birdibak was highly religious and convened an annual conference to discuss the hadith of the 9th-century Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Bukhari. He reached high positions within the Mamluk state and built two other Friday mosques in Damascus and Cairo. The Mahkamah Mosque was originally part of a madrasa (\\"religious school\\"), and education served as the building's principal function. Prayers were also held regularly and on Fridays. During Ottoman rule between the 16th and early 20th centuries, the school functioned as a courthouse for the city's qadis (\\"judges\\"), hence its Arabic name al-Mahkamah (\\"the Court.\\")Sharon, 2009, p. 166 In the late 19th-century Swiss scholar Max van Berchem found a Kufic inscription fixed over the mihrab (\\"pulpit\\") of the mosque that belonged to the tombstone of Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Hashimi,Sharon, 2009, p. 41 a member of the Hashemite family who had died in Gaza in the late 9th- century.Sharon, 2009, p. 44 On top of the mosque's entrance is the foundation inscription crediting Birdibak for the mosque's construction and honoring Sultan Inal.Sharon, 2009, p. 167 During the British Mandate period following World War I it served as boy's religious school under the name Madrasa al- Shuja‚Äòiyya al-Amiriyya. The mosque was destroyed by the Israeli airforce in Operation \\"Protective Edge\\". Architecture The mosque was constructed in the Burji Mamluk style.Shahin, 2005, p. 437. It serves as a unique example of Mamluk architecture, having been highly influenced by earlier Ayyubid mosque- madrasas. In particular, the niches of the northern facade strongly resemble the architectural elements of Ayyubid structures in Egypt and Syria.Sadeq, 2007, p. 208. The complex consists of a central sahn (\\"courtyard\\") situated 1.2 meters below street level. There are several ablution places in the courtyard area. North of the courtyard is the facade where the main entrance is located. The entrance portal is topped by a pointed arch with floral decorations. The northern part of the mosque consists of the entrance hall and three other rectangular-shaped rooms each measuring 3.77 meters by 3.69 meters. Each room, including the entrance hall, is topped by a small dome. The southern part of the complex was laid out in a similar manner, but is in ruins. The rooms on both sides of the mosque served as lodging for the sheikh and his students and provided other services as well. This particular layout makes the Mahkamah Mosque the only madrasa of its kind still standing in Gaza. The courtyard is bordered to the southwest by the iwan. The iwan is divided into three sections and is the largest part of the mosque complex. The central portion serves as the principal section and is covered by a fan-shaped cross vault. It contains the mihrab (\\"niche\\" that indicates the qibla which is the direction towards Mecca) and the minbar (\\"pulpit\\"). The minbar is adorned with marble paneling, floral motifs and Qur'anic inscriptions. The main section is bordered by two smaller outer sections with barrel vaulting and pointed arches connecting both structures with the main section. In the northwest, a smaller Mamluk-era iwan that previously faced the main iwan is extant. The western facade is mostly in ruins as well. In the northwestern corner of the mosque is the Mamluk-style minaret. The base of the minaret is rectangular, while the shaft is composed of two octagonal stories topped by the octagonal muezzin's gallery. The sides of the base contain niches that \\"alleviate the austerity of the structure\\" according to Islamic art researcher Mu'en Sadeq. The octagonal levels of the minaret's body are designed with embrasures decorated with translucent floral and geometric ornamentation. The embrasures allow light and ventilation into the interior spiral staircase that leads to the muezzin's gallery which rests on stone muqarnas.

The residual bicycle brands are now owned by Tandem Group History The former head office of Elswick Hopper, at the junction of Brigg Road and Holydyke in Barton-upon-Humber, while being converted into apartments, August 2006 Frederick Hopper was born in 1859, and in 1880 started a bicycle repair business in a former blacksmith's shop in Barton-upon-Humber. He then started manufacturing bicycles, and by 1906 F. Hopper & Co. Ltd was employing 400 people. By 1912 the company was exporting bicycles all over the British Empire, with particularly strong export markets in Australia, India, Japan and South Africa making it a major manufacturing company. In 1910, Hopper and a series of investors had bought the bankrupt Elswick Cycle Company, which took its name from Elswick, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne where it was based. Run as two rival companies, in 1913 Hopper bought out his fellow investors and closed the Elswick site, merging the two companies at the Barton-upon-Humber in 1914 under the title Elswick Hopper Cycle and Motor Company. The Barton- upon-Humber site began to boom, producing both bicycles and many of their own components, where if he needed more production capacity Fred would simply construct another building. In 1936, after the death of Fred, Elswick Hopper was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In 1974 Elswick Hopper plc began a period of expansion, purchasing Wearwell Cycles, which had been established before 1872. In 1978 the company acquired Falcon Cycles, which was operated as a subsidiary before being later merged at Barton-upon-Humber. By the mid-1980s, Elswick Hopper plc was a diversified conglomerate, spanning manufacturing, engineering, and distribution. But the company was losing money at both group and subsidiary level, and was in desperate need of reorganisation. Under a new Chief Executive, the group company renamed itself Elswick plc in 1984, and renamed its bicycle division Falcon Cycles, the name of its most popular selling sports bicycle brand. Ending production of bicycles under the Elswick brand in the same year, all bicycle manufacture was moved to a new factory at Brigg. In 1987, the company bought the manufacturing and wholesale distribution businesses of rival Holdsworth, which included both the Holdsworth and Claud Butler brands. However, by the late 1980s cheap imports from Asia were flooding the UK market, and with a severe decline in the bicycle components industry, the company was reliant on importing those as well, and only assembling at Brigg. By this point, production had dwindled to just under 120,000 bicycles per annum. Having rebuilt Elswick plc as printing and packaging business focussed on self adhesive labels and garment labels, the group sold the bicycle division to Casket Ltd., a company who controlled the Townsend brand. Having sold the dilapidated Barton-upon-Humber site, in September 1994 the residual Elswick plc sold itself to Ferguson International, which itself went into liquidation in January 2000. Present Casket Ltd with their greater buying power enabled an expansion of the Falcon brand, but themselves ran into difficulty after buying a German-based bicycle manufacturer. Sold to Tandem Group plc in November 1995, the company is now a division of Falcon, which has annual sales in excess of 300,000 bicycles.

It accounts for the movement of more than $32 billion worldwide. A United Nations international protocol against human trafficking has been signed by 117 different countries, among them Argentina. This treaty obligates the countries that are party to it to prevent and combat human trafficking and to assist and protect the victims of it. It also encourages countries to cooperate among themselves to achieve these objectives. In Argentina this crime is punishable by law. There are many laws that cover this problem, but the crime continues to occur. An important legal development in this area was the enactment of law number 26.364, which tries to achieve what this international protocol seeks and provides penalties of 3 to 15 years in prison. Despite being a serious felony, in Argentina there are no official statistics on this crime, only for cases prosecuted. But it is known that the country is a source, transit and destination for trafficking. As a means of preventing trafficking, in July 2011 the government issued an order that banned the publication of explicit advertisements of sexual solicitation in the newspapers. A study from 2012 showed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is changing to evade the law, by allowing exploited women to keep their identification documents or allowing them to leave the location of exploitation, to make the trafficking more difficult to prove. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 1\\" in 2018.  Basic elements of trafficking  # \\"Recruitment\\"; this can be by deception or by force, and involves a recruiter. # \\"Transport\\"; from here to the site of exploitation, the victim is subjected to coercion. Transfer may be between regions or other countries. Colluding in this process are transporters, corrupt officials, and intermediaries to the trafficking. # The \\"operation\\"; here the victim is subjected to exploitation by the pimp or the operator, who takes a totally illegal right of property over the victim.  Federal legislation  There are many laws that touch on the theme of trafficking; historically the Ley Palacios of 1913 was the first law in the protection to protect victims of sexual exploitation and slavery, as well as to punish those responsible. It was the first legislation in the entire American continent and signified a great advance in human rights in the country. The International Day Against Human Trafficking commemorates the enactment of this law.D√≠a Internacional contra la Trata de Personas [Argentina.com.ar], AEN. 25 de Septiembre de 2009 Argentina, as a signatory to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, on April 29, 2008 passed Law 26.364 for the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons and Assistance to its Victims. According to the dictates of international protocol and emphasizing care and rights of victims and differentiating between adults and minors. It is in accordance with the codes of international protocol and places emphasis on assistance and rights of victims and their differentiation between adults and minors. * Law 26.364 defines trafficking as: * Victims can not be punished for committing any offense that is a direct result of being trafficked. In the case of foreigners, no sanctions are applied nor can their contracts be voided because of infractions of immigration legislation if the violations are due trafficking. * This law sets criminal and procedural rules, with penalties of 3‚Äì6 years in the case of trafficking of adults and 4 to 10 years if there are aggravating circumstances such as: # The person who commits the crime is parent or grandparent, spouse, related in a direct line, brother, guardian, person living, tutor, in charge of education or a caretaker, minister of any religion recognized or not, or public official; # The act was committed by three or more people in an organized manner; # There were three or more victims.  Victims  Trafficking generates victims who in the majority of cases live under inhuman conditions; to be a victim of trafficking involves slavery, in which the trafficker gains a totally illegal right of property right over the victim or reduces her to the level of indentured servitude for the purpose of economic exploitation. In Argentina the most common victims of forced labor are in underground sweatshops are textile or as farm laborers and in other cases domestic workers. As for sexual exploitation that principally affects women, adolescents, and children, they are mostly found in the country's brothels. = Forced labor = Forced labor includes a variety of trades, but the sectors most affected are rural and textile labor.  Textile industry  According to the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC ‚Äì Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos), unregistered labor in apparel approaches 75%. The greater number of these workers are black, which promotes the spread of forced labor. According to Gustavo Vera, president of the cooperative La Alameda (which represents and defends textile workers), \\"We know that there are about 3,000 underground sweatshops in the Federal Capital\\" and he adds \\"There are also some 15,000 underground sweatshops in the first tier of the Buenos Aires suburbs and several thousand more in Greater Buenos Aires, Rosario, Mendoza and Cordoba. These workshops include a population of about 200,000 people who are reduced to forced labor or slave labor, which is the same as forced labor but worse, because the will of the workers is controlled 24 hours a day by the employer.\\" According to the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Argentina is classified among the 74 countries in which child labor and forced labor is still practiced today. The Bureau's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor mentions \\"garments\\" as one of 11 other products in Argentina. Furthermore, in one of its reports on the worst forms of child labor, The U.S. Department of Labor states that \\"Argentina has not adopted a list of hazardous occupations that are prohibited to children, and appears to lack programs that target working children in all relevant sectors.\\"  Rural  In Argentina, one of the first protections of the farm laborer was born in 1940 with the enactment of the Estatuto del Pe√≥n [Statute of farm laborers] which gave wage laborers (jornaleros) all the rights of workers (trabajadores). Later, complementary laws were added. The government of Cristina Kirchner signed the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) prohibiting the forced recruitment of manual labor for the rural labor force. However, there still exist recruiting networks that through deception or physical coercion recruit people who are typically in a vulnerable situation. And they are recruited from marginal rural areas of Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Tucuman, Catamarca and Jujuy and from migrant workers from bordering countries such as Chile, Bolivia, and Paraguay. And then they are taken to areas where they do hard labor and live in subhuman conditions. These situations violate the Protocol of San Salvador treaty and International Labour Conference Convention 184. = Sexual abuse =  History  Sexual exploitation was born in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata before the country was even created. After independence in 1875, a law was made regulating prostitution, preventing prostitution of minors, but allowing it if the children were initiated early into this activity. In the late nineteenth century \\"white slavery\\" rings were established that provided women from Central Europe and Russia, who were sold in a sham marriage to a ruffian. They sought to escape poverty and religious persecution that they suffered. And in this country they were forced into prostitution or sold to another pimp. In the early twentieth century, these trafficking organizations tightened their ties with power. This was in order to be protected by law or to avoid problems in case of breaking laws or deception. Because of their great accumulation of wealth through \\"kickbacks\\", they accomplished their mission. Among the customers it is possible to highlight periods of intense European migration that brought primarily single men as main consumers of trafficking, although upper middle class Argentinians also had a high level use of prostitution. By the early twentieth century there were two major international trafficking rings. MILIEU, a trafficking organization of French origin, and La Migdal, or Zwi Migdal, of Jewish origin, formerly called the Varsovia (Warsaw) Jewish Mutual Aid Society ‚Äì This last organization came to an end in 1929 when Raquel Liberman, one of thousands of Polish immigrants enslaved in brothels, reported Zwi Migdal to the authorities. The complaint was taken by a judge, Manuel Rodriguez Ocampo. Especially since another 150 previous complaints were not successful either because of violence against the accusers or police and judicial corruption. This trial against the organization made it possible to make public the treatment suffered by victims. After several periods of closure and opening of brothels, from June 24, 1965, Law 16.666 was put into effect that the practice of prostitution is open and not subject to any form of regulation, this law is in effect to the present day. In practice, this criminal activity is organized on a grand scale and is frequently associated with the illegal drug trade and with arms trafficking. Much of this crime is organized on a global level.  Current status  At present, Argentina is a source, transit, and destination location for trafficking, which means that the victims can be Argentinian or from other countries, that they go through this country, and that some have this as the destination to be illegally exploited. \\"Reclutadores\\" (recruiters) capture the victims through deception or abduction, assisted by \\"marcadores\\" (markers) who pick the victims. Then the circle closes with the \\"proxenetas\\" (pimps) who get their profit from the sexual exploitation of victims. And finally the \\"regentes\\" (managers) or madames of brothels. There are also carriers and secondary dealers concerned with protecting this whole criminal system. In some cases there is some kind of collusion between members of the police, judges, and politicians. The province of the country in which the most women are recruited is Entre Rios, followed by Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Tucuman; usually victims are rotated through brothels across the whole country. The list of destinations includes Buenos Aires and Cordoba, at the head of the list of destinations chosen by the rings, along with La Pampa, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. There are also links to international rings, especially the route to Spain, where young Tucuman women were rescued.  Recruitment  There are many recruiting methods but all are either \\"soft\\", based on fraud and deception, or \\"hard\\", based directly on kidnapping the victims. *Kidnapping: in this crime women are identified and marked. Later they are kidnapped from off the street, they are drugged and transported to a place where they are repeatedly violated for the purpose of sexually exploiting them later. Those who offer resistance are threatened with harming or killing her family. *Deception: in which recruiters take advantage of the poverty or defenselessness of the victim with false offers of employment, moving the victim to another province or country, after which she finds she is to be sexually exploited. There are also cases in which the victim has agreed to work in the sex trade, but then finds out the working and living conditions fall within the category of trafficking. Sometimes these victims only recognize the exploitation after intensive psychological assistance.  Recent studies  A recent study in 2012 of court cases of the Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas [Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Kidnappings and Trafficking in Persons](UFASE) and the Instituto de Estudios Comparados en Ciencias Penales y Sociales [Institute for Comparative Studies in Criminal and Social Sciences] (INECIP) revealed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is mutating into new forms of subjugation of women, to make it more difficult to prove the existence of slavery in bordellos and thus evading the law. This is a result of the enactment of Law 26.364 in April 2008 that strongly penalizes this offense. The victims have their documents in their possession and in many cases are allowed to leave the sites of exploitation, but the subjugation continues to function in another way. Furthermore, the report shows collusion between state, local, police, and judicial entities that \\"legitimizes the activity and leads to its habituation.\\" Some 72% of cases are enslaved in nightclubs like whisker√≠as (undercover brothels), pubs, or pool halls, all enabled by the municipalities, and the other 22% in private apartments. = Underage victims = Worldwide, close to 2.5 million people are victims of some form of trafficking. Between 22% and 50% are girls and boys. The exact figure is unknown because trafficking in children is usually hidden; for this reason, reliable data cannot be obtained. Many of these situations occur within cities or urban areas. For example, trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation occurs with girls and boys working on city streets. Many rural children from rural areas are moved to the cities by the traffickers. According to the Department of State of the United States, that which occurs in the world also occurs in Argentina. Children come from northern provinces, or from bordering countries like Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. Areas with a triple border are a major focus of child trafficking and child labor, especially of children living in border areas and bordering countries. These end up in urban centers of central and south of the country, where child sex tourism is promoted. Others are victims of forced labor in underground sweatshops and agricultural enterprises. Under the new Argentine law, child trafficking is punishable by the maximum penalty for this offense. In addition, penalties can be increased if there are aggravating factors. = Interviews about trafficking = Narrative on trafficking for sexual exploitation: Narrative of labor exploitation:  Court cases  = Case of Marita Veron = One of the more well known cases in Argentina is that of Marita Veron, which was brought to court in 2012 after an intensive search and collection of evidence, where part of the network of this country's web of trafficking for sexual exploitation was discovered. It is known that she left her home on April 3, 2002, and three days later, she was found by police while escaping from a sex party that seems to have been her first destination; she was put on a bus with a group traveling in the direction of Tucuman but never arrived. Later, a witness saw her in one of three Rioja brothels, which the Appeals Chamber of Tucum√°n described as \\"places intended for the practice of prostitution where there is a systematic recruitment of women including by means deprivation of liberty.\\" Since then there has been no more information obtained on the whereabouts of Marita. Marita's mother Susana Trimarco, the principal impulse behind the investigation, has managed to rescue more than 20 women who were victims of trafficking. The Maria de los Angeles Foundation rescues and helps victims of trafficking. The trial over the disappearance of Marita began on February 8, 2012, and indicted 13 people, 7 men and 6 women, who are linked to the kidnapping and to the promotion of prostitution. It brought together more than 150 witnesses. The trial ended on December 11, 2012, and all indicted people were absolved, the mother of Marita Veron will impulse a political trial against the magistrate. = UFASE's statistics = According to statistics taken from August 22, 2008, to March 7, 2012, by the Fiscal Assistance Unit of Kidnappings and Trafficking (UFASE ‚Äì Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas) responsible for assisting the Argentine fiscal units in the processing of kidnappings and trafficking court cases. Some 64% of court cases were for trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation, while the percentages for trafficking for labor exploitation were 5% rural, 1% textile, and 1% begging. As for sexual exploitation, 77% of the victims were female, 19% male, and 4% transgender. In 70% of cases, the method of recruitment was by \\"promises of employment\\", 8% by exploiting the victim's family problems and 8% inducement by romantic relationship, and 3% of cases by the delivery by a family member or acquaintance. Some 52% had no freedom of movement and 45% experienced violence. With regard to the nationality of the victims, 31% were Bolivian, 28% Argentinian, 21% Paraguayan, 10% Dominican, 5% Peruvian, 3% Colombian, and 2% Uruguayan. Source countries for recruitment were 83% in Argentina, 12% in Paraguay, and 1% in Bolivia, while the destination country was 94% for Argentina, 4% Paraguay, and 2% Chile.  Support programs for victims and others  = Office for Rescue and Caring of Victims of Trafficking = According to the new Law 26.364 that was created in August 2008, the \\"Oficina de Rescate y Acompa√±amiento a Personas Damnificadas por el Delito de Trata de Personas [Office of Rescue and Support for People Harmed by the Crime of Trafficking in Persons]\\", is under the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Justice Office. The security forces, professionals in psychology, law, and social work have a similar form. They accompany the victim from the time of their rescue or escape from the place of exploitation and during the investigation of the trafficking crime, later providing support and legal assistance until the moment they give testimony. Victims receive psychological, medical, and legal assistance. Later the victims \\"testify under conditions of special protection and care\\"; this can be via a Gesell chamber or one-way mirror. Victims are \\"not punishable for committing any offense that is a direct result of being trafficked.\\" In the case of foreigners, no sanctions are applied either. = Maria de los Angeles Foundation = Fundaci√≥n Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles [Foundation of Maria of the Angels] is a nonprofit organization that fights against the crime of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The foundation assists victims of sexual exploitation free of charge, and offers legal assistance to victims, counseling for victims and families, and social assistance. It also provides community talks and capacity building for judges, prosecutors, and police. It seeks to prosecute applicable cases under Law 26.364 and to provide psychological support to victims so they can overcome the traumatic situations they have lived through. The foundation was founded by Susana Trimarco in 2007 with the help of the Human Rights Secretariat of Tucuman. Since then this group has achieved the filing of more than 800 court cases, and has found and rescued at least 400 women subjected to sex trafficking without their consent. Susana Trimarco is still searching for her daughter Marita, who fell victim to sex trafficking on April 3, 2002. After investigating the crime of trafficking and its networks, and rescuing many victims, including some under 12 years of age, she decided to create the foundation to help victims and to continue searching for her daughter. The vision of the foundation is to eradicate the trafficking of persons in Argentina. The Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles foundation has offices based in Tucuman and Buenos Aires . The foundation and Susana Trimarco can count a great many accomplishments and awards.

The parameters of the two components are diverse: the \\"level of religiosity\\" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate scientifically, while the \\"level of education\\" is easier to compile, such as official data on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries. Different studies lead to contrasting conclusions regarding the relationship, depending on whether \\"religiosity\\" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, one international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases. Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious. Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades. In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at \\"elite\\" universities, were religious. Studies =Global studies= A Pew Center study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that Jews are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling; Jews also have the highest number of post-secondary degrees per capita (61%). Based on the study data, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both. About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling, Muslims and Hindus have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have graduate and post-graduate degrees. Christians ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling. Christians were found to have the second highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million). According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic Christian churches, in addition to the historical evidence that \\"Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic\\". According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of gender equality in educational attainment, and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the Protestant Reformers in promoting the education of women, which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities. The religiously unaffiliated‚Äîwhich includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as ‚Äúnothing in particular‚Äù‚Äîranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling, and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees. Buddhists have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees. According to the same study \\"there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub- Saharan Africa\\" as Muslim adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts, with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by Christian missionaries during the colonial era for fellow believers. According to a 2015 global survey by Gallup International, the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels. An EU survey finds a positive correlation between leaving school early and believing in a God. In one analysis of World Values Survey data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US. They concluded that \\"these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion\\". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, \\"education raises religious attendance at individual level,\\" while \\"at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere.\\" The authors suggest that \\"this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief,\\" causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations. Statistical analysis of Nobel prizes awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of Nobel laureates were Christians, over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.Baruch A. Shalev, 100 Years of Nobel Prizes (2003), Atlantic Publishers & Distributors , p.57 According to a study that was done by University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln in 1998, 60% of Nobel prize laureates in physics from 1901 to 1990 had a Christian background.Nobel prize winners in physics from 1901 to 1990 Since 1901-2013, 22% of all Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews. By country =Britain= Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both. =India= A survey conducted by the Times of India revealed that 22% of IIT Bombay graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know. =Ireland= In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population. =Spain= In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic. =United States= According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%. Schwadel said, ‚ÄúWith more years of education, you aren‚Äôt relatively more likely to say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt believe in God. But you are relatively more likely to say, ‚ÄòI believe in a higher power.‚Äô‚Äù Differences in educational attainment by religious groups in the U.S., 2001 ARIS data. Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. \\"The irony\\" he states \\"is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education.\\" He found that Hindus, Jews, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Buddhists, and Orthodox ChristiansFaith, Education and Income have the highest levels of education. Catholics, Mormons, and Muslims are at about the national average. Jehovah's Witnesses have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education. Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college. According to the Gallup's 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less. Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher \\"public religiosity\\" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less \\"belief.\\" Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers. Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews ‚Äî Religious, Secular, and Spiritual ‚Äî and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided). Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at \\"elite\\" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At \\"elite\\" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, \\"religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities.\\"Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009). The religiosity of American college and university professors. Sociology of Religion, 70(2):101-129. (EISSN 1759-8818, ISSN 1069-4404) They also found that professors at elite doctoral universities are much less religious than professors teaching in other kinds of institutions with more atheists and agnostics in numbers. However, both groups were still a minority. A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity. Frank Sulloway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Shermer of the California State University conducted a study that found in their polling sample of \\"credentialed\\" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a correlation indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level. Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect. Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. Secularism & Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36. Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than mainline Protestants. He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious. Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education \\"positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life\\", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of \\"exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism\\". Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States. According to a Pew Center study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American Hindus have a graduate and post-graduate degree, followed by Unitarian Universalists (67%), Jews (59%), Anglican (59%), Episcopalians (56%) and Presbyterians (47%) and United Church of Christ (46%). While according to the same study about (43%) of American atheists, and (42%) agnostics, and (24%) of those who say their religion is ‚Äúnothing in particular‚Äù have a graduate and post-graduate degree. In specific religious denominations =Mormons= Studies of Mormons in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending church regularly.Stan L. Albrecht, \\"The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity\\" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU Religious Studies Center, 1998), 286. =Evangelical groups= Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‚Äòfundamentalist‚Äô student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge ‚Äî factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual. In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that \\"Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics.\\" He used SAT scores as a measure of intelligence for this study. =Christian fundamentalists= Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and Christian fundamentalism was found by Burton et al. (1989),Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, Education and Fundamentalism, Review of Religious Research (1989) a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, Protestant residents of Delaware County, Indiana.

In the 1920s, a group of investors led by Clarence J. Sanger had a new vision for a cemetery and proposed their idea to Detroit architect Alvin Harley. After viewing Harley's initial designs, Sanger urged him to make them more grand. Construction began in 1925 and the cemetery began operation in 1929. Harley's plan created a long central boulevard flanked by rectangular sections extending from the main gate. The boulevard ends at a two-story T-shaped mausoleum faced in white marble, set on a white marble base. Above the central entrance is a square two-story tower which houses a grand hall. Directly behind the hall is one of three chapels in the structure. Crypts are housed in wings extending to the east and west of the grand hall. Polar Bear Memorial The state of Michigan dedicated a memorial on May 30, 1930, honoring the U.S. Army's Polar Bear Expedition. It recognizes the efforts of the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (ANREF) against the Bolshevik Red Army in North Russia during 1918 and 1919. The remains of 56 ANREF soldiers exhumed from Russia were on this occasion re-buried in plots surrounding the Polar Bear Monument by sculptor Leon Hermant. Discrimination On August 10, 1960, an honorably discharged 66-year-old World War I veteran, George Vincent Nash, was removed from resting alongside his Caucasian wife at the White Chapel Cemetery. The action took place immediately following the graveside service because Nash was a full-blooded Ho-Chunk (also known as Winnebago) or Native American. The explanation was that 40,000 plot owners \\"had paid for the restriction\\" for the type of people that could be buried at White Chapel Cemetery. According to the cemetery's officials, corpses had to be at least 75% Caucasian to be buried at White Chapel. The governor, G. Mennen Williams, was concerned about the legality of the cemetery's actions. However, the Michigan state legislatures in both 1961 and 1962, failed to pass bills that would have prohibited cemeteries to discriminate who could be interred in them on the basis of race.

The courthouse is located in Enterprise, Oregon. It was built in 1909‚Äì1910 using locally quarried stone. It is a massive High Victorian structure built of local Bowlby stone. The courthouse was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Today, the courthouse still houses Wallowa County government offices. History Wallowa County is located in the northeastern corner of Oregon. It is bordered by Union and Umatilla counties to the west, Union and Baker counties to the south, the state of Washington on the north, and Idaho to the east. The county is bordered geographically by the Wallowa Mountains on the south and west, the Grande Ronde River canyon on the north, and the Snake River and Hells Canyon on the east.McArthur, Lewis A., McArthur, Lewis L., \\"Wallowa County\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 1006.\\"Wallowa County Courthouse\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 18 May 2000.\\"Wallowa County History\\", Oregon Historical County Records Guide, Oregon State Archives, Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, 23 July 2012. The first post office in the Wallowa Valley was established in 1874. The first town in the area was Lostine, which was founded in 1875. The town of Joseph was established in 1879. Wallowa County was formally separated from Union County in February 1887, the same year the town of Enterprise was founded. When the county was first formed, Joseph became the interim county seat. However, Enterprise was selected as the permanent county seat of Wallowa County in 1888.McArthur, Lewis A., McArthur, Lewis L., \\"Enterprise\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 333. Originally, the Wallowa County government rented office space on the second floor of a building on Main Street in Enterprise. In 1898, citizens proposed building a courthouse, but county officials decided it was cheaper to continue renting office space. A decade later, county officials finally decided to build a permanent court building to house county offices. Local citizens contribute $5,000 for construction of the courthouse, but refused to pay until construction reached the second story, ensuring that the courthouse would actually be built as promised by county officials. The contributors also insisted that the total cost of the courthouse be at least $25,000 to ensure the structure would be a well-built landmark for the community. The courthouse was designed by Calvin R. Thornton, an architect from La Grande, Oregon. The construction contract was won by S. R. Haworth for $31,300. Haworth began work on the building in January 1909. The plumbing and heating work was done under a separate sub-contractor, costing an additional $4,592. Thornton moved to Enterprise to supervise to the courthouse construction. However, he was killed in December 1909 when he fell from a scaffold at another job site in Enterprise. As a result, he never saw the finished courthouse. In March 1910, a local furniture company was awarded a $3,183 contract to provide furniture, counters, and bar railings to finish the courthouse. The courthouse opened for business on 5 January 1910. However, construction was not actually completed until May of that year. \\"Historic Wallowa County Courthouse\\", Wallowa County, www.co.wallowa.or.us, Enterprise, Oregon, 2009. Over the years, minor modifications have been made to the courthouse building. For example, the original boiler was replaced in 1927. In the 1970s, several window air conditioning units were installed. Aluminum storm doors were added to the front and rear entrances in 1981. This was accomplished without altering the original wooden entry doors. A concrete handicap-accessible ramp was also added to rear entrance in 1981. Other changes made over the years include adding partitions and paneling, installing carpet, lowered ceiling, and added fluorescent lights. Because the Wallowa County courthouse is one of the few early 20th century county government building in eastern Oregon that has retained its original character, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 14 July 2000. Today, the courthouse is still being used for its original purpose.\\"The Wallowa County Courthouse\\", City of Enterprise, www.enterpriseoregon.org, Enterprise Oregon, 29 July 2012.\\"Wallowa County Courthouse\\", Oregon Historic Sites Database, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 28 July 2012. Structure The Wallowa County courthouse is an imposing stone structure, built in center of Courthouse Square with the main facade facing west. The courthouse was built in the High Victorian style with massive stone facades on all four sides. The building has some Queen Anne elements, such as multiple roof forms, segmental windows arches, and patterned shingles. The courthouse is three stories high including a usable attic. The courthouse also has a full basement. It has a rectangular footprint measuring (east‚Äìwest) by (north‚Äìsouth). The top of the cupola is above ground level. Wallowa County Courthouse main entranceThe perimeter foundation and exterior walls are made of rough-cut Bowlby stone, a type of volcanic tuff. The gray-brown stone was locally quarried. The stone walls are true load-bearing walls. There are stone arches above the windows and main entry doors. The arch keystones and window sills are light gray granite. The courthouse windows are double-hung, one-over-one style in wooden frames. They are arranged in pairs and symmetrically placed on all sides of the building. Some of the original wooden sashes have been replaced by modern vinyl sashes; however, the frames are still intact. In the 1970s, aluminum storm windows were mounted over all the windows. Five first floor windows at the southeast corner of the building have steel bars and are covered with woven wire mesh. This is the exterior of the men's jail. Originally, there were five barred windows on the northeast corner of the building, where the women's jail was located. However, the bars were removed in 1997 when women's cells were removed. There are concrete steps leading up to the front and rear entrances. A concrete wheelchair ramp was added at the east entrance in 1981. Both the front and rear entrances have double doors recessed under an entry arch. The doors have glazed beveled-glass inset windows. There are clear beveled-glass sidelights flanking the entry doors with floral-patterned glass transoms above the each entrance. The basement floor is concrete. The first and second story floors are supported by wood beams with wood sub-floors covered by fir floor boards. The load bearing walls on the first and second floors are brick with a plaster finish. Non-load bearing walls and stairs are wood-frame. The hip-roof is wood-frame except for the roof over the court room which is supported by two massive trusses. The trusses carry a pyramid-shaped coffered ceiling that is currently hidden by a modern suspended ceiling. The portion of the roof visible from the street is covered with asbestos tiles that are a charcoal gray color. Beyond the visible roof is another lesser pitched hip-roof covered with asphalt roofing. The courthouse has a white decorative cornice made of sheet-metal running along the perimeter of the building. The building has three brick chimneys. One chimney is in the center of the roof. The other two are above the east facade on a gabled roof extension. The courthouse cupola is a wood-framed element with sheet metal detailing that crowns the structure. There is round metal finial on top of the cupola. Interior The courthouse has a usable basement, two main floors, and an attic. Originally, there were county offices on all four floors. Today, the courthouse continues to serve its original purpose with offices in the basement, first, and second floors while the attic is now used for storage. The basement has a main hallway with stone-walls runs north to south. The basement walls are a finished rough stone. The ceilings are low with exposed mechanical systems visible in the hallway and office spaces. A small bathroom is located at the north end of the hall. Until the 1970s, there was a basement apartment for the courthouse custodian, who maintained the building, stoked the boiler, and cooked for prisoners housed in the county jail. The mechanical room houses an abandon steam boiler along with a new boiler that heats the building through the building's original radiator system. An exterior stairwell entrance was added in the 1960s. The public entrances to the courthouse are on the first floor. The double doors at the main entrance on the west fa√ßade open to a wide hallway that runs the length of the building to double doors at the rear entrance. There is also a north-south hallway that divides the first floor into office quadrants. The hallway ceiling is high. A staircase at each end of the north‚Äìsouth leads to the basement and the second floor. All the interior office doors are original except for the sheriff's office, which has a new steel security door. There are bathrooms at the north and south ends of hall. The northwest quadrant of the first floor houses the county clerk's office. The clerk's area includes a main office, a research room, and a vault. The northeast quadrant houses the sheriff's office. It includes offices for the sheriff and deputy sheriffs along with a reception area. The northeast corner of the building originally had a women's jail; however, the cells were removed in 1997 and the area was converted into office space. The jail and the treasurer's office are located in the southeast quadrant. The original cells remain intact, but are only used to temporary hold prisoners who are being booked or who are making a court appearance. The treasurer's office suite includes the treasurer's office and a reception area. The southwest quadrant houses offices for the Veteran's Administration and the county assessor. The second floor has a single hallway, running north-south. There are offices on the west side of that hall with the county's courtroom and court offices on the east side of the hall. The second floor has a small bathroom at each end of the hall. The offices on the west side of the hall include the county commissioner's offices, county administrative offices, the district attorney's offices, a jury room, and a children services office. On the east side of the hall is a large courtroom. The courtroom has a double- door entrance. There are six windows opposite the entrance. An oak balustrade divides the courtroom into two sections, separating the judge, attorneys, and jury from the public seating area. The public area is surrounded by wooden bookshelves. The jury box has 12 oak chairs. The judge's and attorney's desks are made of oak, and are original courthouse furnishings. The courtroom originally had a coffered ceiling, but it has been covered by a modern drop- down ceiling. The court offices consist of three interconnected rooms, a reception office, an administrative office, and the judge's chambers, which is located on the northeast corner of the building. The stairs to the attic is located at the south end of the second floor hall. The stairway was originally open, but a door was installed in 1981 to control access. The attic was originally used for office space. However, the offices were closed in the 1970s because fire exits were inadequate. The attic is now only used for storage. The attic area above the courtroom houses a massive truss system that supports the courtroom's original coffered ceiling. The attic's dormers and windows were built to for their exterior effect, not for interior lighting. Courthouse Square Courthouse Square surrounds the courthouse building The Wallowa County courthouse is located at 101 South River Street in Enterprise, Oregon. The courthouse is surrounded by Courthouse Square which encompasses one city block, approximately . The courthouse faces west toward South River Street with East Main Street bordering the north side of Courthouse Square. First Street runs parallel to the rear to the courthouse building to the east of the site, and East Greenwood Street borders the south side of the square. Originally, the courthouse was surrounded by deciduous trees, but they were replaced in 1925 with spruce trees. The spruce trees were removed in 1989 after several were damaged during a storm. The spruce trees were replaced by oak, pine, maple, linden, juniper, and flowering crab apple trees. There are roses planted on the north, west, and south sides of the courthouse. There is a wood-framed gazebo in the northeast corner of Courthouse Square. The gazebo was built in 1986 by the Rotary Club of Wallowa County. It stands on the same location as a gazebo built about 1900. The date the original gazebo was removed is unknown. However, it can be seen in photographs that were taken shortly after the courthouse was built. There are a number of memorials around Courthouse Square. On the northwest corner of the square stands a concrete arch that is dedicated to the early pioneers of Wallowa County, who arrived in the 1870s. The local American Legion post placed the granite boulder in front of the courthouse in 1925. The bronze plaque mounted on the boulder bears the names of Wallowa County men killed in World War I. In 1985, two more plaques were added to honor those killed during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. A World War I field gun was placed in the square in 1926. However, the gun was melted down during a World War II scrap drive to support the war effort. It was replaced in 1947 with a World War II Howitzer that honors American veterans. A Fountain of Honor honoring all veterans of the United States armed forces was dedicated on 9 July 2011.Addison, Brian, \\"Eagle lands at Fountain of Honor\\", Wallowa County Chieftain, Enterprise, Oregon, 7 July 2011.

It was released by Tan's Film Company and a sequel to the 1929 two-part film Njai Dasima; it follows Dasima's daughter Nancy on her quest for vengeance. Like its predecessor, it was a commercial and critical success. Plot Nancy, the daughter of a native njai (mistress) named Dasima who was murdered several years earlier after leaving her family, returns to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia), as an adult. She discovers that her mother's murderers, a delman driver named Samiun and his wife Hayati, have returned from exile. In a dream, Nancy sees her mother, who asks that she hunt down Samiun and Hayati and take revenge upon them. Intending to calm her mother's soul, Nancy sets out in pursuit of the murderers, who have taken what remained of Dasima's wealth and fled to nearby Banten. With the help of a local politician, she finds and chases Samiun and Hayati. Samiun falls down a hole and dies and, when Hayati tries turning on Nancy to kill her, Dasima's ghost startles the murderess into killing herself. Production Nancy Bikin Pembalasan was made as a sequel to the two-part film Njai Dasima, which Tan's Film ‚Äì owned by the ethnic Chinese brothers Tan Khoen Yauw and Tan Khoen Hian ‚Äì had released to commercial success the previous year. Unlike the original film, which was based on Tjerita Njai Dasima (The Story of Njai Dasima; 1896) by G. Francis, Nancy Bikin Pembalesan was written especially for Tan's Film. Like most of Tan's productions, it was targeted at lower-class viewers. The film was directed by Lie Tek Swie, who had previously worked as a film importer, and produced by Tan Koen Yauw. Boby Schonerwald was cast as Nancy. It was silent and black and white and, during production, initially titled Pembalesan Nancy (Nancy's Revenge). Release and reception Nancy Bikin Pembalesan was released on 30 May 1930, four months after the second instalment of Njai Dasima. It was a commercial and critical success. A review in Panorama described the imagery as clear, like a Western film, with beautiful views and good characterisation of Nancy, Hayati, and the government official.

Barney, who switched from tailback to receiver prior to his junior season, ended his impressive career as a two-time first-team all-Big Eight pick and All-American (1966). He graduated as the Big Eight's record-holder in four receiving categories. A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Barney was recruited by Hall of Fame coach Clay Stapleton to succeed All-American tailbacks Tom Watkins and Tom Vaughn in the Cyclones' potent single-wing attack. At 6' 2\\" and 203 pounds, Barney had great size and natural athletic ability. He was clocked in the 100-yard dash at 9.8 seconds and high jumped 6-4 as a freshman on the track & field team. After sitting out his freshman year under NCAA rules, Barney saw action at tailback in his sophomore campaign (1964), gaining 43 yards on 24 carries. He also contributed as a defensive back, intercepting two passes, and as a punt returner, running back six kicks for 39 yards. The Cyclones were primarily a ground-oriented squad in Stapleton's early reign as the ISU mentor. Stapleton, who switched his offense to a wing-T formation, saw enough promise in Barney to move him to the end spot for his junior campaign while incorporating more pass plays into the offense. The move wasn't completely smooth. Barney had a tendency to drop passes, but with his off-the-charts athleticism, he was a threat on every play. He still produced an outstanding year in 1965, catching 35 passes for 495 yards, good enough to lead the league in receiving while earning first-team all-Big Eight accolades. ISU went 5-4-1 that year, a significant improvement from a 1-8-1 mark the previous season. With a year at receiver under his belt, Barney was ready to take over as one of the nation's best in 1966. To achieve this goal, he needed a strong battery mate. He had one in senior quarterback Tim Van Galder, who was setting school records of his own. Van Galder and Barney teamed up to form the best pass- catching tandem in the Big Eight for the second consecutive year, as Van Galder led the league in passing (1,645 yards) and Barney paced the league in receiving (782 yards). Barney broke the ISU and Big Eight marks in single- season receiving yards (782) and receptions (56) to earn first-team all-Big Eight and second-team All-America honors in 1966. His biggest game occurred at Arizona, where he hauled in a then-Big Eight record 11 catches for 175 yards. That performance still stands as the seventh-best single-game receiving yardage effort in school history. Barney ended his career with 97 receptions, a long-standing Big Eight mark that still ranks 10th in school history. Barney participated in the Blue-Gray Bowl and Senior Bowl before getting selected in the third round of the NFL draft by his hometown Cleveland Browns. Barney played two seasons with the Browns (1967, 1968). He caught 18 passes for 189 yards and one touchdown in 1968.

History It was first launched in 1982 with a 249cc single cylinder two- stroke engine powering a 98 inch(length)x 15 inch(width)x .75 inch (paddle) track. In 1987 there came an option to replace the 98 inch long track with a 136 inch long track or with a 102-inch track. This track allowed the Bravo to float on the snow extremely well and appealed much to trappers and beginners on the sled. The Short track versions of the Bravo would do around 70 km/h and the long track would do around 55 km/h. Later Yamaha swapped the 249cc engine for a 246cc engine but little else changed and almost all parts were interchangeable. In the late 1990s Yamaha removed both short track models from the market and only the 136 inch track was available.

The Patriarchal EMU100 (\\"ÂÖÉËÄÅÁ¥öÁöÑËá™Âº∑Ëôü\\"). In Train Collection. Retrieved from http://emu300ct.myweb.hinet.net/index/tramus/EMU100.htm on October 27, 2010. The alternating current electric multiple unit (EMU) fleet entered full squadron service in 1979, and was withdrawn from service in 2009. This class of railcars were the first to operate on the electric Tzu-Chiang Express. Due to the unit's British origin, rail buffs have variously nicknamed them \\"British Girl\\", \\"British Lady\\", or \\"British Grandma\\". Background In the early 1970s, the West Coast Mainline Electrification Scheme was already planned. Taiwan Railways had ordered 20 electric locomotives manufactured by Union Carriage & Wagon of South Africa and also 13 sets of five-car electric multiple units (total 65 vehicles) from England's British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and General Electric Company (GEC). Identified as the Taiwan Railways EMU100 series, the set included driving power coach 50EP100, motor coach 55EM100, two trailers 40ET100, and driving trailer 40ED100. BREL and GEC were awarded the design-build contract, and the sets were assembled at the former's Holgate Road carriage works in 1976; the carriages are closely based on the British Railways Mark 2 design. Throughout 1978 the sets were delivered to Taiwan for testing and acceptance. Although full service was inaugurated on 15 August 1978, within a month the EMU100 units had been temporarily sidelined due to air conditioning trouble and various component issues. The 50-ton motor power coach (50EP100), which contained the 25 kV AC main transformer, was too heavy and caused bogie suspension stress issues, and was a safety concern when operating at high speeds. After four month of intensive troubleshooting involving TRA Mechanical section and the original equipment manufacturers, the vehicles were re-launched on 2 January 1979 in revenue passenger service. It was not until 1 July 1979, when the West Coast Mainline Electrification Project had reached substantial completion throughout its entire project length, had Tzu-Chiang been able to reach its full potential of operating at 120 km/h. Taking 4 hours and 10 minutes between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the EMU100 broke prior service speed records set by the White Steel Train DR2700 diesel multiple unit operating as the Kuang-Hwa Express, and became TRA's newest-generation premier express. After 30 years of service, the EMU100 series was withdrawn from regular commercial service in 2009. It has been used on special occasions since.

While on the board, he served on several courts martial, oversaw the sea trials of the screw steamer , the armored cruiser , the protected cruisers , , and , and the gunboat , and was promoted to captain on 11 April 1894. Leaving the board, Cooper received command of the protected cruiser on 18 July 1894. On 7 November 1894 he detached from San Francisco with orders to become Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, effective 15 November 1894. He remained superintendent until detached from the Academy on 5 July 1898.Hamersly, pp. 84-85. On 7 July 1898, Cooper reported to the protected cruiser to oversee her fitting out after a lengthy overhaul, and he became her commanding officer when she was recommissioned on 1 December 1898. After detaching from Chicago on 5 October 1899, he took a leave of absence, then received orders on 5 May 1900 to report aboard the battleship as her commanding officer, effective 9 June 1900. He detached from Iowa on 5 March 1901 and awaited orders until his assignment on 7 October 1901 to serve on a court martial at Tutuila in the Tutuila Islands (later American Samoa).Hamersly, p. 85. Promoted to rear admiral on 9 February 1902, Cooper became the president of a general court martial at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 10 April 1902. In 1902 he was responsible for the defense of the United States East Coast from Barnegat, New Jersey, north to the border with Canada and in July 1902 took part in combined U.S. Navy-United States Army maneuvers with his headquarters at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and using the gunboat as his flagship.Anonymous, \\"Admiral Cooper May Stay at Newport,\\" The New York Times, July 17, 1902.Anonymous, \\"Admiral Cooper Transferred: Ordered to Command of Southern Division of Asiatic Station,\\" The New York Times, December 25, 1902. Cooper reported for duty on 6 February 1903 as Senior Squadron Commander in the Asiatic Fleet. On 1 March 1903, he assumed command of the fleets Southern Squadron and on 2 July 1903 of its Cruiser Squadron. On 21 March 1904, he assumed command of the entire Asiatic Fleet. However, his health went into decline, and on 1 or 11Tolley, p. 318. July 1904 (sources vary), Cooper detached from the Asiatic Fleet. On 5 August 1904, he retired from the Navy.  Personal life  Coopers first wife was the former Addie Lou Paine. He married his second wife, Sarah Lawrence Stuart (1851-1881), on 3 October 1871. After she died, he married his third wife, Katherine J. Foote Saltus (1853-1937) on 24 June 1884. He fathered six children, Gerald Cooper (d. 1887), Geraldine Cooper (d. 1885), Stuart Cooper (1873-1924), Philip Benson Cooper (1877-1956), Dorothy Bradford Cooper Patterson (1889-1972), and Leslie B. Cooper (1894-1944); the latter became a nationally recognized helicopter expert and a United States Army Air Forces lieutenant colonel before dying in the crash of a U.S. Army Air Forces training plane in New Jersey in October 1944.gendisasters.com Pennsville, NJ Training Plane Crash, Oct 1944  Death  Cooper apparently contracted chronic malaria while in Nicaragua in 1870 and 1871 on the surveying expedition. Repeated bouts of malaria took a toll on his health, which became poor enough in 1904 to force him to relinquish command of the Asiatic Fleet and retire. He returned to the United States but never completely recovered, and died at Morristown, New Jersey, on 29 December 1912 of interstitial myocarditis and general arteriosclerosis. Cooper is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Morristown.

Since 2016 the bill, which applies globally, authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those who it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets, and ban them from entering the U.S. Background In 2009, Russian tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison after investigating a $230 million fraud involving Russian tax officials. Magnitsky was accused of committing the fraud himself and detained. While in prison, Magnitsky developed gall stones, pancreatitis and calculous cholecystitis and was refused medical treatment for months. After almost a year of imprisonment, he was allegedly beaten to death while in custody. Magnitsky's friend Bill Browder, a prominent American-born businessman working extensively in the Russian Federation after the collapse of the USSR, publicized the case and lobbied American officials to pass legislation sanctioning Russian individuals involved in corruption. Browder brought the case to Senators Benjamin Cardin and John McCain, who proceeded to propose legislation. Law In June 2012, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported to the House a bill called the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (H.R. 4405). The main intention of the law was to punish Russian officials who were thought to be responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and their use of its banking system. The legislation was taken up by a Senate panel the next week, sponsored by Senator Ben Cardin, and cited in a broader review of the mounting tensions in the international relationship. Browder later wrote that the Magnitsky Act found quick bipartisan support because the corruption exposed by Magnitsky was blatant beyond dispute, and \\"[t]here wasn't a pro-Russian-torture-and-murder lobby to oppose it\\".Browder, Bill (2015). Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man‚Äôs Fight for Justice (Reprint ed.). Simon & Schuster. p. 329 In November 2012, provisions of the Magnitsky bill were attached to a House bill (H.R. 6156) normalizing trade with Russia (i.e., repealing the Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment) and Moldova. On December 6, 2012, the U.S. Senate passed the House version of the law, 92‚Äì4. The law was signed by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. Individuals affected The Obama administration made public a list of 18 individuals affected by the Act in April 2013. The people included on the list are: *Artem (aka Artyom) Kuznetsov, a tax investigator for the Moscow division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs *Pavel Karpov, a senior investigator for the Moscow division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs *Oleg F.

In addition, the Russian government reportedly lobbied against the legislation acting through a public relations company led by Kenneth Duberstein. Later, a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya was hired to lobby against the Magnitsky Act in the US. She set up a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., purportedly to discuss the matter. =Ban on U.S. adoption of Russian children= On December 19, 2012, the State Duma voted 400 to 4 to ban the international adoption of Russian children into the United States. The bill was unofficially named after Dmitri Yakovlev (Chase Harrison), a Russian toddler who died of heat stroke in 2008 when his adoptive American father forgot he was in the back seat of his SUV. The next year, 2013, two additional laws were proposed: one was to prevent US citizens from working with political NGOs in Russia, and a second law, eventually abandoned, prevented any foreigner from speaking on state television if they discredited the state. =Banning some U.S. officials from Russia= On April 13, 2013, Russia released a list banning 18 Americans from entering Russia for alleged human rights violations, in a response to the Magnitsky list. The people banned from Russia are listed below. US officials involved in legalizing torture and indefinite detention of prisoners: *David Addington, Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney (2005‚Äì2009) *John Yoo, Assistant US Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice (2001‚Äì2003) *Geoffrey D. Miller, retired US Army Major General, commandant of Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), the organization that runs the Guantanamo Bay detention camps (2002‚Äì2003) *Jeffrey Harbeson, US Navy officer, commandant of JTF-GTMO (2010‚Äì2012) The Russian lawmakers also banned several U.S. officials involved in the prosecution and trial of Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout and drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko, both serving prison time in the United States: *Jed S. Rakoff, Senior US District Judge for the Southern District of New York *Preet Bharara, former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York *Michael J. Garcia, former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York *Brendan R. McGuire, Assistant US Attorney *Anjan S. Sahni, Assistant US Attorney *Christian R. Everdell, Assistant US Attorney *Jenna Minicucci Dabbs, Assistant US Attorney *Christopher L. Lavigne, Assistant US Attorney *Michael Max Rosensaft, Assistant US Attorney *Louis J. Milione, Special Agent, US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) *Sam Gaye, Senior Special Agent, US DEA *Robert F. Zachariasiewicz, Special Agent, US DEA *Derek S. Odney, Special Agent, US DEA *Gregory A. Coleman, Special Agent, US Federal Bureau of Investigation Reception Australian expatriate jurist Geoffrey Robertson, who is representing some of the Magnitsky campaigners, has described the Act as \\"one of the most important new developments in human rights\\". He says it provides \\"a way of getting at the Auschwitz train drivers, the apparatchiks, the people who make a little bit of money from human rights abuses and generally keep under the radar\\". State Duma deputy Yevgeny Fedorov argued that the real purpose of the Magnitsky bill was to manipulate key figures in big business and government, with the aim of pro- American policy in the Russian Federation. In 2018, the British parliament passed a so-called ‚ÄòMagnitsky amendment‚Äô to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act to give the government the power to impose sanctions on people who commit gross human rights violations. Bill Van Auken of World Socialist Web Site condemned the United States for what he described as invoking human rights as a cover for realpolitik in the Magnitsky Act, stating that Washington DC officials had supported \\"far greater crimes, [such] as when Boris Yeltsin in 1993 ordered bombardment of the Russian White House, the seat of the country‚Äôs parliament, killing 62 people\\". In June 2016, the documentary The Magnitsky Act ‚Äì Behind the Scenes was released, which presents an alternative view of Magnitsky. As The Guardian relates, that view includes that \\"Magnitsky was not beaten while in police custody, and that he did not make any specific allegations against individuals in his testimony to Russian authorities.\\" It also suggests that Magnitsky was, as paraphrased by The New York Times, \\"an accomplice rather than a victim.\\" In July 2017 on Fareed Zakaria GPS by CNN, Fareed Zakaria interviewed Bill Browder, who discussed the Magnitsky Act, and topics such as why Putin is directly threatened by it, the money given by Russia government to more than 10,000 Russian human-rights abusers, the June 2016 Trump campaign‚ÄìRussian meeting, and the power and influence of Russian money in Washington, D.C. at present. Liberal Russian dissidents Vladimir V. Kara-Murza and Boris Nemtsov both approved of the act, calling it \\"pro-Russian\\". January 2017 blacklisting On January 9, 2017, under the Magnitsky Act, the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control updated its Specially Designated Nationals List and blacklisted Aleksandr I. Bastrykin, Andrei K. Lugovoi, Dmitri V. Kovtun, Stanislav Gordievsky, and Gennady Plaksin, which froze any of their assets held by American financial institutions or transactions with those institutions and banned their traveling to the United States. Implementation oversight in 2017 President Donald Trump gave a memorandum to Congress on the implementation of the act on April 21, 2017. In May 2017 US authorities settled a case against Prevezon Holding, one of the companies used for laundering the money exfiltrated from Russia as result of the fraud discovered by Sergey Magnitsky. The settlement dismissed the case, and the real-estate company agreed to pay a $5.8 million fine. Also in May 2017 an investigation was started on ¬£6.6m that was allegedly transferred from the fraud scheme into a banking firm in the UK. On September 8, 2017, President Trump, in a memorandum, delegated authority to alter the financial sanctions in this act to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the issue of visas to the Secretary of State. Global Magnitsky Act =Passage= In 2016, Congress enacted the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows the U.S. government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world. Initially introduced as separate legislation introduced by Senator Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) in the SenateS.284 - Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. 114th Congress (2015-2016) , Congress.gov. and Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) in the House,H.R.624 - Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, 114th Congress (2015-2016) . the Global Magnitsky Act was ultimately incorporated as Title XII, Subtitle F (sections 1261 through 1265) of the omnibus National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which became law on December 23, 2016, of the NDAA FY 2017.S.2943 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 , 114th Congress (2015-2016)], Congress.gov. =Global Magnitsky Act sanctions imposed through EO 13818= Effective 21 December 2017, US President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13818 which was the first implementation of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act under which the U.S. government imposed sanctions against 13 individuals described as \\"human rights abusers, kleptocrats, and corrupt actors\\".Background Briefing on the Rollout of the Global Magnitsky Sanctions , United States Department of State (December 21, 2018). Under President Trump's direction, Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, announced the sanctions against thirteen \\"\\"human rights abusers, kleptocrats, and corrupt actors.\\" President Trump said that he was \\"declaring a national emergency with respect to serious human-rights abuse and corruption around the world.\\" The individuals sanctioned included Yahya Jammeh, former president of The Gambia and Roberto Jose Rivas Reyes, the president of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council. An additional 39 affiliated companies and individuals were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to The Economist, Dan Gertler, an \\"Israeli mining billionaire\\" who is a longtime close friend of Joseph Kabila, who was President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for decades, was also listed in President Trump's EO Annex and placed on the OFAC financial sanctions list. All of Gertler's assets that were under U.S. jurisdiction were blocked. According to a February 2018 article in The Economist, the sanctions statement said that Gertler had \\"amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals\\" in the DRC. Included in the Executive Order is the list of designated entities \\"affiliated with\\" Gertler, \\"Moku Mines D'or SA, Moku Goldmines AG, Fleurette Energy I B.V., Fleurette Africa Resources I B.V., African Trans International Holdings B.V., Fleurette African Transport B.V., Oriental Iron Company SPRL, Iron Mountain Enterprises Limited, Sanzetta Investments Limited, Almerina Properties Limited, Interlog DRC, Kitoko Food Farm, Karibu Africa Services SA, and Ventora Development Sasu\\". In a November 28, 2019, article in The Economist, it was reported that President Trump's decision to place sanctions on Gertler, who is a close friend of then- President of the Congo, Joseph Kabila, had come as \\"a shock to many companies operating in the Congo.\\" Citing Tom Perriello, then the United States envoy to the African Great Lakes under Barack Obama, the sanctions \\"probably helped push Mr. Kabila to his eventual decision to stand down in the elections that took place a year later\\", in the December 2018 general election. In June 2018, F√©lix Bautista, a member of the Senate of the Dominican Republic and five companies owned or controlled by him were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury under the Global Magnitsky Act due to his involvement in significant corruption. Bautista has reportedly engaged in bribery in relation to his position as a Senator, and is alleged to have engaged in corruption in Haiti, where he used his connections to win public works contracts to help rebuild Haiti following several natural disasters, including one case where his company was paid over $10 million for work not completed. Bautista has been publicly accused of money laundering and embezzlement. In July 2018, three Nicaraguans were added to the OFAC sanctions list. Nicaraguan National Police Commissioner Francisco Javier Diaz Madriz (Diaz) and Secretary of the Mayor's Office of Managua Fidel Antonio Moreno Briones (Moreno) were sanctioned for being responsible for, or the leaders of entities involved in, serious human rights abuse in Nicaragua. Additionally, OFAC designated Jose Francisco Lopez Centeno (Lopez), the Vice President of ALBA de Nicaragua (ALBANISA) and President of Petronic, for engaging in corrupt activities. In August 2018, the Treasury Department sanctioned top Turkish government officials, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit G√ºl and Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Daniel Glaser, the former Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing under President Barack Obama, said: \\"It‚Äôs certainly the first time I can think of\\" the U.S. sanctioning a NATO ally. \\"I certainly regard it as a human rights violation to unlawfully detain somebody, so I think it falls within the scope of the Global Magnitsky Act.\\" In November 2018, the Treasury Department announced the imposition of Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials for their roles in the \\"targeted and brutally killed\\" Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who lived and worked in the United States. On July 9, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned one Chinese government entity and four current/former government officials for serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The sanctioned individuals are: (i) Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party Secretary of XUAR, (ii) Zhu Hailun, a former Deputy Party Secretary of the XUAR, (iii) Wang Mingshan () and Huo Liujun (), respectively, the incumbent and former Communist Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, and (iv) the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB). These individuals and entities are sanctioned for serious human rights abuse, which reportedly include mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious abuses targeting Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim population indigenous to Xinjiang, and other ethnic minorities in the region. On July 31, 2020, the OFAC further sanctioned Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), Sun Jinlong, a former Political Commissar of the XPCC, and Peng Jiarui, the Deputy Party Secretary and Commander of the XPCC, for their connection to similar human rights abuse against the ethnic minorities in XUAR. The XPCC is a paramilitary organization in the XUAR subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), that was created to enhance internal control over the region. XPCC was used by Chen Quanguo, the CCP Secretary of XUAR, who was subject to similar sanctions on July 9, 2020, to implement a comprehensive surveillance, detention, and indoctrination program targeting Uyghurs and members of other ethnic minority groups. The sanction means that all transactions by U.S. persons or taking place within the United States involving any property or interests in property of the sanctioned entities are generally prohibited. The sanctions are stated by the OFAC to be part of \\"an ongoing effort to deter human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region\\". =Global Magnitsky Act sanctions imposed through EO 13936= On August 7, 2020, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned 11 individuals \\"for undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.\\" These sanctions were made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13936, which was issued on July 14, 2020 by President Trump to declare a national emergency with respect to the situation in Hong Kong, where actions by China \\"fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic processes\\". The sanctioned individuals are Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (\\"HKSAR\\"), Chris Tang, Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), Stephen Lo, former Commissioner of HKPF, John Lee Ka-chiu, HKSAR Secretary for Security, Teresa Cheng, HKSAR Secretary for Justice, Erick Tsang, HKSAR Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Xia Baolong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Zhang Xiaoming, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Luo Huining, Director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Zheng Yanxiong, Director, Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong and Eric Chan, Secretary General, Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR. =Calls for additional sanctions to be imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act= In September 2017, a group of NGOs and anti-corruption organizations identified fifteen international cases where alleged crimes were committed. Individuals from countries, including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, were nominated for sanctions. In December 2017, Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain stated that \\"the Trump Administration has failed to take up cases presented regarding serious human rights abuses committed by Bahraini government officials. Ultimately, there were no individuals or entities from any Arab League member state designated in the Global Magnitsky Act‚Äôs first list of designees, despite the submission of eligible cases.\\"\\"Trump Administration Selectively Implements Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act \\". Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB). December 22, 2017. In August 2018, Senator Marco Rubio and a bipartisan group of 16 other members of Congress urged the United States to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. In December 2019, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act was passed in the House of Representatives, which calls for the imposition of sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act. The 2019 annual report of the Congressional- Executive Commission on China called for Congress to consider sanctions against Chinese officials under the Global Magnitsky Act for crimes against humanity. On April 7, 2020, Rep. Chris Smith, called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to form a task force ‚Äúto identify and investigate‚Äù Chinese government officials for their role in allegedly silencing doctors and journalists who have spoken out about China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, Smith suggested that the U.S. apply the Global Magnitsky Act to target specific Chinese officials involved in going after whistleblowers, without punishing the country as a whole. Similar laws in other jurisdictions In March 2015, the parliament of Canada passed an initial motion towards passing such a law. The Canadian Magnitsky Law, also known as the \\"Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act\\", received royal assent and was passed into law on October 18, 2017. On 6 July 2020, United Kingdom‚Äôs Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the first sanctions under a law similar to the Global Magnitsky Act, where 47 individuals came under travel restrictions and asset freezes. The regulations were meant to give the government a power to impose sanctions on those involved in the worst human rights abuses around the world. In March 2019, the European Parliament passed a resolution 447‚Äì70 in favor of passing a Magnitsky Act for the European Union. In her September 2020 State of the European Union address, Ursula von der Leyen stated that one of the European Commission's goals was passing a European Magnitsky Act.

Born in Seoul, South Korea, she emigrated to Canada at the age of four and grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the University of Toronto and, later, New York University. While in university she was influenced by gender and minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the short Sally's Beauty Spot (1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five-year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut, The Art of Woo (2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with gender and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring interracial relationships. Early life Helen Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea, around 1965, but came to Canada when she was four, a year after her parents. She was raised in Scarborough, Ontario, having moved there in the mid-1970s. As a child, she became interested in black-and-white films from the Golden Age of Hollywood. She later wrote that the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong spoke to her racial identity as an Asian Canadian, an experience she found to have influenced her filmmaking; excerpts from the film were included in her first short. Lee began her tertiary studies at the University of Western Ontario, taking business, before transferring to the University of Toronto; there she majored in English literature and film studies. By 1989 she was attending New York University (NYU), studying under Homi K. Bhabha, Faye Ginsburg, and Mick Taussig, with a scholarship. During this period she was influenced by Trinh T. Minh-ha's paradigms on women and ethnicity, as expressed in the 1989 book Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism; these were later expressed in Lee's first film. She later described Minh-ha as at one point being her \\"ultimate role model\\". Early film career Lee made Sally's Beauty Spot, a 12-minute-long short film focusing on a mole on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada. In 1992 Lee made the forty-minute long film My Niagara, which featured scenes shot in Japan that were reminiscent of home movies; the effect was obtained by filming in Super 8 Kodachrome, then transferring it to 16 mm film. Filmed in Etobicoke, Ontario, at the childhood home of co-writer Kerri Sakamoto, the film detailed a young Asian-Canadian woman living alone with her father after the death of her mother. Scenes were also shot at the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto. Fransisca Duran in LIFT writes that the film, which had a budget of $80,000, had a theme of cultural displacement, and Lee states that My Niagara was well received. That year she also released the three-minute To Sir With Love. After My Niagara, Lee took a position as a director observer on the set of Atom Egoyan's Exotica, while led her to enrol with the Canadian Film Centre (CFC). Meanwhile, she worked as a film and music critic for Now and extensively wrote about films for other publications. She took further studies at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Banff, Alberta, before returning to the CFC as a director residency. She continued to be involved with the American company Women Make Movies, a distributor of feminist media, which she had become involved with while at NYU. In 1995 Lee released the 26-minute-long Prey, starring Adam Beach and Sandra Oh; she described the film as a \\"cross- cultural comedy\\". The film, which followed a young Korean woman who falls in love with a drifter, was a collaboration with Cameron Bailey and dealt with themes of racial differences, immigration, and social class. The Canadian film critic and experimental filmmaker Mike Hoolboom compared the themes to those of the 1989 Hollywood film Do the Right Thing, writing that had short films been respected it would have been a watershed mark. That year she also released the three-minute M. Nourbese Philip. She then took a five-year hiatus, which she spent in Korea. Post Korea In 2000 Lee released the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's search for her mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv. Anita Lee, co- producer of Priceless, then suggested that Helen Lee make The Art of Woo, a romantic comedy sponsored by the Canadian Film Centre; it was Lee's feature film debut. Starring Adam Beach and Sook Yin Lee, the film followed a Korean- Canadian art dealer who finds herself interested in a native artist but considers him unworthy as he is poor. Released in 2001, the film was \\"slashed\\" by critics. For example, Jonathan Crow, writing for the Rovi Corporation, found the film \\"less fun and less accomplished than a third grade theater production\\". However, its soundtrack ‚Äì by Ron Sexsmith and Kurt Swinghammer ‚Äì won a Genie Award for Best Achievement in Music ‚Äì Original Song. That year she also released the three-minute Star. After The Art of Woo, Lee announced that intended to adapt Kerri Sakamoto's novel The Electrical Field and a \\"romantic thriller\\". However, neither film has yet been released. In 2002 she showed the video installation Cleaving at the Werkleitz Biennale in Germany. She married around 2008, and that same year released the short Hers at Last, about the interactions of two women in Korea. The short was premiered at the Seoul International Women's Film Festival as part of an omnibus entitled Ten Ten, in celebration of the festival's tenth anniversary. The omnibus also featured works by fellow directors Byun Young-joo and Lee Su-yeon. Themes Race, gender issues, and racial identity often feature in Lee's works. The main characters, up through The Art of Woo, are Asian women that are \\"caught up in some cross cultural encounter\\". She writes that she attempts to address these issues through her films in non-didactic ways, such that the \\"racial melancholia ... are like seepages in the more obvious dramatic or comedic content\\". She contrasts her films with the 1993 drama The Joy Luck Club, which she considers a film with obvious, easily consumable, ethnic content. She considers the stereotype of Asian women as seductresses, either demure \\"lotus blossoms\\" or vociferous \\"dragon ladies\\", to be a degenerative one which is \\"sometimes extremely offensive\\", but one that has \\"a cultural memory that demands [the viewer's] attention.\\" Lee's works often include elements of sexuality in their characterizations. She writes that the main characters of My Niagara and Subrosa reach a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships after sexual encounters. She considers sex as \\"never the culmination or end point\\", but a signifier for intimacy. As such, she feels that the more intimate aspects of sex are best conveyed wordlessly, through how it is presented, although she concedes that \\"talky sex\\" can be appropriate for romantic comedies.

It is arguably the most influential journal of Black Studies and central to the very emergence of that field. After being renewed and reinvigorated in 2010, it has continued its influence. In 2017, The Princeton Review of Academic Journals ranked it the number-one journal of Black Studies in the United States. Its associated Black Scholar Press has published books since the 1970s.

Original editorial board Robert Chrisman (1937‚Äì2013) and Nathan Hare (b. 1933) were active in the 1968 Black and ethnic studies battles at San Francisco State University. Hare had been hired to coordinate a Black Studies program, the first in the United States, and to write a proposal for a department of Black studies, which Black students wanted to have as a fully independent department.\\"Robert Chrisman Obituary\\", H-Net (Humanities & Social Sciences Online). As a consequence of a five-month student-faculty strike, the first and the longest strike for Black studies in the US academy, Hare, who was arrested twice for activities during the strike, was fired and Chrisman was removed as a professor from tenure track. The strike experience motivated Chrisman and Hare to create a venue outside of the academy for Black knowledge production.Chrisman, Robert. The Black Scholar 41.4 (Winter 2011): 2-4. Print. In November 1969, Hare (publisher), Chrisman (editor) and Allan Ross, a white Bay Area printer (as business manager) founded The Black Scholar: A Journal of Black Studies and Research to cover issues of social, cultural, economic and political thought. Its opening issue, \\"The Culture of Revolution\\", featured articles by Eldridge Cleaver, Amiri Baraka, S√©kou Tour√©, and Stokely Carmichael, among others, with Nathan Hare writing the lead article on the First Pan African Cultural Festival Cultural Festival held in Algiers in the summer. There he obtained articles from African intellectuals such as S√©kou Tour√©, as well as Eldridge Clever and his rival, Stokely Carmichael, both of whom had just expatriated to Africa. Early members of the editorial and advisory board included Shirley Chisholm, Imamu Baraka, Angela Davis, Sonia Sanchez, Chuck Stone, Dempsey Travis, Max Roach, John Oliver Killens, Ossie Davis, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Ron Karenga, and Lerone Bennett.Hunter, Charlayne. ‚ÄúIdeology Dispute Shakes Black Journal‚Äù, The New York Times, March 11, 1975.

In his open letter of resignation, Hare accused other board members of conspiring to further a Black Marxist agenda at the expense of competing ideologies. Writing of Hare's resignation, The New York Times called The Black Scholar the most important Black journal since The Crisis magazine of W. E. B. DuBois. Allan Ross had left a year or so earlier, but Hare declined his entreaties to leave with him. Robert Allen was brought in to replace Ross on the Board but in the position of Associate Editor, with Ross's assistant (Gloria Bevien) taking his place as Business Manager. Allan Ross died in 1974. Then Hare left in the spring of 1975. The public split attracted coverage from national newspapers.

Web Archive. while the New York Amsterdam News headline read \\"Black Reds Take Over Black Scholar!\\" Notable issues The Black Scholar published a special issue entitled \\"The Black Sexism Debate\\" (Vol. 10, No. 8/9, May/June 1979); this was one of the first public scholarly forums about sexism within the African-American community and it generated controversy due to contradictory positions on gender equality.Byrd, Rudolph P., and Beverly Guy- Sheftall. Traps: African American Men on Gender and Sexuality. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001. 14. Print. The issue featured responses from feminists, intellectuals, and artists to Robert Staples‚Äô controversial essay, ‚ÄúThe Myth of the Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists,‚Äù which had been published in the previous issue of TBS. Staples had criticized the work of Michele Wallace and Ntozake Shange. The editors of the journal viewed the issue as a means of clarifying the relationship between Black men and women while forging solidarities among them.McGill, Lisa D. Constructing Black Selves: Caribbean American Narratives and the Second Generation. New York University Press, 2005, pp. 119‚Äì120. Print. Over a decade later, when millions of people were fascinated by Clarence Thomas‚Äô hearings in the Senate prior to his being confirmed to the Supreme Court, TBS compiled a special issue. Scholars and historians commented on the issues of sexism and racism in the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy (Vol. 22, No. 1/2, Winter 1991‚ÄìSpring 1992). The essays were later published as Court of Appeal: The Black Community Speaks Out on the Racial and Sexual Politics of Thomas vs. Hill (1992).Metzger, Sheri Elaine, and Ralph Zerbonia, \\"Robert L. Allen\\", Gale Contemporary Black Biography, at Answers.com. Most recently, the journal has published a variety of notable special issues, which have begun to participate in the reshaping of Black Studies in the wake of new generations of institutional Black academics as well as in the wake of new political activism and cultural conversation around race, power, knowledge, and politics. Examples include the award-winning issue on Dominican Black Studies (Vol. 45, No. 2, Summer 2015); a roundtable on the ABC television drama Scandal (Vol. 45, No. 1. Spring 2015); States of Black Studies (Vol. 44, No. 2, Summer 2014); and The Role of Black Philosophy (Vol. 43, No. 4, Winter 2013). Also, there have been cutting-edge issues focused on race and environmental justice (Fall 2016); technology such as Black Code (Fall 2017); Black Studies in South Africa (Summer 2017) and Black Experimental Poetics (Spring 2017). TBS has also focused on debates around sex and sexuality in the Black world, for example, with a wildly popular roundtable on \\"Race, Pornography and Desire\\" (Winter 2016) and with upcoming issues on Black Masculinity and the first collection of writings by and about Black Queer and Trans issues and aesthetics (forthcoming in 2019). The journal has always explored Black American issues through a broader context of Black transnational experiences, and through an explicit global/pan-African lens. In 1977, for example, TBS published a special issue on Cuba, featuring essays from artists, activists, and intellectuals who had been enabled to visit Cuba through the initiative of the journal‚Äôs board.[9] It has also devoted issues to South Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and addresses issues from all points of the Black world. Notable contributors The Black Scholar was founded on the principle that all Black authors, scholars, and activists could take part in dialogues within its pages. It has been dedicated to finding and developing new talent while also continuing to publish established authors. TBS has retained its non-discriminatory policy of publishing intellectuals from a variety of professions outside of academia. For example, TBS has featured articles by US Congress representatives Shirley Chisholm, Ron Dellums, Barbara Lee, and activists such as Julian Bond, Herb Boyd, Am√≠lcar Cabral, Eldridge Cleaver, Nawal El Saadawi, Cheddi Jagan, Julius Nyerere, Bobby Seale, and Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael).Chrisman, Laura, et al. \\"The Black Scholar Press Release.\\" April 2012.

L. R. James, Jacob Lawrence, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Jack O'Dell, Walter Rodney, McCoy Tyner, George Yancy, and Robert F. Williams. The journal has been home to celebrated essays from activists and academics alike. Angela Davis‚Äôs now canonized essay \\"Reflections on the Black Woman's Role in the Community of Slaves\\", written while she was in prison, was first published in TBS in 1971, Vol. 3, No. 4. She was still in prison on murder and kidnapping charges linked to George Jackson‚Äôs attempted escape from the Marin County Hall of Justice when the article was printed. TBS‚Äô archives at UC Berkeley also house the last published writing by George Jackson while he was alive (Vol. 2, No. 10, June 1971), printed just two months before his fatal attempt to escape incarceration. The journal continues to feature the most influential of contemporary Black scholars, critics and activists, from Gerald Early to Louis Chude-Sokei, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Mark Anthony Neal, Nathaniel Mackey, Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Anthony Reed, Evie Shockley, David Marriott, Dionne Brand, Anthony Walton, Stephanie Batiste and so many more. Activist involvement Activism has always been a founding premise of The Black Scholar. As a result of student and faculty agitation and strikes in the late 1960s, a Black Studies department was inaugurated at San Francisco State University. Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare, along with other African-American faculty, were a part of the advisory board created to hire faculty for the new department.Biondi, Martha. The Black Revolution on Campus. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012. 75. Print. As activists in the Civil Rights Movement and the student movements of the 1960s (for instance, Nathan Hare was a leader of the Black University movement and fired at Howard University before his recruitment to San Francisco State), the founders of TBS used the journal not only as a publication informed by community activism but also as a hub for further activist work that addresses social inequality based on race, class, and gender in the United States and abroad.Watkins, Mel. \\"The Last Word: The Black Scholar.\\" New York Times, May 30, 1971. Web Archive. Many of TBS‚Äô contributing and advisory editors have been involved with social and political activism such as organizing a political prisoners' fund, protests against the Vietnam War, trips to Cuba and revolutionary Nicaragua, a trip to the Eastern Bloc in 1985, and a speaker‚Äôs bureau to arrange speaking engagements for diverse thinkers of varying disciplines and experiences in and outside traditional academia. Founder Robert Chrisman represented TBS at a conference held in Havana, Cuba, where a large American delegation met with Angolan leaders Commandante Dibalo, Ogla Lima, and Pedro Zinga Baptista in support of the MPLA. A few months later Chrisman represented TBS at the Angola Support Conference, which opposed U.S. and South African intervention in Angola.\\"Robert Chrisman\\" at KeyWiki. The published works produced by TBS editors have also promoted activism by spreading awareness of racial injustices. As a result of Robert L. Allen‚Äôs publication The Port Chicago Mutiny, which shed light on the unjust and unsafe working conditions that Black Navy servicemen sustained during wartime efforts, social activists were inspired to rectify the injustices of the Port Chicago disaster. The surviving service members were honored by a group of California State Assemblymen in 1998, more than 50 years after these men were charged with mutiny for refusing to work under unsafe conditions. One of the men involved also received an official pardon by President Bill Clinton. Robert Chrisman‚Äôs retirement On June 30, 2012, founding editor Robert Chrisman officially retired from his long-standing position as Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of The Black Scholar. He publicly announced his retirement in a letter published on the back page of the Spring 2012 issue of TBS. Chrisman claimed that through the creation and the dissemination of such materials TBS was able to ‚Äúestablish a foundation and platform for late 20th-century Black criticism and scholarship.\\"Chrisman, Robert. \\"An Open Letter from Robert Chrisman.\\" The Black Scholar 42.1 (Spring 2012). In his letter, Chrisman made reference to the transitioning direction and goals of the journal in the light of changes in the field of Black Studies and the intellectual interests of scholars and activists within it. He ended his letter thanking those who provided support throughout his tenure, including his executive assistant Jacki Fromm√©, typographer Rick Giezentaner, Pat Scott, and Conyus Calhoun. Since retiring, Chrisman completed his third volume of poems, The Dirty Wars, published in summer 2012 by Black Scholar Press, and continued to work on another volume of poetry entitled Minotaur and to work with Robert L. Allen on The Black Scholar archive at UC Berkeley. Chrisman died after a long illness on March 10, 2013.Damu, Jean, \\"Robert Chrisman and The Black Scholar\\", San Francisco BayView, March 21, 2013.

They were originally built by Tokyu Car Corporation of Japan in 1966, in response to an order by the Taiwan Railways Administration, because of the need to renew the rolling stock on the by then 10-year-old Flying Formosan Express service. History By 2006, the DR2700 DMU was operating as an ordinary passenger local train on the Taitung Line. This is another recreation of the Glory of China Express using three preserved DR2700 units, stopping at Taichung station. The DR2700 started public service on October 31, 1966, under the name of The Glory of China Express, and with its light body and a blazing 69 mph design speed, it still holds the pre- electrification record for the fastest time for traversing Taiwan's Western Line in its entirety, in a time of just four hours and 40 minutes, beating the previous Flying Formosan record by 20 minutes. It was a lot more comfortable and much faster than the steam locomotive services, which were the best available in 1956. The total number of power cars built was 25, along with 6 trailers, and they usually worked in a formation of 2 power cars, or two power cars with one trailer in the middle, since the power cars were the only ones equipped with driving cabs, and given the modest output of the engine, it was not possible for just the one power car to haul another trailer alone. The DR2700 series bodywork was based on the Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDC), since Tokyu Car Corporation at that time had a license from the Budd Company to incorporate its stainless steel train body and bogie technology from the latter, which it also did for the TRA DR2800 series built in the early-1980s. The innovations introduced on this service included complementary refreshments and boxed lunches on the train, included free with the rail ticket. The service proved very popular with the rail users of the time, and indeed started a 'travelling by rail' culture in the Taiwan which lingers on today. It was said that this train was introduced to celebrate the 80th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, a Chinese military leader, and eventually the president of the Republic of China. The shining silver carriages were built with stainless steel, giving the nickname 'Baitee-ah', meaning \\"White Steel Train\\" in Southern Min language (Nowadays, this nickname is still used by railway enthusiasts and senior employees of the Taiwan Railway Administration). However, this batch of railcars were a worthwhile investment for the railway. By 1996, the DR2700 had given the locals 30 years of impeccable service, and was still going strong in 1997. As a result, it acquired another nickname ~ 'The forever white steel train'. Interior view of a DR2700 (#DR2707) featuring fans and mid-car radiator ducts for the underfloor engine. Since the electrification of the Western Line in Taiwan, the units were moved to operate on the northern section of the Eastern Line; the southern section of which, in 1979, was still under construction. They were eventually stripped of their express status in 1986, after 20 years of service. Failures were becoming commonplace due to their age, and they were no longer considered suitable for long distance services. The units are now used on branch lines in place of the DR2400 in order to provide a higher quality service. Before the arrival of the EMU400 and EMU500, they operated as peak-hour relief commuter services on the central coastal railway, under the branding of Diesel Express, which was timed slightly faster than the standard commuter service, and offered free seat reservations. One of the first branch lines to receive the DR2700, before they were eventually replaced by the EMU400, was the Neiwan Line, the longest branch line in the Taiwan, extending some 7 miles inland from Hsinchu, but relegation to branch line services didn't really start until 1997 when the EMU500 class commuter trains were phased in throughout the country. The small fleet of six DR2750 trailers had been withdrawn in 1997, following the introduction of the EMU500, in order to reduce the strain on the aged motor coaches. This is wasn't the most sensible move at a time when there was a shortage of hauled mainline rolling stock, however, it is suspected that these trailers would not be scrapped -as with most withdrawn units in Taiwan- they will be sent to Tang Eng Iron Works for conversion into 'new' rolling stock. Today two DR2700 vehicles have been converted to catenary maintenance vehicles and are still in use by TRA in work service. After their formal retirement on in July, 2014, DR2700 are no longer available in regular services. 8 vehicles are reserved for the use of special trains.

Story An advanced civilization once flourished in a fictional solar system. One day, a black hole appeared and sucked everyone who lived there into another dimension. This parallel universe came to be known as Artelius. Ruled by the diabolical king Sarbelor, he controls a machine that has split the universe into spaces filled with asteroid belts. A cyborg has been built by a scientist named Dr. Rado in order to defeat Sarbelor; only he has been entrusted with this mission to save Artelius from the evil king's reign. Gameplay Players begin the game by customizing and modifying the traits of their characters. Warp points allow players to travel across the universe. On the map, the red dots are always bad guys while the blue dots indicate space colonies, where players can rest and stock up on supplies. Each resting spot has at least two doors or a warp point. Battles are done randomly and from a first-person perspective. Winning will earn the player valuable experience points that will make the player stronger and advance in levels. The players attacks are determined by strength while their defensive power is determined by the strength of the shield. Having a high level of agility allows for more frequent successes in running away from unwanted battles.

The program is closely modeled after the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. Several NSF directorates have their own RET programs including the Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO), the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), and the Directorate of Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The later two form a joint RET program. Like many NSF programs, the RET program especially encourages the participation of educators from underrepresented groups. In addition, the NSF encourages potential RET host sites to seek out teachers from impoverished school districts. Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO) RET Program The NSF BIO RET program is designed to increase the knowledge of K-12 science educators. One major objective of the BIO RET program is to encourage participants to incorporate their research skills into their class structures. The BIO RET program is intended to support up to two teachers per host site at any given time. Directorates of Engineering and Computer Information Science and Engineering (ENG/CISE) RET Program The NSF ENG/CISE RET program is designed to increase the general knowledge and research skills of science educators. However, unlike the BIO RET program, the ENG/CISE RET program will support community college professors in addition to K-12 educators. Also, in contrast to the BIO RET program, the ENG/CISE RET program encourages host institutions to recruit no less than two teachers at a given time. Funding for any RET host institution may not exceed $500,000 over three years and may not exceed $10,000 per teacher. In accordance the NSF's concern for ethics, $4,000 per year may be granted to support ethics training. The ENG/CISE allocated $5,500,000 for the fiscal year 2011 to support RETs. Participating educators are provided with a stipend and may be reimbursed for travel and living expenses.

Anapatrapya (Pali: anottappa) is identified as: * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings * One of the twenty secondary unwholesome factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings Explanations =Theravada= In the Visuddhimagga (XIV, 160), anottappa (shamelessness) is defined together with ahirika (consciencelessness) as follows: :Herein, it has no conscientious scruples, thus it is consciencelessness (ahirika). It is unashamed, thus it is shamelessness (anottappa). Of these, ahirika has the characteristic of absence of disgust at bodily misconduct, etc., or it has the characteristic of immodesty. Anottappa has the characteristic of absence of dread on their account, or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about them...Gorkom (2010), Definition of Ignorance, Shamelessness, Recklessness and Restlessness Nina van Gorkom explains: :The two cetasikas shamelessness and recklessness seem to be very close in meaning, but they have different characteristics. Shamelessness does not shrink from evil because it is not ashamed of it and does not abhor it. The ‚ÄúParamattha Ma√±j≈´sƒÅ‚Äù compares it to a domestic pig which does not abhor filth. Defilements (kilesa) are like filth, they are unclean, impure. Shamelessness does not abhor defilements, be it attachment, aversion, ignorance, avarice, jealousy, conceit or any other kind of unwholesomeness. :As to recklessness, it does not abhor, draw back from evil because it does not see the danger of akusala and it does not fear its consequences such as an unhappy rebirth. The ‚ÄúParamattha Ma√±j≈´sƒÅ‚Äù compares recklessness to a moth which is attracted to the fire, although this is dangerous for it. Are we enslaved by pleasant experiences? We may even commit evil through body, speech or mind on account of them. Then recklessness does not fear the danger of akusala, it does not care about the consequences of akusala. =Mahayana= The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is anapatrapya? It is not restraining oneself by taking others as the norm. It is an emotional event associated with passion-lust (raga), aversion-hatred (dvesha), and bewilderment-erring (moha). It aids the basic emotions and the proximate emotions. Mipham Rinpoche states: :Shamelessness means to personally engage in what is unvirtuous without inhibition on account of others. It belongs to the categories of the three poisons and helps all the disturbing emotions. Alexander Berzin explains: :No care for how our actions reflect on others (khrel-med) is a part of any of the three poisonous emotions. It is the lack of any sense to refrain from destructive behavior because of caring how our actions reflect on those connected to us. Such persons may include our family, teachers, social group, ethnic group, religious order, or countrymen. For Vasubandhu, this subsidiary awareness means having no scruples, and is a lack of restraint from being brazenly negative. This and the previous subsidiary awareness (ƒÅhrƒ´kya) accompany all destructive states of mind.Berzin (2006) See also * Mental factors (Buddhism) * ƒÅhrƒ´kya References Sources * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, Pariyatti Publishing * Guenther, Herbert V. & Leslie S.

In 49 career games, Capel pitched innings, struck out 43 batters, and had a career win‚Äìloss record of 3‚Äì4 with a 4.62 earned run average (ERA). While he played in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed . A starting pitcher in college and parts of his Minor League Baseball career, he converted to relief pitching while in Chicago's minor league system. The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th round of the 1980 MLB draft, but the 18-year-old did not sign with the team: instead, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All- Star Team, which competed in the Amateur World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play professional baseball; he played in six seasons of Minor League Baseball before he made his MLB debut in 1988. Capel spent the entire 1989 season in Triple-A, one level below the majors, but the Cubs released him at the end of the year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a spot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released at the end of the season. A free agent, the Astros signed Capel, and over the course of the season he pitched in 25 games for the team. He spent the final part of his career in the Astros farm system, and after he made the 1992 Triple-A All-Star team, Capel played his last season in 1993. After retirement, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston, Texas. Early life Capel was born on October 13, 1961, in Marshall, Texas, and attended Spring High School in Harris County. As a child, he enjoyed watching the Astros play on weekends. During his senior year in 1979, the Spring Lions won the AAAA conference state championship, and Capel was named to the All-State team, composed of the best high school players in the state. He set several pitching records at Spring High School. Future teammate Calvin Schiraldi called Capel a \\"hard thrower when he came out of high school\\" and \\"the top guy out of the state in 1980\\"; Roger Clemens said he was \\"probably the best pitcher in the state at that time\\". The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Capel with the 605th overall pick in the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing with the Phillies, he chose to attend the University of Texas. Collegiate career Capel enrolled at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to miss his freshman season. Capel pitched sidearm for the remainder of his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of his fastball. In 1982, he was named to the All- Southwest Conference team and pitched to a 9‚Äì0 win‚Äìloss record with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59‚Äì6. His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine decisions). In the 1982 College World Series, Texas defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Stanford Cardinal, but losses to the Miami Hurricanes and the Wichita State Shockers eliminated them from play, per the tournament's double-elimination format. Capel played on the United States team in the 1982 Amateur World Series, overseen by the International Baseball Federation. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14‚Äì4 complete game victory, with the match ending after seven innings per the championship's ten-run rule. The United States eventually placed third in the competition. The 1983 Longhorns finished with a 61‚Äì14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by Collegiate Baseball Magazine. That season, the Texas team featured four future MLB pitchers: Capel, Clemens, Bruce Ruffin, and Schiraldi. In the 1983 College World Series, Capel allowed four hits in a complete game against the Michigan Wolverines as the Longhorns advanced to the World Series finals. Facing the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Longhorns made Clemens their starting pitcher and won 4‚Äì3. The championship was the fourth World Series title in University of Texas history, and their first since 1975. Capel finished the season with a 13‚Äì1 record and a 2.98 ERA. His career winning percentage (.957) ties him with Rick Burley for the fifth- best in Texas Longhorns history. In June, before the College World Series, he was drafted by the Cubs with the 320th overall pick in the 1983 MLB draft. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= After he signed a professional contract with the Cubs, Capel no longer threw sidearmed. Capel began professional baseball with the Class A Quad Cities Cubs, but was promoted to the Double-A Midland Cubs shortly into the season. Over 11 games, he finished with a 4‚Äì3 record and a 3.51 ERA. In 1984, Capel split playing time between the Class A-Advanced Lodi Crushers and Midland; he led Midland in losses (10) and wild pitches (11) and had the second-worst ERA (6.31) on the team. With Midland, Capel started 11 games out of the 16 in which he appeared. On his 0‚Äì7 record for the Crushers, Tom Alexander of the Lodi News-Sentinel wrote that Capel's luck \\"has been all bad when it comes to wins\\". Both Lodi and Midland finished their seasons with losing records. From 1985 to 1986, he played for the Double-A Pittsfield Cubs of the Eastern League. In 1986, Capel only pitched in relief, had a career-best 1.87 ERA over innings pitched, and led his team with 13 saves. After he was promoted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, Capel split time between starting and relieving roles in 1987. At 7‚Äì10, Capel tied for Iowa's lead in wins and losses, and led the team in strikeouts, with 75; his seven wins became a career high, and his loss total matched a career high set in Midland three years earlier. After the season, Ray Sons of the Chicago Sun-Times said Capel \\"may be ready for middle relief in Chicago\\", and Dave van Dyck listed him as a prospect for the 1988 season. During winter, Capel, Greg Maddux, Manny Trillo, Damon Berryhill, and several other Cubs played for teams in the Caribbean. Capel played for the √Åguilas del Zulia of Venezuela and led the team with five saves. Capel played in spring training ball as he tried to make Chicago's opening day roster. After the Cubs acquired Mike Bielecki from the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31, 1988, they assigned Capel to Triple-A despite a Sun-Times prediction that he would be on the MLB roster. Prior to the acquisition, when Al Nipper was supposed to become the Cubs' fifth starter, Capel was to take his spot in the bullpen. The Cubs recalled Capel and Mark Grace to the majors on May 3, while Drew Hall and Rolando Roomes were optioned to Iowa; at the time, he had a 1.54 ERA and two saves in Triple-A ball. On May 7, Capel made his MLB debut: he pitched the final innings of a game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing no runs and no hits but issuing a walk in a 2‚Äì1 Cubs loss. His first career win came the following day against the Giants, although he blew a save by giving up a two-run home run to Bob Brenly and lost a 5‚Äì4 lead. The Cubs ultimately won 13‚Äì7. Capel continued to pitch for the club until June 30, when the Cubs optioned him to Iowa to open a roster spot for Rich \\"Goose\\" Gossage to come off the 15-day disabled list (DL). He returned to the MLB club on August 8 to replace Schiraldi, but was demoted on August 13 before making an appearance, as Chicago activated Les Lancaster from the DL. Capel rejoined the club on August 31, and pitched in five more games before the season's end. Over his first MLB season, Capel pitched in 20 games and allowed 16 earned runs over innings for a 4.91 ERA. He pitched the entire 1989 season for Iowa, appearing in 64 games for the team. On October 15, Capel was granted free agency by the Cubs; he signed with the Brewers two months later. =Milwaukee Brewers= Capel competed against 22 other pitchers for an MLB roster spot in the Brewers' spring training camp. The Brewers optioned Capel to their Triple-A affiliate, the Denver Zephyrs, on April 5, before the start of Milwaukee's 1990 season. On May 17, Denver placed Capel on the DL with a strained Achilles tendon, which opened a roster spot on the Zephyrs and allowed the Brewers to send Jaime Navarro back to Denver. When the Brewers needed a replacement for the injured Bill Wegman, Capel was called up to the major leagues. For his Brewers debut, Capel faced five batters and allowed four runs (two charged to Capel) against the Baltimore Orioles. His strikeout of Billy Ripken was the only MLB out Capel recorded in 1990. On June 8, he made his second and final outing with the Brewers and allowed four runs (three charged to Capel) against the Toronto Blue Jays; combined, batters hit .857 against Capel as he finished the season with a 135.00 ERA. When Greg Vaughn, returning from a turf toe injury and a sprained left ankle, was activated from the DL on June 11, Capel was sent to Triple-A. He finished the season with Denver where he had a 4‚Äì3 record with a 4.26 ERA. On October 4, the Brewers granted Capel free agency; he signed with the Astros on January 5, 1991. =Houston Astros= Capel began his 1991 season with the Triple-A Tucson Toros; the Astros added Capel to their MLB roster on June 7. Two days later, against the New York Mets, Capel allowed the game-winning home run to Howard Johnson in the top of the 11th inning. Against the Mets on June 14, Capel, starting pitcher Pete Harnisch, and closer Jim Clancy combined for a four-hitter. His final MLB appearance came on August 14 against the San Diego Padres, when he pitched one inning in relief of Jim Corsi in a 4‚Äì1 loss. Capel said pitching for Houston was \\"the high point of [his] career\\". Over 25 games pitched, Capel finished the season with a 1‚Äì3 record and a 3.03 ERA. To reduce their roster to 35 players, the Astros assigned Capel and seven others to the Toros prior to the 1992 MLB season. Capel was selected to the Triple-A All- Star Game to replace Tim Scott, whom the Padres promoted to MLB. He told Javier Morales of the Arizona Daily Star \\"this [was] one of the greatest thrills of [his] career,\\" and that he hoped it showed the Astros he could pitch in MLB. Doug Jones worked as Houston's closer in 1992, however, and Capel never played for the MLB club. For the Toros, Capel had a 6‚Äì6 record and a 2.19 ERA with a team-leading 18 saves. The following season, the Montreal Expos invited Capel to their spring camp as a non-roster invitee. Capel elected to remain with the Astros organization where he allowed 26 earned runs in innings and pitched the entire season in Triple-A. The Toros, managed by Rick Sweet, finished first in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) South Division with an 83‚Äì60 record and made the playoffs. Unlike the 1993 MLB playoffs, in which four teams competed, only two teams could make the PCL playoffs. In the championship series, the Toros faced the Portland Beavers, champions of the North Division and holders of a PCL-best 87‚Äì56 record. In a best-of-seven series, the Toros defeated the Beavers four games to two. After the season, the Astros did not re-sign Capel. While playing in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed . Personal life In February 1986, Capel pitched in the University of Texas Alumni v. Varsity game, which ended in a 14‚Äì14 tie. Capel started to use dipping tobacco in 1976 and in March 1988 had a non-cancerous lesion removed from his lip; he tried to quit the product in March 1988. Capel met his wife, Elizabeth, at Roger Clemens' wedding. Outside of baseball, he is a close friend of Clemens, and during Clemens' 2012 perjury trial, Capel testified on his work ethic and character. In 2012, Mike worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston. Capel's son, Conner, played baseball as an outfielder for Seven Lakes High School in Katy, Texas, where, in his senior year, he had a .456 batting average with 23 stolen bases and 36 runs scored. The Cleveland Indians drafted Conner in the fifth round of the 2016 MLB draft.

Some media critics believe it undermines the purpose of international sport for the purpose of medals. History and use The term \\"Plastic Brit\\" is derived from Plastic Paddy, which is used to describe people who claim to be Irish despite not residing in that country. While the concept gained the British media's attention in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, it had also been used in describing members of other British sporting teams. England's cricket team had a perceived problem of having too many foreign-born players. The England and Wales Cricket Board responded to the issue by lengthening the residency period before a foreign player can be accepted to play for England to seven years. The term was popularised in the United Kingdom through its usage in the Daily Mail newspaper to describe athletes born outside the UK who had been selected to represent Great Britain at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The term originally had foundations from South African-born Zola Budd having her British citizenship application fast tracked in order to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The term was used to describe a number of amateur wrestlers such as Myroslav Dykun and Yana Stadnik who had not been born in the UK and had been given British citizenship. Only one wrestler had competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, Ukrainian- born Olga Butkevych. British Wrestling had the majority of its host nation berths removed by the British Olympic Association because of British Wrestling's failing to reach set performance targets. The term; \\"Plastic Brit\\" was also used when there were calls for Arsenal's Spanish goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to play for the England national football team in 2009. It was argued by some newspaper reporters that selecting athletes born outside of the UK was discriminatory against British-born athletes and was against the spirit of the Olympics. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) imposed a mandatory three-year waiting period before athletes could compete in the Olympics for another country. In response, International Olympic Committee chairman Jacques Rogge said, \\"Then there are cases where there is support [for athletes competing for other countries] but they go because there is a bigger gain [for the athlete] in another country. Legally we can't stop it but it doesn't mean we love it.\\" In 2015, the term was also erroneously levelled at sprinter Zharnel Hughes by some newspapers despite Hughes having British citizenship by virtue of being born in Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory without IOC recognition.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/zharnel- hughes-plastic-brit-shrugs-off-british-championships  Criticism  The term \\"Plastic Brit\\" has been criticised in the British media. The Daily Telegraph suggested that fans overlook athletes' places of birth if they perform well for Great Britain. The Guardian newspaper criticised the Daily Mails usage of the term, saying that the definition of a \\"Plastic Brit\\" was inconsistent and that under some definitions, some British-born athletes such as Ryan Giggs would be classed as \\"Plastic Brits\\" for failing to sing \\"God Save the Queen\\". The Daily Mirror newspaper also said that the Daily Mail, along with other newspapers, had supported the selection of Zola Budd to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Olympic Games. The Independent newspaper said that a third of Great Britain's gold medal winners at the Olympics and Paralympic games had a non-British parent or had been born outside of the UK. A number of athletes were also critical of the term. Triple jumper Yamil√© Aldama, who had been described as a \\"Plastic Brit\\", openly criticised the term in an article in The Guardian newspaper. She said, \\"I have lived in this country for 11 years, I am married to a British man, I have British children, I train under a British coach, at a British club. This is my home. What are they talking about?\\". She also said that a number of other athletes, including Farah and Kevin Pietersenwho had represented Great Britain and the England cricket team respectivelyhad not been born in the United Kingdom but were not branded as \\"Plastic Brits\\". Marathon runner Paula Radcliffe also criticised the term, asking for Great Britain supporters at the Olympics to support every athlete representing Great Britain, regardless of their countries of origin. Long- distance runner Mo Farah, when asked by a journalist if he should run for Somalia, said, \\"Look mate, this is my country. This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud. I'm very proud.\\" Fijian-born Paralympic discus thrower Derek Derenalagi said in the Evening Standard that he was a \\"Titanium Brit\\" after he lost his legs in an explosion while serving with the British Army.

The title was a recognition of great honor for women who made a significant impact within their community or exhibited great heroism on the battlefield. When a woman was bestowed as a Ghigau she was given great honor and responsibility. The role has changed in Cherokee culture, but the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians still have Beloved Women today. Background The Ghigua title was given to extraordinary women by the Cherokee clans, and the title of great honor and responsibility was held for life. The Cherokees believed that the Great Spirit frequently spoke through the Ghigau. The Ghigau headed the Council of Women and held a voting seat in the Council of Chiefs. She was given the responsibility of prisoners and would decide their fate. There are other similar words.

Tame Doe's brother was Attakullakulla.Descendants of Nancy Ward by David Keith Hampton In 1755, the Cherokee fought against the Muscogee Creeks. During the battle, Nanyehi's first husband, Kingfisher, was killed. She was just 18 at the time, and victoriously led and fought in the battle against the Creeks. Her bravery and leadership resulted in her being bestowed with the title of Ghigau.Nancy Ward. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, Tennessee Historical Society.

Nanyehi became aware of a planned attack against the white colonists during the Revolutionary War by Dragging Canoe, her cousin. She warned the colonists of the upcoming battle, which resulted in her being identified as a patriot for the Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the American Revolution. On September 11, 1808, in council Broom's town, the ancient law of blood revenge was abolished by the Cherokee national government. The Cherokee, once ruled by clan loyalty, were moving toward a republican form of government. There was no longer a place in Cherokee government for a Ghigau.  Seneca myth The Seneca myth speaks of two Cherokee Ghigau deciding the fate of a Seneca man in \\"A warrior cared for by wolves\\". \\"Among the Cherokees there were two women who were looked upon as the head women of the tribe. Each woman had two snakes tattooed on her lips--the upper jaws of the snakes were on the woman's upper lip, and opposite each other, the lower jaws on the lower lip in the same way. When the woman opened her mouth, the snakes seemed to open theirs. These women said, \\"This is the way to torment him; tie him near a fire and burn the soles of his feet till they are blistered, then let the water out of the blisters, put kernels of corn inside the skin, and chase him with clubs till he dies.\\"A Warrior Cared for by Wolves..

Spread over , the airport is located at Pakyong town about 31 km (22 mi) south of Gangtok. At 4646 ft, Pakyong Airport is one of the five highest airports in India. It is also the first greenfield airport constructed in the Northeastern Region of India, the 100th operational airport in India, and the only airport in the state of Sikkim. Inaugurated on 24 September 2018 by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, commercial flight operations started 4 October 2018. Upon its opening, major media across the globe praised its engineering and described it as one of the most scenic airports in the world. Despite this, commercial flight operations have been hampered by low visibility due to poor weather conditions, being originally planned and designed as a Visual flight rule (VFR) Airport. Due to these visibility issues along with agitation from the local villagers, strip area issues and inaction by local administration, the airport's only commercial passenger airline SpiceJet stopped flight operations to the airport effective 1 June 2019. A resumption of flight operations has not yet been finalized by SpiceJet.https://www.spicejet.com/Schedules.aspx  History  Prior to the construction of Pakyong Airport, Sikkim had been the sole state in India possessing no functional airport. Previously, the nearest airports used to access Sikkim were Bagdogra, located (and a five-hour drive) away in the neighboring state of West Bengal, and Paro Airport in Bhutan. The project to develop Pakyong Airport was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in October 2008. The Punj Lloyd Group was awarded the contract to construct a runway, taxiway, apron drainage system, and electrical work for the greenfield airport in January 2009. The foundation stone for the greenfield airport was laid by the then Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel, in February 2009. The project was initially slated to be completed by 2012, but protests by local villagers, demanding proper rehabilitation and compensation, had resulted in suspension of work in January 2014. The AAI intervened and held discussions with agitating villagers and paid part compensation allowing work to resume in October 2014. However, in January 2015, work came to a halt once again as villagers took to protests. In July 2015, AAI and the State Government signed an MoU with AAI, promising to shift the affected households by 15 August so that AAI could resume work from October 2015. These protest-related delays and landslides upslope of the runway resulted in suspension of work twice, escalating costs from to . Maximally ecological slope-stabilization techniques were used to remedy the landslide situation. On 5 March 2018, an IAF Dornier 228 landed on the completed airstrip, becoming the first aircraft to land at Pakyong.IAF's Dornier aircraft lands at Pakyong airport Economic Times 5 March 2018 SpiceJet had been awarded the Pakyong to Kolkata and Guwahati sectors under the second round of bidding for the Government's UDAN Regional Connectivity Scheme in January 2018 and it conducted a trial landing of its Q400 aircraft at Pakyong on 10 March 2018.Spicejet Bombardier Q400 78 seater aircraft makes historic landing at Pakyong Airport Voice of Sikkim 10 March 2018 The airport received its commercial operating license from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on 5 May 2018. On 5 December 2019, 35 families affected by the airport's construction signed off on a joint agreement and accepted the first installment in compensation for their loss of land bringing years of protest to a close.  Structure  The airport was built by the AAI at an estimated cost of 605 crore featuring a runway and a long taxiway connecting it to an apron measuring that can accommodate two ATR 72 aircraft at a time. A terminal building measuring with a capacity of 100 passengers, a car park for 80 vehicles and a fire station cum Air Traffic Control Tower was constructed by Ms PABSCON. Navigation facilities include NDB, DVOR, High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), airport beacon, and a PAPI. The Pakyong Airport project is one of the tallest reinforced soil structures in the world. The land for the airport was carved from the mountainside using massive geotechnical 'cut and fill' engineering works. These state-of-the-art geogrid soil reinforcement and slope stabilisation techniques were employed as traditional retaining structures and embankments were ruled out as being unfeasible. Italian geotechnical company Maccaferri given consultancy services to execute the project that envisaged a wide, long corridor on which the runway and airport buildings were to be constructed. The company, which completed the project with partners Mott MacDonald and Punj Lloyd, won the 'International Project of the Year' award at the Ground Engineering Awards 2012 for its work in constructing high reinforced soil walls and slopes at the site.  Commercial flight operations  The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi at the inauguration of the Pakyong Airport Although initially praised by worldwide media upon its opening as being \\"a breathtaking piece of engineering on the roof of the world\\" offering arriving passengers \\"one of the most dramatic airport approaches on the planet\\", the airport's commercial flight operations have since been disrupted by poor weather conditions affecting flight visibility. In December 2018, 21 of SpiceJet's 31 daily flights (nearly 70% of its schedule) were forced to divert to Bagdogra (up to a five-hour drive away) because Pakyong \\"lacked the requisite navigation equipment for low-visibility situations\\", being a Visual flight rule (VFR) Airport as originally planned as per MOU 2002 & MOU 2015 among Civil Aviation GOI, Tourism Deptt Govt of Sikkim and AAI. Currently, Pakyong requires at least 5 km (5,000m). The Airports Authority of India (AAI) would like bring this down to at least 2.5 km (2,500m) with an instrument landing system (ILS), but says area residents were against it. An official in the Sikkim government cited issues that took place during the rainy season when landslides damaged small tracts of agricultural land affecting over 37 land owners of a nearby village uphill area. As of 1 June 2019, SpiceJet, the airport's sole airline providing commercial passenger service, ceased its once daily Kolkata-Pakyong-Kolkata flight due to \\"unpredictable weather in Pakyong which results in very low visibility\\", having earlier suspended the other daily service between Pakyong and Guwahati. Airline officials also cited the approaching monsoon season's aggravating effect on flight operations when announcing the service suspension. SpiceJet earlier conveyed that they will restart flight operation with effect from winter schedule i.e., 27 October 2019 but till date SpiceJet have yet not confirmed when they will resume Kolkata- Pakyong -Kolkata. In addition to fluctuating weather, adequate basic strip area (western side) issues have also hampered commercial flight operations. The basic strip, which is mandated to be a minimum of 75 m wide, is only 40 m in western side & 80m wide Eastern side along 2 km long. Contractors have been \\"unable to take up Civil works to extend the stretch of basic strip and erect a strong RCC Retaining wall with anchoring system\\" because the State Government of Sikkim at the time had not compensated few of the affected landowners. On 5 December 2019, it was reported that 35 families affected by the airport's construction had been offered a compensation of 20.6 crore by the State Government and that there would be support in ensuring the full completion and operation of the airport.  Military flight operations  As Pakyong Airport sits approximately 60 km (37.28 mi) from the India-China border, it is considered strategically important. In March 2018, the Indian Air Force (IAF) was the first to land an aircraft, a Dornier 228, at the airport. And in January 2019, an IAF Antanov-32 transport plane arrived \\"in an effort to boost the transportation of troops and material to this region.\\" At present security is being provided by State govt. of Sikkim as per MoU dated 30.6.2015 signed among Government of Sikkim, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India and Airports Authority of India. Border disputes have gripped this Himalayan region for decades. The 2017 China‚ÄìIndia border standoff took place over the Doklam pass on the tri- junction between China, India and Bhutan, situated roughly 54 km (33.55 mi) west of Pakyong Airport.

Several times, he took part in managing the Italian University system, and shared his opinions in newspapers, such as La Repubblica. He was a close friend of Carlo Pucci, a mathematician who spent most of his energy in improving the method of teaching maths in Italy, and the management of Italian Maths Departments. (Pucci was, especially, the re-founder of the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi.) From 1995 to 2003, Fig√† Talamanca, successor to Pucci, was President of the Istituto, and he continued what Pucci had set up. He was also Vice-President of the European Mathematical Society. Moreover, he was a member of the Consiglio Universitario Nazionale and, from 1999 to 2004, of the Comitato nazionale per la valutazione del sistema universitario. Career Fig√† Talamanca did research, and got valuable results, in the field of harmonic analysis, on aleatory Fourier series and the diffusion process, mostly in Rome - at La Sapienza -, but also in the US, especially in the Sixties. During that period on a Fulbright scholarship, he joined research activities in California, UCLA, where he got his Ph.D, in 1964, and, in the same year, was Acting Assistant Professor, and met the well-famous French-American mathematician Serge Lang, and also in Boston, Moore Instructor at MIT from 1966 to 1968. While teaching at MIT, he read Tom M. Apostol's Calculus, a two volume book, and decided to bring it back to Italy - when he was to become Professor at the University of Genova - with him: he was the one who proposed an Italian edition of Apostol's work to a printer in Turin, and he himself overwatched the translation,Edizione italiana a cura di Alessandro Fig√† Talamanca, Calcolo, Tom M. Apostol, editore Bollati Boringhieri, 2002, , just one page before the index in 1977. He was lecturer at Berkeley, from 1968 to 1969, then at Yale, from 1969 to 1970, then Visiting Professor in Maryland, in Washington, Wales and Sydney. He taught Calculus for 50 years, including both Italian and American universities. Mostly, he referred to La Sapienza: in 2007, he became General Director of the Maths' Department there, but he was to leave in 2009 because he was 71.

After being withdrawn by the MRWA in 1956, B6 was acquired by the then municipality of Geraldton, and put on display in a Geraldton park. In 1995, ownership of B6 was transferred to the then Shire of Swan, and in 1999 the locomotive was moved to the former Midland Railway Workshops, for storage in the custody of Rail Heritage WA. In 2010, following a renewal of interest by the City of Geraldton-Greenough in rail history, B6 was moved back to the Geraldton area, for intended eventual display at a proposed railway museum at Walkaway.

He was known for his \\"over-the-top appearance\\" with unusual clothing and hair styles and his coarse humor. Early life Chu was born Hsieh Hsin-ta (Ë¨ùÊñ∞ÈÅî; Taiwanese SiƒÅ Sin-taÃçt) in Zuoying, Kaohsiung in Taiwan.ÈªÉÂì≤Êñå, ÈÉ≠Áü≥Âüé „ÄåÂ§©ÁéãÂêåÁ™óË±¨Âì•‰∫ÆÂè´‰ªñÁè≠Èï∑„Äç. Â§©‰∏ãÊñáÂåñ Commonwealth Publishing Co., Ltd. 30 August 2009. Retrieved 15 August 2012. Chu left home in his early teenage years to pursue his dream of being in the theater. He went on to receive tuition from Lin Sung-yen (ÊûóÊùæÁÖô L√≠n S≈çngyƒÅn) and became an actor and writer but remained largely unknown to the wider public. At around age 30, he had a role in a play about the semi-legendary Liao Tianding as the clown character Zh≈´ Gƒìli√†ng. He was so popular in this role that he chose the name as his own stage name. Career =Early career= Chu's actor's union card from 1993 In 1980, the Chu Ke-liang Cabaret Show (Ë±¨Âì•‰∫ÆÊ≠åÂª≥ÁßÄ; Zh≈´ Gƒìli√†ng Gƒìtƒ´ng Xi√π) broke onto the scene in Taiwan and Chu's popularity took off. In the show, Chu had a mild-mannered persona but often used coarse language and double entendre. He would get into quarrels with the guest singers and tell off-color jokes. Along with Chang Fei, Frankie Kao, and Ni Min-jan, Chu was one of Taiwan's biggest TV stars of the 1980s. In 1994, Chu campaigned on behalf of James Soong in his candidacy for the governorship of Taiwan province. Soong successfully used support from Chu, who was at the time Taiwan's most popular entertainer, to help convince Taiwanese to support a candidate with a mainland Chinese background. =Hiatus= Chu racked up gambling debts over NT$100 million (US$35 million) from playing Taiwan's illegal lottery and Hong Kong's Mark Six despite an income of NT$60 million per month. He is said to have owed his boss, Yang Tang-kuei, NT$120 million. As a result, he fled into hiding to escape this and other debts to underworld figures in 1995. He briefly returned to the public eye in 1997 but again absconded in 1999. Reports of Chu's whereabouts occasionally surfaced. In 2002, Chu was spotted in a He Xian Gu temple in Wandan, Pingtung County. However, generally, the media took pains not to expose him. Chu's performances were available on videotape and were occasionally shown on Taiwan television, so his audiences did not forget him. On 19 February 2009, correspondents from the tabloid Apple Daily followed Chu in various areas of Kaohsiung and Pingtung Counties before confronting him in a Yongda Road swordfish oden noodle restaurant in Pingtung City. With his trademark hair now slicked back, he told the reporters he was \\"still on the lam\\" and still very poor. He was reportedly working at a temple at the time. Some of Chu's former fellow performers, including Chang Fei, Frankie Kao and Kevin Chu, called for Chu to return to public life and for his creditors to spare his life so he could work to repay his debts. =Comeback= Chu being vaccinated in 2009 Following Chu's exposure in an Apple Daily cover story, Sanchong legislator and entertainer Yu Tian, on 23 April 2009, announced an advertising deal between Chu and Tsann Kuen 3C whereby Chu would receive NT$20 million. The following day, Chu announced plans for a comeback in a short speech aired on Taiwan's major TV channels. Chu euphemistically said that he had been \\"studying abroad\\" for ten years but that he was grateful to the media for \\"photographing me eating oden\\". He said he had always wanted to come back but did not have the courage. According to the China Times, Yu facilitated a meeting between Chu and Chu's former boss Yang Tang-kuei where Yang agreed to forgive 80 percent off the total debt owed to him. Chu was required to give Yang 20 percent of his earnings until he repaid the remaining NT$24 million he owed. On 5 June 2009, Golden Throne Communication TV Co., Ltd. announced a series of new video-on-demand shows starring Chu. Recording of a new variety show hosted by Chu, Zh≈´gƒì Hu√¨sh√® (Ë±¨Âì•ÊúÉÁ§æ), began in July 2009. Chu received NT$300,000 per show for his new program . On 16 September 2010, Chu released his first music album, D≈çngshƒÅnz√†iq«ê (Êù±Â±±ÂÜçËµ∑). In the following month, he was recognized in the Golden Bell Awards as Best Variety Show Host, together with his co-host, Rene Hou. Chu also had a major part as a city councilman in the 2011 hit movie Night Market Hero, a role which cemented his comeback. =Living with cancer and death= Chu was diagnosed with stage II colo-rectal cancer in 2014. He feared the adverse effects that came along with the cancer treatment especially the installation of colostomy, leading him to delaying to have intensive treatments until September 2016 when he had severe ascites and poor health status where he were left no choice. (It's reported that Chu had tried many other regimens and unknown treatments both are not proven to be effective instead of the surgery and chemotherapy which are proven to be effective in treating cancer.) Whereas, even though he finally returned to the hospital to accept surgery of removal of the malignant tumor, his cancer of colo-rectal had advanced to the final stage. When interviewed subsequent to the surgery, he said \\"I should have believed in evidence-based medicine two years ago.\\" Having terminal colorectal cancer for two years, Chu died in the National Taiwan University Hospital on 15 May 2017 due to liver failure. He was 70. A private memorial was held on 16 May. A public funeral attended by 2,000 people took place in Banciao District on 20 June. Image and influence Chu's screen image includes a distinctive hairstyle and clothing. Chu typically wears a (sometimes colorful) dinner jacket with a bowtie but with bermuda shorts, black shoes, and white socks. Chu's hairstyle has been called a \\"toilet-lid (È¶¨Ê°∂Ëìã m«ét«íng g√†i) haircut\\" and is similar to a bowl cut like that of Moe Howard of the Three Stooges but covering the ears and shoulder-length at the back. Taiwanese entertainer Show Lo is a known admirer of Chu and has imitated his style. Personal life Chu was married four times and had two sons and three daughters. His second daughter, Jeannie Hsieh, is a well-known Taiwanese singer and actress.

Formed in January 1959 at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, its role was to convert pilots and navigators to the English Electric Canberra bombers flown by Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. The unit's complement of Canberras included T.4 and Mk.21 dual-control trainers, and Mk.20 bombers. Originally a component of No. 82 Wing, No. 1 OCU became an independent unit at Amberley in April 1968, its focus being the provision of operationally ready pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron in the Vietnam War. No. 1 OCU was disbanded in June 1971, following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from South-East Asia. By then the RAAF's only Canberra unit, No. 2 Squadron ran its own conversion courses before disbanding in 1982. History alt=Front three-quarter view of white twin-engined military jet parked on grass During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) established several operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills they had already learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, and the advent of the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 167‚Äì168, 364 In December 1953, No. 82 (Bomber) Wing, headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, took delivery of Australia's first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra. Over the next five years, forty-eight Canberras built in Australia by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) re-equipped all three of the wing's flying units, Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. During this period, operational training of new bomber aircrew was performed \\"in-house\\" by the wing, primarily by No. 6 Squadron.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 104Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, pp. 34‚Äì35 Aside from its adverse effect on regular flying duties, the task was made technically challenging and potentially dangerous by virtue of the Canberra being designed for only one pilot, with a single control column. On 12 January 1959, No. 1 (Bomber) Operational Conversion Unit (No. 1 OCU) was formed at Amberley. Coming under the control of No. 82 Wing, its purpose was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra, and train them for operations with Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 60‚Äì61 On establishment, the unit was commanded by Squadron Leader B.F.M. Rachinger, and equipped with Mk.20 bombers and T.4 trainers. The T.4 was a dual-control model with three seats; the pilot and instructor sat side by side at the front of the cockpit, and the navigator was seated behind them. Two of these models had been purchased from Britain.Wilson, Lincoln, Canberra and F-111, p. 122 The unit was subsequently allocated Mk.21 trainers; GAF built seven of these dual- control models by converting five early Mk.20s and two British-built B.2 bombers.Bennett, Highest Traditions, pp. 403‚Äì404 Student aircrew underwent bombing and navigation instruction, as well as simulated operations. The first training course graduated in April 1959. alt=Side view of camouflaged twin- engined military jet in level flight As well as training, over the course of No. 1 OCU's existence its aircrews flew operational sorties involving naval cooperation, aerial photography, target towing and radar targeting, and participated in exercises in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand.Bennett, Highest Traditions, p. 335 During runway upgrades at Amberley in mid-1962, the unit was based for a month at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Later that year, it briefly maintained a detachment at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. On 11 September 1964, one of its Canberras was intercepted by a Sabre fighter of No. 76 Squadron based at RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory, as part of Operation Handover, a little-known contingency plan put into effect during Konfrontasi to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the Federation of Malaysia. No. 1 OCU suffered a fatal accident on 16 February 1965, when a Canberra Mk.21 ran off the runway and crashed at Amberley, killing both crew members. The unit was made independent of No. 82 Wing in April 1968. Its role from then on was to provide trained crews solely for No. 2 Squadron, which was on active duty in the Vietnam War. At the same time, maintenance responsibilities for the Canberras transferred from No. 482 Squadron to No. 1 OCU, along with relevant staff and equipment.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 67‚Äì68 Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C, expected to enter service soon afterwards.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 59 Delivery of the F-111s was delayed, so Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons began operating leased F-4E Phantoms as an interim strike force in 1970.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, p. 114Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 385‚Äì388 To prepare aircrew for their rotation through No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam, No. 1 OCU students participated in exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No. 30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September‚ÄìOctober 1969, in conjunction with the Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23 March 1970. From 21 March to 25 April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No. 1 OCU was disbanded on 9 June 1971, following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No. 2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No. 1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No. 2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No. 82 Wing in 1973, No. 6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No. 1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No. 1 OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.

The park, with a separate play area for children, is kept open to the public from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. and is a popular place for morning walks among the locals. The park also hosts music kutcheris and civic forums, on the weekends all year round. The park has a badminton court. The park is maintained by Sundaram Finance. History Nageswara Rao Park was originally called Arathakuttai (big pond). In deference to a request by the Chennai Corporation, the owners of the pond, Ramayamma Pantulu, Aravamutha Iyengar and Nainiappa Mudaliar, donated the pond to the civic body for creating a park. After its creation, the park was named after Desodharaka Nageswara Rao Pantulu. It was opened to the public by P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja, the then Chief Minister of Madras, on 20 October 1940. Originally developed in a much smaller area on Luz Church Road, the park was expanded when more land was donated by Ramayee Ammal, M. Nainappa Mudaliyar, V. Kumaraswamy Raja and Aravamadhu Iyengar in the same year. In 1996, the Chennai Corporation re-developed the park and started maintaining it. A pond known as Aaratha kuttai was filled in and made into a garden. It was Nageswara Rao, founder of the neighbouring Amrutanjan factory, who convinced the local residents to develop the area when the pond began to dry up. It is in his memory that the park was named after him. Flora Tree varieties found in the park include Lapostromea, Cassia fistula, Tabulia and foliage trees like Pungam, Neem, palms, Ficus religiosa and Thespesia. Medicinal and ornamental plants such as Tabubia, Copper pod, Enterolobium saman, Cassia sp. and Ixora sp. are also found in the park. Developments In 2002, an initiative named \\"Project Green Spaces - Dr. Nageswara Rao Park\\" was started, whereby the park was adopted by the Chennai Chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce in India (AMCHAM). This also included support from the local community, which had donated for the face-lift of the park. The estimated initial costs of the face-lift was pegged at 3 million, while the ongoing costs at 600,000 per annum. The establishment of a corpus fund of 10 million for the upkeep of the park was also proposed. In 2009, a composting yard consisting of three pits was set up at the rear of the park to make compost from the garden waste that are collected from eight bins in the park. The project is funded by Sundaram Finance, which also maintains the park belonging to the Chennai Corporation. Incidents On 7 November 2010, a man was killed while taking a morning stroll on the dedicated track in the park, when a tree branch snapped off and fell on his head after a heavy rain due to cyclone that passed near the city after a gap of 14 years.

Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct leads to the excess overflow of tears called epiphora.  Sign and symptoms  Excessive tearing is the most common complaint of patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction, followed by acute or chronic infections. Pain at the side of the nose suggests dacryocystitis. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is more common with increasing age and more common in females than males.  Cause  =Involutional stenosis= Involutional stenosis is probably the most common cause of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in older people. It affects women twice as frequently as men. Although the inciting event in this process is unknown, clinicopathologic study suggests that compression of the lumen of the nasolacrimal duct is caused by inflammatory infiltrates and edema. This may be the result of an unidentified infection or possibly an autoimmune disease. =Dacryolith= Dacryoliths or cast formation, within the lacrimal sac can also produce obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. =Sinus disease= Sinus disease often occurs in conjunction with, and in other instances may contribute to the development of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Patients should be asked about previous sinus surgery, as the nasolacrimal duct is sometimes damaged when the maxillary sinus ostium is being enlarged anteriorly. =Trauma= Naso-orbital fractures may involve the nasolacrimal duct. Early treatment by fracture reduction with stenting of the entire lacrimal drainage system should be considered. However, such injuries are often not recognized or are initially neglected as more serious injuries are managed. In such cases, late treatment of persistent epiphora usually requires dacryocystorhinostomy. =Inflammatory disease= Granulomatous disease, including sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and midline granuloma, may also lead to nasolacrimal duct obstruction. =Lacrimal plugs= As with similar cases of canalicular obstruction, dislodged punctual and canalicular plugs can migrate to and occlude the nasolacrimal duct. =Neoplasm= Neoplasm should be considered in any patient presenting with nasolacrimal duct obstruction. In patients with atypical presentations, including younger age and male gender, further workup is appropriate. Bloody punctual discharge or lacrimal sac distension above the medial canthal tendon is also highly suggestive of neoplasm. =Congenital= Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction, or dacryostenosis, occurs when the lacrimal duct has failed to open at the time of birth, most often due to an imperforate membrane at the valve of Hasner.Blocked tear ducts in infants, Pediatric Views, June 2006 http://www.childrenshospital.org/views/june06/blocked_tear_ducts.html Around 6% of infants have congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction, or dacryostenosis, usually experiencing a persistent watery eye even when not crying. If a secondary infection occurs (Dacryocystitis), purulent (yellow / green) discharge may be present. Most cases resolve spontaneously, with antibiotics reserved only if conjunctivitis occurs. Lacrimal sac massage has been proposed as helping to open the duct, though this is not always successful. The aim of massage is to generate enough hydrostatic pressure (downward, toward the nose) to \\"pop\\" open any obstruction. Additional massage may then be performed up toward the lacrimal punctum, in order to express any infectious material out of the nasolacrimal sac. When discharge or crusting is present, the lids should be gently cleaned using cooled pre-boiled water or saline. Referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated if symptoms are still present at 12 months, or sooner if significant symptoms or recurrent infections occur. Nasolacrimal duct probing may be performed in the office setting (usually from 4 to 8 months of age) or under general anesthesia in an operating room for older patients. The success rate of probing is higher for younger children. A silastic tube or stent may be employed along with probing to maintain tear duct patency. A systematic review comparing immediate probing with deferred probing found that in children with unilateral nasolacrimal duct obstruction, immediate probing resulted in a higher success rate of treatment compared to deferred probing. Diagnosis Evaluation is in the form of a dye disappearance test followed by irrigation test. By using this sequence (with modifications) as a guide, the physician can frequently streamline diagnostic testing. =Dye disappearance test= The dye disappearance test is useful for assessing the presence or absence of adequate lacrimal outflow, especially in unilateral cases. It is more heavily relied upon in children, in whom lacrimal irrigation is impossible without deep sedation. Using a drop of sterile 2% fluorescein solution or a moistened fluorescein strip, the examiner instills fluorescein into the conjunctival fornices of each eye and then observes the tear film, preferably with the cobalt blue filter of the slit lamp. Persistence of significant dye and, particularly asymmetric clearance of the dye from the tear meniscus over a 5-minute period indicate an obstruction. If the dye disappearance test result is normal, severe lacrimal drainage dysfunction is highly unlikely. The Jones tests are variations of the dye disappearance test. =Irrigation test= Flushing the nasolacrimal duct in a cat. In irrigation test, a lacrimal irrigation cannula is passed into the punctum and advanced through the canaliculus to the lacrimal fossa. Clear water or saline is then irrigated through the cannula. If fluid passes into the nose without reflux out of the opposite canaliculus, the system is patent. If no fluid passes but it all comes back through either punctum, nasolacrimal duct obstruction is present. Management =Intubation and stenting= Some clinicians believe that partial stenosis of the nasolacrimal duct with symptomatic epiphora sometimes responds to surgical intubation of the entire lacrimal drainage system. This procedure should be performed only if the tubes can be passed easily. In complete nasolacrimal duct obstruction, intubation alone is not effective, and a dacryocystorhinostomy should be considered. =Dacryocystorhinostomy= A dacryocystorhinostomy is the treatment of choice for most patients with acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Surgical indications include recurrent dacryocystitis, chronic mucoid reflux, painful distension of the lacrimal sac, and bothersome epiphora. For patients with dacryocystitis, active infection should be cleared, if possible, before a dacryocystorhinostomy is performed.

After commanding a brigade with distinction during the War of the Fifth Coalition at Aspern-Essling and Wagram he was promoted and made chief of staff to Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na. He served in this role during Mass√©na's 1810‚Äì1811 invasion of Portugal. His history of that campaign was published posthumously by his son. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 16. Early career Friron was born on 7 February 1766 in Vandieres in what later became Meurthe department in eastern France. He joined the French Royal Army in 1782 as a volunteer. After the start of the French Revolutionary Wars he was promoted to chef de bataillon (major) in 1794. He became an adjutant general chef de brigade (colonel) on 9 March 1797. He fought in Switzerland and later in Italy under Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer. He served as chief of staff to Jacques Maurice Hatry at the Battle of Verona on 26 March 1799 and the Battle of Magnano on 5 April. After fighting on the Rhine in 1799, Jean Victor Marie Moreau nominated him for promotion. His appointment as general of brigade came through on 17 July 1800. Subsequently he fought at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800. General of Brigade During the peace, Fririon commanded the troops in the Bas-Rhin department. He later fought under Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na in Italy. He served at the Siege of Stralsund which lasted from 15 January to 20 August 1807, when the Swedish garrison abandoned the city. On 25 August he and French naval Captain Montcabri√© attacked the fortified island of D√§nholm between Stralsund and R√ºgen. The 1,200-man French force included one battalion of the 30th Light Infantry Regiment, two artillery pieces and crews, and detachments of sappers, miners, and Sailors of the Imperial Guard. The operation was a success, costing the French only 15 dead and 26 wounded. The 900-man Swedish garrison lost 50 killed, 75 wounded, and 517 captured. Six field pieces and eight heavy cannons also fell into French hands. The following year found him serving under Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte in Denmark. He was present during the mutiny of two Spanish regiments on 31 July 1808, during which his aide was killed. The mutiny was suppressed the next day by a superior force of Danish troops. However, most of the other units of the Spanish Northern Division escaped in British vessels during the evacuation of the La Romana Division. In the 1809 war, Fririon led a brigade in Jean Boudet's 4th Division of Mass√©na's IV Corps. The brigade consisted only of two battalions of the 3rd Light Infantry Regiment and began the campaign with 1,545 men. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Boudet's division heroically defended Essling for the better part of two days against repeated Austrian attacks. Finally, at 3:00 pm on 22 May the troops were chased out of the village except for the granary where Boudet and some grenadiers held out. During the struggle, Marshal Jean Lannes wrote out a special commendation for Fririon's valiant fighting, \\"General, you have covered yourself with glory, you and your brigade; I will report your conduct to the Emperor\\". Essling was later retaken by the Imperial Guard, but Lannes was mortally wounded in the fighting. Fririon led his brigade at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July 1809. The two battalions of the 3rd Light numbered 1,270 men. On the second day, the VI Austrian Corps fell on Boudet's isolated division, overwhelming it and capturing its artillery. However, the Austrians immediately came under an intense bombardment from Jean Reynier's massed artillery on Lobau Island. The VI Corps recoiled, allowing Boudet's troops to avoid total destruction. The French victory was decided on another part of the battlefield. Fririon also fought in the Battle of Znaim on 10-11 July. General of Division Fririon was promoted to general of division on 21 July 1809. He soon became chief of staff to Marshal Mass√©na, replacing Nicolas L√©onard Beker who had angered Emperor Napoleon. He was named Baron of the Empire on 31 January 1810. He continued in his role as Mass√©na's chief of staff during the 1810‚Äì1811 invasion of Portugal. At the Siege of Almeida, Fririon carried an ultimatum to William Cox, the fortress commanding officer, after the fort's main magazine exploded, killing 600 defenders. Cox surrendered the next day, on 27 August. The Battle of Bussaco was fought on 27 September 1810. The night before, Fririon recommended that the Anglo-Portuguese army of Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington be flanked out of position instead of assaulted directly. Mass√©na dismissed this idea, saying, \\"You are of the Army of the Rhine, you like to maneuver; this is the first time that Wellington appears disposed to offer battle. I will profit by the occasion\\". The attack was a failure with the French suffering 4,479 killed, wounded or captured against only 1,252 Allied casualties. While the French army was before the Lines of Torres Vedras, Fririon urged that the VIII Corps be withdrawn from its exposed position at the village of Sobral. During Mass√©na's tenure in command the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro would be fought on 3-5 May 1811. The historian Charles Oman wrote that Fririon was \\"scientific\\" and got along well with his fellow soldiers. However, Mass√©na appeared to rely too much on his senior aide de camp, Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau and sometimes changed his instructions without consulting with Fririon. Certainly, there was friction among Massena's staff during the campaign. After the Portugal campaign, Fririon became commander of the 1st Military Division. Under the Bourbon Restoration he served as an inspector general of infantry. Later career Fririon died on 25 September 1840. His son published his papers in 1841 as, Journal historique de la campagne de Portugal. The work was disapproving of Mass√©na's aide Pelet. But unlike others who wrote that Pelet had undue influence over the marshal, Fririon minimized the aide's role. Stung by the criticism, Pelet later wrote his own history of the campaign. In his history of the Portugal campaign, Fririon wrote perceptively about Napoleon's many exaggerated bulletins, \\"This is how history was written at the time; it was by reports of this lying description than an attempt was made to calm anxious families. Did no one reflect that, by deceiving them in this way, the government made enemies of all those who trusted for a time in the exactitude of the Bulletins, and lost their illusion soon after, when they learnt the melancholy ends of their sons and brothers?\\" FRIRION is engraved on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe.

Biography Believed to belong to a family who originated from the eastern provinces of the Roman empire, Hannibalianus was a military commander who served under the emperor Probus (r. 276-282). A member of the Equestrian order (as noted by the official reference to him as a vir eminentissimus, which was reserved for the equestrian order),Chastagnol, pgs. 28-29 he probably was only adlected to the senatorial order after the death of Probus in AD 282.Chastagnol, pg. 27 He was elevated to the rank of Praetorian prefect of the west in AD 286 under Maximian, and had led the imperial armies to victory over the Germanic tribes along the Rhine in that year.Martindale & Jones, pg. 408 Hannibalianus held this rank until probably AD 292, when he was appointed consul prior alongside Julius Asclepiodotus. Then from AD 297-298, he served as the Praefectus urbi of Rome. Hannibalianus was possibly married to Eutropia, who divorced him to marry the emperor Maximian in around AD 287, but this has been contested.C. E. V.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1987. Overview The largest keyhole- shaped kofun in the T≈çkai region of Japan, the Dampusan Kofun dates from the early 6th century. The burial mound has a total length of 151 meters, with the circular portion containing the burial chamber having a diameter of 80 meters, and a height of 16.2 meters. The 116-meter rectangular portion is terraced into three tiers, from which numerous fragments of cylindrical haniwa and Sue ware pottery have been recovered. Many of these artifacts are currently preserved at the Anthropological Museum of Nanzan University. The presence of a large number of rounded river boulders indicates that the surface may have originally been paved with stones (fukiishi). The tomb was originally surrounded by at least one moat which can clearly been seen in the Meiji period maps, but the urbanization of the surrounding area in the post-World War II era has obliterated most traces. The interior of the burial mound has not been excavated by modern methods. The name or rank of the person buried in the tomb is unknown. Per legend, the inhabitant of the tomb is Miyazuhime, the wife of Prince Yamato Takeru, whose purported grave is located nearby. Another theory is that the tomb is that of a powerful chieftain of the Owari clan, perhaps the Owari no Kusaka, who is mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles of the Nara period, and whose daughter married the semi-legendary Emperor Keitai. The Dampusan Kofun was under the management of Atsuta Shrine until World War II. After the war, it came under the control of Nagoya city until 1980, when it was taken over by the Aichi Prefectural government.

(died c.1485) was a French Dominican, known as a Thomist philosopher and commentator on Aristotle. Title page from 1499 of a commentary by John Versor on the Posterior analytics of Aristotle. He was Rector of the University of Paris in 1458. Works Though traditionally Versor has often been considered a Thomist, more recent studies show his dependence on both Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great, and evidence suggests that, by his contemporaries, Versor was regarded as an authority of his own.Pepijn Rutten, \\"Secundum processum et mentem Versoris: John Versor and His Relation to the Schools of Thought Reconsidered\\", in: Vivarium 43 (2005), 292-336. In so far as he can be regarded as a Thomist, his position represents an interesting, pre-Cajetan verson of Thomism. His commentaries covered most of the works of Aristotle, and his textbooks were very widely circulated in the period 1470 to 1520. A large part of his questions on Aristotle and Aquinas was translated into Hebrew by Eli Habillo, during the 1470s. Questions on Aristotle were printed in a number of editions at Cologne, from 1485 onwards.

It was acquired by International Game Technology (IGT) in 1999 for $230 million. History Sodak was formed in 1989 to supply equipment to gambling halls in Deadwood, South Dakota, and soon became the exclusive distributor of IGT machines to tribal casinos. The Promus Companies acquired a 20 percent stake in Sodak in November 1992. Sodak made its initial public offering in June 1993. Sodak purchased and refitted a riverboat and leased it to Gaming Supply Co., who opened it in December 1994 as the Miss Marquette casino, in Marquette, Iowa. After Gaming Supply defaulted on lease payments, Sodak bought out the company for less than $5.5 million, taking over operation of the casino in July 1996. The company moved into the South American market in an effort to diversify its revenue base. In May 1995, it began establishing gaming halls and slot route operations in Peru, reaching a total of 1,300 machines by the end of 1996. It opened a casino at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Quito, Ecuador in March 1996, followed by a gaming hall in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1996. In June 1998, Sodak announced its decision to divest its South American operations, citing a lack of profitability and an unstable regulatory environment. The ventures in Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil were sold off by the end of the year. Sodak agreed in March 1999 to be acquired by IGT for $230 million. As IGT executives did not want to operate casinos, the deal called for Sodak to sell the Miss Marquette casino and its interest in a Louisiana casino project. The Miss Marquette was sold to Lady Luck Gaming for $42 million. Sodak's partner in the Louisiana project, Hollywood Casino Corp., purchased Sodak's stake for $2.5 million. The acquisition of Sodak by IGT was completed in September 1999. Following the acquisition, Sodak continued to operate out of Rapid City as a division of IGT, focused on distributing products to Indian casinos. IGT began a reorganization of its North American businesses in 2005, which included dispersing Sodak's operations around the country, and phasing out the Sodak name.
